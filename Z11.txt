Z11|Art Auctions|The second edition of this widely acclaimed and extensively cited collection of original contributions by specialist authors reflects changes in the field of cultural economics over the last eight years. Thoroughly revised chapters alongside new topics and contributors bring the Handbook up to date, taking into account new research, literature and the impact of new technologies in the creative industries.
Z11|Art auctions|A Handbook of Cultural Economics includes over 60 eminently readable and concise articles by 50 expert contributors. This unique Handbook is both highly informative and readable; it covers a wide area of cultural economics and its closely related subjects. While being accessible to any reader with a basic knowledge of economics, it presents a comprehensive study at the fore-front of the field.
Z11|Art Auctions|This paper contains a new review of the research of the last decade that has been designed to shed light on how the art auction system works, what it indicates about price formation, and how well it performs. We begin with a short description of the mechanics of the auction system and then organize the remainder of our discussion around two major topics. The first topic concerns how researchers have used auction prices. We begin by discussing the returns to holding art and whether certain classes of art make a better investment. We then discuss studies that have used auction prices to determine the importance of individual works of art and individual artists. We conclude this topic by discussing whether different auction houses achieve systematically different prices. The second topic focuses on studies that examine the influence of the auction mechanism on prices. We begin with a discussion of the Christie's and Sotheby's price fixing case and the role of the competitive behavior of auction houses in the determination of prices. We move on to discuss the role of experts and price estimates in auctions. We then look at whether items that fail at auction subsequently return less than items that have not failed and furthermore discuss sale rates and reserve prices. We conclude this topic by reviewing the extensive literature that has documented and tried to explain why the prices of identical objects are more likely to decline than to increase when multiple units are sold. Subsequent empirical research has tended to document declining prices even when the objects are imperfect substitutes.
Z11|Art Dealers' Strategy The case of Goupil, Boussod & Valadon from 1860 to 1914|Despite the existence of a large literature dedicated to the art market, the management of art galleries remains a black box as both buyers and sellers put a high value on discretion. This paper overcomes the traditional lack of quantitative data by analysing the complete books of one of the most successful French galleries at the end of the 19th century: Goupil, Boussod & Valadon. This original database covers the sale of more than 40,000 artworks that occurred between 1860 and 1914. Rapidity to sell artworks was a key element in Goupil's strategy. As a whole Goupil sold 71% of artworks bought. Out of the sold artworks, almost 80% were sold within a year (with 22% before the acquisition reflecting orders). Changes in ownership allow us to quantify changes in business strategy. The first owner required a lower mark-up for the artists in residence it was sponsoring and higher ones for nobles and art dealers. The second owner followed a similar strategy but also required a higher mark-up from former branches such as Knoedler.
Z11|The effects of cultural policy on nascent cultural entrepreneurship: A Bayesian nonparametric approach to longitudinal mediation|Despite the topic of nascent entrepreneurship receiving quite extent in coverage in the scientific literature there is very few, if any, knowledge on the characteristics of nascent firms in the cultural and creative sector. In this article we use Amadeus database for a sample of firms from 28 European Union countries in the period 2007-2016, to study the effects of cultural policy on nascent entrepreneurship. We model the effects as a mediation problem and show that while cultural policy has an effect on general performance of cultural firms it is mediated through its indirect effect on nascent cultural and creative firms and mediation happens with time delay. This finding is robust to numerous cultural policy variables, definitions of nascent entrepreneurship, performance indicators and model specifications. The article also implements and discusses a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) approach to longitudinal mediation analysis (using Bayesian additive regression trees used on cross-lagged panel modelling of the Baron-Kenny approach to mediation) which is to our knowledge the first application of BNP in longitudinal mediation in statistical and econometric literature. We conclude by policy and research recommendations and reflections.
Z11|The Origins of Creativity: The Case of the Arts in the United States since 1850|This research illuminates the historical development of creative activity in the United States. Census data is used to identify creative occupations (i.e., artists, musicians, authors, actors) and data on prominent creatives, as listed in a comprehensive biographical compendium. The analysis first sheds light on the socio-economic background of creative people and how it has changed since 1850. The results indicate that the proportion of female creatives is relatively high, time constraints can be a hindrance for taking up a creative occupation, racial inequality is present and tends to change only slowly, and education plays a significant role for taking up a creative occupation. Second, the study systematically documents and quantifies the geography of creative clusters in the United States and explains how these have evolved over time and across creative domains. Third, it investigates the importance of outstanding talent in a discipline for the local growth of an artistic cluster.
Z11|Publicly funded cultural institutions – a comparative economic valuation study|Cultural institutions are the main creators of cultural goods and services and are responsible for their accessibility; cultural institutions are also the main beneficiaries of public funds for culture. The aim of this study is to evaluate the division of public resources into different branches of culture that are rooted in political ‘adhocism’ and historical dependencies. Based on the observed visitations and their costs, a two-stage budgeting model is employed to investigate the change in consumer surplus related to the loss of access to the markets of cinemas, museums, and theatres in Warsaw, the capital city of Poland. The institutions vary in terms of public good characteristics and importance as public bodies, expressed in terms of subsidies. The inclusion of the entire markets of institutions helps to overcome the embedding effect, which affects many single-site valuations. It also enables a comparison between cultural sectors, which is rare in cultural economics. We find that people assign a positive value to the accessibility of all institutions and groups of institutions. However, the estimated value generated by each type of cultural institution is not aligned with the division of subsidies between these markets. For theatres, the total benefits exceed public support. Museums are found to deliver a lower level of benefits to society; the value they generate is outweighed by the subsidies they receive. Cinemas receive little direct support; however, they are valued twice as much as museums. The problem of cultural policy lies in the division of resources, which is much more equal relative to benefits attributed to groups of museums and theatres. At the same time the division between single institutions within all three branches of culture is unequal, with the significant exclusion of non-public institutions.
Z11|Quantification and Revolution: An Investigation of German Capital Flight after the First|It is well known that after the First World War there was a massive flight of capital from the major European countries to foreign financial centres. It is surprising, however, to note that no historian to date has actually taken the trouble to make a detailed study of the phenomenon. The aim of this article is to go beyond the impressionism that characterises the historical approach to the study of capital flight following the First World War. In order to show what can and cannot be established, the subject of study will be Germany. After presenting the main difficulties encountered in quantifying the flight of German capital, the article will go on to provide a new estimate of it. A wide range of sources were referred to for the survey: national archives, expert reports, bank statistics, and balances of payments. The application of rigorous historical method, with crosschecking and critical analysis of documents, have made it possible to establish new relevant facts regarding the flight of German capital following the First World War. The final figure obtained is greater than those generally accepted.
Z11|Immigrant Artists: Enrichment or Displacement?|In order to investigate the role of immigrant artists on the development of artistic clusters in U.S. cities, we use the US Census and American Community Survey, collected every 10 years since 1850. We identify artists and art teachers, authors, musicians and music teachers, actors and actresses, architects, and journalists, their geographical location and their status as a native or an immigrant. We look at the relative growth rate of the immigrant population in these occupations over a ten year period and how it affects the relative growth rate of native-born individuals in these artistic occupations. We find that cities that experienced immigrant artist inflows also see a greater inflow of native artists.
Z11|Do Tax Incentives Affect Business Location and Economic Development? Evidence from State Film Incentives|"I estimate the impacts of recently-popular U.S. state film incentives on filming location, film industry employment, wages, and establishments, and spillover impacts on related industries. I compile a detailed database of incentives, matching this with TV series and feature film data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and Studio System, and establishment and employment data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages and Country Business Patterns. I compare these outcomes in states before and after they adopt incentives, relative to similar states that did not adopt incentives over the same time period (a panel difference-in-differences). I find that TV series filming increases by 6.3 to 55.4% (at most 1.50 additional TV series) after incentive adoption. However, there is no meaningful effect on feature films, and employment, wages, and establishments in the film industry and in related industries. These results show that the ability for tax incentives to affect business location decisions and economic development is mixed, suggesting that even with aggressive incentives, and ""footloose"" filming, incentives can have little impact."

Z11|دور اللغة العربية في نشر البحوث الاقتصادية مراجعة مستودع البحوث الاقتصادية بمكتبة جامعة ميونخ بألمانيا<BR>[The role of arabic language in the dissemination of economic research a review of the repository of economic research in munich university library, germany]|This study aims to evaluate the contribution of the Arabic language to the dissemination of economic research at the international level via investigating the experience of the economic research repository at the University of Munich, Germany, which publishes research in all languages. The study uses analytical descriptive methodology based on the analysis of the content of this research to determine the extent of its coverage of the different economic fields of economics, to highlight the economic terminology in Arabic, and the use of Arabic terms corresponding to the main terms which used in economic analysis methodologies.

Z11|Colors, Emotions, and the Auction Value of Paintings|We study the impact of colors of paintings on prices in the art auction market and incorporate color attributes of non-figurative paintings in pricing models. A one standard deviation increase in the percentages of blue (red) hue leads to premiums of 10.63% (4.20%). We also conduct laboratory experiments in China, the Netherlands, and U.S., and elicit participants’ willingness-to-pay and emotions (pleasure-arousal). Blue (red) paintings command 18.57% (17.28%) higher bids and stronger intention to purchase. Although abstract art is visually arousing, it is the emotional pleasure channel that relates colors and prices. Our results are consistent across all three cultures.
Z11|“The Master of …”: creating names for art history and the art market|Abstract The value of a painting is influenced above all by the artist who created it and his reputation. Painters nowadays are easy to identify and are used to signing their artworks. But what about those whose names have not survived the test of time? This paper contributes to the understanding of art valuation and art brands on the auction market. It focuses on a particular subset of anonymous artists labelled with so-called provisional names (“Master of …”). After considering the origins and reception of the practice of creating names for unrecorded artists, we empirically investigate the market behaviour of this niche segment. Based on comparative price indexes and hedonic regressions, we show that masters with provisional names have not only become autonomous brand names that are highly valued by the art market; they also outperformed named artists between 1955 and 2015. In the second phase, we analyse the provisional-name linked elements valued by the market. We find that art market participants pay attention to the creator of the provisional name, its long-term recognition and market visibility, and the typology of the names.
Z11|Bend but don't break: a case study on the cultural entrepreneurial process in the publishing industry|Research on cultural industries has attracted considerable interest on cultural entrepreneurs as agents in complex interaction with multiple and evolving contexts. The study aims to capture the complexity and intensity of these relationships, exploring entrepreneurship as a journey driven by cultural and social dynamics on one side, and economic needs on the other. The investigation is an inductive inquiry carried out through an in-depth analysis of a single revelatory case in the publishing industry. Focusing on the relational process through which the entrepreneur and the context are co-created, the paper analyzes the entrepreneurial journey through the identification of three major stages: Divergence, Identity construction, and Institutionalization.
Z11|‘Quality food’ for cultural policies. Quality attributes in the non-market stated-preference based valuation of cultural goods|Evidence-based policies require well-established research and reliable data. One of the major difficulties in delivering ‘good quality food’ for cultural policies lies in measuring culture. Stated preference based non-market valuation is one of the privileged tools to reveal the benefits cultural goods deliver to the society for cost-benefit analysis. The prevalent problem in this kind of research are poorly defined, ambiguous goods. The challenge lies in describing their quality attributes. The article’s goal is to review the hitherto uses of quality measurements of arts and culture in stated preference based non-market valuation research, mostly dedicated to performing arts and cultural heritage.
Z11|The Gift and Open Science|This short note illustrates how social structures and behavior of scientists in the societal sub-system of open science resemble patterns analyzed in the Gift, an essay written by Marcel Mauss nearly 100 years ago. The presented analysis goes beyond existing interpretations of gift giving in science. The latter has mainly focused on the exchange of knowledge and citations. I argue that the Gift explains also identity, competition, co-opetition, rituals, and punishment. Mauss’s Gift is seen as a complementary model to existing economic and sociological approaches regularly used to analyze structures and behavior in open science. By accentuating such an anthropological approach, I conclude that the Gift provides explanations of the stability and the expansion of the open science community.
Z11|The painting can be fake, but not the feeling’: an overview of the Vietnamese market through the lens of fake, forgery and copy paintings|A work of Vietnamese art crossed a million-dollar mark in the international art market in early 2017. The event was reluctantly seen as a sign of maturity from the Vietnamese art amidst the many existing problems. Even though the Vietnamese media has discussed the issues enthusiastically, there is a lack of literature from the Vietnamese academics examining the subject, and even rarer in from the market perspective. This paper aims to contribute an insightful perspective on the Vietnamese art market, and hesitantly the Vietnamese art as well, through the lens of fake, forgery and copy artworks. 35 cases of fake, forgery and copy paintings were found on the news and from the experts' wisdom. Through the examples, we argue that the Vietnamese art market is a temporary reaction to the immaturely rising of the Vietnamese art and the economy. Therefore, the art market is unable to function healthily unless the Vietnamese art and the economy developed.
Z11|Liberalizing Art. Evidence on the Impressionists at the end of the Paris Salon|We analyze the Paris art market between the government-controlled Salon as a centralized organization of art exhibition and the system liberalized by the Republican government based on competition between independent exhibitions. The jury of the old Salon decided on submissions with a bias toward conservative art of the academic insiders, reducing demand for the outsiders, as confirmed by the impact on prices of the acceptance of Impressionists. With a difference-in difference estimation we provide evidence that the end of the government-controlled Salon in 1880 started the increase of the prices of the Impressionists relative to the insiders.

Z11|Power-Laws in Art. From Renaissance to Contemporary Art|We provide evidence of a cubic law of art prices that hints to a general pattern for the distribution of artistic talent. The persistence across heterogeneous markets from historical ones to contemporary art auctions of a power law in the distribution of the average price per artist suggests the possibility of a universal law for talent distribution. We explore scale-free networks of teacher-students to investigate the diffusion of talent over time.
Z11|My kingdom for a horse (or a classic car)|This paper investigates the price determinants and investment performance of classic cars comprising various categories starting from veteran cars (built between 1888 and 1907) up to modern classics (built between 1975 and 1990). We examine a sample of 29,000 classic car auction sales conducted globally between 1998 and 2017. A hedonic pricing methodology is used to construct several classic car price indices, which enable a risk-return analysis. Classic cars appreciated annually by 3.37% and 5.63%, respectively in real and in nominal terms before transaction costs. Investments in ‘blue chip’ classic cars (12.50%) and Italian classics (11.28%) generate the highest annual nominal returns. On a risk-adjusted basis, classic cars have outperformed equity and other emotional assets such as art, but underperformed bonds and gold over the past two decades. The risk-adjusted returns on the category of affordable classics are similar to those of equity investments.
Z11|Recenti iniziative europee ed italiane per la valorizzazione del patrimonio culturale|Nel presente studio si illustrano â€“ in occasione della fine dellâ€™anno dedicato dalla Commissione europea al Patrimonio culturale â€“ le piÃ¹ significative iniziative condotte sia da parte dellâ€™Unione europea che da parte italiana a favore dei beni culturali. Ovviamente, dopo aver debitamente accennato al quadro giuridico-istituzionale e alla sua evoluzione nel tempo, si evidenziano i principali aspetti di carattere strutturale che si riflettono sulle attivitÃ recentemente realizzate in tale ambito soprattutto in Italia, Paese a cui viene riconosciuta una indiscussa leadership quantomeno a livello europeo.
Z11|Educación artística, elección de bachillerato y capacidades. Efecto de la creación del bachillerato artístico en la matrícula universitaria|This paper evaluates the effects of a high school curriculum reform on students' probability to choose Arts as college major. The reform was introduced in 2006 and involved, among other things, the creation of the Art and Expression track in the last two years of the upper secondary level, incorporating for the first time multi-artistic education as a high school diploma. Based on administrative data covering students from the Social and Artistic Area (ASYA, in Spanish) of the Universidad de la República (UdelaR) between 2004 and 2016, the empirical analysis is carried out by applying a difference-in-differences model. After controlling for sex, age and year of graduation from high school as well as place of residence, the results show that the reform increased the probability of choosing a major in Arts by 8.98 pp., conditional on choosing a free entry career of the ASYA, in students who finished public day-time high school between 2004 and 2010. Furthermore, being a woman reduces the impact of the reform, while finishing the secondary school in Montevideo Metropolitan Area increases it. The age of graduation from high school does not have significant effects on the studied probability. Based on Amartya Sen’s (1985) Capabilities Approach and Akerlof and Kranton’s (2000, 2002) Identity Economics, this research constitutes a first approach to the decision making process of students who chose arts in high school to later pursue university artistic formation. In this sense, the contribution to national production on educational evaluation, in general, and to the capabilities and identity literature applied to Uruguay, in particular, stands out.
Z11|Cultural consumption and the artistic benefit|This research-based paper aims to analyse the benefits linked with the art & culture consumption in order to improve their taxonomy. Starting from a list of benefits composed by five voices: functional, symbolic, emotional, social and artistic, this paper is dedicated to an analysis aimed at understanding what are the features that a cultural product of performing arts should have. Particular attention is dedicated to the artistic benefit, defined as the feeling of being part of the artistic process. This benefit, through the optic of the customer engagement, helps to push forward arts and culture marketing and management into a service-dominant logic. Data collection and analysis are divided in two main studies. The first qualitative, explorative and item-generation study is based on in-depth interviews with pivotal witnesses of the art management process; the second quantitative study intends to purify the items generation process and evaluate the validity of the identified semantic dimensions in comparison with the starting framework. The results confirm the relevance of the topic for the arts consumption in order to shed light on the customer engagement process within the art & culture marketing and management dynamics.
Z11|The cultural omnivorousness and the consumption of performing arts|This paper aims to understand and investigate the relationship between the cultural omnivorousness and the research of the artistic benefit in the fruition of cultural products. The hypothesis at the base of the research is that the omnivore, as an expert and consumer protagonist of his time and of his choices, moves in search of artistic enriching experiences based on the sense of re-enchantment and authenticity as an antidote to the experiential standardization and homologation. To search for the conceptual link between omnivorousness and artistic benefit, in the context of the fruition behaviors, this research aims to understand, through a mixed methods methodology, the point of view of the omnivore user and to investigate his cultural logic of distinction. The aim is to identify managerial implications for the planning of new business models in the cultural and artistic fields.
Z11|The archive as a cognitive artefact. An analysis of the complex relationship between culture and business|The research work aims at investigating the company archive phenomenon by considering its original cultural dimension and analysing it through a parallel empiric research carried out in two different contexts: in a manufacturing design company and in a cultural institution. In both cases, the archive is an “in fieri” project. In the first case, it is the desired tool to boost the brand communication, while it will end in identifying the absence of a coherent product strategy. In the second case, it is conceived as a process of revision of the existent archive, meant to re-organise the cultural asset of the foundation in a period of change and new acquisitions, and it will become the opportunity to revise the relationship between temporary exhibitions and permanent collection. The present work then aims at analysing the complexity of the process of archive construction and interpretation, and adopts a perspective which is intrinsically interdisciplinary, both because of the researchers involved and because of the process of investigation which is based on a qualitative work of analysis where all the documentation are analysed in parallel and adopting different perspectives, in order to make sense of the archive safeguarding its complexity.
Z11|Is gender in the eye of the beholder? Identifying cultural attitudes with art auction prices|In the secondary art market, artists play no active role. This allows us to isolate cultural influences on the demand for female artists' work from supply-side factors. Using 1.5 million auction transactions in 45 countries, we document a 47.6% gender discount in auction prices for paintings. The discount is higher in countries with greater gender inequality. In experiments, participants are unable to guess the gender of an artist simply by looking at a painting and they vary in their preferences for paintings associated with female artists. Women's art appears to sell for less because it is made by women.
Z11|A Double Machine Learning Approach to Estimate the Effects of Musical Practice on Student's Skills|This study investigates the dose-response effects of making music on youth development. Identification is based on the conditional independence assumption and estimation is implemented using a recent double machine learning estimator. The study proposes solutions to two highly practically relevant questions that arise for these new methods: (i) How to investigate sensitivity of estimates to tuning parameter choices in the machine learning part? (ii) How to assess covariate balancing in high-dimensional settings? The results show that improvements in objectively measured cognitive skills require at least medium intensity, while improvements in school grades are already observed for low intensity of practice.
Z11|The Competitive Market Value of Copyright in Music: A Digital Gordian Knot (The Working Paper Version – v2)|Pricing copyrighted works or assets so that creators are competitively compensated has always been a difficult task given the information good character of such works. Doing it in the digital era is even more challenging. I consider Hertzian radio, satellite radio, and interactive music streaming services and I argue that annual competitive royalties in Hertzian radio should be increased from $100 million to $450 million. I further argue that this gap should not be filled by primary users alone but by a broader set of beneficiaries, including the general public and their government. La tarification des œuvres protégées par le droit d'auteur assurant aux créateurs une rémunération concurrentielle a toujours été une tâche difficile étant donné le caractère biens d’information de ces œuvres. Le faire à l'ère du numérique est encore plus difficile. Je considère la radio hertzienne, la radio par satellite, et les services de musique interactive et je prétends que les royautés dans la radio hertzienne devraient être augmentées de $100 à $450 million. Je prétends en outre que cet écart devrait être comblé non pas uniquement par les utilisateurs primaires, mais par un ensemble plus large de bénéficiaires, y compris le grand public et leur gouvernement.
Z11|Testing for bubbles in cryptocurrencies with time-varying volatility|The recent evolution of cryptocurrencies has been characterized by bubble-like behavior and extreme volatility. While it is difficult to assess an intrinsic value to a specific cryptocurrency, one can employ recently proposed bubble tests that rely on recursive applications of classical unit root tests. This paper extends this approach to the case where volatility is time varying, assuming a deterministic long-run component that may take into account a decrease of unconditional volatility when the cryptocurrency matures with a higher market dissemination. Volatility also includes a stochastic short-run component to capture volatility clustering. The wild bootstrap is shown to correctly adjust the size properties of the bubble test, which retains good power properties. In an empirical application using eleven of the largest cryptocurrencies and the CRIX index, the general evidence in favor of bubbles is confirmed, but much less pronounced than under constant volatility.
Z11|Monthly art market returns|We provide an innovative methodological contribution to the measurement of returns on infrequently traded assets using a novel approach to repeat-sales regression estimation. The model for price indices we propose allows for correlation with other markets, typically with higher liquidity and high frequency trading. Using the new econometric approach, we propose a monthly art market index, as well as sub-indices from Impressionist, Modern, Post-War, and Contemporary paintings based on repeated sales at a monthly frequency. The correlations enable us to update the art index via observed transactions in other markets that have a link with the art market.
Z11|Physiological Constraints and Comparative Economic Development|"It is a well known fact that economic development and distance to the equator are positively correlated variables in the world today. It is perhaps less well known that as recently as 1500 C.E. it was the other way around. The present paper provides a theory of why the ""latitude gradient"" seemingly changed sign in the course of the last half millennium. In particular, we develop a dynamic model of economic and physiological development in which households decide upon the number and nutrition of their offspring. In this setting we demonstrate that relatively high metabolic costs of fertility, which may have emerged due to positive selection towards greater cold tolerance in locations away from the equator, would work to sti fle economic development during pre-industrial times, yet allow for an early onset of sustained growth. As a result, the theory suggests a reversal of fortune whereby economic activity gradually shifts away from the equator in the process of long-term economic development."
Z11|Do Contemporary Plays Feature Fewer Roles? Some Empirical Evidence|This paper shows that the number of roles in theatre plays has been decreasing over time. Playwrights seem to internalize the costs of producing plays with too many roles by downsizing. This downsizing is not a recent phenomenon: it is going for many decades. We also analyze which plays get produced. This paper uses a unique data set of repertory archives of Turkish State Theatres, covering plays from decades.
Z11|Are We (Un)Consciously Driven by First Impressions? Price Declarations vs. Observed Cinema Demand when VAT Increases|The aim of this research is to shed light on how people's self-declared price perceptions could be affected by external factors other than real prices. Also, we analyze if these perceptions, particularly when inaccurate, determine later economic behavior. We study how a rise in the Spanish Cultural VAT triggered changes in actual prices, price perceptions and cinema demand. We find that price declarations in survey responses, as they are based on intuitive thinking, are affected by other features than prices. These factors, which are different for attendants and non-attendants, include promotion research costs, differences between implicit and explicit costs, interpretation of prices according to prior expectations, the influence of other channels such as mass media or word of mouth, recall of the latest price paid and, finally, protest responses, as in our case the origin of the price change is a tax increase. Moreover, for those who are more affected by these external factors, we find that declared valuations of prices are not consistent with observed consumption decisions. Behavior involves a more reflective and deliberative way of thinking that helps set aside external factors and places the focus back on real prices. Therefore, the real behavior is more consistent with rationality than are price declarations.
Z11|Supporting the Dance Sector. Does Efficiency Clash with Success When Programming?|Dance has received scant attention in economic literature perhaps because it is an activity that appears under a number of legal forms and diverse formats and due to the fact that â€“in many instances- it is affected by a high degree of instability time-wise, thus making it difficult to have the necessary data available required for economic analysis. Nevertheless, this sectorâ€™s dependence on public funding provides grounds for it to be the subject of performance related studies. This work aims to offer an evaluation process for a public project designed to spread dance in Spain. The project involves a number of stakeholders: public authorities, performance venues and dance companies. Each participant plays a role in the project: public authorities provide the funding while the theatres and dance companies offer the artistic idea that is taken to the audience. By applying Data Envelopment Analysis techniques (DEA), the present work seeks to evaluate the efficiency of the stakeholders involved in the project, as well as the efficiency of the programme itself by relating resources and objectives. We find that efficiency in resource performance often runs counter to other cultural aims such as increasing audiences or extending repertoire diversity.
Z11|Deep-Rooted Culture and Economic Development: Taking the Seven Deadly Sins to Build A Well-Being Composite Indicator|This work involves undertaking a reappraisal of the Seven Deadly Sins in order to construct synthetic indicators of well-being aimed at measuring spatial economic disparities and their link to economic development. The Seven Deadly Sins constitute a way of describing vices vis-Ã -vis Christian moral education. Yet they might also be viewed as general norms of social behaviour and interpreted today as notions related to the concept of well-being. For example, the level of concentration of wealth (greed), sustainability of resources (gluttony), safety index (wrath), problems adapting to the labour market or workplace absenteeism (sloth), etc. The Seven Deadly Sins have also yielded emblematic examples of artistic iconography and cultural production. How they are perceived and expressed may also differ depending on each groupâ€™s cultural idiosyncrasy, in the sense of a series of beliefs and attitudes forged over the centuries. Based on these premises, the current work first seeks to compile variables that reflect each conceptual dimension so as to later construct a synthetic indicator of well-being with territorial disaggregation. This enables us to explore spatial disparities and the extent to which they relate to economic development. This is applied to a group of countries in the European Union with NUTS 2 territorial disaggregation (regions). The sources of information are basically Eurostat. The method involves applying Data Envelopment Analysis to construct the synthetic indicator, and spatial econometrics to pinpoint spatial dependence effects.
Z11|Internal and external factors in the development of a network organization in the arts: A mediation analysis|Network organizations in the arts have recently received substantial discussion in cultural policy research. Yet, very seldom have they been empirically modelled. We analyze development of DruÅ¡tvo Asociacija, the cover network of non-governmental organizations and freelancers in culture and the arts in Slovenia in years 2004-2017. Using mediation analysis for time series, using generalized linear models and Granger mediation analysis, we observe three breakpoint periods in the development of the network and explore if they were the effects of internal, organizationally related factors or the mere response to external, macroeconomic changes. Our findings point to the importance of internal decisions of the organization which do not have a mediating effect to the consequences of external factors like financial crises. This shows that decisions of network organizations in the arts are not merely a reflection of changes in their environment.
Z11|Fame as an Illusion of Creativity: Evidence from the Pioneers of Abstract Art|We build a social structural model of fame, which departs from the atomistic view of prior literature where creativity is the sole driver of fame in creative markets. We test the model in a significant empirical context: 90 pioneers of the early 20th century (1910–25) abstract art movement. We find that an artist in a brokerage rather than a closure position was likely to become more famous. This effect was not, however, associated with the artist’s creativity, which we measured using both objective computational methods and subjective expert evaluations, and which was not itself related to fame. Rather than creativity, brokerage networks were associated with cosmopolitan identities—broker’s alters were likely to differ more from each other’s nationalities--and this was the key social-structural driver of fame.
Z11|Power-Laws in Art. From Renaissance to Contemporary Art|We provide evidence of a cubic law of art prices that hints to a general pattern for the distribution of artistic talent. The persistence across heterogeneous markets from historical ones to contemporary art auctions of a power law in the distribution of the average price per artist suggests the possibility of a universal law for talent distribution. We explore scale-free networks of teacher-students to investigate the diffusion of talent over time.
Z11|Segmentation of Theatre Audiences: A Latent Class Approach for Combined Data|Theatrical productions are perishable goods, since the tickets for a particular play cannot be inventoried and sold after the time of the play. In the revenue management of a perishable good, price discrimination is widely used. Since the theatre audience is heterogeneous in terms of visit purpose, ability to perceive quality, willingness-to-pay, the strategy of price discrimination should be developed in the context of theatre segments. In this paper, we segment consumers of the Perm Opera and Ballet Theatre and propose marketing instruments to increase theatre revenue. Since the development of a detailed price discrimination strategy requires data on consumer purchase history, behavioral and socio-demographic characteristics, we combine two data sources: data on ticket purchases and survey data. Using a modication of a latent class logit model for joint revealed and stated preference data we identify four segments of the theater's audience. The study reveals theatregoer segments with dierent willingness-to-pay for performance and seat location characteristics, which allows the development of detailed recommendations on the pricing strategy for various theatre audiences
Z11|Pre-release leaks as one-time incentives for switching to unauthorised sources of cultural content|Pre-release leaks of cultural content incentivise consumers to look for unauthorised sources. I find that such events may induce some television viewers to switch to unauthorised sources to gain access even to content that had not been leaked. To demonstrate that this is the case, I use a unique dataset on a sample of TV shows aired around the time of a pre-release leak of a very popular TV show (Game of Thrones). The results of a difference-in-differences analysis indicate that the leaked TV show lost viewership for both the leaked episodes and those that followed. Moreover, the event also had negative effects for other TV shows that may share an audience with the leaked show. Finally, my results for the shows with a shared audience are corroborated by evidence of an increase in Google searches for phrases including the show names and the words “watch online”, after the leak. I argue that the one-time incentive to use unauthorised sources caused some viewers to engage in unauthorised consumption even of shows not affected directly by the leak. These conclusions are consistent with the existence of one-time costs of switching channels of content acquisition.
Z11|A Double Machine Learning Approach to Estimate the Effects of Musical Practice on Student's Skills|This study investigates the dose-response effects of making music on youth development. Identification is based on the conditional independence assumption and estimation is implemented using a recent double machine learning estimator. The study proposes solutions to two highly practically relevant questions that arise for these new methods: (i) How to investigate sensitivity of estimates to tuning parameter choices in the machine learning part? (ii) How to assess covariate balancing in high-dimensional settings? The results show that improvements in objectively measured cognitive skills require at least medium intensity, while improvements in school grades are already observed for low intensity of practice.
Z11|Computer Vision and Real Estate: Do Looks Matter and Do Incentives Determine Looks|How much does the appearance of a house, or its neighbors, impact its price? Do events that impact the incentives facing homeowners, like foreclosure, impact the maintenance and appearance of a home? Using computer vision techniques, we find that a one standard deviation improvement in the appearance of a home in Boston is associated with a .16 log point increase in the home’s value, or about $68,000 at the sample mean. The additional predictive power created by images is small relative to location and basic home variables, but external images do outperform variables collected by in-person home assessors. A home’s value increases by .4 log points, when its neighbor’s visually predicted value increases by one log point, and more visible neighbors have a larger price impact than less visible neighbors. Homes that went through foreclosure during the 2008-09 financial crisis experienced a .04 log point decline in their appearance-related value, relative to comparable homes, suggesting that foreclosures reduced the incentives to maintain the housing stock. We do not find more depreciation of appearance in rental properties, or more upgrading of appearance by owners before resale.
Z11|Geschichte und Politökonomie deutscher Theatersubventionen<BR>[History and Political Economy of Public Subsidies for German Theatres and Operas]|Public theatres and operas in Germany currently receive an annual funding of 2 – 2,5 billion Euros by the German Laender and municipalities. The presented monograph shows that this special kind of cultural subsidy can be traced back to the Late Middle Ages, and that theatres and operas have always been subsidized for political reasons. Employing a panel data set, the empirical analysis also demonstrates clearly that since German reunification, a higher propor-tion of center-right party members in the Laender parliaments entails higher subsidies for theatres and operas. In addition, a classical political budget cycle can be observed, with higher subsidies being granted in election years.

Z11|De la Cumbiamba al Vallenato: Aproximación cultural, económica y política a la música de acordeón en el Caribe colombiano, 1870-1960|A partir de los datos aportados por este trabajo se propone que el acordeón llegó por primera vez a las costas del Caribe colombiano en el año 1870, por lo que el instrumento está próximo a cumplir 150 años de presencia en el folclor colombiano. En la década de 1890 se encuentran referencias de los primeros conjuntos de cumbiamba que se componían de acordeón, caja y guacharaca. En la última década del siglo XIX y principios del siglo XX surgieron los primeros intelectuales que discutieron y difundieron la música de acordeón y el folclor costeño en general. En la segunda mitad del siglo XX el vallenato se convirtió en la música de mayor auge, primero en el Caribe colombiano y luego en toda Colombia, desplazando a los otros ritmos costeños como la cumbia y el porro. Su máximo exponente fue el compositor Rafael Escalona y su principal promotor el escritor Gabriel García Márquez, quien reconoció las influencias extra literarias de la música vallenata en sus obras. ******ABSTRACT: This document argues that the Accordion first arrived to the Caribbean coast of Colombia in 1870, which implies that the instrument is about to celebrate 150 years of influence in the culture of the region. There are references in the decade of 1890 that relate to the first musical groups of cumbiamba, which were integrated by an accordion, but also with Caja and Guacharaca. The first intellectuals that commented and spread the music of accordion and the folklore of the Caribbean region emerged during the last decade of the nineteenth century and the early twentieth. In the second half of the twentieth century, Vallenato became very popular. At first in the Caribbean region, but then in all of the country, displacing other coastal rhythms such as Cumbia and Porro. Its maximum exponent was the composer Rafael Escalona, and its main promoter the writer Gabriel García Márquez, who recognized the influence of this music in its work.
Z11|Potterian Economics|Recent studies in psychology and neuroscience find that fictional works exert strong influence on readers and shape their opinions and worldviews. We study the Potterian economy, which we compare to economic models, to assess how Harry Potter books affect economic literacy. We find that some principles of Potterian economics are consistent with economistsâ€™ models. Many others, however, are distorted and contain numerous inaccuracies, which contradict professional economistsâ€™ views and insights, and contribute to the general publicâ€™s biases, ignorance, and lack of understanding of economics.
Z11|Cultural identity and willingness to protect and preserve art|The aim of this paper is to analyse the willingness to pay of art-goers for the protection and preservation of cultural artefacts. To this purpose, a discrete choice experiment approach is employed. The experiment took place in 2011 during a major exhibition dedicated to the artist Costantino Nivola (1911- 1988). His works, especially those based on the novel sand-casting technique, are known worldwide and many of them were produced after he moved from Sardinia (Italy) to the United States (where he lived from 1939 to his death in 1988). Over this period he never cut his ties with his native land. As a result, both the American and the Sardinian culture affect and show up in his works. In this context, the discrete choice experiments allowed us to estimate not only the price that people are prepared to pay for the security of Nivola's artefacts but also the contribution of non-market components, such as identity, to preserve those objects. Accounting for heterogeneity, the empirical findings show that among visitors there is a substantial willingness to partially cover the cost of preserving the cultural heritage, with significant differences related to the characteristics of the collections considered.
Z11|50 años de economía de la cultura. Explorando sus raíces en la historia del pensamiento económico|El artículo tiene por objetivo rastrear elementos clave desde el pensamiento económico que en principio limitaron y posteriormente permitieron el acercamiento de la economía al análisis de los bienes y servicios culturales. La contribución del artículo es doble. Por un lado, se sintetiza cómo se incorporó la modelización del consumo de bienes culturales al análisis económico, a partir de una selectiva revisión de la literatura de prestigiosos economistas en la historia del pensamiento económico. Por otro lado, se describen los elementos que configuran la economía de la cultura como un área dinámica de especialización, perfectamente situada y con prestigio intelectual en la economía. ***** The objective of this paper is to rediscover key elements of economic thought, which first limited and then paved the way for an economic analysis of cultural goods and services. This paper contributes in two ways. Firstly, we show how modelling the consumption of cultural goods was undertaken by economic analysis. In order to do so, we have selectively used the relevant literature written by prestigious economists on the economic thought history. Secondly, we describe the elements that form the basis of cultural economics. These can be understood as a dynamic area of specialization, they are perfectly situated and are intellectually prestige within the economy.

Z11|The Cultural Value and Variety of Playing Video Games|This paper compares different profiles of video game players and studies how these groups differ in their cultural consumptions patterns. By using a unique dataset on cultural participation in Denmark, we address the problem of over-aggregation and differentiate between several profiles of video gamers based on the genre they play. We find that video gamers are far from being unresponsive to other forms of cultural consumption. In fact, they rather exhibit, on average, better cultural habits than non-players. In particular, they have higher frequencies of reading, museum and performing arts attendance, and are more likely to be involved in active music participation. The exception exists for the category of reflex game players; this could be driven by age effects, since reflex games are the most popular among (males) under 40.
Z11|Has cultural heritage monetary value an impact on visits? An assessment using Italian official data|In this paper we try to investigate which factors affect the visits to Cultural Heritage (CH), using Italy as a case study. We adopt a broad definition of CH including archaeological and historical sites, historical buildings and, also, museums, focusing our attention on State CH. In our empirical analysis we use a rather innovative indicator of CH value, i.e. the monetary value of State CH, officially provided by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Using these data, this paper aims at evaluating if such monetary value has a significant role in stimulating visits to cultural sites for the years 1996-2010. We also control for other factors potentially affecting the number of visits to cultural sites, such as alternative tourist attractors and the regional performance in the tourism sector. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to investigate the effect of CH monetary value on cultural participation.
Z11|Disentangle inefficiency in the production activities of Italian national libraries: A network DEA approach|n Italy, public state libraries are multi-product organizations providing divisible services to the public and preserving ancient books of great historical relevance for future generations. So they may undertake different production activities for conservation and use, which together construct a network. This paper shows the importance of considering multi-process interactions in evaluating the overall performance of public state libraries and focuses on library operations and its sub-processes. It uses a network two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach to examine the relationship between the librariesâ€™ basic inputs, intermediate measures and final outputs. The main result is that Italian public state libraries generally perform better in the first stage of conservation, but score poorly in the second stage of use. Therefore, policy advices to improve the decision-making process are derived.
Z11|Video games as cultural participation: understanding games playing in England using the Taking Part survey|This study addresses the important and recurring question of whether playing video games is detrimental to the socio-economic development of a person. It does this by using novel data from the Taking Part Survey in England to establish whether games playing is associated with particular socio-economic characteristics and/or other forms of cultural participation. The results do not indicate any obviously negative effects of video games playing: those who play are typically better educated and wealthier, and games players are also more likely than non-games players to participate in other forms of culture, especially through active participation. These findings are reinforced when comparing the characteristics of individuals who did and did not play video games when younger.
Z11|Efficiency of Slovenian General Public Libraries: A Data Envelopment Analysis Approach|In the article, we study financing and efficiency of Slovenian GeneralPublicLibraries. We employ a rich dataset of CEZAR â€“Centre for Development of Libraries for the years 2008-2014 for 58 libraries and use data envelopment analysis, cluster analysis and regression methods to study the efficiency of libraries over the years. Our main results show that the problems for the libraries in this period did not lie in the lowered efficiency but more likely in other system requirements. Wealso provide a grouping of libraries following clusteranalysis with spatial constraints and show thecluster membership had significant effects on theperformance of the libraries.
Z11|Prevalence of Diseases and Health Care Utilization ofthe Self-Employed Artists and TheirEmpirical Determinants: Evidence From a Slovenian Survey|Empirical studies on precarious work are still at their beginnings, even more so when the health of precarious workers is under concern. Commonly, precarious workers are assumed to have the inferior health to the employees and even to the population in general, although some recent studiesfound counter evidence to this claim. In particular, studies on the labor market of artists have so far almost completely neglected the question of the health of the artists,and this study tries to fill in this large and important void. In the study, we employ a survey of Slovenian self-employed artists, undertaken in 2015, to study the determinants of the prevalence of diseases and health utilization of self-employed artists in Slovenia using econometric modelling and network analysis. We study and find the determinants, influencing the prevalence of each type of the most common disease among the self-employed artists, determine the most common groupings/multiple diseases among this population, and, finally, study the determinants of health care utilization of self-employed artists and model the heterogeneity in the observed sample. Aninteresting result lies in determining two differentgroups according to their health care utilization and providingtheir interpretation which fits into the existing literature on artist labor markets.
Z11|A Model of Trading in the Art Market|We present an infinite-horizon model of endogenous trading in the art auction market. Agents make purchase and sale decisions based on the relative magnitude of their private use value in each period. Our model generates endogenous cross-sectional and time-series patterns in investment outcomes. Average returns and buy-in probabilities are negatively correlated with the time between purchase and resale (attempt). Idiosyncratic risk does not converge to zero as the holding period shrinks. Prices and auction volume increase during expansions. Our model finds empirical support in auction data and has implications for selection biases in observed prices and transaction-based price indexes.
Z11|The Rise and Fall of Castrati|Castrato singers appeared in the Western World during the 16th century. They were needed by the Church for reasons that we shall discuss, and their skills were such that opera composers also decided to use them. This created a major demand for their services. Castrati reigned supreme at the Opera until the mid-19th century and continued to sing in Italian churches until 1913. The last one died in Rome in 1922. The paper shows that economic incentives played a key role in explaining the rise and fall of this remarkable group of singers.
Z11|The Implicit Value of Arts Experts: the Case of Klaus Ertz and Pieter Brueghel the Younger|Pieter Brueghel the Younger (c. 1564/65 – 1637/38) is a well-known painter who reproduced the works of his celebrated father Pieter Bruegel the Elder (c. 1525/30-1569). We collected the sales of his original works as well as those from his atelier and followers over the period 1972-2015 and compare the prices of two categories of works: his autograph works, and all others, whether partly autograph or untouched by him. Confusion among the types was floating around, since the same compositions exist in many versions and dimensions, and were probably even executed by different painters. In 1997-1998, the German independent art historian Klaus Ertz curated a large itinerant exhibition in four European countries dedicated to Pieter the Younger. At the time, it was known that he was working on a catalogue raisonné (CR) of the painter to which he referred substantially, though it came out in 2000 only. We use difference-in-differences estimation to establish that the exhibitions and the information concerning the catalogue had a significant effect on the prices of autograph works. Though we cannot judge whether Ertz’s attributions are right or not, it seems that buyers started feeling more confident, since they were ready to pay roughly 60 percent more for works considered autograph after the late 1990s.
Z11|Horizon analysis of art investments: Evidence from the Chinese market|This paper analyzes art investments with different investment horizons based on the repeated sales transactions in the Chinese calligraphy and paintings auction market from 1994 to 2012. We classify the whole sample into short-, medium-, and long-horizon subsamples according to their different holding periods. We find that both art returns and return volatilities increase with the investment horizons, but short-horizon returns hardly comove with the medium- and long-horizon returns. Through the return factors analysis, we show that short-horizon art investors focus on arbitrage. Their returns increase with arbitrage across auction houses and locations but decrease with the choice of masterpieces. On the contrary, long-horizon art investors focus on value. They favor masterpieces as well as ancient artworks and abstain from venue arbitrage.
Z11|¿Dinero o trascendencia? La frivolidad del arte durante el Rococó|Background. During the 18th century, a distinctive art style emerged, the Rococo, expression of frivolity and connoisseur taste, where little advances were made in the visual realm. The main objective of this paper is to present a theoretical model that relates royal patronage with artist’s creativity. Methods. This paper presents a theoretical model on the interaction between artists and gallerists of the 18th century, and it allows to study the optimal level of creativity applied by artists to their works. Results. The model predicts a positive relationship between royal patronage and creativity. Conclusions. The death of King Louis XIV and the consequent reduction in royal patronage could explain the decline, documented by art historians, in the level of complexity of art works produced during the Rococo period.// Antecedentes. Durante el siglo XVIII surgió un estilo distintivo de arte, el Rococó, expresión de frivolidad y juicio “conocedor”, donde hubo pocos avances en materia visual. El principal objetivo de este trabajo es establecer un modelo teórico que relacione la caída en el mecenazgo real para las artes con una disminución en la creatividad impregnada a las obras. Métodos. Se presenta un modelo teórico sobre la interacción entre artistas plásticos y galeristas del siglo XVIII, el cual permite estudiar el nivel de creatividad óptimo que los artistas impregnaban a sus obras de arte. Resultado. El modelo predice una relación positiva entre patronazgo real y nivel de creatividad. Conclusiones. La muerte del Rey Luis XIV y la consecuente reducción en el mecenazgo real podrían explicar la caída, documentada por los historiadores del arte, en el nivel de complejidad de las obras producidas durante el periodo Rococó.

Z11|Regression Tree Model for Analysis of Demand with Heterogeneity and Censorship|In this research we analyze new approach for prediction of demand. In the studied market of performing arts the observed demand is limited by capacity of the house. Then one needs to account for demand censorhip to obtain unbiased estimates of demand funnction parameters. The presence of consumer segments with dierent purposes of going to the theatre and willingness-to-pay for performance and ticket characteristics causes a heterogeneity in theatre demand. We propose an estimator for prediction of demand that accounts for both demand censorhip and preferences heterogeneity. The estimator is based on the idea of classiffication and regression trees and bagging prediction aggregation extended for prediction of censored data. Our algorithm predicts and combines predictions for both discrete and continuous parts of censored data.We show that our estimator performs better in terms of prediction accuracy compared with estimators which accounts either for censorship, or heterogeneity only. The proposed approach is helpful for finding product segments and optimal price setting.
Z11|Couples’ arts participation: assessing individual and joint time use|Abstract In this paper, we analyse the joint and individual time that Italian couples allocate to the different arts activities and arts practices. The Time Use Survey of Italian households (ISTAT 2002–2003) is used for the first time for this purpose. Despite an unbalanced gender division of paid and unpaid work in this country, women are shown to have a greater predisposition towards engaging in the arts. Altogether, Italian couples spend half of their arts time together. After we apply a Heckman’s selection model, results show the overall positive effects of age, education, individual and couple’s well-being and weekend participation, and the negative effects of children and residence in southern regions. Yet we demonstrate that the likelihood to participate in the arts and the amount of time allocated to them are determined by different factors. In particular, we highlight some differences and complementarities in partners’ personal and mutual influence and respective roles within the couple and the household.

Z11|Transformations of the Art Market in the World – Quantitative Approach|The dynamics of the art market is usually presented using price perspective, price indexes for the market and financial returns. In this paper the value and volume approach is proposed, that haven’t been considered in aggregative way for a longer period of time in the literature. The presentation of changes taking place in the global art market in the period 2002-2015 is the aim of the paper. The results of dynamic analysis of the art market have been presented, including the two approaches: value and volume of transactions. The impact of the global crisis on the art market has been considered. In order to present the changes on the global art market statistical indexes of dynamics (single base and chain indexes) have been used. Moreover the trend analyses have also been conducted for the value and volume of transactions on the art market. The sources of data on the global art market have come from Artprice, ArtTactic, TEFAF (The European Fine Art Foundation). In the analyzed period 2002-2015 the changes of sales on the global art market had in general increasing tendency. The value and volume of sales have reached their tops in 2007 and 2014. The art market has been touched considerably by economic recession in 2009, but in the next year it has already staged a recovery. The trend analyses have allowed describing the changes on the market by means of mathematical functions. The analyses have allowed identifying the countries with the largest share in the global art market. A particular attention has been paid to the existence of triad on the art market, including the countries of Europe, USA and China. It is noteworthy that Europe and USA have dynamically lost their market share in favor of China.
Z11|How free admittance affects charged visits to museums: an analysis of the Italian case|This study evaluates the effects of free visits to museums on charged visits. We take the Italian State museums and monuments as the case study, and we consider monthly data, aggregate at the national level, from January 1996 to December 2015. Within a multivariate analysis, which takes into account the seasonal structure of data, we document a positive influence of the number of free visits to museums and monuments on the subsequent charged visits. We also analyse the effect of a recent policy change (July 2014), consisting of an extension of free admittance. We show that the new rule has entailed an increase in both free and charged visits, as well as a stronger link between the patterns of free and charged visits. Our results can be informative in the ever-green debate on the museum attendance and its relations with individual choices and public policies regarding cultural consumption.
Z11|Can Emerging Markets Tilt Global Product Design? Impacts of Chinese Colorism on Hollywood Castings|In various cultural and behavioral respects, emerging market consumers differ significantly from their counterparts of developed markets. They may thus derive consumption utility from different aspects of product meaning and functionality. Based on this premise, we investigate whether the economic rise of emerging markets may have begun to impact the typical “one-size-fits-all” design of many international product categories. Focusing on Hollywood films, and exploiting a recent relaxation of China’s foreign film importation policy, we provide evidence suggesting that these impacts may exist and be non-negligible. In particular, we show that the Chinese society’s aesthetic preference for lighter skin can be linked to the more frequent casting of pale-skinned stars in films targeting the Chinese market. Implications for the design of international products are drawn.
Z11|Male victimization of women Covered in Society’s Expectation in Razia Sultana Khan’s Seduction: The Perspective of Seven Building Tasks of Language|Living in the society’s expectation is like we are forced to do what they want us to do and it is in the circle of hell. At one time, we need society as the means to communicate and be a natural human being. At the other hands, its culture and custom destroy ourselves especially those who have sexist culture and custom. This Bangladesh short story titled Seduction is one of the representatives of society that has sexist culture. It tells about a young girl who is forced to marry at the young age and becomes the object of her husband’s sexual trinket. What the writer wants to emphasize is the way the author named Razia Sultana Khan describe the treatment and the culture through Paul Gee’s seven language blocks’ perspective. The result of the discussion is that this short story, indeed, contains some of the seven building blocks that are significance, activities, identities, relationships, politics, connections and sign systems and knowledge.
Z11|Cultural and economic value: A (p)review|The concept of value in cultural economics has been one of the main topic of study in the last years, focusing on the distinction between economic and cultural value and on how these two values interact one with the other. However, a review of these studies lacks in literature, together with a scheme which represents the relationships between the cultural good's and the artistâ€™s characteristics: this is what we propose in our paper, presenting a review of the cultural economics literature and then representing the above-mentioned relationships, as a preview of what we think could be the direction of the analysis of this issue.
Z11|Private pricing in the art market|This note investigates price-formation mechanisms at work in the private art market. An analysis is provided on pricing of new artwork for the first sale. In a model with five different types of agents using a bargaining game approach, the artist's preferred market channel is identified. The bargaining power of each agent emerges as the key element. This setting is also an ideal framework to test public interventions to support one or more agents and channels in the art market, such as Artist Re-sale Rights.
Z11|Analysis of the Bhakti Poetry Movement in India with Special Reference to Mirabai and her poems|The Bhakti movement refers to the theistic devotional trend that emerged in medieval Hinduism. It originated in the seventh-century Tamil south India, and spread northwards. The Bhakti movement regionally developed around different gods and goddesses, such as Vishnu, Shiva. The movement has traditionally been considered as an influential social reformation in Hinduism, and provided an individual-focused alternative path to spirituality regardless of one's caste of birth or gender.This paper aims to provide a brief understanding of the Bhakti movement which spread in early India and the Indian literature which sprang out of it. The focus of the paper is to identity the features of Bhakti poetry and the relevance of the ideas in the contemporary world. The paper proposes to focus in particular on Saint Mirabai- one of the well known women poets of the Bhakti movement.Born in Rajasthan and married to Rana Bhojraj but as a young girl Mirabai took the idol of Lord Krishna (Hindu God) as her husband incarnate. Mirabai?s entire life was devoted to Krishna. Despite the discontentment from her in-laws, Mirabai continued to sing, dance and immerse herself in the devotion of Lord Krishna.The idea of bhakti is often looked at as a mere devotion to God. Its value is often limited to that being religious. This paper aims to expand the horizon and look deeper into the movement and what it stood for with religion not at the center of it. This paper analyses Mirabai?s role as a strong woman in the early India dominated by patriarchy and caste-ism and looks at Mirabai?s poetic themes as philosophies which can be adapted by the contemporary world. The paper does not intend to change or propagate any religious ideas as the focus is the attitude, the mentality and the courage which one can infer. The paper proposes to explore religion and God as a concept which is personal and may be interpreted individually. These two terms can be replaced with anything that is deeply personal and carry immense value for any individual. Lord Krishna was a concept or a belief and the purpose of Mira?s life. For a modern day individual Krishna can stand for something else- one?s belief ,a commercial idea, a philosophy,anything that is intuitive and different from that which is taught- this is the undercurrent of this paper.
Z11|Understanding The Work of Aesthetics in Modern Life|NeoMarxists scholars of education writing on urban life have tended to place aesthetics on the boundaries of critical practices, treating aesthetics as a surplus set of practices that could only be made fully usefully relevant when added on to a more concentrated attention to economy and politics. The main claim I want to make in this presentation is that aesthetic practices now underwrite the fibre of everyday modern life. As Arjun Appadurai usefully argues in Modernity at Large and History as Cultural Fact aesthetics are no longer to be simply understood as the practices of the artist, a maverick citizen creating images about the past, present and the future of human existence. But aesthetics are linked to the work of imagination of ordinary people and connected even more earnestly to the work of capitalism and its reorganization on a global scale. Contrary to the neoMarxist tradition, aesthetic practices are at the epicenter of lived experience and the commodified and institutional practices of modern societies. These practices, as CLR James allerted us to in American Civilization, constitute a great window on contemporary life revealing central contradictions, tensions and discontinuities. This, after all, was the burden of the Latin American and Caribbean Writers Forum of Intellectual and Cultural workers (George Lamming, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and others) who had publicly opposed the Reagan government invasion of Grenada in 1983. They insisted, as did Arnaldo Roche-Rabel, that aesthetics were imbricated in economy and politics?that artistic militancy is critical to production of democracy. The work of aesthetics is crucial to any formula for democratic transformation. In this presentation, I would like to call attention to the following issues. First, the entanglement of the diffusion of modernization to the third world in aesthetics. Second, I want to point as well to the deepening role of aesthetics in the organization capitalism in the new millenium in which we live. Third, I will discuss briefly the crisis of language that the aestheticization of everyday life has imposed/precipitated in neoMarxist efforts to grasp the central dynamics of comtemporary society. The latter has led to a depreciation of the value and insightfulness of neoMarxist analysis in our time?old metaphors associated with the class, economy, state (?production,? ?reproduction,? ?resistance,? ?the labor/capital? contradiction) are all worn down by the transformations of the past decades in which the saturation of economic and political practices in aesthetic mediations has proceeded full scale.
Z11|Potterian Economics|Recent studies in psychology and neuroscience find that fictional works exert strong influence on readers and shape their opinions and worldviews. We study the Potterian economy, which we compare to economic models, to assess how Harry Potter books affect economic literacy. We find that some principles of Potterian economics are consistent with economists’ models. Many others, however, are distorted and contain numerous inaccuracies, which contradict professional economists’ views and insights, and contribute to the general public’s biases, ignorance, and lack of understanding of economics.
Z11|Art as a Wartime Investment: Conspicuous Consumption and Discretion|During World War II, artworks significantly outperformed all alternative investments in Occupied France. With the surge in demand for portable and easyâ€ toâ€ hide (discreet) assets such as artworks and collectible stamps, prices boomed. This suggests that discreet assets may be viewed as cryptoâ€ currencies, demand for which varies depending on the environment and the need to hide value. Regarding art market valuation, this article argues that while some economic actors derive significant utility from conspicuous consumption, others value the discretion offered by artworks. Motives for purchasing art may thus vary over time.
Z11|Charity and public libraries: Does government funding crowd out donations?|Abstract This paper analyzes the determinants of donations to public libraries testing the following hypothesis: Is there a crowd out effect from government funding of public libraries? I look at novel data, the Public Library Survey, and use an unbalanced panel of public libraries across the USA from 2000 to 2013. The results suggest a crowd in effect with an inverted U shape in all levels of government. Local government is associated with 4–6 cents increase in donations, state government with 20–23 cents increase, and federal government with 75 cents to 1 dollar and 33 cents.
Z11|How Much Does Talent Matter? Evidences From The Brazilian Formal Cultural Industry|The goal of this paper is to evaluate how much does talent â€“ the individual non-observed characteristics â€“ matter to explain the wage differences between workers from the cultural industry and workers from other formal industries in Brazil. To do so we use the data from 2003 to 2008 of the Rais-Migra â€“ MTE, which is a true panel of formal workers from Brazil, and use fixed effects estimators to capture the talent measure and the Blinder (1973) and Oaxaca (1973) decomposition to seek for evidences of wage difference. The results imply that the talent is important in the determination of wages especially when considering formal workers in the cultural activities, occupations and workers in both cultural activities and occupation. The Oaxaca decomposition provides evidence that when considering talent, each of the groups paid their workers more per se, proving that not only the talent matter, but also that the formal cultural environment in Brazil positively discriminates their workers.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Z11|Zwischen den Welten: Hybride Arbeitsverhaeltnisse in den Kulturberufen (Between worlds: Hybrid employment in the cultural industries)|Der vorliegende Beitrag untersucht Arbeitsverhaeltnisse der Kultur- und Kreativberufe. Es gibt einige empirische Anhaltspunkte, dass sich hier eine neue Stufe der Flexibilisierung von Arbeit vollzieht, die als Erwerbshybridisierung zu beschreiben ist. Die Frage ist, unter welchen beschaeftigungs- und arbeitspolitischen Bedingungen und in welchen empirischen Formen sie auftritt sowie welche Arbeitswirklichkeiten sich damit verbinden. Argumentiert wird, dass die Aufteilung von Erwerbsformen nach sozialversicherungspflichtig versus selbstaendig nur mehr zu kurz greift und dass sich in den Kulturberufen hybride Arbeitsverhaeltnisse entwickeln, die sich als Grenzgaenge zwischen Erwerbsformen und Arbeitsverhaeltnissen manifestieren. Exemplarisch diskutiert wird dieses Problem am Beispiel der Designbranche. Empirische Basis ist eine umfassende, qualitative Studie ueber kuenstlerisch-kreative Arbeit im arbeitsgesellschaftlichen Strukturwandel, die eine Feldstudie von zwei Feldern der Designbranche umfasst: Kommunikations- und Modedesign. Deutlich wird an diesem Beispiel, dass sich das Phaenomen der Erwerbshybridisierung korrespondierend mit der institutionellen Umwelt ausbildet, dass es daher zu strukturell differenzierten Grenzgaengen kommt und dass damit Herausforderungen fuer die Interessenpolitik im Kulturbereich verbunden sind. (This article examines labour relations in the creative industries. There is some empirical evidence to suggest that a new level of work flexibility is emerging in the creative industries, which can be described as employment hybridisation. The question is which labour conditions and industrial relations lead to hybrid employment patterns and which work realities are connected with them. I will argue that in the cultural industries hybrid employment patterns evolve that occur as boundaries between self-employment and employed working conditions. This argument is illustrated with examples from the design industry. The empirical basis is a comprehensive, qualitative study of artistic and creative work, including a field study of two fields in the design industry: communications and fashion design. It is clear from this example that the phenomenon of employment hybridisation corresponds with the institutional environment. Thus, there are structurally differentiated border crossings. Finally, this poses a challenge for industrial relations in the cultural sector.)
Z11|Theoretical and Methodological Research Basis of Management of Cultural Facilities<BR>[Теоретико-Методологические Основы Исследования Процессов Управления Объектами Культуры]|The article analyzes the theoretical basis and specified methodological approach to the research of cultural objects to optimize its financing arrangements. It presented 3 methodologically different approaches to the research of the culture economy: from the point of the principles of methodological individualism, methodological principles of holism and sociodynamics theory. In each approaches the author analyzes the basic tendencies of development of the sphere of culture, chooses the priority sources of this sector`s financing and focuses on specific groups of cultural goods consumers making funding decisions sphere of culture. It notes the existence of the mutation`s phenomenon of public support for culture institutions in the private Institute of budgetary funds charity. It provides 3 approaches to the financing of the cultural sphere. As part of the methodological individualism financing mass culture at the cost of cultural goods consumers and elite culture at the expense of charity. Based on the position of methodological holism cultural sphere financed solely by the state. In the frame of the theory sociodynamics culture financing is part of a public-private partnership. At the same time the state must bear the costs of preservation and development of cultural goods and the private sector — the costs of public cultural services. The author concludes that the scientific basis for the level of spending on culture, that should identify the factors which will determine the reduction or increase of these costs. It proposes an algorithm research culture facility management processes to solve this problem. The construction of this algorithm is based on the approach to cultural facilities as one of the specific types of goods — ward goods. From the specificities and their characteristic “price illness” it grounds institutional changes which aims to creating a mechanism of public-private partnership in the sphere of cultural objects financing through endowment funds and other types of partnerships. This institution should ensure the growth of costs on culture by attracting funds from patrons.
Z11|Research Parasites Are Beneficial for the Organism as a Whole: Competition between Researchers Creates a Symbiotic Relationship|"In the New England Journal of Medicine, Longo and Drazen critically assessed the concept of data sharing. Their main concern is that a ""new class of research person will emerge"" that uses data, which were gathered by other researchers, for their own original research questions. The authors referred to this class of researcher as ""research parasites"". Longo and Drazen are right when they note that scientific data sharing deserves more recognition. However, they indicate that the most adequate form of recognition for data sharing is coauthorship. They suggest to work ""symbiotically, rather than parasitically, with the investigators holding the data, moving the field forward in a way that neither group could have done on its own."" Although this is true in particular cases, co-authorship as the sole instrument of credit will unnecessarily restrict the potential of data sharing. More suitable instruments for giving credit where credit is due would be a much greater appreciation of data sharing by research communities by introducing citations of data sets, bestowing awards for good datasets, and considering data ""production"" when assessing scientists' career prospects, funding applications, and research outputs."
Z11|Art as an investment in Poland - the first 20 years after the collapse of the central planning economy|The article aims at answering the following research question: is the Polish art market mature enough to look at art investment as an important element of portfolio diversification? To provide an answer, the Authors analyzed auctions in Poland from the period 1991-2010, which were published by Art&Business magazine. The number of the analyzed records amounted to 28951. The conclusions may be valuable for researchers specializing in art economics, investors dealing with wealth transfer, financial advisors offering financial products as well as for policy makers responsible for providing institutional infrastructure essential for development of the Polish art market.
Z11|Towards data oriented analysis of the art market: survey and outlook|Due to the constantly growing interest in alternati ve investments, the art market has become the subject of numerous studies. By publishing sales data, many services and aucti on houses provide a foundati on for further research on the latest trends. Determining the defi niti on of the arti sti c value or formalisati on of appraisal may be considered quite complex. Stati sti cal analysis, econometric methods or data mining techniques could pave the way towards bett er understanding of the mechanisms occurring on the art market. The goal of this paper is to identi fy, describe and compare soluti ons (and related challenges) that help to analyse, make decisions and defi ne state of the art in the context of the intersecti on of econometrics on art markets and computer science. This work is also a starti ng point for further research.
Z11|When Tom Cruise said: ?You complete me!?|The researcher collates a set of proposal lines from mainstream Hollywood movies, and through the symbolic lens, attempts to understand the profit that such artistic endeavors contribute, through the political unconscious of the consumer, to the furtherance of the economic system they are a product of. The correlation of Modern Art, Branding, Maslow?s Hierarchy and Feminism with the popular proposals reveals the strategic positioning of self-actualization as a valid economic capital. Eventually the researcher contends that self-actualization is nothing but sublime self-esteem. In the process she also derives a new communication technique that is a powerful tool for persuasive communication.
Z11|Art for A New Consciousness, Art for A New Humanity: An Empirical Investigation of Aesthetic Effect of Kamran Khavarani?s Paintings|Our hypothesis is that Khavarani?s painting style, Abstract Romanticism, combines artistic elements that impart positive effect on viewers? psyche. Our data encompass survey of 318 viewers? responses, recorded in six Likert scales. We used Random Group Design to administer and organize the data. Our estimation results, using the Friedman, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests, produced ?2 values, which confirm our hypothesis with 95-100% confidence. We conclude that Khavarani?s paintings impart positive effect on viewers? psyche. In a future study, we?ll report that such effect is independent of viewer?s age, gender, and their base mood. We invoke Vartanian and Skov (2014): When our subjects viewed Khavarani?s paintings, they ?maximized the utility of the moment? and ?disengaged? from their external world. We recognize that as experiencing meditative joy.
Z11|Comparison of Parametric and Nonparametric Modeling: Aesthetic Effect of Kamran Khavarani?s Paintings|This research is an extension of Amirmostofian, Mozayeni (2016). Our hypothesis is that Khavarani?s painting style, Abstract Romanticism, combines artistic elements that impart positive effect on viewers? psyche. Our data encompass 320 surveys. Previously, we reported three nonparametric tests results, and concluded that Khavarani?s paintings have positive effects on viewers? psyche. In this research we examine new results for six Multivariate General Linear Model (MGLM) estimations for six Khavarani?s groups. With their R2, 0.04-021, and negligible and insignificant coefficients for variables Age, Gender, and the base mood, we propose that Khavarani?s paintings influence the subjects? Mood After, the dependent variable in our model. We invoke Vartanian and Skov (2014), and recognize that subjects in the six groups experienced a meditative joy.
Z11|Consumer choice of theatrical productions: a combined revealed preference–stated preference approach|Abstract This paper investigates the value of attributes of theatrical productions using a joint revealed preference–stated preference (RP–SP) method. SP models have advantages over RP models, requiring less data and avoiding multicollinearity problems which often confound RP analysis. However, the advantage to joint RP–SP model is that theatre-goers choices are anchored to real behaviour. The RP–SP model reveals the most important determinant of choice and willingness to pay (WTP) to be the type of show. The Royal Shakespeare Company strongly influenced choice and WTP. Reviews of productions by theatre critics influenced choice. A mixed logit model revealed considerable heterogeneity in theatre-goer tastes for types of show and variation in taste for the attributes of shows by socioeconomic and demographic profile of theatre-goers.
Z11|The late 1970s bubble in Dutch collectible postage stamps|Abstract Collectible postage stamp prices in the Netherlands witnessed a bubble in the late 1970s, while prices rapidly floored in the mid-1980s. We analyze 500 individual stamps prices (instead of a single index) to examine whether the bubble could somehow have been predicted and whether there were early warning signals. Also, we study whether the characteristics of these stamps mediated the bubble and the price landing afterward. Scarcity and initial price levels appear to have predictive value in various dimensions. Implications for recognizing bubbles in other asset prices are discussed.
Z11|Entry of painters in the Amsterdam market of the Golden Age|Abstract We analyze the evolution of the entry of painters and price of paintings in the XVII century Amsterdam art market. In line with evolutionary theory, demand-driven entry in the market was first associated with product innovations and a rapid increase in the number of painters. After reaching a peak, the number of painters started to decrease in parallel with a price decline and the introduction of process innovations. To test for the role of profitability in the art market as a determinant of endogenous entry of painters, we build a price index for the representative painting inventoried in Dutch houses. This is based on hedonic regressions controlling for characteristics of the paintings (size, genre, placement in the house), the owners (job, religion, value of the collection, size of the house) and the painters. After a peak at the beginning of the century, the real price of paintings decreased until the end of the century. We provide anecdotal evidence for which high initial prices attracted entry of innovators, and econometric evidence on the causal relation between price movements and entry.
Z11|Effect of consuming imported cultural goods on trading partners’ tolerance toward immigrants: the case of Japanese anime in Korea|Abstract The consumption of imported goods is thought to influence consumers’ views and attitudes toward export countries. It is important to consider this issue, especially when there is political tension and conflict between countries. Because of their historical background, political conflict exists between Korea and Japan. This paper examines the effect of viewing Japanese anime (animation) on the attitudes of Koreans toward Japanese living in Korea. The major findings of the study show that the more frequently adult Koreans view Japanese anime, the more likely they are to accept Japanese as workplace colleagues and neighbors after controlling for endogeneity bias using instrumental variables. The findings of this paper imply that via the consumption of imported cultural goods, people are exposed to positive traits of the trading partner, and thus consumers have a stronger affinity with the export country. From this, we derive the policy implication that promoting the trade of modern cultural goods is effective in increasing mutual understanding between trading partners, thereby reducing political tension between them.
Z11|Modelling South African Art Prices: An analysis of post-2000 price behaviour|The South African art market has grown markedly over the last two decades, and yet there is currently very little research on this market. This paper aims to make three contributions to the literature. The first is to estimate new quality-adjusted price indices for South African art since the turn of the millennium. The paper estimates central tendency indices, as a baseline for comparisons, as well as various hedonic indices that control for quality-mix or compositional changes over time. The second contribution is to estimate alternative art price indices by applying a simple hybrid repeat sales method to art prices. This approach addresses the problem of lack of repeat sales observations in the data and to some extent the potential omitted variable bias inherent in the hedonic method. This has not been attempted for art prices in any country. The hedonic and hybrid repeat sales indices seem to point to the same general trend in South African art prices. According to these measures, the South African art market experienced a huge price increase in the run-up to the Great Recession. The third contribution of the paper is to study the art price indices for evidence of a bubble in the South African art market over the period. The hedonic and hybrid repeat sales indices seem to point to consistent evidence of mildly explosive price behaviour in the run-up to the Great Recession.
Z11|Change in access after digitization: Ethnographic collections in Wikipedia|The raison dâ€™Ãªtre of memory institutions revolves around collecting, preserving and giving access to heritage collections. Increasingly, access takes place in social networked markets characterized by communities of users that serve to select and rank content to facilitate reuse. Publication of heritage in such digital medium transforms patterns of consumption. We performed a quantitative analysis on the access to a museum collection and compared results before and after publication on Wikimedia. Analysis of the difference in access showed two main results: first, access to collections increased substantially online. From a selection of the most viewed objects, access grew from an average of 156,000 onsite visitors per year (or 15.5 million in a century) to over 1.5 million views online per year (or 7.9 million in five years). Second, we find a long tail in both mediums, where 8% of objects were exhibited onsite and 11% of available objects online were used in Wikipedia articles (representing 1% of the total collection). We further document differences in consumer preference for type of object, favouring 3D onsite and 2D online, as well as topic and language preference, favouring Wikipedia articles about geography and in English. Online publication is hence an important complement to onsite exhibitions to increase access to collections. Results shed light on online consumption of heritage content by consumers who may not necessarily visit heritage sites.
Z11|Dance Participation and Attendance in Denmark|Dancing may be one of the most competitive professions available career-wise. The lack of job opportunities and the competitiveness, the inherent expense in costumes and training and the high risk of injuries mean that only few dancers are able to make it their profession. However, dancing is an activity that comes with positive externalities, as various socio-economic benefits are experienced by those who practice dance non-professionally. Despite the importance of dancing, very little is known with respect to the profiles of dancers. This chapter, by availing of an information database on cultural preferences and habits in Denmark for 2004, illustrates the profiles of dancers and dance audiences and so deepens the current knowledge on the functioning of the dance market. We show that there exists a very strong positive correlation between cultural participation and the well-being of a society. These links are carefully described in the chapter.
Z11|Experience and Brokerage in Asset Markets: Evidence from Art Auctions|Focusing on the art market, where auction houses act as brokers between art sellers and buyers, we investigate whether more experienced brokers achieve better performance as information providers and matchmakers. We find that houses with artist‐specific experience are more likely to achieve a sale and provide more precise pre‐sale estimates. These findings suggest that experience in a specific market segment plays an important role for brokers to reduce illiquidity and opacity in markets with asymmetric information. Our analysis also shows that specific experience matters above and beyond other house‐specific factors, including reputation and market power.
Z11|What editors talk about when they talk about editors: Resisting institutional change through discourse in Italian literary field|How do resisters and losers of a process of institutional change use discourse to define their identity and position themselves in the new institutional arrangements? After a process of institutional change, received literature suggests that losers tend to re-define themselves in relation to the new institutional arrangement: in this case we see their discourse colonized by a new dominant one. We analyse Italian literary field, that experienced a transformation toward a market oriented institutional logic, that is already finished. Here editors, that are professional that select new manuscripts to be published and edit texts before publishing, far from incorporating market discourse, leverage their symbolic role to protect their niche. We find that their discourse highlights their literary peculiarities: we suggest that they maintain an idiosyncratic discourse, focused on aesthetic and literary topics, in order to define their identity and role and protect their position. Publishers' dimensions accounts for different discourses, with editors of medium sized publishers more prone to refer to aesthetic issues, editors working for big ones that refer to personal expertise, whereas small publishersÕ editors are the only ones explicitly referring to market.
Z11|The Taxing Deed of Globalization|This paper examines the effects of globalization on the distribution of worker-specific labor taxes using a unique set of tax calculators. We find a differential effect of higher trade and factor mobility on relative tax burdens in 1980–1993 versus 1994–2007 in the OECD. Prior to 1994, greater openness meant that higher income earners were taxed progressively more. However, after 1994, we document a globalization-induced rise in the labor income tax burden of the middle class, while the top 1 percent of workers and employees faced a reduction in their tax burden of 0.59–1.45 percentage points.
Z11|Coordination and the fight against tax havens|The success or failure of the fight against tax havens is the outcome of a many player coordination game between a tax haven and its potential investors. Key determinants are the costly international pressure and the size of the haven country's revenue pool. The latter is determined endogenously by the decisions of many individual investors. Our analysis suggests a non-standard market model that explains why haven countries would ever comply with international standards of transparency despite the large empirically observable returns in the tax haven business. It also alludes to why service fees in tax havens can be positive despite a competitive financial market with multiple tax havens. Furthermore, we identify a trade-off between the fight against tax havens and high tax rates. Finally, low fines for disclosed offshore tax evasion, e.g. in special programs for tax evaders who voluntarily report their offshore wealth, strengthen haven countries against international pressure.

Z11|Sovereign and private default risks over the business cycle|Sovereign debt crises are often accompanied by deep recessions with sharp declines in external credit to the private sector. In a sample of emerging economies we find that both, sovereign and private risk premia are countercyclical. This paper presents a model of a small open economy that accounts for these empirical regularities. It includes private firms which finance a fraction of imports by external debt and are subject to idiosyncratic and aggregate productivity risk, and a government which borrows internationally and taxes firms to finance public expenditures. The model gives rise to endogenous private and sovereign credit spreads and a dynamic feedback mechanism between sovereign and private default risks through the endogenous response of fiscal policy to adverse productivity shocks.
Z11|No Price Like Home: Global House Prices, 1870-2012|How have house prices evolved over the long run? This paper presents annual house prices for 14 advanced economies since 1870. We show that real house prices stayed constant from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, but rose strongly and with substantial cross-country variation in the second half of the twentieth century. Land prices, not replacement costs, are the key to understanding the trajectory of house prices. Rising land prices explain about 80 percent of the global house price boom that has taken place since World War II. Our findings have implications for the evolution of wealth-to-income ratios, the growth effects of agglomeration, and the price elasticity of housing supply.
Z11|Precautionary Savings, Illiquid Assets, and the Aggregate Consequences of Shocks to Household Income Risk|Households face large income uncertainty that varies substantially over the business cycle. We examine the macroeconomic consequences of these variations in a model with incomplete markets, liquid and illiquid assets, and a nominal rigidity. Heightened uncertainty depresses aggregate demand as households respond by hoarding liquid “paper” assets for precautionary motives, thereby reducing both illiquid physical investment and consumption demand. We document the empirical response of portfolio liquidity and aggregate activity to surprise changes in idiosyncratic income uncertainty and find both to be quantitatively in line with our model. The welfare consequences of uncertainty shocks and of the policy response thereto depend crucially on a household's asset position.
Z11|Russian Art Market: a View from the Inside|Far-seeing specialists have been long defining the investments into works of art as “shelter investments” for their notably monetary stability throughout political conflicts, economic crises and other situations which any country will find critical. Russian art has provided yet another opportunity to prove this axiom. In spite of the stringency of the international sanctions, rapid oil prices downturn and the instability of the Russian ruble, it was the Russian art which demonstrated, according to New York Times, “a surprising boom”. Sotheby’s and Christie’s have set new Russian records that granted financial hope to many interested players from the external side of the Russian art market. Thus the question arises: how synchronized is the development of the home market with the auction success of the Russian art? The present research is an attempt to give a structured answer to the above question.

Este trabajo analiza los determinantes de la participación en espectáculos de artes escénicas en Medellín, Colombia, a través de la estimación de modelos de elección discreta para la participación y la frecuencia de participación, utilizando los micro datos de la Encuesta de Calidad de Vida de Medellín para el año 2014. Los resultados indican que el nivel de educación y las restricciones de tiempo son los principales determinantes de la asistencia a estos eventos.
Z11|Intergenerational Transmission of Musical Education|There is an extensive literature documenting the fact that there is a positive correlation between parental education and that of their children. While most research has focused on the transmission of formal schooling, there are other aspects of education that may be considered. For instance, music training has been shown to have a positive correlation with other cognitive abilities, such as mathematics and linguistics. In this paper, we analyze the intergenerational transmission of musical education. We have collected data on musical, general arts and formal education on a representative sample of Asturias, a Northern Spanish region. We find that the intergenerational link goes from both parents to their children. Furthermore, mothersâ€™ musical training has a greater impact on males than that of the fathersâ€™. On the contrary, in the case of females, only the father-child link is significant.
Z11|Visitor Attitudes to Deaccessioning in Italian Public Museums: An Econometric Analysis|Deaccessioning is a largely controversial practice involving the sale or disposal of objects from a museumâ€™s collection. Although it has received increasing attention in the past few decades as a solution to museumsâ€™ financial concerns, its implications have rarely been researched in academia which is mainly due to the â€˜barely legalâ€™ status of deaccessioning as a management practice. Previous research suggests that visitorsâ€™ responses may vary depending on some factors, such as the destination of income generated by deaccessioning operations and the publicâ€™s perception of the museum collection as a public good. We address this question by analysing visitorsâ€™ responses in Italian public museums. Specifically, we hypothesize that stronger public cultural identity of the collection and the purpose of the income generated by deaccessioning strongly affect the attitudes to deaccessioning. Using structural equation modelling, we estimate several important determinants of visitorsâ€™ responses. We also show that attitudes to deaccessioning do not influence the decision to visit a museum. The findings of the article have implications for museum governance and particularly for the knowledge about deaccessioning in cultural economics and museum management.
Z11|Demand for Performing Arts: The Effect of Unobserved Quality on Price Elasticity|This paper studies behavior patterns among theater attendees in the process of ticket purchasing. Since the theater attempts to balance between a high occupancy and affordable prices, the purpose of the study is to reveal the effects of changes in prices on attendance. This project is conducted conjointly with the Perm Tchaikovsky Opera and Ballet Theater. Data are taken from the sales information system of the theater for four seasons 2011-2012/2014-2015. The data are disaggregated to the level of the seating area and performance and consist of the attendance rate, the set of prices and the performance characteristics. The research explores the determinants of demand using a censored quantile regression which accounts for the heterogeneity of effects on different levels of attendance rates and censoring. We estimate the parameters of the demand function and show that the aggregated demand is elastic by price, at the same time the elasticity varies across different seating areas. Moreover, demand for the more popular seats and performances is less elastic
Z11|Researching song titles, product cycles and copyright in published music: problems, results and data sources|The purpose of this Working Paper is to pass on our experience of research on song titles and product cycles in UK music publishing which was intended to provide evidence of the impact of copyright in a market. The Working Paper relates to the article â€˜Economics of Music Publishing: Copyright and the Marketâ€™, published in the Journal of Cultural Economics, 2016. The context of the research was a project on copyright and business models in music publishing that was part of the AHRC funded project: the â€˜Economic Survival in a Long Established Creative Industry: Strategies, Business Models and Copyright in Music Publishingâ€™. By collecting data on the product cycles of a sample of long-lasting song titles and trying to establish changes in the product cycle as the copyright regime changed we had hoped to produce empirical evidence on the effect changes in the copyright regime, such as term extension, or to those in copyright management organisations. For a variety of reasons, this proved impossible to do (at least in the UK) and the Working Paper explains what we think were the reasons. It may also serve as a possible warning to others attempting the same thing. The paper also suggests that previous research that did not consider the ambiguities of â€˜a song titleâ€™ may be flawed.
Z11|Looking into the Profile of Music Audiences|The main aims of this chapter are to identify different groups of music consumers and to analyse the relation between the observed diversity of musical consumption and the socio-economic characteristics of the audiences. This information is essential for producersâ€™ and cultural practitionersâ€™ as well as for public agencies for the purpose of encouraging cultural consumption and the promotion of certain types of music. Using cluster analysis with the 2011 Survey on Spanish Habits and Cultural Practices (SHCP-2011), we have identified 12 distinct clusters of music listeners and obtained a detailed classification of music consumers. As expected, education and age are the main determinants of music consumption. Hence, education and childhood exposure to music could prove to be important instruments for improving music demand especially if they are focused on personal enjoyment and satisfaction rather than on the more formal aspects of music.
Z11|Being Central and Productive? Evidence from Slovenian Visual Artists in the 19th and 20th Century|Slovenian art history has received very little (if any) attention from the viewpoint of network theory although there were several examples of artists co-working or working in groups, collectives or even loosely organized clusters (groups from the impressionist Sava in 1904 to postmodern Irwin in 1984). This may be interpreted as a way to acquire better positions in the national and international art circles and on the art market. In our article we use web-based dataset of Slovenska biografija (operated by the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts), which contains data on numerous notable persons throughout Slovenian history to analyze the centrality of individual artistic figures and movements throughout Slovenian art history. We also study the influence of network centrality on cultural production controlling for endogeneity following the instrumental variable approach, proposed in the literature while using a new instrumental variable to solve the problem. Finally, we present results which show that women visual artists used their network positions more intensively than men and provide some first explanations for this observed relationship. In conclusion, we provide some reflections on the importance of these findings for further research work in the area.
Z11|Where Are the Artists? Analyzing Economies of Agglomeration in Spain|The creative economy has become the subject of increasing interest in recent years, both in the area of cultural economics as well as in economic development studies and the analysis of spatial disparities. In this regard, various studies have examined the spatial logics of cultural and creative industries, although analyses into the location and agglomeration of artists therein remain few and far between, in other words inquiry into the activities location linked to artistic creation in a purer sense. The present work thus seeks to delve into location and spatial structure of the cultural sector in a Spanish region, focusing specifically on activities more closely linked to artistic creativity, such as literary creation, performing arts, bullfighting, music, cinema, etc. The work examines the autonomous community of Castilla y LeÃ³n as an example, and posits an analysis of the spatial distribution of artists using micro-spatial disaggregation, in other words taking the network of towns as the territorial analysis unit. Spatial econometric techniques are used to identify location patterns, pinpoint territorial activity clusters and to measure agglomeration economies. A first look at the findings reveals that the cultural sector in Castilla y LeÃ³n evidences a strong trend towards concentration, with spatial distribution patterns which lead to the formation of statistically significant cultural clusters and strong spatial dependence between territories over the whole of the period analysed (2005-2013).
Z11|Fifty years of Cultural Economics. Exploring the roots in the history of economic thought|The objective of this paper is to backtrack key elements from the economic thought which limited and then allowed the approach of the economy to the analysis of cultural goods and services. The contribution of this paper is double. On the one hand, we synthesize how the modeling of consume of cultural goods was embodied to economic analysis, with this aim we use a selective revision of the literature of prestigious economists on the economic thought history. On the other hand, we describe the elements which form the basis of cultural economics as a dynamic area of specialization, which be perfectly identified and with an intellectual prestige on the economy.
Z11|Evaluating the Economic Effects of Cultural Events|The chapter describes the different techniques that may be used to measure the short-term economic fallouts of cultural events and, in particular, of music and opera festivals. It tries to distinguish failsafe methods—which are unfortunately not always easy to use—from more doubtful ones, in particular contingent valuation and interviews—which lead to exaggerated evaluations. Examples are provided in each case. We also suggest a new and inexpensive method to evaluate the relative numbers of visitors (by country of origin), which does not suffer from the overstatements provided by contingent valuation and interviews.
Z11|Four decades of the Journal of Econometrics: Coauthorship patterns and networks|This paper reviews the first forty years of the Journal of Econometrics. The focus of the paper is on collaboration patterns and the internationalization of research in econometrics. We report the most prolific authors, institutions and countries and we find that the share of collaborative articles has increased over time and that most contributions come from affiliations that are based in the USA (but decreasingly so). We also apply social network analysis and discover the most central authors, institutions and countries in the Journal of Econometrics. Moreover, we find that the coauthorship network has been increasingly integrated, exhibiting small-world properties.
Z11|Is there a bubble in the art market?|The record-breaking prices observed in the art market over the last 5years raise the question of whether it is an ongoing boom or whether we are experiencing a speculative bubble. Given the difficulty to determine the fundamental value of artworks, we apply a right-tailed unit root test with forward recursive regressions (SADF test) to detect explosive behaviors directly in the time series of six different art market segments for the period from 1970 to 2014. We identify two historical speculative bubbles and find an explosive movement in today's “Impressionist and Modern”, “Post-war and Contemporary”, “American”, and “Old Masters” fine art market segments.
Z11|On the “uniform pricing puzzle” in recorded music|This paper proposes a possible explanation for uniform pricing in the recorded music industry, based on a pooling equilibrium across different quality types. We show that an ex ante ability to invest in the probability of success – which we identify with record companies’ artists and repertoire (A&R) expenditures – makes such a pooling equilibrium more likely.
Z11|The validity of Islamic art as an investment|This paper investigates the validity of Islamic art as an investment product. We examine the current and future market potential, as well as, performing a hedonic regression analysis on London auction sales from 1998 to 2007. The main findings of the research are; Islamic art returns out performed both the equity and debt markets over the last 10 years; increases in oil prices have a positive effect on art prices, Islamic terrorist attacks on the Western World significantly reduce the value of Islamic art; and that the increase in future buyers means the Islamic art market has the potential to grow very strongly over the coming years. All these indicate the strong potential of this form of art as an investment.
Z11|How do cultural activities influence happiness? Investigating the relationship between self-reported well-being and leisure|Leisure is a human condition related to the discretionary use of time in a rewarding way that contributes to individual well-being. Individuals decide to engage on cultural activities to enjoy pleasant experiences. Cultural participation can be explained in different dimension, considering how the individual access those cultural experiences: by live attendance, by home consumption, by community practice. We find that the magnitude of the positive effect of cultural activities on the top happiness goes in this descending order: cinema going, participat- ing in cultural events,listening to music,reading books and watching TV.
Z11|Demand for performing arts: the effect of unobserved quality on price elasticity|This paper studies the behavior patterns among the theatreâ€™s attendants in the process of ticketâ€™s purchase. Since the theatre attempts to balance between the high rate of occupancy and the affordable prices for the spectator, the purpose of the study is to reveal the effects of changes in prices on attendance rate on different levels of attendance. This project is conducted conjointly with the Perm Tchaikovsky Opera and Ballet Theater. Data is taken from the sales information system of the theater for four seasons 2011-2012/2014-2015. The data is disaggregated to the level of the seating area and performance and consists of the attendance rate, the set of prices and the performance characteristics. The research explores the determinants of demand using censored quantile regression that accounts for the heterogeneity of effects on different levels of attendance rates and censoring. We have estimated the parameters of demand function and revealed that the aggregated demand is elastic by price, at the same time the elasticity varies across different seating areas. Moreover, demand for the more popular seats and performances expectedly turns out to be the less elastic.
Z11|Research parasites are beneficial for the organism as a whole: competition between researchers creates a symbiotic relationship|"In the New England Journal of Medicine, Longo and Drazen critically assessed the concept of data sharing. Their main concern is that a ""new class of research person will emerge"" that uses data, which were gathered by other researchers, for their own original research questions. The authors referred to this class of researcher as ""research parasites"". Longo and Drazen are right when they note that scientific data sharing deserves more recognition. However, they indicate that the most adequate form of recognition for data sharing is coauthorship. They suggest to work ""symbiotically, rather than parasitically, with the investigators holding the data, moving the field forward in a way that neither group could have done on its own."" Although this is true in particular cases, co-authorship as the sole instrument of credit will unnecessarily restrict the potential of data sharing. More suitable instruments for giving credit where credit is due would be a much greater appreciation of data sharing by research communities by introducing citations of data sets, bestowing awards for good datasets, and considering data ""production"" when assessing scientists' career prospects, funding applications, and research outputs.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
Z11|An economic perspective on rock concerts and climate change: Should carbon offsets compensating emissions be included in the ticket price?|Musicians, singers and bands can use their popularity to promote various causes and products, either through endorsements or more individual initiatives. Environmental activism is becoming more widespread as humans are trying to tackle and mitigate climate change. In this paper, we ask how best a band can compensate for the carbon emissions generated by fans travelling to its shows. We first report on the various “green” initiatives and practices of the music industry. We then focus on greenhouse gas emissions that result from tours and concerts since they are one of the largest environmental impacts generated by the music industry. We take the perspective of the artist or band wishing to internalize their carbon emissions and present a model of carbon offsets in the context of rock concerts, which amounts to the private provision of a public good. In our model, bands have the option to include offsets in the ticket price or to offer voluntary offsets. To illustrate our point, we present a field study conducted by a Quebec rock band at shows in Montreal and in Europe to show how the artists can reduce the environmental impact of their concert by buying carbon credits equivalent to their fans’ footprint. We show that at 1 % of the ticket price on average, the cost of carbon offsets is marginal and discuss the numerous challenges that arise for those artists wanting to engage in carbon offsetting.

Z11|Local government allocation of cultural services|Abstract In the present paper, we analyse the allocation process for cultural services in Norwegian municipalities. The cultural sector at this administrative level is decomposed into the following eight subcategories: children’s and youth activities, libraries, cinemas, museums, arts dissemination, cultural heritage, cultural schools, and other cultural services. By means of budget shares for these eight cultural services and a residual sector consisting of all other municipal services, we estimate a system of demand relations which are interdependently linked to each other by a budget restriction. Our analyses are based on data from 409 out of 429 Norwegian municipalities during the period 2002–2010. In the empirical analyses, we mainly focus on the effects of income variation for the cultural services. We estimate effects of free income, matching grants to each sector, and user fees and other sector-specific income for each sector. We also estimate crowding-out effects for the cultural sectors of demographic variables indicating higher demand for services such as education, childcare, and health services. Our results confirm previous results. There are interesting differences within the group of cultural services, and these are partly related to different levels of national standardisation and regulation among the cultural services.
Z11|Does the long tail really favor small publishers?|Abstract A growing body of literature is devoted to testing the reality of the “long-tail” phenomenon. This literature is mostly, if not exclusively, focused on the impact of Internet on the distribution of sales by product. However, the long tail also raises the issue of a possible change in the usual market structure of cultural industries: an oligopoly with a competitive fringe. To our knowledge, no paper addresses the following question: If the long-tail effect does exist, is it of more benefit to small or dominant publishers? The aim of this paper was to address this issue in the context of the French publishing industry. Our main findings are as follows: (1) the market concentration of the French book industry is lower online than offline and (2) the difference in concentration between the two channels of distribution tended to widen over the period 2004–2010. Strategies adopted by leading publishers on the Web do not allow them to maintain the market share obtained with bricks-and-mortar retailers. Furthermore, we show that the market share lost by dominant firms is captured by small publishers online and by medium-sized publishers in conventional stores.
Z11|Fairness constraints on profit-seeking: evidence from the German club concert industry|Abstract Unlike Kahneman et al. (Am Econ Rev 76(4):728–741, 1986) iconic snow shovel, live music is a performance good that fans attach a particular value to. Hence, an artist’s pricing decision might differ from standard rent-seeking behavior. In this paper, I propose a model that incorporates fairness concerns into the pricing decision for concert tickets. The hypotheses derived from this model are tested on data from the German club concert industry. The results are consistent with the model: Although (1) price dispersion is the dominant pricing strategy in the club concert industry and artists prefer to perform on a Friday or Saturday night, (2) artists do not set higher prices on the weekend. These results are consistent with fairness constraints, but are difficult to explain within a standard profit maximization framework. As a third result, (3) the data reveal that ticket prices are positively correlated with a city’s number of inhabitants .
Z11|Market Evolution, Bidding Strategies, and Survival of Art Dealers|We show the value of expertise during the evolution of a market characterized by asymmetric information. Using a unique historical data set, we show how market dynamics encourage entrants. Our results provide evidence that better informed dealers pay about 24% more for an artwork of the same quality than less informed dealers. Additionally, our results indicate that informed dealers are more likely to survive in the market. Our evidence supports the conjecture that, in common value auctions, when information asymmetries are present, dealers with better information benefit. These results have important implications for maintaining and sustaining competitive advantage.
Z11|The Analysis Of Investment Appeal Of The Art Market Objects|The article describes the approaches to assessing the investment attractiveness of the art facilities which is associated with a modified GE / McKinsey model parameter estimation and carried out using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The article illustrates a strategic positioning of the four art objects which are belonged to different areas of Russian art that differ significantly in their market strength and investment attractiveness.
Z11|Art Criticism And Analysis As Factors Affecting Artwork Pricing|This article studies influence of expert evaluation and art criticism on the way investment potential of artworks is formed. We have specifically examined how art criticism affects value of artworks and how it may influence a decision to purchase a specific piece of art.
Z11|Does it Pay to Invest in Art? A Selection-Corrected Returns Perspective|This paper shows the importance of correcting for sample selection when investing in illiquid assets that trade endogenously. Using a sample of 32,928 paintings that sold repeatedly between 1960 and 2013, we find an asymmetric V-shaped relation between sale probabilities and returns. Adjusting for the resulting selection bias reduces average annual index returns from 8.7% to 6.3%, lowers Sharpe ratios from 0.27 to 0.11, and materially impacts portfolio allocations. Investing in a broad portfolio of paintings is not attractive, but targeting specific styles or top-selling artists may add value. The methodology naturally extends to other asset classes.

Z11|Cirebon as the Silk Road: A New Approach of Heritage Tourisme and Creative Economy|The tourism industry and creative economy in Cirebon can not be separated from the historical aspect of the city's growth and development as silk lines in the spread of Islam, trade, and acculturation is very smooth so that the ethnic diversification becomes a major part in tourist activities. With a qualitative approach that emphasizes the phenomenon of ethnic Cirebon with tourist objects that vary in every corner of this city, then this paper confirms that Cirebon is a tourist destination that is unique in terms of religion, culture, history, to the creative economy, especially religious tourism that will create this city as a friendly city for tourists.
Z11|Cariere, destine și atitudini naționale romanești in Basarabia: Constantin Stere și revista Viața Romaneasca<BR>[Careers, destinies and Romanian national attitudes in Bessarabia: Constantin Stere and Romanian Life Journal]|Prezenta cercetare istorică, intitulată Cariere, destine și atitudini naționale românești în Basarabia: Constantin Stere și Revista Viața Românească, îşi propune evocarea anumitor aspecte biografice şi publicistice din activitatea scriitorului, publicistului şi omului politic Constantin Stere. Acest demers biografico-intelectual şi reconstituire diacronică a personalităţii basarabeanului Constantin Stere are ca obiectiv să readucă în vizorul istoriografiei actuale o expunere a vieţii lui Constantin Stere. Autorul a împărţit acest articol în mai multe etape secvenţiale: 1) Primii ani; 2) Liceul şi primele iniţiative politice; 3) Perioada detenţiei şi a deportărilor; 4) Întoarcerea din exil şi studiile universitare; 5) Din activitatea publicistică şi politică; 6) Ultimii ani. Departe de a avea pretenţii de exhaustivitate, prezentul demers istoric doreşte să aducă pe baza bibliografiei de specialitate momente importante din viaţa lui Constantin Stere, elementul de noutate al studiului constând în această revalorificare istorică şi istoriografică a importanţei lui Constantin Stere, propunând o nouă abordare şi perspectivă istorică asupra acestui subiect. În reconfigurarea aspectelor metodologice și de cercetare academică, un rol important l-a avut revista Viața Românească înființată la Iași în anul 1906. Prin relevarea aspectelor culturale și diseminarea sustenabilității economice din paginile revistei ieșene, se poate observa discrepanța acerbă între latura culturală a presei românești, privită sub aspectul asumării mișcării naționale de la începutul secolului al XX-lea, în ipostază antitetică cu modalitatea sub raportul căreia se face azi presă. Astăzi asistăm la obsolescența ziarului tipărit și transpunerea acestuia în lumea virtuală, pe internet. Stadiul actual al cercetărilor în domeniul temei a constat într-o reevaluare a surselor. Astfel, putem menţiona că despre Constantin Stere s-au scris lucrări importante, studii, articole, numeroase site-uri online au publicat articole despre activitatea acestuia etc. O reconsiderare istoriografică asupra subiectului propus relevă un interes crescut pentru personalitatea adusă în dezbatere. De amintit sunt următoarele lucrări: Virginia Muşat, Constantin Stere. Scriitorul (1978); Ion Căpreanu, Eseul unei restituiri. Constantin Stere (1988), Zigu Ornea, Viaţa lui Constantin Stere (1989, 1991), o monografie în două volume. Acesta a reeditat la Bucureşti, în anii 1991 şi 1993, lucrarea dedicată lui Stere. De o atenţie sporită se bucură în Republica Moldova, când în anul 1991 apare lucrarea lui V. Badiu despre activitatea lui C. Stere. De amintit este şi articolul lui I. Vasilenco din 1963.
Z11|Entrepreneurship and its Economical Value in a very Dynamic Business Environment|The aim of this article is to enrich the vision regarding the connection between entrepreneurship and economic growth, focusing upon an economy in transition to a market economy. The authors of the present paper have developed an empirical model – based on a constant preoccupation to observe the impact of the entrepreneurial phenomenon on the free, emerging market in Romania – model which uses a number of variables which are believed to influence the critical mass of viable business existing in a dynamic environment. The proposed model identifies the factors that need to be activated in the current context to transfer the theoretical importance of SME’s in the truly complex world of an economy that desires to be prosperous. Then, the model was exposed to the test of the objective statistical and mathematical testing, starting from the results obtained from a survey of 536 entrepreneurs. The methodological approach makes use both of regression models, which use the relevant aspects from the survey, turned into quantitative or qualitative variables, and of the analysis of variance, with the aim of explaining the way in which the considered variables have managed to determine the economic growth, as well as of determining their importance and their influence. Finally, several conclusions have been outlined, regarding the economic policy measures that are needed and feasible in order to make the business environment in Romania more predictable and more friendly and, thus, to encourage entrepreneurship.
Z11|Flowers in Mihai Eminescu’s poetic imagery|Some of the objectives of this paper are: the identification and inventorying of the lyrics which include the concept of flower; finding out the means by which the word in the colloquial language becomes poetical in Mihai Eminescu’s work. The stylistic analysis and the lexical-semantic analysis of the floral elements are the methods we used in our approach. The choice of this specific topic arises from a steady interest in the systematic study of a clearly defined constituent of the Romanian vocabulary, particularly the names of different flower types, so as to understand the internal structure of language and to come to know the images they create in Mihai Eminescu’s poetic language. Thus, several flower types have been identified, such as garden flowers, wild flowers, flowering trees and shrubs, and acquatic plants.
Z11|Ioan Molnar – Piuariu (1749 - 1815) and the Romanian language - (200 years after death)|In the Romanian language, the name of Ioan Molnar - Piuariu is connected to the first Romanian- German grammar, a Romanian - German dictionary and the first rhetoric Romanian printed paper. His main activity was conducted in the field of linguistic and literary ideas and actions completed physiognomy Blãjeni representatives of the Transylvanian School, while Catholic Enlightenment shade of Latinity ideal Transylvanian School will increase the Romanians, focusing on language studies and history. Ioan Molnar - Piuariu fought for the Greek Eastern religious community, relying on secular education and a more direct propaganda among the masses. Manifested in different areas of the outstanding results, he was an innovative spirit brought in Romanian culture by the Transylvanian School, being concerned with the cultural emancipation of the Romanian people.
Z11|The linden tree in Mihai Eminescu’s anthumous poetry|This paper’s main objective is the analysis of the flower names which have fundamental terms embedded in their structure, expressions of some mythical, metaphorical or symbolic developments. The stylistic analysis and the lexical-semantic analysis of the floral elements are the methods we used in our approach. The choice of Mihai Eminescu’s poetry as a source of analysis of the poetics of floral elements has been prompted by the fact that Eminescu is the one who places Romanian poetry in the context of European poetry. As well as jasmine, lilac, the cherry blossom, and the apple blossom, the linden tree is part of the flowering trees and shrubs class.
Z11|Learning German as a Foreign Language in Sibiu. A Profile of the Learner|The following article is based on a questionnaire, which was filled in by 94 learners of the German language. The language school Centrul Cultural German enabled us to discover what the profile of the German language learner in Sibiu is. Our town is economically connected to Germany, due to the multitude of German companies, who are settled here and are looking for German speaking people. What kind of people are they? Why are they learning German? Is this language also the key to emigration? These questions will be answered in the bellow article.
Z11|Humanists and pedagogues of the Renaissance, theoretician followers of physical education|The eighteenth century is the century of Realism. The Renaissance placed education in the center of culture and has drew the lines of a new human profile, which suited the needs of the bourgeois society. In this context, physical education had significant impact, returning to its rightful place after it had been removed during the middle Ages. Outcast of the educational system, physical education had found refuge in popular games and preparation of knighthood. Renaissance humanist culture bound the broken thread of classical antiquity, brought back physical exercise in the education of youth and became an important element of the educational process. Teachers of this period, however, were thinkers and theorists, but they could not always implement their ideas in practice. Specifying the role of physical education in schools will become a complex concern, finding the best fitting forms and methods will be the mission for intellectuals and pedagogues in the following centuries.
Z11|The Market for Paintings in Paris between Rococo and Romanticism|" type=""main""> We analyze art pricing in a unique dataset on Paris auctions between 700s and 800s. Prices reflect the objective features of the paintings and of the sale, and they reveal a substantial death effect, with upward jumps in the years after the death of the artists. Both the hedonic and repeated sale price indexes show a declining pattern for the price of paintings (relative to the cost of living) starting with the French Revolution. On this basis, we analyze the emerging role and market power of art dealers and employ network theory to study whether they created rings to manipulate the outcome of the auctions for their profits. Dealers appear to have been divided into four main communities heavily trading between themselves and we find evidence of collusive behavior with lower hammer prices for buyers belonging to the same community of the dealers organizing the auction."
Z11|Agglomeration economies in classical music|This study investigates agglomeration effects for classical music production in a wide range of cities for a global sample of composers born between 1750 and 1899. Theory suggests a trade-off between agglomeration economies (peer effects) and diseconomies (peer crowding). I test this hypothesis using historical data on composers and employ a unique instrumental variable – a measure of birth centrality, calculated as the average distance between a composer's birthplace and the birthplace of his peers. I find a strong causal impact of peer group size on the number of important compositions written in a given year. Consistent with theory, the productivity gain eventually decreases and is characterized by an inverted U-shaped relationship. These results are robust to a large series of tests, including checks for quality of peers, city characteristics, various measures of composers' productivity, and across different estimations in which also time-varying birth centrality measures are used as instrumental variables.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Z11|Fiscal and economic aspects of book consumption in the European Union|Abstract One of the available and yet controversial tools in cultural policy at the national level is the reduction of VAT rates for cultural goods and services. We document the standard and reduced VAT rates in EU-28 countries in the period from 1993 to 2013 and explore the underlying determinants. We further introduce a simple theoretical framework to explain how reduced fiscal rates are expected to decrease prices and increase quantities of the consumed cultural goods and services. We then estimate quantitatively that a decrease in the VAT rate for books by one percentage point is associated with an economically significant drop in the price by 2.6%. Finally, we show the positive effect of a fiscal rate reduction on the book expenditure, where a one percentage point decrease in the VAT rate for books leads to an increase in expenditure by 2.7%.
Z11|A quantitative analysis of reading habits|In this paper, reading leisure habits in Spain are analysed as part of the consumersâ€™ decision process under a general framework of time allocation and emphasizing the role of cultural background. We use the Survey on Cultural Habits and Practices in Spain 2010-2011 to analyse the factors influencing reading habits, measured by the number of books read, and using a Zero Inflated Binomial Negative model. Time restrictions are a relevant barrier for reading habits. Female and educated people show different patterns. Furthermore, cultural attitudes and consumption are determinants of the probability of being a reader but also of the number of books read. This positive effect is linked to activities classified inside highbrow culture. Cultural capital, measured by a set of variables related to cultural home equipment that may also capture an income effect, has also a positive impact. Finally, we have also found relevant urban/rural differences.
Z11|European Cultural Models in Statistical Perspective: A High-dimensionally Adjusted Cultural Index for the EU Countries, 2005-2009|In the article, we present the construction of a cultural index using datasets of Eurostatâ€™s Cultural Statistics Pocketbooks from 2007 and 2011 and Eurostatâ€™s COFOG data. The datasets allow us a broad perspective over a set of more than 200 variables in 12 domains for the EU-27 member states. Using high-dimensionally adjusted factor analysis (Metropolis-Hastings Robbins-Monro algorithm), we construct a cultural index and determine a set of several cultural dimensions (as seen from the cultural statistics viewpoint). Using clustering analysis, we determine the general similarities and differences of observed cultural models and show several broadly different groupings that roughly, but not exclusively follow the divide speculated in some previous studies. The analysis therefore brings a novel and first statistically developed tool to empirically follow the changes in the condition of culture from the viewpoint of cultural statistics, while the clustering of models has important consequences for empirical cultural policy and has to be verified in future studies.

It can be found in the Ehrenhof of the Museum Kunstpalast in front of the library. The aim of the study was to find out whether this work of art has an effect on young people: This was to be done by measuring the psychological feelings by means of a semantic differential towards the location before and after the mounting of the artwork while also attempting to determine the effect by means of an open-ended question. The results are quite meaningful: In the six closed-ended questions asked the values improved significantly on the 0.1 % level in five features. In the characteristic ""fits to Düsseldorf"" a significance level of 2 % was achieved. In the open-ended question, 80 young people judged the future location very negatively: A total of 84 % negative and only 16 % positive statements. After the mounting of the artwork a further 80 young people were asked who then made 70 % positive and only 30 % negative statements. This difference is also statistically highly significant. The results of the experiment are interpreted psychologically and discussed in the light of the philosophy of science and epistemology. Finally, attention is drawn to the everyday impact assessment in corporate practice and the appropriate use of ""real"" artists in corporate and brand management is discussed."
Z11|Analyzing the decision to listen to recorded music. A microeconometric approach|In order to analyze the determining factors of the decision of listening to recorded music in Colombia, participation equations are estimated in the document. To do so, probit models are estimated using micro–data from the Encuesta de Consumo Cultural 2008 [Cultural Consumption Survey] for Colombia. The empírical results show that higher education, greater passive cultural participation, and positioning in a medium and high social–economic strata are the main determining factors of the decision of listening to recorded music. On the other hand, a factor that decreases the likelihood of listening to recorded music is self-declaring African– Colombian–descendent. This document contributes to the limited empirical literature on the determinants of cultural participation in Latin American countries.
Z11|Copyright and Innovation: Fit for Digitization?|It is contentious to what extent the existing copyright system contributes to the positive development of the regulated sectors of society. The present report shows that substantially more musical works and movies have been released in recent years than before the diffusion of digital copying technology. At the same time, the average quality of these works has been stable according to user assessments. Countries with stronger copyright protection do not exhibit greater supply of new works. Accordingly, the relatively strict copyright protection in some countries does not seem to promote the supply of new creative works. The present report also considers whether user-generated content (UGC) complements or substitutes professional content. An increasing supply of valuable UGC is not reflected in official economic statistics. In all probability, copyright protection promotes user-generated content less than professional content. As a result, substituting professional content with “amateur material” could reduce the socially desirable strength of copyright protection. However, we find that almost half of all works available on YouTube are professional content. Professional works are watched and recommended more frequently than the average. In addition, a large proportion of UGC on YouTube draws on professional works. There is little evidence that professional content would be widely replaced. It follows that UGC could also be supported by an efficient copyright system, which strengthens the supply of professional content without excessively limiting its further use as input for UGC.

Z11|Leave the Drama on the Stage: The Effect of Cultural Participation on Health|The aim of this study is to estimate the causal effect of cultural participation on health status. Cultural activities may directly impact upon health through palliative coping or substituting health-compromising behaviors. Cultural engagement may also facilitate the development of social networks, which can improve health via social support and the dissemination of social health norms. Previous estimates on the arts-health relationship are potentially biased due to reverse causality and unobserved heterogeneity. Using individual-level data from Germany, we employ propensity-score matching methods. The treatment group is confined to individuals that visit cultural events at least once a month. The participation equation includes a rich set of personal characteristics that cover the respondents' demographic and social background, social capital and leisure-time activities, health-related lifestyle, personality and childhood environment. We explicitly consider reverse causality by including the pre-treatment trends in health outcomes among the covariates. To deal with time-fixed unobserved heterogeneity, we combine the matching model with a difference-indifference approach. We find that frequent cultural-event visits are unrelated to health once we account for unobserved persistent differences across individuals. However, examining the dose-response relationship we find positive mental-health effects of low levels of cultural participation compared to non-attendance. Our results may thus yield important insights on the effectiveness of arts participation as a means to reduce social inequalities in health.

Im Zusammenhang mit der Digitalisierung ist es seit Jahren strittig, inwieweit das bestehende Urheberrecht zu einer nachhaltig positiven Entwicklung der geregelten Gesellschaftsbereiche beiträgt. Dieser Bericht belegt, dass in den letzten Jahren deutlich mehr Musik und Filme veröffentlicht worden sind als vor der Verbreitung digitaler Kopiertechnologie. Nutzerbewertungen zufolge ist dabei die durchschnittliche Qualität der Veröffentlichungen in etwa gleich geblieben. Zudem werden in Ländern mit stärkerem Urheberrechtsschutz nicht signifikant mehr neue Werke veröffentlicht. Relativ starke Urheberrechtsschutzmaßnahmen in einigen Ländern fördern demnach das Angebot neuer kreativer Werk nicht. Dieser Bericht betrachtet ebenfalls, ob professionelle Inhalte durch nutzergenerierte Inhalte (User Generated Content) ergänzt oder ersetzt werden. Diese Art von Veröffentlichungen ohne direktes Erwerbsinteresse wird in den üblichen Statistiken nicht erfasst und erhöht die Vielfalt des Angebots zusätzlich. Nutzergenerierte Inhalte werden durch einen starken Urheberrechtsschutz wahrscheinlich weniger gefördert als professionelle Inhalte. Ein Ersatz professioneller Inhalte durch „Amateur-Veröffentlichungen“ könnte also den gesamtgesellschaftlich erstrebenswerten Urheberrechtsschutz verringern. Wir finden allerdings, dass professionelle Inhalte auch auf YouTube fast die Hälfte des Angebots ausmachen, überdurchschnittlich häufig aufgerufen und positiv bewertet werden. Ein weitgehender Ersatz professioneller Inhalte ist nicht zu erkennen. Außerdem beinhaltet ein großer Teil der auf YouTube befindlichen nutzergenerierten Inhalte Teile professioneller Veröffentlichungen. Demzufolge könnte auch das Angebot nutzergenerierter Inhalte von einem effizienteren Urheberrechtsschutz gefördert werden, der das professionelle Angebot kreativer Werke stärkt, ohne dessen weitere Nutzung als Input für nutzergenerierte Inhalte übermäßig einzuschränken.

Z11|Factors Affecting the Financial Success of Motion Pictures: What is the Role of Star Power?|In the mid-1940s, American film industry was on its way up to its golden era as studios started mass-producing iconic feature films. The escalating increase in popularity of Hollywood stars was actively suggested for its direct links to box office success by academics. Using data collected in 2007, this paper carries out an empirical investigation on how different factors, including star power, affect the revenue of ‘home-run’ movies in Hollywood. Due to the subjective nature of star power, two different approaches were used: (1) number of nominations and wins of Academy Awards by the key players, and (2) average lifetime gross revenue of films involving the key players preceding the sample year. It is found that number of Academy awards nominations and wins was not statistically significant in generating box office revenue, whereas star power based on the second approach was statistically significant. Other significant factors were critics’ reviews, screen coverage and top distributor, while number of Academy awards, MPAA-rating, seasonality, being a sequel and popular genre were not statistically significant.
Z11|How Learning a Musical Instrument Affects the Development of Skills|Despite numerous studies on skill development, we know little about the effects of extracurricular music activities on cognitive and non-cognitive skills. This study examines how music training during childhood and youth affects the development of cognitive skills, school grades, personality, time use and ambition using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Our findings suggest that adolescents with music training have better school grades, are more conscientious, open and ambitious. These effects are stronger among adolescents from lower socio-economic status. In order to address the non-random selection into playing music, we take into account detailed information on the child and its parents, which may determine both the decision to pursue music lessons and educational outcomes. While lacking truly exogenous variations in music activities, our results are robust to a large range of sensitivity tests. We thereby approach causality better than previous observational studies.

Z11|The economics of aesthetics and record prices for art since 1701|Aggregate art price patterns mask a lot of underlying variation—both in the time series and in the cross-section. We argue that, to increase our understanding of the market for aesthetics, it is helpful to take a micro perspective on the formation of art prices, and acknowledge that each artwork gives rise to a market for trading in its private-value benefits. We discuss relevant recent literature, and illustrate the potential of this approach through a historical study of record prices for art at auction since 1701.
Z11|The price of wine|Using historical price records for Bordeaux Premiers Crus, we examine the impact of aging on wine prices and the long-term investment performance of fine wine. In line with the predictions of an illustrative model, young maturing wines from high-quality vintages provide the highest financial returns. Past maturity, famous châteaus deliver growing non-pecuniary benefits to their owners. Using an arithmetic repeat-sales regression over 1900–2012, we estimate a real financial return to wine investment (net of storage costs) of 4.1%, which exceeds bonds, art, and stamps. Returns to wine and equities are positively correlated. Finally, we find evidence of in-sample return predictability.
Z11|Tratantes de arte y los grandes maestros de la pintura|This paper presents a model on the relationship born during the Renaissance, between artists and dealers. It establishes the conditions that made possible such an arrangement. The model explains why this contract functioned properly among minor painters, and why the Great Masters did not got involved on it. Finally, the model studies the relationship between the number of artists signed under one single dealer and the marketing and promotional cost of the works of art.
Z11|Innovare il rapporto tra musei, visitatori ed utenti attraverso le relazioni digitali|"Le tecnologie della comunicazione stanno progressivamente ridisegnando il nostro modo di essere, le nostre relazioni e le forme e gli strumenti attraverso cui quotidianamente accediamo alle informazioni di cui abbiamo bisogno. Anche i musei sono coinvolti in tali evoluzioni ed il rapporto che può essere instaurato tra visitatore e museo attraverso i nuovi media digitali diventa quindi incredibilmente più ricco e complesso. Tanto il museo quanto l’individuo sono, quindi, portatori di una trama relazionale che diventa progressivamente più estesa, anche traendo beneficio dalla più recente evoluzione della rete internet, caratterizzata dall’avvento e dalla diffusione del cosiddetto ""web 2.0"" e dei social media. Ciò determinerà per i musei la necessità di sviluppare una consapevole strategia di presenza sui social media, cioè una vera e propria ""social media strategy"", la quale rappresenta una porzione della più ampia ""digital strategy"" del museo. Inoltre, la diffusione sempre più ampia e pervasiva delle tecnologie mobili e dei dispositivi indossabili prefigura l’avvento di uno scenario in cui i visitatori dei musei modificheranno profondamente sia il modo con il quale stabilire una relazione con queste organizzazioni, sia le modalità concrete di fruizione dei servizi museali."

Z11|Creativity and economic growth: theory, measures, and potentials for morocco|The current era of globalization is dominated by the rise of investments in intangible capital rather than tangible capital — the ascendance of creativity over plant and equipment. This brief paper is motivated by the possibility that emerging market economies such as Morocco might take greater advantage of new tools and policies designed for this new era. To begin, I discuss the transformation of the global economy and the consequences of the transformed global economy for economic thinking and measurement. I refer to both old and new literature on the measurement of intangible investment and capital. Then, I discuss the rising role of creativity and cultural difference in the development of these new economic forces, using the example of the Harry Potter book series. I then consider how cultural enhancement serves multiple purposes for a nation. Finally, I turn to some of the possible implications of these economic forces for Morocco, stressing that these implications are speculative.
Z11|Are autographs integrating the global art market? The case of hedonic prices for French autographs (1960-2005)|The market for autographs has become more open to international buyers since 1990. Our data set features a large sample of store and auction sales for selected authors every five years from 1960 to 2005. The estimation of a hedonic price function shows that page count, type of author, date and type of the document, together with consumer and assets price indices explain more than one half of the price differences. Authors whho are more often sold at auctions (hence more likely to attract international demand) carry a 28% premium when sold in stores. The autographs (real) price increased by 222% during the period, while the hedonic price increased by 190%. With growing correlation between French autograph prices and art market index, as well as a supply function responsive to market valuation and trends, the French autograph market has become more integrated in the global art market since the 1990's
Z11|Dance Participation and Attendance in Denmark|Dancing may be one of the most competitive professions availabl career-wise. The lack of job opportunities and the competitiveness, the inherent expense in costumes and training and the high risk of injuries mean that only few dancers are able to make it their profession. However, dancing is an activity that comes with positive externalities, as various socioeconomic benefits are experienced by those who practice dance non-professionally. Despite the importance of dancing, very little is known with respect to the profiles of dancers. This paper, by availing of an information database on cultural preferences and habits in Denmark for 2004, illustrates the profiles of dancers and dance audiences and so deepens the current knowledge on the functioning of the dance market. We show that there exists a very strong positive correlation between cultural participation and the well-being of a society. These links are carefully described in the paper.
Z11|Is Opera Attendance Fashionable? The Case of Perm Opera and Ballet Theatre|This paper considers fashion as a factor of theatre attendance. The research setting is the industrial city Perm with approximately one million citizens. Perm opera and ballet theatre found in 1870 is “Russia’s third ballet Mecca, after Moscow and St. Petersburg”. Series of in-depth interviews, content-analysis and analysis of discourse provide “corroborative evidence”. The research is based on fashion value framework, which regards fashion guided behaviour as a function of shared values called fashion values. The literature review generates insights about the role of fashion in high culture consumption and arguments pro applicability of the fashion values framework for theatre attendance. The data comes from 23 in-depth interviews with visitors and non-visitors of Perm opera and ballet theatre. The research develops the set of indicators of fashion awareness in context of theatre attendance. The results shows that institutionalized cultural capital and occupation in cultural industries matter for fashion awareness of a particularly participant. So far, it is supposed education and occupation play more important role as an explanation of fashion awareness than class does. The ways for future investigations are discussed
Z11|The Estimates of Restoration Interventions regarding the Wooden Churches in the Buzãu County|A number of multilateral conventions adopted under the aegis of the UNESCO and the European Councile support the protection of cultural heritage as a prerequisite for cohesion and European solidarity, being mentioned in the EU Sustainable Development Strategy. The aim of this paper is an economic analysis on the interventions of conservation - restoration of the Buzau wooden churches. The research was performed on six wooden churches declared historical monument swhich present different degrees of degradation and the high difficulty of restoration interventions finally led to an estimate of increasing values. Through this evaluation new strategies can be formulated in order to develop and promote tourism in the Buzau County.
Z11|Experts’ awards and economic success: evidence from an Italian literary prize|Product quality is often unobservable ex-ante and consumers rely on experts’ judgments, sometimes in the form of ratings or awards. Do awards affect consumers’ choices or, conversely, are they conferred on the most popular products? To disentangle this issue, we use data about the most important Italian literary prize, the “Strega Prize,” undertaking two different estimation strategies to evaluate the impact that winning the Prize has on book sales. First, we adopt a regression discontinuity design using a measure of book sales as a dependent variable and as a forcing variable (proxying for intrinsic book quality) the jury votes received by each nominated book in the competition. We find that the Strega Prize has a very strong impact on sales. Second, by using weekly data on appearances on bestseller lists, we estimate a difference-in-differences model in which we compare sales performance of treated and control books before the award is conferred with their respective performances afterward. The results confirm a huge influence of the Prize on book sales and show that most of the impact occurs in the weeks following the announcement of the Prize.

Z11|Factors Correlated with Visitors’ Interest in the Best International Show: Evidence from Hong Kong Arts Festivals|The key objective of this empirical study is to determine and analyze the demographic, attitudinal and behavioral factors that could significantly correlate with international visitors’ interest in the Best International Show, which had taken place at the Hong Kong Arts Festivals. A total of 129 samples were drawn randomly from both the male and female international visitors, who participated in that international arts and festival show in Hong Kong. The study used paired samples t-test and descriptive statistics as analytical techniques to achieve the key objective. The estimated correlation coefficients obtained through t-test and the corresponding levels of significance reveal that Latvian National Opera: Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk and Northern Sinfonia and Chorus are the two most attractive show performances, which have been positively as well as significantly (P=0.05) correlated with international visitors’ interest in the Best International Show. Interestingly, as confirmed by the paired samples t-test, no demographic factors of the international visitors were found to be correlated with their interest in the Best International Show. Thus, policies and strategies, which will promote and improve the quality of the above two show performances, are to be taken in order to attract more international visitors to the Best International Show. While the main limitation of this study lies in the use of a small sub-set of samples, future research could overcome this by interviewing a large number of international visitors.
Z11|Willingness to believe and betrayal aversion: the special role of trust in art exchanges|Lack of transparency is considered a major functional deficiency of art markets. The uniqueness of artworks, the subjectivity of the pleasure component in their appeal, the unequal access to verifiable information make information asymmetries, and their potential opportunistic use, one of the dominant characteristics of this market and one that is very difficult to remedy. Yet, art goods are not simply risk-intensive goods, as are financial assets. Their complexity and specificity have given ample room, not only for calls for greater transparency and more credible information, but also for building trust-based long-term relationships. Drawing on the distinction between decisions involving risk and decisions involving trust, the paper discusses how relational trust, based on confidentiality and reciprocity, has helped compensate for the lack of transparency to increase the overall trustworthiness of art markets. Yet, trust-based exchanges have a downside too, since trust, once gained, can also be used opportunistically to defend and exploit positions of privilege and power. This form of strategic trust can become an obstacle to the diffusion of information and the adoption of credible norms of transparency. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
Z11|The success of art galleries: a dynamic model with competition and information effects|An intrinsic characteristic of cultural goods is the unpredictability of their economic success. Arts goods in particular share characteristics with credence, inspection, and experience goods. Accordingly, art collectors rely on the experience and the reputation of art galleries when investing in artwork. Some qualitative sociological studies have found that only a few very successful galleries represent the bulk of the most visible and most successful artists (e.g., Crane in The transformation of the avant-garde: the New York art world, 1940–1985. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1989 ; Currid in The Warhol economy: How fashion, art and music drive New York City. Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2007 ). This paper investigates the success of art galleries in a dynamic model, which elaborates different statistical processes that allow us to analyze the development of different types of success distributions in the market for art galleries. Instead of applying standard economic analysis only, we employ methods from statistical physics to construct a model of gallery investment and competition. Our model entails information, competition, and innovation effects. Subsequently, art market data are used to test which version of the model fits best. We find that the lognormal distribution provides the best fit and conclude that the data generating process is compatible with the version of the model, which entails an inhomogeneous geometric Brownian motion. Hence, the success of art galleries depends strongly on information and innovation effects, but is hardly affected by competition effects. We argue that the superstar effect in the case of art galleries can be understood as an appropriation of search and entrance costs, which emerge whenever consumption requires special knowledge and social inclusion.

Z11|Video games playing: A substitute for cultural consumptions?|This article discusses some economic and cultural features of video games and posits that this medium belongs within the core of cultural economics. We further provide an applied investigation of video game usage. Using data for Spain, we estimate zero-inflated ordered probit models to control for an excess of zeros in our ordinal dependent variable. We find that the probability of game playing increases with the consumption of other cultural goods (e.g., listening to music or watching television) or active involvement in artistic activities (e.g., writing or visual arts production). Game playing is in general an urban phenomenon; it is positively associated with the ownership of home equipment and access to new technologies, but decreases with greater time restrictions of a person. The main differences to the traditional art formats is that game playing appeals particularly to younger, usually less educated cohorts. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
Z11|Innovation, experience and artists’ age-valuation profiles: evidence from eighteenth-century rococo and neoclassical painters|Age-valuation profiles for artists’ works are to some degree analogous to age-earnings profiles for workers more generally and are of interest for valuation of art objects as well as for what they reveal about artists’ career dynamics. A number of writers have suggested that the school, or style, characterizing an artist’s work may have implications for the peak of the age-valuation profile (the age of the artist at the time at which his or her most highly valued works were executed). In particular, shifts of style which change the relative valuation of innovation and originality, versus craftsmanship and experience, have been hypothesized. The second half of the eighteenth century provides an interesting potential test, because socioeconomic and political changes at this time were paralleled by revolutionary change in the fine arts, especially painting, witnessing major changes in subject manner and aesthetic style among prominent artists. We revisit the hypothesis using data on auction sales of works from this time, estimating hedonic age-valuation profiles using a novel data set. We pool our set of artists to estimate profiles for different birth cohorts, also using a specification where profiles shift continuously with year of birth. We also use dimension-reduction and model-averaging techniques to allow estimation of individual profiles for several artists, despite limited sample sizes.

Z11|Two approaches to study the value of art and culture, and the emergence of a third|This paper argues that a third approach to study the value of art and culture is emerging: the valuation approach. The paper, first, outlines the two established approaches to study the value of art. The economics of the arts approach in which economic analysis is used to analyze the arts is the first of those established approaches. The other established approach is the art and commerce approach in which the relative position of the arts in society and in particular its relation to the commercial and industrial world is analyzed. The valuation approach takes elements of these two established approaches, but focuses explicitly on processes of valuation of the arts and cultural goods on markets as well as within bureaucracies, organizations, among experts, peers and other communities. Central to the valuation approach is the notion that the study of market prices is not sufficient to establish the value of cultural goods. Contributors to this emerging approach analyze valuation processes in and outside markets, the norms and conventions used to value the arts, and the role of intermediaries who are able to deal with competing notions and justifications of value.

Z11|The impact of music on educational attainment|This paper analyzes the impact of music practice on educational outcomes. Estimates from multivariate regressions and individual fixed effects suggest that childhood musical activity—either playing an instrument or singing—relates positively to educational achievements in adolescence. The magnitude and significance of the estimated music coefficients for different music indicators is robust when increasing the amount of individual and family control variables. Yet, the size of the music estimates decreases when holding constant the effect of parental education, other time leisure activities, and previous educational achievements.

Z11|Investing in Diamonds|This paper examines the risk-return characteristics of investment grade gems (white diamonds, colored diamonds and other types of gems including sapphires, rubies, and emeralds). The transactions are coming from gem auctions and span the period 1999-2012. Over our time frame, the annual nominal USD returns for white and colored diamonds amount to 8.1% and 7.4%, respectively, or 5.5% and 4.8% in real terms. For a Euro investor, the returns on white and colored diamonds are about 1.3% lower than for a USD investors but the Euro returns still beat inflation by 3.5% annually. The returns for Other Gem types (rubies, emeralds and sapphires) are more volatile and somewhat lower (4.5% annual nominal returns and 2.1% in annual real terms). Applying the hedonic regression method to the data set of auction transactions of investment grade diamonds, we are able to explain more than 95% of their price variation in white diamonds. Although the diamond returns since 1999 have been below those on gold, both white and colored diamonds have significantly outperformed the US and European stock markets, US and European real estate, US government bonds, as well as European government and corporate bonds. The reward-to-risk (Sharpe ratio) of white diamonds is very close to that of US corporate government bonds. The highest Sharpe ratio (by far) over the past 14 years was the one on gold. Still, in times of crisis investments in diamonds have shown an attractive risk-return tradeoff. In spite of a small positive correlation between the diamond and the equity markets, adding diamonds to an equity portfolio still have some diversification advantages.
Z11|Neoliberalism, ‘Digitization’, and Creativity: the Issue of Applied Ontology|The paper extends Foucault’s analysis of neoliberalism in The Birth of Biopolitics. More specifically, I construct and defend an anti-Husserlian approach to the labour process with the objective of investigating how collectively generated forms of intellectual labour have been appropriated under capitalist relations of production. I also interrogate the way that different notions of (computational) applied ontology influence both the nature of and our very conception of social creativity. What, quite wrongly, has been thought of in Spinoza as pantheism is simply the reduction of the field of God to the universality of the signifier, which produces a serene, exceptional detachment from human desire. In so far as Spinoza says—desire is the essence of man, and in the radical dependence of the universality of the divine attributes, which is possible only through the function of the signifier, in so far as he does this, he obtains that unique position by which the philosopher—and it is no accident that it is a Jew detached from his tradition who embodies it—may be confused with a transcendent love. This position is not tenable for us. Experience shows us that Kant is more true, and I have proved that his theory of consciousness, when he writes of practical reason, is sustained only by giving a specification of the moral law which, looked at more closely, is simply desire in its pure state, that very desire that culminates in sacrifice, strictly speaking, of everything that is the object of love in one’s human tenderness—I would say, not only in the rejection of the pathological object, but also in its sacrifice and murder. That is why I wrote Kant avec Sade. (Lacan, 1979: 275-6) But it is like the story of the Resistance fighters who, wanting to destroy a pylon, balanced the plastic charges so well that the pylon blew up and fell back into its hole. From the Symbolic to the Imaginary, from castration to Oedipus, and from the despotic age to capitalism, inversely, there is the progress leading to the withdrawal of the overseeing and overcoding object from on high, which gives way to a social field of immanence where the decoded flows produce images and level them down. Whence the two aspects of the signifier: a barred transcendent signifier taken in a maximum that distributes lack, and an immanent system of relations between minimal elements that come to fill the uncovered field (somewhat similar in traditional terms to the way one goes from Parmenidean Being to the atoms of Democritus). (Deleuze and Guattari,1987: 290-1). Marx was vexed by the bourgeois character of the American working class. But it turned out that the prosperous Americans were merely showing the way for the British and the French and the Japanese. The universal class into which we are merging is not the revolutionary proletariat but the innovative bourgeoisie. (McClosky, D. 2009)
Z11|Support Mechanisms for Museums in the Economic Crisis (the Example of Major Museums of Europe and Russia)|The authors analyze the mechanisms of financial support for major European and Russian museums in the economic crisis. The key performance indicators of the largest museum institutions in Europe and Russia (the Louvre, the Prado Museum, the British Museum, the Hermitage, the Tretyakov Gallery and Moscow Kremlin Museums) are analyzed. The main trends and patterns in the formation of financial resources of museums in a changing economic environment are considered.
Z11|Economic Crisis and the New Paradigm of Public Support of the Patronized Goods|In this paper, we propose a new model of economic regulation of the patronized goods in the humanitarian sector of the economy, aimed at increasing the sustainability of the financial position of organizations of culture, science, and education and at reduction of their dependence on conjunctural, or opportunistic, decisions of the economic departments. The basis of this model is composed of three mechanisms of public support: 1) a system of financial performance standards that characterizes a minimum share of budget expenditures on the production of the appropriate types of patronized goods, reflecting state commitments to their accessibility for the population and the remuneration of labor of workers of culture, science and education; 2) the institution of individual budget appropriations which implements the right of citizens' participation in the selection of areas, or directions of spending a limited part of state income tax; 3) a system of endowment funds, allowing to accumulate receipts from the individual budget appropriations and labeled taxes, in order to extract the increasing investment income from the target capital, or the endowment, which is an additional source of financial support for the patronized goods in the humanitarian sector of the economy.
Z11|Economic Dimension of Crimes against Cultural, Historical and Archaeological Heritage|The publication is one of the first studies of the economic dimension of crimes against cultural and archaeological heritage. Lack of research in this area is largely due to irregular global prevalence vague definition of economic value of the damage they cause to society at the national and global level, to present and to future generations. The author uses classical models of Becker and Freeman, by modifying and complementing them with the tools of economics of culture based on the non-use values. The model tries to determine the opportunity cost of this type of crime in several scenarios and based on this to determine the extent of their limitation at an affordable cost to society and raising public benefits of conservation of World and National Heritage.
Z11|George Orwell and the Incoherence of Democratic Socialism|George Orwell's famous fictions, Animal Farm and Nineteen-Eighty Four were intended to advocate democratic socialism by portraying undemocratic forms of socialism as totalitarian. For Orwell, democracy was a political institution which would limit the abuse of power. But there are several problems with democratic socialism which ensure its failure. In Orwell's novel A Clergyman's Daughter, Orwell's views of economics and politics are inconsistent and conflicting in a way that ensures democratic socialism will not succeed on Orwell's terms. Democratic socialism in general is criticized according to F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom and John Jewkes's The New Ordeal by Planning, whose arguments differ crucially from those against market socialism by Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny. An economic analysis of the political institutions of democratic socialism shows that democratic socialism must necessarily fail for political (not economic) reasons even if nobody in authority has ill-intentions or abuses their power.
Z11|Two Opposing Economic-Literary Critiques of Socialism: George Orwell Versus Eugen Richter and Henry Hazlitt|Orwell's famous fictions, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four criticized totalitarian forms of socialism from a Public Choice perspective, assuming that socialism would work as an economic system as long as the proper political institutions were in place to curb the potential for the abuse of power. This is contrasted with two novels by others who took the opposite approach: Richter's Pictures of the Socialistic Future and Hazlitt's Time Will Run Back. These two assumed that the political implementation of socialism would be perfect but that socialism would necessarily turn totalitarian because of the problem of economic calculation. These novels assumed away the Public Choice problem of institutions and the abuse of power and focused on the political implications of socialism as a purely economic system. Contrasting these two sets of novels shows how the Austrian and Public Choice schools criticize socialism in two entirely different ways.
Z11|Product Success in Cultural Markets: The Mediating Role of Familiarity, Peers, and Experts|The mediation of ambiguous markets has been essential to recent developments in economic sociology. Cultural industries provide a valuable testing ground for its perspective of socially influenced market behavior. This article emphasizes the uncertainty of cultural markets and thus the relevance of social valuation in disseminating new releases. I hypothesize that recipients of culture simplify cultural choice by reacting to easily attainable signals of product value. Mechanisms of valuation include product familiarity, peer influence, and expert critique. Focusing on an exemplary cultural market, I confront theoretical implications with data from the German book industry (2001–2006). Panel and cross-section regressions show that, alongside well-defined market segments, separate mechanisms guide consumer behavior. For incumbents’ offerings, prior recognition stabilizes cultural choice and reinforces differences in market success. In the highly ambiguous newcomer segment, imitation and negative media steer audience attention, at times leading to unsatisfactory aggregate outcomes, i.e. ‘bad’ bestsellers.
Z11|George Orwell as a Public Choice Economist|George Orwell is famous for his two final fictions, Animal Farm (Orwell 1945a) and Nineteen Eighty-Four (Orwell 1949a). These two works are sometimes understood to defend capitalism against socialism. But as Orwell was a committed socialist, this could not have been his intention. Orwell's criticisms were directed not against socialism per se but against the Soviet Union and similarly totalitarian regimes. Instead, these fictions were intended as Public Choice-style investigations into which political systems furnished suitable incentive structures to prevent the abuse of power. This is demonstrated through a study of Orwell's non-fiction works, where his opinions and intentions are more explicit.

Z11|What Marketing Strategy for Sacred Geometry Discoveries to Make Archaeotourism Work?|Archaeotourism can take place in two main forms: i) on site or locations of discoveries; and ii) assembling the discoveries into museums or exhibitions. Given that the first option in Kosovo has not proven viable, a marketing strategy went on to be explored for the latter in broad terms by taking into account Bronze Age artifacts with engravings from the sacred geometry discovered by the Author of this paper during 2013-14, which were the work of ancient Illyrians. Yet, the results suggest a third alternative of archaeotourism development, and that is the interest by respective foreign scholars, institutions, and foundations by using Long Tail marketing approach. The paper interprets some astrological metaphors of sacred geometry in literature review, but draws conclusions from archeological discoveries.
Z11|Gestión de la propiedad intelectual en museos<BR>[Management of intellectual property in museums]|Este artículo tiene el propósito de presentar la gestión de la propiedad intelectual en museos (GPIM), en un escenario en el cual estas instituciones culturales pasaron de ser usuarios que respetaban la propiedad intelectual (PI) a gestionarla y ser intermediarios en el posible uso para terceros. Para ello, el documento explica las diferentes concepciones de museo; la discusión sobre los diversos tipos de protección de la PI; y la importancia de la GPIM. Se identificó que la PI en los museos cumple generalmente dos funciones que deben estar balanceadas: la mayor difusión social posible garantizando los derechos de autor y la explotación comercial de la PI, como fuente de recursos, con el fin de garantizar la subsistencia de la institución cultural. This article aims to present the management of intellectual property in museums, in a scenario where these cultural institutions became users who not only respect the intellectual property, but are intermediaries in the possible use for third parties. The document explains the different conceptions of museum; the discussion of the various types of intellectual property protection; and the importance of management of intellectual property in museums. It identified that intellectual property in museums generally serves two functions which must be balanced: (i) the greatest possible social diffusion ensuring the copyright and the commercial exploitation of intellectual property, in order to ensure the survival of the cultural institution.
Z11|Time dedicated by consumers to cultural goods: Determinants for Spain|This paper analyzes the time that consumers dedicate to a range of cultural goods (cinema, theatre, museums, and spectator sports) by estimating a SUR model with information from the Spanish Time Use Survey for 2009-2010. Thus, we bridge the gap in the literature of consumption that has omitted the determinants of the time adults spend on cultural goods. Our main results indicate that age influences the time spent going to cinemas and art exhibitions/museums in different ways. Older individuals spend less time going to cinemas, while younger individuals are less frequent visitors to art galleries and museums, and men spend more time than women at sporting events. A university level of education influences the time dedicated to these four activities in a positive and statistically significant manner, and larger families positively influence the time dedicated to attending sporting events.
Z11|What do you prefer for a relaxing and cultural time at home: Reading, watching TV, or listening to the radio?|This paper studies the determinants of time spent by Spanish consumers on reading, watching TV, and listening to the radio, by estimating a SUR model with data from the Spanish Time Use Survey for 2009-2010. The existing literature on the consumption of cultural goods has, so far, failed to address the determinants of the amount of time adults spend at home interacting with cultural goods. We find that age has a positive influence on the time dedicated to reading, while the opposite occurs with time spent watching TV. Men spend more time than women watching television and listening to the radio, while those in our sample with a higher level of education spend more time reading. Individuals with a lower level of education spend more time watching television. The more children there are in the family, the less time is spent on all three options, but this negative effect diminishes as the children grow older. Finally, living in a larger city has a positive effect on the time dedicated to all three of our cultural options.
Z11|Kontribusi Sarjana Muslim bagi Peradaban Eropa: Melacak Akar Sejarah dan Perkembangan Ekonomi<BR>[Muslim Scholars Contribution for European Civilization: The Roots of History and Economic Development Tracing]|"The development of economic thought in the Islamic tradition started since the beginning of the first century of the Hijrah. This period is a time when the scientific works about how to achieve economic progress and strengthen the country through foreign trade intangibles movements in the West, known as mercantilism in the economic literature. At this stage of history, after the transmission of Greek ideas, the Muslim scholars to innovate and enrich life interpretations of thought in the world at large, then gradually those ideas into decline and forgotten in history. However, these ideas are not recognized by Western scholars, resulting in a missing link that led to the ""great gap"" in the history of the world economy."
