Z22|Do high wage footballers play for high wage teams? The case of Major League Soccer|Intuition and sports knowledge suggest the most talented professional footballers play for the best teams, i.e. positive assortative matching based on productivity. We consider Major League Soccer between 2007 and 2017. We estimate a wage equation, finding that player and team fixed wage premiums are negatively correlated. This is a puzzle, especially because our estimates of players' wage premiums do correlate strongly with measures of their performance on the pitch, and there is evidence of teammate sorting. One potential solution to this puzzle would be that players match to teams according to some sort of compensating wage differential, for example from their desire to play for successful or well-supported teams; the estimated wage premiums of MLS teams are highly and negatively correlated with their success in the league and their home game attendances.
Z22|istinguishing Incentive from Selection Effects in Auction-Determined Contracts|This paper develops a novel approach to estimate how contract and principal-agent characteristics influence an ex-post performance outcome when the matching between agents and principals derives from an auction process. We propose a control-function approach to account for the endogeneity of contracts and matching. This consists of, first, estimating the primitives of an interdependent values auction model - which is shown to be non-parametrically identified from the bidding data - second, constructing control functions based on the distribution of the unobserved private signals conditional on the auction outcome. A Monte Carlo study shows that our augmented outcome equation corrects well of the endogeneity biases, even in small samples. We apply our methodology to a labor market application: we estimate the effect of sports players’ auction-determined wages on their individual performance.
Z22|Globalización y desigualdad: el caso del fútbol internacional|Este artículo hace dos cosas. Primero, usa una base de datos original, basada en los albúmenes de Panini de los mundiales de fútbol, para estudiar la creciente globalización en el mercado de jugadores. Segundo, muestra, con base en una serie de indicadores sencillos, que la globalización coincidió con una doble desigualdad, la desigualdad entre ligas (cuatro ligas europeas amplían su dominio) y la desigualdad al interior de las principales ligas europeas. Los resultados sugieren la existencia de fenómenos similares en otras industrias (la industria del entretenimiento, la industria de software e información, la industria farmacéutica, etc.) en las cuales los mercados laborales tienen un alcance global.
Z22|Mind the absent gap: Gender-specific competitiveness in non-professional sports|There is wide evidence for gender differences in competitiveness and performance under pressure from experimental economics and single-sex professional sports. We analyze these differences in a sport with direct gender competition. Our unique data consists of over 500,000 observations from around 11,000 German ninepin bowling games of which around 15% are from mixed-gender leagues. Men perform better against women on average but this is fully explained by differences in ability. Our results are robust to instrumenting for opposite gender using the sex composition of the opponent team. Surprisingly, gender differences in tight situations do not seem to play a role.
Z22|Wages and labor productivity. Evidence from injuries in the National Football League|Studies in labor economics face severe difficulties when identifying the relationship between wages and labor productivity. This paper presents a novel identification strategy and demonstrates that the connection between wages and labor productivity is remarkably robust even when institutional constraints serve to distort the relationship. Identification is achieved by considering injuries to professional football players as an exogenous shock to labor productivity. This is an ideal empirical setting because injured players in the NFL can not be replaced easily because franchises are constrained by the salary cap. Injuries are shown to play a major role in franchise success and a tight connection between wages and marginal productivity emerges. This is in spite of regulatory frictions that serve to hold down wages for some workers
Z22|Running the Risk of an Injury in the NFL: Short-Run and Career Consequences|Similar to other workers in industrial settings NFL running backs can choose to provide additional work effort with possible negative health consequences. We find that the most informative measure for running backs is yards gained after contact, which not only increases total rushing yards but also increases injuries that can cause subsequent lost income due to future games missed. We econometrically examine the decisions running backs reveal in trading off injury risk against total yards gained and salary in the short run and how the tradeoff appears in the longer run where career length considerations come into play. Our estimates reveal subtle nonlinearities and interpersonal heterogeneity in risky effort and the associated short and long run injury risk and economic payoffs.
Z22|Measuring Customer Discrimination: Evidence from the Professional Cricket League in India|Research in the field of customer discrimination has received relatively little attention even if the theory of discrimination suggests that customer discrimination may exist in the long run whereas employer and employee discrimination may not. This paper examines customer discrimination considering a unique dataset from the most popular sports industry in India, i.e., cricket. Relying on Playing XI vote in the Indian Premier League (IPL), we analyze whether supporters have a different personal preference towards players based on their location of origin and religion. In contrast to the often-heated rhetoric surrounding discrimination, the often-unfounded assertions surrounding diversity, and the previous literature, we overall do not find any discrimination in voting. Our overall findings suggest that supporters treat players equally irrespective of nationality, place of origin or religious background while selecting their favorite players. However, our results also suggest that examining discrimination by controlling for proxy productivity characteristics may produce bias results as certain included or excluded characteristics may be systematically different. Our findings further suggest that political conflict may lead to customer discrimination. And finally, in line with Heckman's (1998) argument, our results suggest that customer discrimination may exist on the margin.
Z22|The Superstar Code - Deciphering Key Characteristics And Their Value|The purpose of the presented research is to advance the superstar literature on the aspect of superstar’s characteristics and value. Typically, superstar research is faced with one problem: They apply the same criteria to determine who their superstars are as to describe them later because they lack “an objective measure of star quality” (Krueger, 2005, p.18). To avoid this complication, the author chose to study Major League Soccer’s (MLS) designated players as this setting present a unique, as discrete, assignment of star status. MLS has formally introduced stars in 2007 under the designated player (DP) rule which delivers over 100 star-observations in the last ten years to investigate MLS strategy of star employment. The insights from this data set demonstrate which characteristics are relevant, whether MLS stars can be categorized as Rosen or Adler stars, and what the MLS pays for and in this sense values most. A cluster analysis discovers a sub group of ten stars that stand out from the others, in this sense superstars. A two-stage regression model confirms the value stemming from popularity, leadership qualities, previous playing level, age and national team experience but refutes other typical performance indicators like games played and goals scored or position. Overall, evidence for Rosen and Adler’s theory is found, and an over the time change from hiring old and popular stars to younger but still leadership-prone stars.
Z22|The Negative Effect of NCAA Football Bowl Bans on University Enrollment and Applications|Universities provide consumption amenities to students in addition to their educational services. Collegiate sports programs have been characterized one of these consumption amenities. Previous research has shown that athletic success has a positive impact on both the quantity and quality of students attending a university. Alternatively, we analyze if athletic malfeasance, as measured by NCAA postseason bowl bans of football programs, negatively affects either the quantity or quality of student applications or enrollment. Our findings suggest that athletic malfeasance that results in a postseason football bowl ban lowers the quantity of applications, admittances, and enrollment. We do not, however, detect any reduction in student quality at the sanctioned university. Our results demonstrate that impropriety by an athletics program directly impacts a university’s non-athlete student enrollment by influencing the amenity mix provided by the university. Key Words: Higher Education, NCAA, Athletic Malfeasance
Z22|Performance, Diversity and National Identity Evidence from Association football|The increasing national diversity of co-workers has no consensus on its impact on performance. Using a team’s predominant nationality as proxy for national diversity and national identity, there is robust evidence that it affects performance. Detailed worker-level data from a highly globalized industry, association football, shows a non-linear relationship between performance and the predominant nationality of a team’s roster. As the number of members from the predominant nationality increase, performance declines. However, beyond a threshold level, performance rises. It implies that performance benefits from national diversity when the predominant nationality is small and from national identity when it is large.
Z22|The inefficient advantage of experience in the market for football managers|We study hiring in a labor market where worker ability can only be observed on-the-job, but quickly becomes public information after labor market entry. We show that firms in these markets have a socially inefficient incentive to hire low talented, experienced workers instead of more promising labor market entrants, either when an extremely poor hire may bankrupt the firm, or when workers cannot commit to long-term contracts. In a dataset covering 38 years of hiring in the English labor market for football managers, we find that in around one quarter of all cases, where a firm hires an experienced worker, this experienced worker has an estimated ability below the average ability of recent labor market entrants. We argue this hiring behavior is inefficient, because it has persistently depressed the average ability of the active manager labor force over our sample period.
Z22|An Efficiency Evaluation of Menâ€™s College Basketball Coaches|An ESPN panel of experts ranked the top 51 menâ€™s college basketball coaches as of June 2014. I evaluate the production efficiency of those coaches, along with (a) 25 others who received honorable mention and (b) 86 whose teams earned either an NCAA or National Invitation Tournament (NIT) bid in the three then-most-recent seasons, and (c) 27 that were fired at the end of the 2013-2014 season. The evaluation uses data envelopment analysis and its three measures of efficiency: technical, overall technical, and scale. The measures do not necessarily yield the same rankings, with the efficiency-based rankings modestly corresponding to those of the panel when based on the coachâ€™s entire career and somewhat less so when based on the 2012-2014 data. An ordered-logit analysis highlights the correspondingly modest role efficiency played in determining what it took to get into the sample and, by contrast, the dominant role that winning played in the process.
Z22|Doping in teams: A simple decision theoretic model<BR>[Doping in Teams: Ein einfaches entscheidungstheoretisches Modell]|A simple decision theoretic model shows the doping incentives for a member of a professional sports team. Depending on the detection probability and the punishment, a sportsman dopes not at all, at a medium or at the maximal level. The whole team has a higher incentive than an individual team member that at least some of its members dope. That there are not many proven cases of doping in team sports could be because doping is less effective or because the incentives to cover it are higher than in individual sports.
Z22|Sind Wettbewerbe im Profisport Rattenrennen?|Eine Reihe von Autoren - vor allem im deutschsprachigen - Raum begründet die Notwendigkeit regulatorischer Eingriffe in Profisportmärkte damit, dass der Wettbewerb auf diesen Märkten systematisch versage. Als wesentliche Ursache für Wettbewerbsprobleme innerhalb dieser Ligen oder Meisterschaften gilt dem-nach das Auftreten eines ruinösen Wettbewerbs in Form von Rattenrennen à la Akerlof. Der vorliegende Beitrag untersucht die Frage, ob Rattenrennenmodelle eine geeignete Erklärung des ökonomischen Wettbewerbs in einer Sportliga darstellen und legt regulatorische Implikationen dar.
Z22|Physical constitution matters for athletic performance and salary of NBA players|Basketball is one of the most practised sports in the world, especially in America. America has the most famous professional basketball league, the National Basketball Association (NBA). This study examines whether there is a relationship between the physical constitution of professional basketball players and their athletic performance in the 2015/16 NBA season. Regression results show that the relative wingspan influences the athletic performance in a significantly positive way whereas the vertical jumping ability influences it in a significantly negative way. Furthermore, age follows an inverted U-shape with a maximum at 28 years. Moreover, this study analyses the impact of on-court performance measurements and personal characteristics on salary for NBA players. Taller players have a higher salary in the 2015/16 NBA season.
Z22|Gender Specific Relative Age Effects in Politics and Football| The existence of a relative age effect (RAE) is well documented, i.e., those born early in the calendar year perform better at school and sports. We exploit a change in a selection period in youth football and regression discontinuity design in political selection to parliament in Finland to provide causal evidence of the RAE on long-run outcomes: The RAE is not driven by inherent advantages of an early year birth but rather by factors that favor those that are the oldest of a cohort irrespective of the calendar year. Thus, it is not limited to sports but has persistent consequences even on the selection to the highest positions of power within a society. Strikingly, we find strong evidence that the RAE only applies to males in competitive political environments.
Z22|A strategy to predict association football players’ passing skills|Transfers are big business in association football. This paper develops a generalized additive mixed model that aids managers in predicting how a football player is expected to perform in a new team. It does so by using event-level data from the Spanish and the Colombian football leagues. Using passes as a performance proxy, the model exploits the richness of the data to account for the difficulty of each pass attempt performed by each player over an entire season. The model estimates are then used to determine how a player transferred from the Colombian league should perform in the Spanish league, taking into account that teammates and rivals’ abilities are different in the latter.
Z22|Beyond Moneyball|This study examines the changes in player compensation in Major League Baseball during the last three decades. Specifically, we examine the extent to which recently documented changes in playersâ€™ compensation structure based on certain types of productivity fits in with the longer term trends in compensation and identify the value of specific output activities in different time periods. We examine free-agent contracts in 3-year periods across three decades and find significant changes to how playersâ€™ past performances are rewarded in free agency beyond the change in those to on-base percentage seen in the mid-2000s. We find evidence that the compensation strategies of baseball teams increased the rewards to â€œpowerâ€ statistics beyond home runs in the 1990s from a model that focused on successfully reaching base with a batted ball without a significant regard for the number of bases reached. Similarly, we confirm and expand upon the increased financial return to bases on balls in the late 2000s as found in previous research.
Z22|The strongest link in a weak team? Performance of players with and without outside options in relegated football clubs|In this study the performance of players in relegated German football clubs is analysed, in particular the change in their contribution to team production. The players in the data sample differ regarding their outside options. Different career opportunities of players may have two effects when their current team struggles against relegation. First, players with outside options should be less motivated compared to the reference group. Second, risk attitudes of players who lack career opportunities may change. The empirical results show that players with outside options contribute less to the teams overall running distance before they are transferred to league opponents. Players who stayed after relegation with their teams played more incomplete passes, which indicates that they are more willing to take risks. Effort levels of staying players get higher, but leaving players might have superior playing talent.
Z22|The Rise and Fall of the Enforcer in the National Hockey League|This paper investigates the time series properties of fighting and scoring in the National Hockey League from 1957-2013. The empirical analysis focuses on identifying structural breaks in the various time series and correlating these breaks with rule changes in the NHL, especially those that focus on fighting. We find that player behavior in the areas of fighting and scoring changed structurally before rule changes in the NHL that reduced the benefits and increased the costs of fighting. The data and empirical results suggest that the rise and fall of the enforcer was a function of changes in social norms within the NHL rather than legal changes by the league itself. The example suggests that other sports might also experience changes in social norms that lead to reduced violence and increased offense before formal rule changes are made by league officials. Key Words: Social Norms, Cultural Change, Rule Changes, Structural Breaks
Z22|Fördert sportliche Aktivität den beruflichen Aufstieg?|Eine höhere Entlohnung von sportlich aktiveren Arbeitnehmern konnte in den letzten Jahren bereits mehrfach nachgewiesen werden. Diese wurde u. a. auf eine höhere Durchsetzungsfähigkeit sowie auf bessere soziale Fähigkeiten zurückgeführt. In diesem Beitrag wird mit Daten des Sozioökonomischen Panels (SOEP) analysiert, ob sportlich aktivere Arbeitnehmer eher beruflich aufsteigen bzw. Positionen mit Führungsverantwortung erreichen. Außerdem werden Persönlichkeitsmerkmale der beförderten Personen untersucht, um feststellen zu können, ob sich diese in geringerem bzw. höherem Maße für die erreichten (Führungs-)Positionen eignen. Es zeigt sich zunächst, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit, beruflich aufzusteigen, für sportlich aktivere Arbeitnehmer signifikant höher ist. Des Weiteren können bei den untersuchten beförderten Mitarbeitern stärkere Ausprägungen von Persönlichkeitseigenschaften, die insbesondere für Führungskräfte empfehlenswert bzw. vorteilhaft sind, nachgewiesen werden.
Z22|Misconduct and Leader Behaviour in Contests – New Evidence from European Football|This paper provides an empirical investigation of severe misconducts in contests based on data from European football championships. We extend previous studies by differentiating between two types of misconducts both resulting in a yellow card, namely dissents with the referee and other misconducts. Confirming the existing literature, we find that teams with lower ability are more likely to commit sabotage, i.e. fouls, to reduce the opponent’s chances for success. Sabotage is also more likely when the outcome of the contests is still open. In addition, we find that dissents with the referee are significantly more likely in the case of an unfavourable score. We introduce a new perspective to the study of football data by distinguishing misconducts of team captains from those of other players. We find that captains engage more in sabotage during important matches and challenge referees’ decisions in direct reaction to sanctions awarded to teammates. In contrast to regular players, however, captains do not participate in the escalation of series of retaliative misconducts. Finally, our analyses indicate that all types of misconduct have a negative effect on the likelihood of success.
Z22|Career duration in the NHL: pushing and pulling on Europeans?| Using a panel of National Hockey League players from 2000 through 2013, we analyse the determinants of career length in the league. In our analysis, we include both performance variables and nationality of origin to determine their importance in determining career length. We find that European-born players have shorter careers than North American-born players holding performance constant and Russian-born players have even shorter careers than other Europeans. We further find that Russian-born players have even shorter careers than other players after the 2005 lockout. These shorter careers are consistent with both exit discrimination against European and Russian players who are pushed out of the league as well as voluntary exit by European and Russian players who are pulled out of the league due to opportunities in their home countries.
Z22|The mortality crisis in transition economies|Large and sudden economic and political changes, even if potentially positive, often entail enormous social and health costs. Such transitory costs are generally underestimated or neglected by incumbent governments. The mortality crisis experienced by the former communist countries of Europe—which caused ten million excess deaths from 1990 to 2000—is a good example of how the transition from a low to a high socio-economic level can generate huge social costs if it is not actively, effectively, and equitably managed from a public policy perspective.
Z22|Does Poverty Influence Prevalence of Child Labor in Developing Countries?|The present article examined the impact of poverty on child labor prevalence across 42 developing countries based on system-generalize method of moment technique. The main result on the linkage between child labor prevalence and poverty deviated from the popular beliefs in majority of the existing literature that poverty caused child labor prevalence. The finding indicated that poverty is negatively related to child labor prevalence, in the sense that the higher the poverty the lower the child labor prevalence in the sample countries investigated, this finding therefore reconfirmed the wealth paradox of Bhalotra and Heady (2003).
Z22|Does Physical Exercise Affect Tradeoffs between Fixed Pay and Performance-related Pay for Individuals?|Much of the literature on performance-related pay has discussed the relationships with risk attitude, job satisfaction, sorting effects, amongst other factors. This paper focuses on the relationship between individual preferences for physical exercise or sports and the tradeoff between fixed and performance-related pay. First, a choice experiment is used to identify the individual preference for payments, and the tradeoff between fixed and performance-related pay. Next, OLS regression models are used to link the tradeoff with individual preference for physical exercise or sports. The results show that such a preference has a positive and significant influence on individuals' tradeoff of payments. For individuals who like physical exercise or sports more, who are better at them, and who take part in them more frequently, are more likely to prefer performance-related pay.
Z22|Career Duration in the NHL: Bias against Europeans?|Using a panel of National Hockey League players from 2000 through 2010, we analyze the determinants of career length in the league. In our analysis, we include both performance variables and nationality of origin to determine their importance in determining career length. We find that European-born players have shorter careers than do North American-born players holding performance constant and Russian-born players have even shorter careers than other Europeans. We further explore if the empirical evidence of a shorter career is consistent with exit discrimination on the part of team owners or with foreign-born players voluntarily returning home to end their careers in European leagues. Key Words: National Hockey League, exit discrimination, professional sports, foreign workers
Z22|I Take Care of My Own: A Field Study on How Leadership Handles Conflict between Individual and Collective Incentives|In most collective actions, individuals' incentives are not perfectly aligned with the goals of the group/team they are part of. We investigate how individual specific incentives affect both individuals and team leaders' strategies in a natural setting. We use a discontinuity in individual rewards in batsmen scoring in cricket to identify the causal effect of such incentives on behavior. We find that batsmen react to the presence of individual-specific incentives by adopting strategies that may be suboptimal at the team level. More surprisingly, we also find that team captains react to these individual incentives by adopting suboptimal strategies at the team level, which may bring large benefits to the individual players. These results suggest a complex interplay of individual and team incentives which we conjecture may arise in repeated team interactions.
Z22|Born in the USA: National Origin Effects on Time Allocation in US and Spanish Professional Basketball|This paper examines national origin bias in professional basketball in both the North American National Basketball Association (NBA) and Spanish professional league (Liga ACB). Past studies into racial bias find mixed results. In contrast, our study provides consistent evidence that players born in the USA receive preferential treatment in both the USA and Spain in terms of receiving additional time on the court.
Z22|Monopsony Exploitation in Professional Sport: Evidence from Major League Baseball Position Players, 2000–2011| Some professional athletes still face monopsony power in labor markets, underscoring the importance of estimating players' marginal revenue product to assess its effects. We introduce two new empirical approaches, spline revenue functions and fixed‐effects stochastic production functions, into the standard Scully (1974) approach to marginal revenue product estimation and calculate Monopsony Exploitation Ratios (MERs) for position players in Major League Baseball over the 2001–2011 seasons. Estimates indicate that MERs are about 0.89 for rookie players, 0.75 for arbitration eligible players, and 0.21 for free agents. Recent collective bargaining agreements have reduced MERs for free agents, but had no effect on MERs for other players. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
Z22|Exit Discrimination in the NBA. Is there a Bias against Foreigners?|Using a panel of National Basketball Association players from 1989 through 2013, we analyze the determinants of career length in the league. In our analysis we include performance, the race of the player and nationality of origin to determine their importance in determining career length. First we find that the performance is an important determinant of career length and that the race of the player does not determine career suggesting that there is no race based exit discrimination. We do find, however, that foreign-born players have shorter careers than do American-born players holding performance constant. In particular we find that foreign players who did not play college basketball in the United States have a higher probability of exit than foreign players who played college ball in the United States. Key Words: National Basketball Association, discrimination, and professional sports.
Z22|Economists’ Perspective on Sport: Overview of the Current State-of-the-Art|The article provides an overview of current research in the field of sports economics. Sport is an area of special interest for economists due to the increasing economic and political significance of this industry. Many economic puzzles arise in sport, such as market failures, property rights, institutional design. The author demonstrates and analyzes opportunities for economic analysis in sports industry and formulates unsolved problems in this area.
Z22|Bankruptcy Rates among NFL Players with Short-Lived Income Spikes|We test for consumption smoothing using bankruptcy data on players in the National Football League (NFL), who typically earn several million dollars during an income spike that lasts a few years. The life-cycle hypothesis predicts that players should save substantially while playing and then have little risk of bankruptcy post-NFL. However, players in our sample begin to file for bankruptcy soon after they stop playing and continue filing at a high rate through at least the first 12 years of retirement. Players' total earnings and career lengths have surprisingly little effect on the risk of bankruptcy.
Z22|Performance Feedback Does Not Eliminate the Sunk-Cost Fallacy: Evidence From Professional Football|Empirical studies on the influence of sunk costs in high stakes decisions have come to mixed conclusions. As observational studies have primarily used professional sports labor markets, we analyze the effect of sunk costs, player compensation, on the labor utilization of defensive players in the National Football League (NFL). Our analysis has several advantages. First, we measure the direct impact of increased financial commitment. Second, we analyze the effect of sunk costs when firms have accurate and abundant performance feedback; therefore, our conclusions are not driven by uncertainty. Finally, we control for possible endogeneity by using the exogenous variation in compensation generated when players become eligible for free agency or change teams. Our results indicate sunk costs are significant determinants of player utilization. A 15 % increase in compensation has an equivalent effect on playing time as an increase of five to eleven solo tackles, one to two interceptions and two to five and a half sacks in the previous season for linebackers, defensive backs and defensive linemen respectively. Furthermore, the sunk-cost fallacy is persistent throughout the entire career of an average NFL player. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
Z22|Rank-Order Tournaments, Probability of Winning and Investing in Talent: Evidence from Champions' League Qualifying Rules|We analyse how a change in the probability of winning a tournament affects an agent's effort using the qualification rules for entry into the group and playoff stages of the UEFA Champions' League. Our results suggest that increasing the number of slots that a national league gets in the Champions' League leads to increases in investment in talent ex ante. This effect is largest among the teams that in the previous season just failed to qualify. This suggests that changes in prize structure leads to changes in investment decisions amongst those clubs most affected at the margin. However, we also find that incumbent teams that have already qualified for the Champions' League simultaneously raise their efforts, consistent with the occurrence of an arms race among top European football teams.

Z22|Network Dynamics in Emerging Regions of Europe|This important book focuses on post-Lisbon Agenda issues of alignment and misalignment on different dimensions of European society and the European economy, including industrial systems, R&D systems, educational systems and job markets. It also looks in particular at the peripheral regions of Europe — the less developed parts of ‘old’ Europe, the parts of old Europe that are outside or only half-inside the EU, the new member-states of the EU, and Turkey as the most important EU candidate country. It takes as its methodological starting point the theory of network alignment as developed in SPRU, notably by Nick von Tunzelmann, and builds on this to produce an incisive assessment of the institutions, individual actors and markets that drive the knowledge economy. In all of this, it sets the European picture firmly in the context of global developments in investment, labour and intellectual property flows. Key authors include the editor himself, von Tunzelmann, Andrea Salavetz of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Matija Rojec of the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia.
