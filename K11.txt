K11|Russia’s public sector and privatization policy in 2018|From 2016, statistical data began to be published in the framework of the System of Public Property Management Efficiency Estimates. It was approved by Decree of the RF Government No 72 dated January 29, 2015, and introduced by way of replacing the public sector monitoring data, collected and released by the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) since the early 2000s in accordance with the provisions stipulated in RF Government Decree No 1 dated January 4, 1999 (as amended on December 30, 2002). Among other things, the System contains data on the number of federal state unitary enterprises (FSUEs) and joint-stock companies (JSCs) with RF stakes in their capital. Previously, such data were usually published as part of government privatization programs (from 2011 – for three-year period, and prior to 2011 – for one-year period). In the current Forecast Plan (Program) of Federal Property Privatization and the Main Directions of Federal Property Privatization for 2017–2019, relevant data are available only as of early 2016 (Table 1), and so in order to describe the processes taking place over the period 2016–2018, one must rely on data in the System of Public Property Management Efficiency Estimates.
K11|The housing market in Russian cities in 2018|The preliminary results of the Russian economy’s development in 2018 appear to be rather controversial. On the one hand, the growth rate of GDP gained 2.3 percent; on the other, the consumer inflation index increased significantly, to 4.3 percent, from its record low of the entire period since the onset of market reforms (2.5 percent), achieved in 2017. The movement pattern of personal disposable income, which is a much more significant factor determining the situation in the real estate market, was quite volatile throughout the course of last year, with multiple trend reversals. In spite of the positive results of the first two quarters, probably achieved thanks to the current electoral cycle, in the end the personal disposable income index stayed roughly at the same level as in 2017. The RF Central Bank twice reduced its key rate over the course of H1 2018, to 7.25 percent per annum in early autumn. However, over the next few months it was once again hiked twice, and so returned to its level of late 2017 (7.75 percent). The tricky movement pattern of the key rate pushed down the interest rates on bank loans and notably improved the position of borrowers.
K11|Learning cooperation from the commons|"The paper discusses the link between commons as they might have been used in prehistoric Norway and the rules concerning the exploitation of the commons as found in the oldest known legislation for regions of Norway, Gulating Law and Frostating Law. One clear social dilemma has been identified: the setting of a common date for moving animals from the home fields up to the summer farms and home again in the fall. The problem was obvious and the solution not particularly difficult to institute. Many more problems were of course present, but they did not rise to the level of a social dilemma. All such problems were managed by the rules enacted by the bygdeting along with other problems of a community. In particular the process of inheritance, the problems of fencing, how to change borders between neighbours and between individually owned fields and the commons, were treated by extensive rules. The bygdeting managed such issues from prehistory until the 16th and 17th centuries when reforms initiated by the Danish-Norwegian kings started to take effect, making the rule-of-law more uniquely a task for the central authorities and of less concern for the local communities. Maybe the basic legacy of the long history of local rule was a strong belief in the court system, that it would secure the old saying: ""By law the land shall be built, not with unlaw wasted""."
K11|Decentralising the Patent System|This paper proposes a substantive re-think of the modern patent system. The patent system has come under intensive criticism in the past, and many scholars have proposed ways to improve it. Ideas for improvement include, e.g., prior-art bounties, contracting out examination and dynamic fee setting. However, many of these ideas have gone unheeded due to the cost of administering them and the rigidity of the patent system. We explore how distributed ledger technologies enable these major changes.
K11|Housing cooperatives are a growing presence in Australiaâ€™s housing system, providing a diversity of housing forms to a variety of household types across the income spectrum, typically serving low- and moderate-income households. International evidence shows that housing cooperatives can provide a range of housing from very low price points through to market rate in both non-urban and urban contexts. The research presented in this report reviewed a selection of international cooperative housing sectors in addition to the Australian context, with the aims of compiling current evidence for the social and financial benefits of housing cooperatives, to develop a framework to assess this in Australia; and to identify preliminary issues regarding the growth and diversification of housing cooperatives in Australia. Australian and international evidence for the benefits of housing cooperatives focuses on seven primary areas; greater levels of social capital, greater housing security and quality, health and wellbeing, skills acquisition, reduced costs, broader economic and development outcomes. Based on the international review, five factors can be seen to help the growth of cooperative housing in addition to supportive policy and/or public funding. Core amongst these are a stable asset base if the State itself is not the developer, access to appropriate finance, and familiarity and acceptance in the market. The growth and diversification of Australiaâ€™s cooperative housing sector requires assessment of its legislative and funding environment. Factors for consideration are: 1. Individual project viability; 2. Access to property title; 3. Appropriate development finance and resident mortgage mechanisms; 4. Policy support; 5. Appropriate regulation|No abstract is available for this item.
K11|“To destroy the settlement of estate”? the Glorious Revolution and estate acts of parliament, 1660–1702|This article sheds light on the way the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England affected property rights to land. From 1660 to 1702, the bulk of parliament’s legislative work was on estate acts that reorganized families’ rights to land use. Using a random sample of 65 estate acts, the article finds that the Revolution broadened political access to parliament. I show acts were primarily for members of parliament and their families, but new acts after 1688 had secondary connections to MPs as trustees. It also finds that the composition of the acts changed after the Revolution because landholders sought to break strict settlements, a new form of property conveyance. The findings establish the place of estate acts in the broad narrative of the Glorious Revolution and help to explain the development of capitalism in England.
K11|Why Is the Practice of Levirate Marriage Disappearing in Africa? HIV/AIDS as an Agent of Institutional Change|Levirate marriage, whereby a widow is inherited by male relatives of her deceased husband, has anecdotally been viewed as informal insurance for widows who have limited property rights. This study investigates why this widespread practice in sub-Saharan Africa has recently been disappearing. A developed game-theoretic analysis reveals that levirate marriage arises as a pure strategy subgame perfect equilibrium when a husband's clan desires to keep children of the deceased within its extended family and widows have limited independent livelihood means. Female empowerment renders levirate marriage redundant because it increases widows' reservation utility. HIV/AIDS also discourages a husband's clan from inheriting a widow who loses her husband to HIV/AIDS, reducing her remarriage prospects and thus, reservation utility because she is likely to be HIV positive. Consequently, widows' welfare tends to decline (increase) in step with the deterioration of levirate marriage driven by HIV/AIDS (female empowerment). By exploiting long-term household panel data drawn from rural Tanzania and testing multiple theoretical predictions relevant to widows' welfare and women's fertility, this study finds that HIV/AIDS is primarily responsible for the deterioration of levirate marriage. Young widows in Africa may need some form of social protection against the influence of HIV/AIDS.
K11|Homelessness, Property Rights and Institutional Logics|We explore whether there is evidence of property rights amongst the homeless, and if so, how these rights are governed. We show that although the homeless are able to derive some value from assets, and can exclude other members of their community, these rights are precarious and dependent upon state agents not seizing the â€œpropertyâ€ and overriding the communityâ€™s rules of the game. The transferring of assets are especially curtailed. We demonstrate the intersectionality of claims with respect to the same physical property from the varying perspectives of the claimants involved and how this differs depending on the property. Homeless people rely on a community logic to develop rules of the game which results in the appearance of a market logic. In the absence of formal institutions effectively operating in their spaces, they have constituted social norms which provide some semblance of property rights which are respected within the group.
K11|Will Ukraine Be Able to Establish Real Property Rights?|Over time, the necessary economic reforms have become so obvious that they have become politically possible in most places. The great problem has become the establishment of real property rights. By and large, Central and Eastern Europe have managed to accomplish that not least thanks to support from the European Union. In the former Soviet Union, however, only Georgia succeeded in that endeavor. The big question today is whether Ukraine will manage to do so, or whether it will be caught in a low-economic-growth trap. The three main elements that are needed are independent courts, autonomous prosecutors, and a law-abiding law enforcement, while no old secret police structures should be allowed to sabotage them.
K11|Evolving Practice in Land Demarcation|This paper analyzes social choice with respect to the demarcation of land boundaries, distinguishing between physical and legal demarcation. In contrast with the influential “land administration” literature and the World Bank’s policy guidelines, the analysis supports voluntary—instead of mandatory—demarcation as well as non-integrated services for land administration. Consistent with these theoretical arguments, the paper empirically verifies that demarcation conflicts play a lesser role in title-, land- and property-related litigation, which seems to increase in all these areas after physical demarcation is made mandatory. Relying on World Bank data, it also observes that linking and merging cadastres and land registries does not correlate with lower transaction costs.
K11|Dématérialiser la nature pour la faire entrer dans la sphère du marché|Cela fait longtemps que la nature est entrée dans le processus capitaliste dans ses dimensions matérielles, terre, ressources agricoles et minières, sous la forme de biens tangibles donc. Depuis quelques décennies, un phénomène nouveau apparaît. Des dimensions de la nature sont requalifiées en information, en services et en actifs financiers pour pouvoir à leur tour faire l’objet d’échanges marchands. Autrement dit une nouvelle classe de marchandises fictives apparaît (Karl Polanyi (1944)). Plutôt que de les nommer « immatérielles », je préfère parler de dématérialisation, car il s’agit d’un processus institutionnel, juridique et politique construit et voulu, et non d’une immanence. Analysant le cas des services écosystémiques, cet article propose une catégorisation permettant de comprendre comment l’institution marchande remodèle ainsi de grands pans de la nature, en trois grands moments. Le premier est celui de la qualification de la marchandise, qui vise à en définir les contours précis, la doter d’une mesure et de droits de propriété. Le deuxième processus est celui de l’évaluation, où l’objet considéré acquiert une valeur monétaire de référence. On parle quelquefois de monétisation. Le troisième et dernier moment de la création d’une marchandise fictive est celui de la valorisation. Il s’agit de dispositifs contractuels et/ou marchands qui transforment les valeurs en prix. Ce n’est qu’à cette ultime étape que de la valeur est effectivement créée, c’est-à-dire du capital. Malgré le caractère apparemment immatériel de ces nouvelles marchandises, les conséquences de leur création sur la nature et les relations que nous entretenons avec elle sont tout à fait matérielles.
K11|On (intellectual) property and other legal frameworks in the digital economy: An economic analysis of the law|The significance of data as an economic good in the digital economy quickly raises the question of who owns the data. More specifically, within the context of a data marketplace in which data is being exchanged or traded and where different bundles of rights (property rights) are trans-ferred (contract law) - an answer regarding the genuine assignment of property rights for data seems important. From an economic standpoint, this paper investigates the need for an (new) intellectual prop-erty right for data. Firstly, an overview of the status quo of the literature on property rights for data will be provided. This will be followed by an analysis of the characteristics of data as a good, clarifying the circumstances under which a market failure can occur. Accordingly, only a market failure situation will authorise economic policy intervention. Lastly, we will derive specific policy implications, offering economic reasoning on a new intellectual property right for data and spe-cifically pointing to other forms of law that may be more applicable for reaching an efficient allocation of data resources.
K11|That's classified! Inventing a new patent taxonomy|Patent studies inform our understanding of innovation. Any study of patenting involves classifying patent data according to a chosen taxonomy. The literature has produced numerous taxonomies, which means patents are being classified differently across studies. This potential inconsistency is compounded by a lack of documentation provided on existing taxonomies, making them diffcult to replicate. Because of this, we develop a new patent taxonomy using machine learning techniques, and propose a new methodology to automate patent classification. We contrast existing taxonomies with our own upon a widely used patent dataset. In a regression analysis of patent classes upon patent characteristics, we show that classification bias exists: the size, statistical significance, and direction of association of coefficients depend upon how a patent dataset has been classified. We recommend investigators adopt our approach to ensure future studies are comparable and replicable.

In contrast with the influential “land administration” literature and the World Bank’s policy guidelines, the analysis supports voluntary—instead of mandatory—demarcation as well as non-integrated services for land administration.

K11|Patent pools, vertical integration, and downstream competition|Patent pools are commonly used to license technologies to manufacturers. Whereas previous studies focused on manufacturers active in independent markets, we analyze pools licensing to competing manufacturers, allowing for multiple licensors and nonlinear tariffs. We find that the impact of pools on welfare depends on the industry structure: whereas they are procompetitive when no manufacturer is integrated with a licensor, the presence of vertically integrated manufacturers triggers a novel trade‐off between horizontal and vertical price coordination. Specifically, pools are anticompetitive if the share of integrated firms is large, procompetitive otherwise. We then formulate information‐free policies to screen anticompetitive pools.
K11|The European Patent System: A Descriptive Analysis|The European Patent System consists of national patent offices (NPOs) and the supranational European Patent Office (EPO). EPO and the NPOs have granted patents in Europe side-by-side since 1980. The resulting patent system is complicated and less coordinated than might be expected. Firms must consider a number of variables when selecting the route of patenting they take within this system: price, rigour of examination, duration of examination, quality of legal redress. To date there is little descriptive evidence on how firms choose between EPO and national offices. This paper provides a rich descriptive analysis of patenting in Europe. We analyze how origin, size and technological focus of companies, affect how they choose among patent offices within the EPS and report differences in examination durations and grant rates across patent offices.
K11|Efectos de las decisiones de inversión en la formalización de tierras de los hogares rurales colombianos|Este trabajo estima la efectividad de las inversiones permanentes en predios sobre la formalización de tierras de hogares rurales, en el contexto de la ley de reforma agraria colombiana. Utilizando un modelo de probabilidad lineal con efectos fijos de hogar, se encuentra que un aumento de 1% en estas inversiones aumenta en 0.22% la probabilidad de formalización, en tres microrregiones colombianas entre el 2010 y el 2016. Además, se propone una posible solución a sesgos por simultaneidad y selección entre la inversión y la formalización, con variables rezagadas e instrumentando con choques de precipitación. La investigación ofrece una explicación sobre la permanencia en la informalidad de los pequeños productores, a pesar de la creación de políticas que promueven la formalización.
K11|Financial frictions, real estate collateral, and small firm activity in Europe|We observe significant heterogeneity in the correlation between changes in house prices and the growth of small firms across certain countries in Europe. We find that, overall, the correlation is far greater in Southern Europe than in Northern Europe. Using a simple model, we show that this heterogeneity may relate to financial frictions in a country. We confirm the model’s propositions in a number of empirical analyses for the following countries in Northern and Southern Europe: the United Kingdom, Norway, France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal. Small firms in countries with higher financial frictions (for example, places where bankruptcy resolution is more difficult and/or takes longer) see a greater dependence on “stable” real estate collateral. This is most pronounced for opaque (for example, very young) firms. Through an extension to our model and our choice of specification, we show that our findings are most consistent with a collateral-value-based credit supply channel and rule out a consumer-driven demand effect.
K11|The public sector of the Russian economy: it’s size and dynamics|Two main channels can be pointed out whereby the state participates in value added chains: through the operation of companies with state stakes, and through the services (in a broader sense of the work) produced by enterprises with state stakes and budget-funded organizations. Consequently, the assessment of the state sector scope inside the national economy consists, as a rule, of two components: an analysis of the relative share of biggest companies with state stakes – state-owned enterprises (SOE) in a country's aggregate economic statistics (the scope of state ownership); and an estimation of the input of the general government sector (GGS) in GDP.
K11|Federal property and privatization policy|2016 saw first publication of data from a performance measures framework for federal property management that was adopted on January 29, 2015 by Russian Government’s executive order No. 72 in lieu of performance measures for a public sector monitoring conducted by Rosstat in the early 2000s in pursuance of the Russian Government’s executive order No. 1 dated January 4, 1999 (as further amended on December 30, 2002). The performance measures framework contains data for the number of federal state unitary enterprises (FSUEs) and joint-stock companies (JSCs) with government equity participation that were previously published in privatization programs over a 3-year period (since 2011) and one-year period (prior to 2011). A new Forecast Plan (Program) for Federal Property Privatization and Guidelines for Federal Property Privatization for 2017–2019 adopted early in 2017[1] contains data dated only as of early 2016 (Table 1). As of early 2017, according to the Report of the Federal Agency for State Property Management (hereinafter Rosimushchestvo) on the implementation of privatization program for 2017–2019, the Russian Federation owned 1108 FSUEs and held an interest of 11 and 17 percent in 1416 JSCs and LLCs, respectively, marking a decline from the previous year’s number of economic agents with the same legal form of business. However, developments and processes that took place in 2017 only can be described using data from the performance measures framework for federal property management.
K11|The housing market in Russia's cities in 2017|The actual development pattern displayed by the Russian economy in 2017 only in part answered the expectations voiced by the expert community in late 2016. First of all, last year there was no sustainable recovery at the macroeconomic level. Although the year-end GDP growth rate amounted to 1.5 percent, it still demonstrated rather strong volatility of its index over the course of the year. However, the professional participants of the real estate market, as well as Russian businesses in general, usually look not at GDP or industrial output indices, but at the exchange rate of the national currency, the movement of wages and salaries, and consumer demand, because the latter better describe the existing risks, while the movement pattern of GDP serves only as a background indicator.
K11|Plant Breeders’ Rights, Patents, and Incentives to Innovate| Both patents and Plant Breeders’ Rights (PBRs) can protect plant innovations. Unlike patents, PBRs allow farmers to save part of their harvest to replant. We analyze the impact of this exemption on prices and innovation in a monopoly setting. In a PBR regime, a monopolist might let farmers self-produce, and he over- or under-invests compared to socially optimal investments. Under a PBR and patent regime, large (small) innovations are more likely to be patented (protected with PBRs), but self-production is not completely prevented, private investments are often socially optimal, and incentives to innovate are boosted. However, overall effects on welfare are ambiguous.
K11|Minnelige avtaler ved grunnerverv|Statens vegvesens grunnerverv ender i større grad enn før med minnelig avtale enn skjønn. Etter 2000 har ca. 95 % av alle deres grunnerverv endt med minnelig avtale. Med bakgrunn i dette ønsker vi å undersøke hvorfor grunneiere inngår minnelig avtale. Vi har utarbeidet en spørreundersøkelse som vi har sendt til grunneiere som har inngått minnelig avtale ved grunnerverv. Spørreundersøkelsen har en svarprosent på 39,45 % og svarene har blitt brukt til forskjellige typer analyser, som sammen med resultatene har dannet grunnlaget for drøfting av problemstillinger. Analysene avslører at grunneierne har angitt forskjellige ting som utslagsgivende for deres avtale. Gjennomsnitt viser at vegens betydning for lokalsamfunnet er mest utslagsgivende. Videre kommer det frem at noen inngår avtale for å unngå skjønn, mens andre er fornøyd med erstatningen. Grunneiere inngår minnelig avtale fordi de får dekket behov som er nødvendig for dem for at de skal godta avtalen.
K11|Is a Blockchain-based conveyance system the next step in the financialisation of housing? The case of Sweden|This paper investigates the social and economic mechanisms of a blockchain technology in the area of land administration. In particular, it focuses, first, on an emerging blockchain-based solution in Sweden to change and improve its land administration system (LAS), and, second, on the 'upgraded' LAS' potential impacts to create more complex financial derivatives based on land and the built environment. We investigate how these changes influence housing markets at the interface with financial markets and how these changes impact on the economic organisation of the different stakeholders involved in these processes. The argument is developed using the case of Sweden, where Lantmäteriet, a government agency, is pioneering the use of blockchain technology for real-estate conveyance.
K11|Licensing with Free Entry|The literature on the licensing of an innovation has mainly focused on some speci c contract types. We show within the framework of a fairly general model that removing these contractual limitations will lead to extreme market outcomes. Speci cally, we nd that when the patentee can employ observable contracts that can condition on market entry, it can achieve the monopoly outcome. Furthermore, when the patentee can only use unconditional quantity forcing contracts, it captures the entire market, albeit not at monopoly price, via a single licensee. Our results point out to the signi cance, and perhaps the particularity, of observable, nonrenegotiable contracts.
K11|Property Rights to Frontier Land and Minerals: US Exceptionalism|Property rights are the most fundamental institution in any society. They determine who has decision-making authority over assets and who bears the costs and benefits of those decisions. They assign ownership, wealth, political influence, and social standing. They make markets possible; define timelines; and provide incentives for investment, innovation, and trade. They mitigate the losses of open access and provide the basis for long-term economic growth. Economists and economic historians have long recognized the importance of secure property rights for economic outcomes. Other political economy, philosophy, historical, and legal literatures emphasize different, but critical attributes based on how property rights are allocated and to whom. The linkages among the social, political, and economic effects are examined here with respect to US and Latin American frontier land and minerals. Property rights were sharply different across the two frontiers with apparent long-term consequences for economic growth, innovation, wealth distribution, private investment in public goods, as well as social and political stability. The distinct assignment of property rights to land and minerals is likely a basis for long-term US exceptionalism in economic performance, individualism, mobility, and optimism. The mechanisms through which property rights to land in a frontier society affect outcomes in a contemporary, highly urban one are complex. Because property rights to land were broadly distributed, Americans could participate in capital markets using land as collateral. This ability shaped opinions regarding markets, capitalism, and individual opportunity. In the 21st century, these critical attributes may be eroding, inviting more analysis from economists and economic historians.
K11|Douglass C. North: Transaction Costs, Property Rights, and Economic Outcomes|Douglass North asked why some societies historically and contemporarily have rising per-capita incomes and individual welfare, whereas others do not? He argued that successful economies had property rights that encouraged markets, trade, and investment in new production and organizational methods. In other economies, transaction costs, especially those due to the political process, blocked more efficient property rights. Property rights grant decision making over valuable resources and are the basis for investment, and market exchange. They mold the economy and the distribution of wealth and political power. Politicians and coalitions of privileged elites with stakes in the status quo join to preserve it. Inefficiencies create their own constituencies. There is no clear remedy for general citizens in North’s cases. Despite the power of North’s argument, transaction costs are not clear in aggregate studies of economies. They are more apparent in US common-pool resource problems with large, continuing losses in resource rents. This evidence runs counter to the facile arguments in the welfare and environmental economics literatures for addressing externalities that are reminiscent of the simplistic recommendations in the growth and economic history literatures that North challenged. If the observed costly political response to open access losses is characteristic of regulation in general, then welfare losses permeate developed economies as well and are more pervasive than the dramatic examples of development failure examined by North and others. Mitigation requires competitive interest groups that benefit from more secure property rights and greater resource rents to offset powerful elites that align with politicians and capture bureaucratic agencies to achieve particularistic benefits that undermine general welfare.
K11|Federal Lands, Opportunity Costs, and Bureaucratic Management|The federal government owns and administers 472, 892,659 acres or 21% of the land area of the lower US, making it both the country’s largest land owner and among the largest by a central government among western democracies. This condition is surprising, given that the US generally is viewed as more oriented toward private property rights and markets. The land largely is managed by the US Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, staffed by unelected, career civil servants who hold tenure to their positions. Access and use regulations are administered by agency officials who have wide latitude under all-purpose legislation passed by Congress. Their actions are influenced by bureaucratic incentives and by lobby groups seeking to influence federal land policy. General citizens have little information about how policies are determined and only costly recourse to challenge them. Other than the comparatively small, 27,400,000 acres in National Parks, most of the land has no important amenity values nor apparent major externalities associated with use. These lands were to be transferred to private claimants under 19th century land laws. This paper examines how this vast area came to be withheld by the federal government and the role of the environmental movement in the process. Market failure and externalities were asserted justifications, but there is no strong supportive evidence. Although externalities were possible, the most obvious solution was to define property rights more completely. This option was and remains rejected by politicians, agency officials, and those lobby groups that sought permanent management and control over federal lands. Sustained-yield was an overarching objective, but it is a biological and not an economic concept and the human welfare outcomes of bureaucratic management may be large.
K11|A Theory of Patent Portfolios|This paper develops a theory of patent portfolios in which firms accumulate an enormous amount of related patents, which makes it impractical to develop new products that avoid inadvertent infringement. We show that patent peace arises if product market competition is weak and patent portfolios are either sufficiently weak or sufficiently strong with comparable size. An increase in one firm's patent portfolio reduces the innovation incentives of its rivals but does not necessarily increase its own. Firms with larger patent portfolios have stronger incentives to acquire additional patents, while consumers may be better off if firms with weaker portfolios acquire them.
K11|Women's Property Rights and Outreach of Microfinance Institutions Targeting Women| The right to legally own and control property is vital to the ability of an individual to receive credit. Women in developing countries often lack property rights and are therefore at a disadvantage when applying for loans. In addition, even where women have been granted equal or near-equal rights as men, there is often a disconnect between what is codified as law and what occurs in practice. Therefore, I seek to examine how women’s property rights, both as codified and in enforcement, affect outreach activities of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) serving women. I initially hypothesized that in MFIs targeting women, the breadth of outreach to women would be positively affected by both the legal strength and enforcement of women’s property rights. Results of a Heckman selection model and a Seemingly Unrelated Regression model both contradict that initial hypothesis, instead showing that MFIs give a far greater portion of their loan funds to women clients in countries with more discriminatory women’s property rights, and that enforcement of property rights does not show any significant effect on the ability of MFIs to reach women borrowers.
K11|Property Rights in Sequential Exchange|We analyze the “sequential exchange” problem in which traders have imperfect information on earlier contracts. We show that under sequential exchange, it is in general not possible to simultaneously implement two key features of markets—specialization between asset ownership and control, and impersonal trade. In particular, we show that in contrast with the conventional wisdom in economics, strong property rights—enforceable against subsequent buyers—may be detrimental to impersonal trade because they expose asset buyers to the risk of collusive relationships between owners and sellers. Finally, we provide conditions under which a mechanism that overcomes the trade-off between specialization and impersonal trade exists. We characterize and discuss such mechanism. Our results provide an efficiency rationale for how property rights are enforced in business, company and real estate transactions, and for the ubiquitousness of “formalization” institutions that the literature has narrowly seen as entry barriers. (JEL D23, D83, K11, K22)
K11|Property as sequential exchange: the forgotten limits of private contract|The contractual, single-exchange framework in Coase (1960) contains the implicit assumption that exchange in property rights does not affect future transaction (i.e., trading) costs. This is pertinent for analyzing use externalities but limits our understanding of property institutions: a central problem of property markets lies in the interaction among multiple transactions, which causes exchange-related and non-contractible externalities. By retaining a single-exchange simplification, the economic analysis of property has encouraged views that: (1) overemphasize the initial allocation of property rights, while some form of recurrent allocation is often needed; (2) pay scant attention to legal rights, although these determine enforceability and, therefore, economic value; and (3) overestimate the power of unregulated private ordering, despite its inability to protect third parties. These three biases have been misleading policy in many areas, including land titling and business firm formalization.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K11|How should we model property? Thinking with my critics|Inspired by comments made by Allen (2017), Lueck (2017), Ménard (2017) and Smith (2017), this response clarifies and deepens the analysis in Arruñada (2017a). Its main argument is that to deal with the complexity of property we must abstract secondary elements, such as the physical dimensions of some types of assets, and focus on the interaction between transactions. This sequential-exchange framework captures the main problem of property in the current environment of impersonal markets. It also provides criteria to compare private and public ordering, as well as to organize public solutions that enable new forms of private ordering. The analysis applies the lessons in Coase (1960) to property by not only comparing realities but also maintaining his separate treatment of the definition of property rights and transaction costs. However, it replaces his contractual, single-exchange, framework for one in which contracts interact, causing exchange externalities.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K11|How to make land titling more rational|Substantial variety exists among systems of land and business formalization both over time and across countries. For instance, England relied on private titling and delayed land registration for centuries. In contrast, early on, its American colonies imported land recordation and its Australian colonies land registration. Similarly, in most of the world, governments used to allow voluntary land titling, in which owners decide whether they register their land. Recently, however, governments and international agencies have more often opted for universal titling, aiming to register all the land in a certain region. This paper critically examines these strategies, analyzing the costs and benefits of the two main decisions: whether to create a public titling system or to rely exclusively on private titling, and the choice between voluntary and universal titling. It concludes that universal titling is seldom optimal. In particular, it argues that lack of titling is more a consequence than a cause of poverty.
K11|One man’s trash is another man’s treasure: A comparative analysis of property rights in solid waste|Previous literature has studied waste picking as an economic, social and environmental phenomenon of great importance in countries characterized by ineffective waste collection and recycling programs. The legal foundations of waste picking have, however, received little scholarly attention. Surveys conducted with waste pickers from 5 cities (Bogotá, Pune, Belo Horizonte, Durban, Nakuru) find that existing, and often hostile, regulations and competition from new entrants are key concerns for the waste pickers. In this paper, I argue that any system of legal rules that tries to exclude the waste pickers from the waste value chain results in high transaction costs and risks further aggravating existing social injustices. Several inclusive property right regimes are conceivable, from waste picker ownership of waste to a res nullius (nobody’s property) regime complemented by a right of first possession. Res nullius creates incentives for the stakeholders of waste to specialize in different segments of the collection and recycling chain. Possible drawbacks of this regime are dissipating rents because of open access to waste.
K11|Endowments, Exclusion, and Exchange|We propose a new cooperative solution for discrete exchange economies and resource allocation problems, the exclusion core. The exclusion core is neither weaker nor stronger than the (strong) core and it rests upon a foundational idea in the legal understanding of property, the right to exclude others. By reinterpreting endowments as a distribution of exclusion rights, we can extend our analysis to economies with qualified property rights and social hierarchies. The exclusion core characterizes a generalized top trading cycle algorithm in a large class of economies, including those featuring private and public ownership.
K11|Formal and informal appropriation mechanisms: The role of openness and innovativeness|This paper analyses how firmsâ€™ degree of openness and innovativeness influence their use of formal and informal appropriation mechanisms. Patents, trademarks, copyrights, and design rights are formal appropriation mechanisms. Secrecy, lead-time, and complexity are examples of informal appropriation mechanisms. Both external search breadth and depth are positively associated with firmsâ€™ use of informal appropriation mechanisms, while only external search breadth is positively associated with formal appropriation mechanisms. Firmsâ€™ degree of radical (incremental) innovation orientation is negatively (positively) associated with their use of formal appropriation mechanisms. Analysis of the joint impact of openness and innovativeness, suggests that for radical innovators it is external search breadth (rather than depth) that has a positive association with the use of informal appropriation mechanisms. In contrast, for radical innovators external search depth (rather than breadth) is associated with the use of formal appropriation mechanisms. For incremental innovators, external search breadth (rather than depth) is associated with the use of both formal and informal appropriation mechanisms.
K11|Thou shalt not steal. Taking aversion with legal property claims|Abstract Some recent experimental literature on the taking game (a variation of the dictator game) suggests that human subjects may generally be taking averse, implying that the moral cost of taking exceeds the moral cost of not giving. In our experiment, our subjects could decide to take tangible objects (lottery scratchcards) brought from outside the lab and thus legally owned by other subjects. This legal treatment was compared with a more standard one where subjects earned their scratchcards inside the lab. Evidence is provided of a (weak) taking aversion that is greater when property is established inside the lab via an effort task than when it is pre-existing and legally enforceable outside the lab
K11|Housing market in Russia in 2016|According to the data released by the Bank of Russia, as of July 1, 2016, the number of credit institutions issuing residential loans (RL) and housing mortgage loans (HNL) fell to 680 and constituted 85.3% of their number as of July 1, 2015 (Table 16). Herewith, the number of credit institutions issuing RL came to 522 and those extending HML – 499, and those attracting refinancing on the HML secondary market – 34. Moreover, the number of credit institutions extending housing mortgage loans secured by the right of foreclosure on agreements of participation in shared construction came to 212 as of July 1, 2016.
K11|Dynamics of prices on residential real estate|The paper deals with the issues of price dynamics on residential property on secondary and primary markets.
K11|The public sector and privatization policy|In 2016, statistical data began to be published in the framework of the newly introduced System of Public Property Management Efficiency Estimates. It was approved by Decree of the RF Government of 29 January 2015, No 72 and introduced by way of replacing the public sector monitoring data, collected and released by the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) since the late 1990s in accordance with the provisions stipulated in Decree of the RF Government of January 4, 1999, No 1 (as amended as of December 30, 2002). Among other things, the System of Public Property Management Efficiency Estimates contains data on the number of federal state unitary enterprises (FSUEs) and joint-stock companies (JSCs) with RF stakes in their capital, which previously were published as part of government privatization programs (from 2011 – for three-year period, and prior to 2011- for one-year period.
K11|The economics of ownership, access and trade in digital data|Despite the rapidly growing volume and economic importance of data in the digital economy, the legal framework for data ownership, access and trade remains incompletely defined in the EU and elsewhere. De facto data ownership dominates and often leads to fragmentation or anti-commons problems in data. Combined with limited access and trade, this inhibits the realisation of the full economic benefits of non-rival data. It may slow down innovation and affect the efficiency of data markets. We examine three potential sources of data market failures: externalities related to economies of scope in data, strategic behaviour of data owners and transaction costs in data exchanges. We link the legal debate on data ownership with relevant branches of the economics literature, including intellectual property rights economics, the commons and anti-commons literature, models of trade under the Arrow Information Paradox and multi-sided markets. Economists are inclined to think that well-defined private property rights are a necessary condition for an efficient resource allocation. The question in this paper is to what extent this view holds for non-rival data. We show that the allocation of data ownership or residual control rights matters, not only for private benefits but also for social welfare. The outcomes of bargaining over data ownership and access rights do not necessarily maximize social welfare. Can regulators intervene to improve these outcomes? Would a better specification of legal ownership rights or introducing access provisions to improve efficiency and reduce data market failures? There are no easy answers to these largely empirical questions. We offer no policy solutions yet and more research is required to bring economics up to speed with these questions.
K11|Geo-blocking of Non Audio-visual Digital Media Content in the EU Digital Single Market|This study measures the extent of cross-border geo-blocking and the impact on product availability and pricing for three non-audio-visual digital media products (music, e-books and games) in the EU Digital Single Market. We find that cross-border access to online media stores is generally blocked for the products and distributors surveyed in this study, though it can usually be circumvented. By contrast, cross-border availability is high, reaching around 98.6% for e-books on Amazon, 90% for downloadable music on iTunes, and 81.1% and 90.5% respectively for PS3 and PS4 PlayStation games. We could not directly verify cross-border availability of music in streaming services but a small sample test suggests that it could reach around 96% on Spotify. We find that the frequency of cross-country price differentiation is limited for games in the Sony PlayStation stores (less than 4%) but higher for downloadable music in the Apple iTunes stores (11.5%) and Amazon e-book stores (26%). Much of this price differentiation is driven by exchange rates and rounding off prices in country stores not denominated in Euro. In music, price discrimination is used mostly to extract higher prices from high-income consumers and for more popular songs with a lower price elasticity of demand. Subscription prices for main music streaming services are strongly correlated with country per capita income levels. Geographical market differentiation and geo-blocking in digital media is often attributed to the territoriality of the copyright management regime. In most cases rights holders are in a position to issue multi-territorial licenses. For commercial reasons however they may prefer to exercise their rights on a territorial basis. The welfare effect of geo-blocking on sellers can be safely assumed to be positive otherwise sellers would not apply this commercial strategy. The impact on consumer welfare is a-priori ambiguous. Geo-blocking reduces the extent of product variety available to consumers. Whether it increases or reduces consumer welfare is an empirical question. The data required to empirically estimate the impact of (lifting) geo-blocking restrictions on welfare are held by the private platform operators. A future assessment can only be made if the required data on product prices and sales are made available to independent researchers. Lifting geo-blocking restrictions will induce price arbitrage between country markets. That may put pressure on sellers to reduce price differentiation and push some prices up, others down. The price response of sellers is hard to predict and may have repercussions not only on downstream consumers but also on upstream parts of the supply chain. Price convergence is unlikely to be perfect and some differentiation may continue to exist because trade costs between country stores may not fall to zero (exchange rates, means of payment, linguistic trade barriers, etc.).
K11|Barriers to European cross-border E-commerce|We analyse survey data to investigate the main barriers to European cross-border e-commerce. We investigate the determinants of selling online, as well as the frequency and determinants of cross-border e-commerce, and the role of barriers. Large firms, which are part of a group, are more likely to sell online. Firms generally make most of their online sales to their home country, although EU firms are more likely to engage in cross-border online trade with EU countries than non-EU countries. Firms report that they are facing a variety of barriers to e-commerce. Regulatory barriers are negatively associated with online sales. There is weak evidence that firms which use their own websites are more vulnerable to financial, market and information barriers. Firms that use a large platform experience fewer financial and market barriers. On the positive side, we find that small and young firms do not seem to be more vulnerable to barriers than large or more experienced firms.
K11|The competitive landscape of online platforms|This paper describes the different forces that shape the market structure of four different 'online platform ecosystems' and the competition between them. The paper focuses on the following categories of platforms, which represent a wide scope of online activities: (i) e-commerce marketplaces; (ii) app stores; (iii) social media; and (iv) online advertising platforms. A central concern is to provide descriptive, empirical evidence on the relative strength of the forces operating in each case. In the past decade or so, many theoretical and conceptual contributions have been very helpful in developing a clear understanding of many of the issues around multi-sided markets, and have analysed these activities from many different perspectives. Unfortunately, they have provided hardly any empirical evidence. This paper attempts to reduce the lack of empirical evidence available on online platforms.
K11|"Trade, competition and welfare in global online labour markets: A ""gig economy"" case study"|This study focuses on collaborative economy platforms that specialize in purely digital tasks that require no physical delivery or proximity between workers and their clients, which we call Online Labour Markets (OLMs). They have a global reach. There is a debate on job fragmentation and deteriorating working conditions in OLMs. This study emphasizes the economic opportunities and explores (a) the drivers of global trade in digital tasks, (b) the determinants of online wages and (c) the welfare impact of OLMs on workers and employers. This is a case study based on data obtained from a single UK-based OLM. Our findings cannot necessarily be generalised to other OLMs with different characteristics. Using panel data we find that the vast majority of employers are located in high-income countries while many workers are located in low-income countries. Workers in low-income countries are motivated to participate mostly by labour productivity gains and the corresponding higher wages. Workers in high income countries combine opportunities for additional work and income with the benefits of flexible time use and other non-wage benefits. Employers are motivated by wage savings and task unbundling. Despite the global nature of digital OLMs, there is an impression of home bias in hiring. OLMs are heterogeneous markets where about half of all transactions are settled above the lowest price bid. Workers' skills and experience as well as their countries of residence have an impact on the agreed wage and the probability of being hired. Worker quality signaling induces superstar effects and a very uneven distribution of work. Taking into account only the difference between online and offline wages in the countries of residence of workers and employers we estimate that this particular OLM has positive monetized welfare effects, both for workers (+17%) and even more so for employers (+70%). Unobservable non-monetized benefits such as increased flexibility and savings in transport or migration costs for workers and task unbundling for employers give a further boost to welfare. The extent of unbundling is demonstrated by the very short duration of the average task in this OLM: slightly less than 8 hours. Workers in this case study platform are self-employed and responsible for compliance with regulations in their country of residence.
K11|Quality discrimination in online multi-sided markets|"The aim of this paper is to explain evidence of unfair practices by online platforms towards business users, particularly SME's. First, using survey data, we show that sellers operating with four different categories of platforms multi-home (marketplaces, app stores, social networks and online advertising). Hence, the appropriate competitive framework is the ""competitive bottleneck"" model. Second, we develop an empirical model of platform competition adding an additional dimension: service quality. The results indicate that the costs of providing quality to sellers are higher than the costs of providing quality to buyers. These differences may reflect different needs or preferences across groups. While buyers would require simple functionalities sellers would need more sophisticated services. When sellers' multi-home, platforms care more about buyers than sellers and while buyers will get an efficient level of quality, quality to sellers will be ""degraded"". We argue that this service quality degradation explain unfair trading practices simply because platforms are not willing to invest to take care of sellers."
K11|Platforms to business relations in online platform ecosystems|This report presents evidence on the relationship between online platforms and businesses using these platforms to reach consumers or conduct their operations. First, we review the literature on vertical relationships both from a classic approach and from a multi-sided market perspective. Second, we use survey data to explain the factors behind firms’ choice of online channel. Third, we explore the results of a survey passed to firms using platforms to understand their concerns about the behaviour of some of these online gatekeepers. Finally, we offer some conclusions.
K11|Stabilize the peasant economy: Governance of foreclosure by the shogunate|Regulation of foreclosure in a financial crisis has been a centuries-long conundrum to authorities. Japan in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries had free financial, land and coercive labor markets. It raised the growth but resulted in recurrent financial crises. Therefore, the Edo shogunate, 1600–1868, banned coercive labor, protected peasants’ property right and regulated the farmland-collateral loans. Seeking an appropriate degree of regulation, the shogunate first banned foreclosure and invited a credit shrink. Then the shogunate introduced legislation to legalize foreclosure of pledged farmland as clarifying the rights of borrowers. The regulation asymmetrically lowered interest rates for timely repayment.
K11|Women's Inheritance Rights Reform and the Preference for Sons in India|We investigate whether legislation of equal inheritance rights for women modifies the historic preference for sons in India, and find that it exacerbates it. Children born after the reform in families with a first-born daughter are 3.8–4.3 percentage points less likely to be girls, indicating that the reform encouraged female foeticide. We also find that the reform increased excess female infant mortality and son-biased fertility stopping. This suggests that the inheritance reform raised the costs of having daughters, consistent with which we document an increase in stated son preference in fertility post-reform. We conclude that this is a case where legal reform was frustrated by persistence of cultural norms. We provide some suggestive evidence of slowly changing patrilocality norms.
K11|Measuring Innovation with Patents when Patenting is Strategic|I model a firm's decision to create an invention and, separately, her decision to protect that invention with intellectual property (IP). Because external forces, such as industry characteristics or policy regimes, can affect the innovation and protection decisions differently, the model predicts that innovation measures based on IP usage, such as patent counts, may not correlate with innovative effort. For example, the threat of competition generally has an inverse-U shaped relationship with observed patenting but has a normal-U relationship with innovative effort. In this case, the average quality of a firm's patent portfolio is a better proxy for innovation. I derive general conditions under which various patent statistics, such as quality-adjusted patenting or average patent quality, are useful proxies for how innovation responds to external influences.
K11|On security of collateral in Danish mortgage finance: a formula of property rights, incentives and market mechanisms|Abstract Specialized mortgage intermediaries in Denmark have for over 200 years provided owners and buyers of real property wide access to credit. The present paper sets out to explore the safeguards that nurtured development of a robust, market based financing system and a deep mortgage market. Observations are made on the nature of collateral performance in respect to property rights, mortgage law and market development in search of general features of required institutional arrangements. The robustness of the Danish mortgage finance system is largely accredited to the securitization model based on the balance principle that assigns risks and responsibility to market players in a self-disciplinary manner and protected the mortgage banks against cash flow mismatches even during deep crisis, as history attests. It is shown how property registers and effective enforcement have created transparent property rights and practically reduced legal risks of mortgaging to zero. Standardization and scale of economics supported collateral efficiency, as measured in terms of simplicity, transparency, rapidity and costs. The Danish mortgage finance system illustrates the critical role of government in insuring the quality and enforceability of mortgage collateral, and reducing uncertainty for market players throughout the entire process. The paper suggests that sound incentive structures of the securitization model, strong commitment mechanisms and the market mechanisms constituted a complex formula of safeguards that—rather than specific capital coverage requirements—created the preconditions required for a well-functioning mortgage market.
K11|The Coase Mechanism and the Iteration Argument|The “iteration argument” presented in Schlicht (1996) shows that the allocation of property rights may generate inefficiencies, contrary to what the “Coase Theorem,” as commonly understood, asserts. The argument may be summarized by saying that markets (and bargaining) cease to function properly if several people are entitled and prepared to engage in the same externality-ridden activity and each of them has to be bribed individually from being the first offender. Given that the harm from pollution does not rise linearily with the amount of pollution, the sum-total of the damages produced when all of the potential offenders engage in the harmful activity may be smaller than the sum-total of the bribes which must be offered to prevent each potential offender from starting the offensive activity, even if the ensuing social damages exceed the associated private returns and an inefficient outcome is obtained. If pollution without permission by the community is not permitted, a different – and in this case efficient – outcome results. This note illustrates the argument by means of a simple example. It is an excerpt of Schlicht (1997).
K11|Efficient Compensation: Lessons from Civil Liability|This paper deals with compensation requirements ensuring efficient incentives in a setting with two active parties whose decisions affect a third party through an external effect. To achieve efficient incentives under civil liability, expectation damages should be based on a reasonable-person standard, and enrichments due to deviations from obligations may have to be returned. Adapting these lessons to the takings interpretation of the model would require unusual steps, unheard of in actual compensation practice. Yet, if taking decisions are reached in line with theories of public choice, an externality is implicitly present that, if neglected, tends to distort incentives.
K11|The Valuation of Moral Rights: A Field Experiment|U.S. intellectual property law is firmly rooted in utilitarian principles. Copyright law is viewed as a means to give proper monetary incentives to authors for their creative effort. Many European copyright systems pursue additional goals: Authors have the right to be named as author, to control alterations and to retract their work in case their artistic beliefs have changed. Protecting these “moral rights” might be justified by the preferences of typical authors. We present the first field experiment on moral rights revealing the true valuation of these rights by over 200 authors from 24 countries. A majority of authors are not willing to trade moral rights in the first place. They demand substantial prices in case they decide to trade. The differences between authors from the U.S. and Europe are small. These results call into question whether moral rights protection should differ across the Atlantic and whether a purely profit-based theory of copyright law is sufficient to capture the complex relationship between human behavior and creativity.
K11|How to Protect Entitlements: An Experiment|We study the effects of legal protection on the likelihood of efficient trade. Fairness norms that affect the parties' willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA) may depend on how strongly the entitlement is protected. We show that our participants can be divided into three groups corresponding to three fairness norms: negative types, whose WTP and WTA are decreasing in the strength of the legal remedy; positive types, whose WTP and WTA are increasing in the strength of the legal remedy; and flat types, whose WTP and WTA do not depend on the strength of the legal remedy. We find that type is role dependent such that a higher WTP and a lower WTA--the combination most conducive to efficient trade--is obtained with a weaker legal remedy.
K11|How Transaction Costs Obstruct Collective Action: Evidence from California’s Groundwater|Collective action to remedy the losses of open access to common-pool resources often is late and incomplete, extending rent dissipation. Examples include persistent over-exploitation of oil fields and ocean fisheries, despite general agreement that production constraints are needed. Transaction costs encountered in assigning property rights are an explanation, but analysis of their role is limited by a lack of systematic data. We examine governance institutions in California’s 445 groundwater basins using a new dataset to identify factors that influence the adoption of extraction controls. In 309 basins, institutions allow unconstrained pumping, while an additional 105 basins have weak management plans. Twenty of these basins are severely overdrafted. Meanwhile, users in 31 basins have defined groundwater property rights, the most complete solution. We document the critical role of transaction costs in explaining this variation in responses. This research adds to the literatures on open access, transaction costs, bargaining, and property rights
K11|Collective Action, White Flight, and the Origins of Formal Segregation Laws|This paper develops and tests a simple model to explain the origins of municipal segregation ordinances. Passed by cities between 1909 and 1917, these ordinances prohibited members of the majority racial group on a given city block from selling or renting property to members of another racial group. Our results suggest that prior to these laws cities had created and sustained residential segregation through private norms and vigilante activity. Only when these private arrangements began to break down during the early 1900s did whites start lobbying municipal governments for segregation ordinances.
K11|Patent Examiner Specialization|We study the matching of patent applications to examiners at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Using test statistics originally developed to identify industry agglomeration, we find strong evidence that examiners specialize in particular technologies, even within relatively homogeneous art units. Examiner specialization is more pronounced in the biotechnology and chemistry fields, and less in computers and software. Evidence of specialization becomes weaker, but does not completely disappear, if we condition on technology sub-classes. There is no evidence that certain examiners specialize in applications that have greater importance or broader claims. More specialized examiners have a lower grant rate and produce a larger narrowing of claim-scope during the examination process. We discuss implications for instrumental variables based on examiner characteristics.
K11|Neutralnosc podatkowa przy dzierzawie gospodarstwa rolnego lub jego skladnikow na cele rolnicze|Jedna z form lokowania wolnych srodkow pienieznych przez osoby fizyczne sa nieruchomosci. Zainteresowanie wzbudzaja zarowno nieruchomosci lokalowe jak i gruntowe. Zakresem przedmiotowym przytaczanej tresci objeto nieruchomosci wystepujace w postaci gruntow rolnych. Do pierwszego maja 2016 r. kazda osoba fizyczna mogla stac sie wlascicielem gruntow rolnych. Swobodny zakup ziemi rolnej ograniczono restrykcyjnymi przepisami ustawy z 11 kwietnia 2003 r. o ksztaltowaniu ustroju rolnego (Dz.U. Z 2012 r. poz. 803 ze zm.) . Zmiana przepisow dotyczaca swobodnego obrotu nieruchomosciami rolnymi nie spowodowala tego, (chociaz ku temu zmierza), ze grunty rolne pozostaja jedynie w rekach rolnikow. Osoby fizyczne, ktore nabyly ziemie przed 1 majem 2016 r., a nie sa zwiazane z rolnictwem udostepniaja ja innym w drodze umowy najmu czy tez dzierzawy. Otrzymywany czynsz jest korzyscia majatkowa, ktora prawo podatkowe traktuje w szczegolny sposob. Pozytki osiagane w drodze dzierzawy przez osobe fizyczna niezwiazana z rolnictwem sa traktowane w swietle podatku dochodowego od osob fizycznych na preferencyjnych zasadach. Celem artykulu jest analiza opodatkowania dochodow uzyskiwanych przez osoby fizyczne z tytulu udostepniania nieruchomosci rolnych osobom trzecim. W opracowaniu zastosowano analize regulacji prawnych dotyczacych dzialalnosci rolniczej i podatku dochodowego od osob fizycznych. Dla okreslenia rozbieznosci w opodatkowaniu czynszu z dzierzawy nieruchomosci rolnej na cele rolnicze i nierolnicze posluzono sie analiza porownawcza i dedukcja. Wynagrodzenie otrzymywane z dzierzawy gospodarstwa rolnego lub jego skladnikow na cele rolnicze nie stanowi zrodla przychodow w rozumieniu podatku dochodowego od osob fizycznych. Przychody uzyskiwane z udostepniania osobom trzecim innych nieruchomosci lub gospodarstw rolnych na cele nierolnicze podlegaja opodatkowaniu podatkiem dochodowym od osob fizycznych. Tutaj otrzymywany czynsz stanowi zrodlo przychodow w podatku dochodowym od osob fizycznych i podlega zgloszeniu do wlasciwego urzedu skarbowego.
K11|The firm as a common. The case of the accumulation and use of capital resources in co-operative enterprises|Contemporary literature dealing with the governance of the exploitation of common-pool natural resources was initiated by Elinor Ostrom in 1990, and has been growing fast ever since. On the contrary, within the same research stream, the study of the presence and economic role of common resources in entrepreneurial-organizational is, to date, under-researched. This work endeavours some attempt to fill this gap by: first, spelling out a new-institutionalist framework for the analysis of the accumulation and governance of common capital resources within organizational boundaries; second, by considering co-operative enterprises as the organizational form that, on the basis of historical record, and of behavioural and institutional characteristics, demonstrated to be the most compatible with a substantial role for common and non-divided asset-ownership and with its governance thereof. The economic forces influencing the optimal level of self-financed common capital resources in co-operatives are enquired. Also their governance is brought under the spotlight, evidencing: (i) the constraints that need to be fulfilled, and the potential benefits arising out of their presence; (ii) the compatibility and mutual adaptability between democratic governance in co-operatives and the governance of non-divided assets.
K11|Human Rights and Sovereign Debts in the Context of Property and Creditor Rights|Post-War conceptions of human rights have evolved independently of long-established theory and practice of property and creditor rights, to the detriment of the development and implementation of human rights law. This chapter attempts to build a first bridge between these two fields of law. It begins by recalling the strikingly different origin and implementation of ‘human’ versus property and creditor rights, because the differences have significant implications. Human rights laws are more honoured in the breach than in the observance in most parts of the world, principally because states accepted international standards governing the treatment of their own nationals in their own territory while reserving to themselves the sovereign right to enforce those rights as they saw fit. In sharp contrast, when it comes to property and creditor rights, there are few gaps between principled intentions, legal mandates, and actual enforcement. Property and creditor rights are important for the attainment of other human rights, especially those of an economic nature, and many human rights are connected to, and are rather inseparable from, broadly conceived property rights. There follows a discussion of the still wide gap between aspirational human rights and economic reality. The time has come for human rights scholars to ratchet down their expectations to match the very limited capacity of low-income and formerly communist countries most prone to human rights deficiencies to import the Western European welfare state model. The final section focuses on the poorly understood interconnections between sovereign debts and human rights. Neglect of property and creditor-rights considerations has led many contemporary human rights advocates down an infertile, if not inappropriate, intellectual and policy path. Speculation that contracts governing cross-border debts and investments may not be sufficiently compelling, at least relative to human rights commitments, is unwarranted and counterproductive.
K11|Why Countries Shouldn't Sell Their Natural Resources To Foreigners|Years ago, I recommended that my City, my Polis, Gloucester, MA, never sell its natural resources to any outsider. Last year, with the passing of Fidel Castro, I saw a possibility for Cuba to become finally free. Naturally, I urged Cubans not to repeat the errors made by Russia and China at the collapse of communism; I urged Cubans not to sell their natural resources to the oligarchs, whether local or foreign. This time around, I also urged Cubans not to repeat the political errors of the past, namely trying to correct horrors of the left with horrors of the right; this time around I urged Cubans and anyone else who might want to hear to achieve a revolution from the center of the political system. With the forthcoming elections in Kenya, in the hope of averting the bloodshed that followed the 2007 elections there, I recently felt impelled to enlarge my focus to appeal to every nation in Africa, and the rest of the world for that matter, not to sell their natural resources to foreigners. The financial resources to achieve this goal are the same the world over: One must organize local financial resources, through: 1. Any such instrument as a Local Interdependence Fund; and 2. A reform of central bank operations to issue a) loans only to create real wealth; b) loans at cost; c) loans to benefit as many people as possible, hence loans to individual entrepreneurs, cooperatives, corporations with ESOPs and/or CSOPs, and to public agencies with taxing power to fund public works projects.
K11|Legal Systems and Blockchain Interactions|A large amount of money is spent globally in the litigation process. A significant chunk of litigations can actually be prevented from even arising if the policies, contracts and laws can be fully objectivised. Presently, the interpretation of law, contracts, policies etc. lead to a lot of confusion and ambiguities. This complicates the justice process. This paper deals with simplifying the legal procedures by using Blockchain Technology. Firstly I introduce the concept of Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies. Then we discuss the present legal services. The ways in which Blockchain technology can be applied to legal processes is identified. Civil and Common law systems are the most widespread in the world. The probable impact of Blockchain on law systems is evaluated. The paper concludes by summarizing the consequences and suitability of using Blockchain Technology in Law systems and Legal services.
K11|Essays in Applied Labor Economics|In this paper, James Edward Curtis, Jr. (2017) compiles essays on economic history, labor economics and laws & economics to address economic issues. James Edward Curtis, Jr. (2017) considers economic theory, summary empirical analyses, and government & social construct to challenge our comfort levels with the current status of unequal economic indicators and public policy.
K11|Measurement and Analysis of the Evolution of Institutions in Nigeria|â€œInstitutions matterâ€ has become a generally accepted premise in development economics. The growth and development problems in Nigeria are also common knowledge. To better understand these problems a proper characterization of institutions in Nigeria is essential. Conducting empirical test of the role of institutions in Nigeriaâ€™s growth and development can prove challenging due to lack of institutional data set that span over a long time. In the event that short span data set is available, Glaeser et al. (2004) highlight the many flaws implicit in such measures constructed by political scientists in literature. In this paper, we construct an index of institution quality for the period 1862 through to 2011 for Nigeria, in doing so, we adopt a new method of measuring institutions, which makes use of pre-existing (de jure) legislations, ordinances and constitutions in constructing three institutional indicators; civil and political liberties, freehold property rights, and non-freehold (customary) property rights. These constructed indicators provide a platform for characterization and comprehensive analysis of how institutions haveevolved in Nigeria.
K11|Recourse and residential mortgages: The case of Nevada|The state of Nevada passed legislation in 2009 that abolished deficiency judgments for purchase mortgage loans made after October 1, 2009, and collateralized by primary single-family homes. In this paper, we study how this change in the law affected equilibrium mortgage lending. Using unique mortgage loan-level application data and a difference-in-differences approach that exploits the qualification criterion, we find that the law change led to a decline in equilibrium loan sizes of about 1 to 2 percent. There exists some evidence that mortgage approval rates also decreased for the affected loan applications. These results suggest that making the deficiency judgment law more default friendly in Nevada generated material cost on borrowers at the time of mortgage origination.
K11|Endogenous Recombinant Growth And Intellectual Property Rights|We show that, even in a framework in which monopolistic exploitation of patents does not occur, patents still give rise to serious drawbacks. We build on Weitzman’s (1998) recombinant growth model which provides a stylized but clear description of the formation of knowledge externalities. In our framework a benevolent government buys immediately new patents in a competitive market and releases their contents for free. We show that inefficiencies nevertheless arise and welfare can be improved by correcting the market price through a tax-subsidy scheme. We characterize the (asymptotic) steady state equilibrium, and some properties of the transitional path. We show that if certain conditions are met, then the economy will converge to its (asymptotic) balanced growth path, and along such a path growth will be independent of the policy parameter; conversely, transition dynamics are affected by the choice of the policy parameter. We then quantitatively analyze the effect of different policy interventions on welfare, and show that stricter tax (weaker appropriability) regimes lead to higher social welfare.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K11|The Origins of Private Property|This paper focuses on the legitimacy of private property and analyses the process of first appropriation. In particular, we examine and comment the different views on the origin of private property rights that have emerged through the history of economic and legal thinking, from Democritus to de Jasay. These views have been grouped in two broad categories: consequentialism and fundamental principles. Although consequentialism is now dominant among economists and inchoate in the legal profession, we observe that it is in fact an alibi for discretionary policymaking by the authority. By definition, fundamentalist approaches generate rules that limit discretion. However, we show that some fundamental views rest on questionable a-priori statements. De Jasay’s argument based on the presumption of liberty is perhaps the only perspective that escapes this criticism.
K11|Patent litigation in Europe|Abstract We compare patent litigation cases across four European jurisdictions—Germany, the UK (England and Wales), France, The Netherlands—using case-level data gathered from cases filed in the four jurisdictions during the period 2000–2008. Overall, we find substantial differences across jurisdictions in terms of caseloads—notably, courts in Germany hear by far the largest number of cases, not only in absolute terms, but also when taking macro-economic indicators into account—and we further find important cross-country variances in terms of case outcomes. Moreover, we show empirically that a considerable number of patents are litigated across multiple European jurisdictions; and further, that in the majority of these cases divergent case outcomes are reached across the different jurisdictions, suggesting that the long-suspected problem of inconsistency of decision-making in European patent litigation is in fact real. Finally, we note that the coming into force of the Unified Patent Court in Europe may, in the long term, help to alleviate this inconsistency problem.
K11|Blockchain's struggle to deliver impersonal exchange|The paper identifies what value blockchain adds to the contractual and property processes, exploring its potential and analyzing the main difficulties it is facing. It argues that, contrary to naive conceptions that proclaim the end of intermediaries and state involvement, blockchain applications will rely on a variety of interface, completion and enforcement specialists, including standard public interventions, especially for property transactions. Without these interventions, blockchain applications will at most enable trade in in personam claims—instead of in rem rights—, therefore facilitating personal instead of truly impersonal—that is, asset-based—transactions.
K11|How to Make Land Titling more Rational|Substantial variety exists among systems of land and business formalization both over time and across countries. For instance, England relied on private titling and delayed land registration for centuries. In contrast, early on, its American colonies imported land recordation and its Australian colonies land registration. Similarly, in most of the world, governments used to allow voluntary land titling, in which owners decide whether they register their land. Recently, however, governments and international agencies have more often opted for universal titling, aiming to register all the land in a certain region. This paper critically examines these strategies, analyzing the costs and benefits of the two main decisions: whether to create a public titling system or to rely exclusively on private titling, and the choice between voluntary and universal titling. It concludes that universal titling is seldom optimal. In particular, it argues that lack of titling is more a consequence than a cause of poverty.
K11|Interplay between patents and standards in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector and its relevance to the implementation of the WTO Agreements|The interplay between patents and standards in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector has been intensively debated at international, regional and national levels over the past decades. In essence, the debate is firstly about the extent and impact of patent holdup and holdout in the ICT sector, and then about how to eliminate or reduce these practices. While standard setting organizations (SSOs), industry bodies, as well as judicial and administrative authorities have made great efforts to solve the issue of patent holdup and holdout, there is still an ongoing struggle among divergent stakeholders. Patent holdup and holdout directly impacts the innovation and dissemination of patented technology, the harmonization and implementation of standards, and international trade, which are promoted by the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement). This working paper provides an overview of the current debate on patent holdup and holdout in the ICT sector, analyses existing policy measures and their limitations, and then highlights the relevance of the WTO to this debate.
K11|Digital design protection in Europe: Law, trends, and emerging issues|Digital designs - that is, designs for display on electronic screens - have recently burst onto the intellectual property (IP) stage. While in the U.S. a smattering of legal studies have recently addressed the question of digital design as a copyright-, trademark- and patent-eligible subject matter, a European perspective is still lacking in the literature. This study provides an overview of basic legal background to the protection of digital designs in Europe, explores firms'actual digital design protection behaviors, and highlights some important practical and doctrinal issues that warrant further study
K11|Some Aspects Concerning the Concept of Rent in the Romanian Law|"The notion of rent was analyzed through the ages by both lawyers and economists generically representing an equivalent to the lack of use due to the owner of the property by the person who benefits from that good and form of profit that can be obtained by the owner of a good from the person exploiting the good. The interest that this issue presents refers to the location of each of these types of understanding the concept of rent in areas where it is found and used to get to know the specifics and peculiarities of this term. Whether we speak of ""ground rent"" or ""land rent"" or ""farm rent"", we will consider the real legal relationships of the property, regarding the relationship between the land owner to the other people, who must adopt a certain behavior towards the owner and his/her good."
K11|The Right to Property and Inheritance in the Old Testament|The right to property is considered to be the most accomplished real prerogative, as it endows its holder with all the attributes deriving thereby namely the right to ownership, the right to use and the right to dispose of properties. In the Law written in the Old Testament, the right to ownership had a special nature given the fact that Yahweh was the owner of the Promised Land, the Jewish people being regarded only as usufructuary. Inheritance is the legal and social practice of passing properties, titles, debts, rights and obligations of a deceased person onto the legal, testamentary heirs. Inheritance has for ever played an important part in human societies and it still does in certain areas of the world. The Jewish right to succession had some features that derived from the patriarchal family, which had been thoroughly established even before the age of state consolidation.
K11|A Pound of Flesh for the King|This paper provides a simple model of banking in the shadow of expropriation, which sheds light on the credit markets of XIIIth Century England and the economic reforms introduced by the Angevin Kings. We argue that the fear of expropriation induced bankers to liquidate loans early and reduced the volume of trade in the credit market. To solve this commitment problem, the nobility imposed a restriction on the ability of the king to profit from the loans that fell into his hands. The subsequent demise of these reforms was likely to contribute to the decay of Jewish bankers under Henry III and their eventual expulsion in 1290.
K11|The Effects of Non-Existent Property Ownership Rights Within the Electricity Production Sector on Labor Force Participation in the Dominican Republic|The labor market in the Dominican Republic is in disarray. There has been a high rate of unemployment and a very high rate of non-participation within the labor force for years. Output growth has been steady in manufacturing, telecommunication, and financial services, and new jobs have been added in the service sector consistently, however these gains have led to no real increase in available quality jobs and wage stagnation (Williams & Adedeji, 2004). Abdullaev and Marcello (2013) describe a dichotomous approach to solving the problem; through targeted education for the long term and through product market reforms in the near term. The energy sector in the Dominican Republic is a prime example of an area where reforms are needed to improve the operating environment to spur and sustain growth. At present the losses in transmission and distribution are significantly higher than in most places as a result of fraud (Smith 2004). Until recently it has not been against the law to steal electricity (Enerdata 2011). The rationale being that if electricity is a basic human right we cannot punish those who attempt to gain it. This lack of property law within the context of electricity underpins a significant failure by the government when viewed from the point of the electricity producers. Property ownership is a fundamental concept of free markets. Without ownership rights there is no (or limited) ability to charge for goods produced with that property. Electricity is a commodity property and without the ability to effectively charge for its consumption the producers have struggled.
K11|Securing Property Rights|A central challenge in securing property rights is the subversion of justice through legal skill, bribery, or physical force by the strong--the state or its powerful citizens--against the weak. We present evidence that the less educated and poorer citizens in many countries feel their property rights are least secure. We then present a model of a farmer and a mine which can pollute his farm in a jurisdiction where the mine can subvert law enforcement. We show that, in this model, injunctions or other forms of property rules work better than compensation for damage or liability rules. The equivalences of the Coase Theorem break down in realistic ways. The case for injunctions is even stronger when parties can invest in power. Our approach sheds light on several controversies in law and economics, but also applies to practical problems in developing countries, such as low demand for formality, law enforcement under uncertain property rights, and unresolved conflicts between environmental damage and development.
K11|The Econometric Analysis in Right Economy: Research of Institutional Barriers During Right Realization on the Example of Lands Distribution Processes in Moscow Region. Patterns in Neighboring Areas|This article offers econometric approach for right realization institutional barriers research in right economy. Offered approach is realized on the example of right to build receiving on a farmland in Moscow region. In this article there is the concept of right demand entered, the features of this term are explained and the econometric model for the purpose of demand factors identification with institutional barriers taken into account is offered.
K11|Path Dependence and Interdependence Between Institutions and Development|Path dependence theory, within the institutions context, means that the path of institutions promulgated within a system historically determines the nature of institutions that will ensue within the same system in the present and in the future. The paper makes use of a newly constructed index of institutions quality, and addresses three related questions; the existence of path dependence in institutions, the interdependence and causality between political and economic institutions, and lastly the interdependence between economic development and institutions. In addressing the first question, I use unit root tests to test the hypothesis that institutions promulgated during colonial times still influence institutions promulgated during the post colonial era. I also test for interdependence between institutions in Nigeria using an error correction model in analysing the extent of interdependence between political and economic institutions. Lastly, I test the critical juncture hypothesisâ€”which argues that better institutions lead to economic development and the modernisation hypothesesâ€”which argues that economic development leads to better institutions. The results show support for early path dependence in both political and economic institutions. I also find evidence in support of interdependence running from economic to political institutions. Lastly, there is evidence of a long-run association between institutions and economic development, with the evidence supporting the critical juncture hypothesis, more than the modernisation hypothesis.
K11|The Prospects, Benefits and Challenges of Sui Generis Protection of Geographical Indications of South Africa|This article appraises the prospects, benefits and challenges of sui generis protection of geographical indications (GIs) in South Africa (SA). In SA, there is no specific legislation protecting GIs, and the country relies, amongst others, on the common law system and various legislations, such as the Agricultural Products Standards Act of 1990; Counterfeit Goods of 1997; the Liquor Products; the Trademark Act; the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Act of 2013; and the Consumer Protection Act of 1998. It is therefore argued that SA needs a specific law that considers GIs as a specific, separate intellectual property right (IPR).
K11|Commons and the Public Domain|This article critically examines the concepts of the commons and the public domain as developed in the literature on law and economics, and in the legal literature on intellectual property. It aims to accomplish two things: reviewing the literature laying out diverse meanings associated with these terms and reintroducing them into radical political economy. The study of the commons and the public domain have long been neglected in the area of radical political economy, and the way these concepts have been developed in the literature reviewed is only marginally relevant to problems and methods of political economy. This article argues for a reassessment and redefinition of the commons and the public domain from the standpoint of radical political economy, and proposes a research agenda for the commons.
K11|The scope of qualified law: comparative analysis|During the last decades, several countries have entrenched a special subcategory of law, which is adopted by stricter procedural rules, than the requirements of the ordinary legislative process. These laws are enacted by qualified majority, by the consent of the two chambers of the legislation, they are subject to mandatory constitutional review before their promulgation, or additional safeguards are implemented in the ordinary legislative process. In my article, I would compare the experiences of three legal systems, France, Spain, and Hungary, which provide three different frameworks of qualified law. Nevertheless, I would provide further examples from Europe , Africa and Latin America to demonstrate better the diversity of legal concepts. My aim is to identify the most contested issues from the legal nature of qualified laws, and to seek the proper solutions of these issues, as well as an ideal model of qualified law.-Firstly, on the ground of different national experiences, I would seek for a broadly acceptable definition of qualified law. -Secondly, I would briefly compare the historical background of the three emerges. An important common point would be the role of qualified laws during any process of democratic transition.-Thirdly, the scope of qualified law differs significantly from country to country, consequently, I would continue with this issue by arguing for a narrower scope of qualified law. -Fourthly, qualified law may have a special position in the hierarchy of norms, somewhere between statutory and the constitutional level, so I would cover this aspect. I would focus on the level of precision of constitutional articles in this regard.-Furthermore, the separation of powers perspective of qualified laws would be taken into consideration: the neglect of two-third majority, and the mandatory a priory review.-As the main outcome, certain points would be highlighted for a potential constitution-drafting process.
K11|A comparative study on the law of remedy system for patent infringement in US and Korea|"The purpose of this presentation is to review the right of patentee put in a statutory form in Korea patent law compared with that of USA and Japan patent law. The focus is a regular patent protect system, especially in criminal suit regarding patent infringement. The IP (?Intellectual Property?) protection should be strengthened as much as possible, rather than impeded, if economies seek to move up the global innovation value chain. And the most effective remedy for damages of patent infringement is the criminal penalties and sanctions for IP rights infringement. That is the reason why the U.S. Chamber International IP Index includes the indicators of ?Criminal standards including minimum imprisonment and minimum fines.? Therefore, comparative analysis of remedy system of US and Korea for the patent infringement is performed. In US, as you see in the statement of ""Except as otherwise provided in this title, whoever without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented invention, within the United States, or imports into the United States any patented invention during the term of the patent therefore infringes the patent"", the definition of the patent infringement is only stated comprehensively and there is no criminal punishment for patent infringement. When the damages are not found by a jury, the court shall assess them. In either event the court may increase the damages up to three times the amount found or assessed. On contrast, in the case of Korean patent infringement claims, both civil and criminal remedies are available. Patent Law enacted in 1961 for patent infringement when penalties are explicitly stipulated increasingly so criminal remedies have been strengthened. In the Patent Act of Korea, Any person who infringes a patent right or exclusive license shall be punished by imprisonment not exceeding seven years or by a fine not exceeding 100 million won. Furthermore, If a representative of a juristic person, or an agent, an employee or any other employed person of a juristic person or individual has committed an offense under Articles 225 (1), 228 or 229 with respect to the duties of the juristic person or individual, not only shall the offender be punished, but also the juristic person shall be punished by a fine under any of the individual shall be punished by a fine referred to in the relevant provisions in Korea, which is named as ?Joint Penal Provisions.?"
K11|Termination Of The Caretaking Contract For Enforcement Objective Impossibility. Case Study|This study refers to a frequently used contract, namely the contract of caretaking, and presents the cancellation of this contract for the objective impossibility of out carrying it. Also, this case study highlights the legal issues that may occur in the situation of objective impossibility of execution of the caretaking obliga tion by the debtor – caretaker. In case of cancellation of such a contract there can be no discussion of succesors in rights from the debtor – caretaker because there is no mention about the continuity of the contract with the successors. Only from the creditor that was taken care of, there has been a will in favour of another person from outside the family, namely a third party
K11|Practical Aspects Regarding Fiduciary Operations|The trusts have been frequently used in the countries which function under the Anglo-Saxon law system, but it most certainly represents an innovation in the new Romanian legislation. For this reason, in this paper, we tried to highlight the main differences between the trust regulated in the Romanian Civil code and its corespondent in other legal systems. Observing that the trust in an institution that is mainly theoretical, and the reluctance of practicioners in using it, we tried to analyze the trust, regarding its practical side. In this paper, we will take into consideration the following aspects: the rights that the trustee acquires after establishing the trust, that will be explained through the new regulations regarding the division of assets, the quality of the parties and the limits in which the trustee may be held liable. Other important aspects are: the means that the new regulations provide in order to protect the interests of the creditors and at the same time, the fiduciary assets; the formalities which the law requires and the means of termination of the contract. In the end, in order to identify alternative solutions, we will compare the trust (regulated in the Civil code) with the management of assets that belong to a third party.
K11|The determinants of open access publishing: survey evidence from countries in the Mediterranean Open Access Network (MedOANet)|Abstract We discuss the results of a survey conducted between March 2013 and May 2014 in six Mediterranean countries and covering 2528 researchers from France (380), Italy (596), Spain (1291), Portugal (142), Greece (130) and Turkey (131). We compare the results with those of a survey on Germany, conducted in 2012, with 1913 respondents. We show that there are significant differences between the scientific disciplines with respect to researcher’s awareness of and experience with both open access journals and self-archiving. We conclude by discussing our results in the light of the MedOANet policies which seek to foster open access publishing.
K11|South Africa: Trading international investment for policy space|The overall trend since 1994 of growing foreign direct investment into South Africa has been a reflection of the country’s openness to investment as well as significant international trust in its institutions. Recent policy and legislative developments, including the termination of South Africa’s bilateral investment treaties with EU trading partners and the introduction of the Protection of Investment Act, are however raising concern among international investors and bringing into question the attractiveness and reliability of South Africa as a destination for foreign investment. These concerns have been compounded by increasing regulatory restrictions upon foreign investors, including stricter visa requirements, and the introduction of various other pieces of legislation that have implications upon the level of protection of property rights in South Africa. A policy shift, reflected in legislation such as the Protection of Investment Act, the Private Security Industry Regulation Amendment Bill and the Expropriation Bill, indicates an enhanced focus on the public interest aspect of the constitutional right to property in accordance with the government’s constitutionally mandated transformative agenda. A balance needs to be found between the government’s sovereign right to implement domestic policies in order to achieve its socio-economic goals, its duty to protect foreign investments, and its overall objective of promoting sustainable economic growth.
K11|Precision-Guided or Blunt? The Effects of US Economic Sanctions on Human Rights|We use endogenous treatment-regression models to estimate the causal average treatment effect of US economic sanctions on four types of human rights. In contrast to previous studies, we find no support for adverse effects of sanctions on economic rights, political and civil rights, and basic human rights. With respect to women's rights, our findings even indicate a positive relationship. Emancipatory rights are, on average, strengthened when a country faces sanctions by the US. Our findings are robust when applying various changes to the empirical specification. Most importantly, this study provides strong evidence that the endogeneity of treatment assignment must be modelled when the consequences of sanctions are studied empirically.
K11|Government Expropriation Increases Economic Growth and Racial Inequality: Evidence from Eminent Domain|Is it justified for states to appropriate private property rights? If so, should governments expropriate or regulate?We test three conventional views: insecure property rights cause underinvestment, moral hazard cause overinvestment, or public use cause economic growth.We embed these mechanisms in a model and measure them using the random assignment of U.S. federal court judges setting geographicallylocal precedent. For a half-century, racial minority Democrats were more likely to strike down government appropriations while Republican former federal prosecutors were more likely to uphold them. We find that pro-government physical takings precedent stimulated subsequent takings, expropriation of larger parcels, highway construction, and growth in construction, transportation, and government sectors as well as agriculture, retail, and financial sectors, overall economic growth, and property values. However, racial minorities were increasingly displaced, unemployed, and living in public housing, and the service sector declined. Pro-government regulatory takings precedent also spurred economic growth and property values, but did not increase displacement or racial inequality.

K11|Coase and the departure from property|Ronald H. Coase was one of the most innovative and provocative economists of the twentieth century. Besides his best known papers on ‘The Nature of the Firm’ and ‘The Problem of Social Cost’, he had a major role in the development of the field of law and economics, and made numerous influential contributions to topics including public utilities, regulation and the functioning of markets. In this comprehensive Companion, 31 leading economists, social scientists and legal scholars assess the impact of his work with particular reference to the research programs initiated, the influence on policymakers, and the challenge to conventional perspectives.
K11|How Rome enabled impersonal markets|Impersonal exchange increases trade and specialization opportunities, encouraging economic growth. However, it requires the support of sophisticated public institutions. This paper explains how Classical Rome provided such support in the main areas of economic activity by relying on public possession as a titling device, enacting rules to protect innocent acquirers in agency contexts, enabling the extended family to act as a contractual entity, and diluting the enforcement of personal obligations which might collide with impersonal exchange. Focusing on the institutions of impersonal exchange, it reaches a clear positive conclusion on the market-facilitating role of the Roman state because such institutions have unambiguously positive effects on markets. Moreover, being impersonal, these beneficial effects are also widely distributed across society instead of accruing disproportionately to better-connected individuals.

K11|Property, Possession and Knowledge|As Hodgson has nicely pointed out, capitalism can be only understood if we accept that, unlike possession, property is a social construction and a relation among individuals. Unlike possession, property does not require a material thing on which it should be applied. Property rights can create fictitious commodities on intangible assets symbolizing the relationships among persons. The commoditization of knowledge and the emergence of contemporary intellectual monopoly capitalism must be understood in this framework. Knowledge is a non-rival good and its possession by others is not incompatible. Since we can all possess the same piece of knowledge, the so-called knowledge economy is often seen as place where capitalist relations should weaken. However this view confuses property with possession. In modern societies, intellectual property is becoming the most important part of capital. In spite of the non-rival possession of knowledge, intellectual property rights can be defined as the exclusive right to a piece of knowledge involving the corresponding restriction of others' liberties to use it. Modern intellectual monopoly capitalism is built on sophisticated property rights that should be not confused with any sort of primitive possession
K11|Precision-Guided or Blunt? The Effects of US Economic Sanctions on Human Rights|This study contributes to the literature that analyzes the consequences of economic sanctions for the target country’s human rights situation. We offer a political economy explanation for different types of human rights infringements or improvements in reaction to economic shocks caused by sanctions. Based on this, we derive hypotheses linking sanctions to four types of human rights: economic rights, political and civil rights, basic human rights, and emancipatory rights. We use endogenous treatment regression models to estimate the causal average treatment effect of US economic sanctions on each type of human rights within a uniform empirical framework. In contrast to previous studies, we find no adverse effects of sanctions on economic rights, political and civil rights, and basic human rights, once the endogenous selection into sanctions is modelled. With respect to women’s rights, our findings even indicate a positive relationship. Emancipatory rights are, on average, strengthened when a country experiences sanctions by the US. Our findings are robust and we find little evidence for effect heterogeneity between types of target countries or sanctions. Most importantly, this study shows that the endogeneity of treatment assignment must be modelled when the consequences of sanctions are studied empirically.
K11|Kopieren, transformieren, kombinieren: Ideenklau und Plagiarismus in der Werbung|Die Allgemeinfreiheit und rechtliche Schutzunfähigkeit von Ideen - und somit gleichermaßen von Werbeideen - gilt als eiserne Regel unserer Gesellschaft. Die Möglichkeit, bereits bestehende Ideen als Basis freischaffender Kreativität zu nutzen, sie umzuformen, neu zu erfinden und mit eigenen Gedanken anzureichern, sichert den kulturellen, wirtschaftlichen und technischen Fortschritt. Und dies kommt schließlich allen zu Gute. Warum sollte sich eine wissenschaftliche Arbeit also mit dem Schutz von Werbeideen beschäftigen? Die Antwort ist so einfach, wie entscheidend: Ideen sind Kapital! Ideen sind die Existenzgrundlage aller kreativ Schaffenden - und so insbesondere auch der Kreativen in der Werbebranche. Herausragende Werbung ist heute, in Zeiten von Informationsüberlastung und Aufmerksamkeitsverknappung, sowohl für werbungtreibende Unternehmen als auch für Werbeagenturen von existentieller Bedeutung. Einzigartige Werbeideen erzeugen ihre Aufmerksamkeit jedoch nicht nur bei den Adressaten der Werbung, sie dienen gleichermaßen als Maßstab sowie als Inspiration für viele Werbeschöpfungen anderer Kreativer in der Werbebranche. Und so kommen immer wieder Fälle von Ideenübernahmen ans Licht, die in der Branche vielfach diskutiert und kritisch - meist jedoch ausschließlich subjektiv - reflektiert werden. So herrscht eine fatale Diskrepanz zwischen der einerseits alltäglichen Präsenz von Plagiarismus und Ideendiebstahl in der Werbebranche und der andererseits fehlenden objektiven Ursachenanalyse sowie des stark fragmentierten und äußerst komplexen Status Quo rechtlicher Schutzmöglichkeiten.

K11|Copyright Infringement in the Market for Digital Images|Digital technologies for sharing creative goods create new opportunities for copyright infringement and challenge established enforcement methods. We establish several important facts about the nature of copyright infringement and efforts to settle past infringing use in the market for digital images. Infringement in this, and many other markets, is often uninformed: users may be unaware that their use infringes, and may lack information about the price of a license. The uninformed nature of infringement implies that price may not be the primary factor in the decision to settle past use; in contrast, non-price factors may significantly affect settlement outcomes.
K11|Patent Quality and Examination in Europe|This paper reports on effects of recent administrative reforms at the European Patent Office (EPO). In EPO-granted patents, claims numbers started to decline in 2008 when new claims fees became effective, claims sections in patents became shorter, and independent claims longer and presumably more specific. The grant rate remained at relatively low levels, but the EPO was unable to stem the use of divisional filings. The developments at the EPO point to a high private value of delay options. Delay may be achieved either by making use of explicit statutory rules or by other means, such as filing divisional applications.
K11|Patent Remedies|Since the Supreme Court's eBay decision in 2006, the U.S. has employed a hybrid patent remedy system that mixes property and liability rules. When the patent owner and the infringer are competitors, the courts typically issue a permanent injunction requiring the infringer to cease its infringing activities. In contrast, when the patent owner and the infringer are not competitors, the courts often allow the infringer to continue its infringing activities so long as it pays specified ongoing royalties to the patent holder. This article studies the incentives for invention and for new product development in such a hybrid system.
K11|Patents as a Spur to Subsequent Innovation? Evidence from Pharmaceuticals|This paper examines how an incumbent's patent protection acts as an implicit subsidy toward non-infringing substitutes. I analyze whether classes of pharmaceuticals whose first entrant has a longer period of market exclusivity (time between approval and generic entry) see more subsequent entry. Instrumenting for exclusivity using plausibly exogenous delays in the development process, I find that a one-year increase in the first entrant's market exclusivity increases subsequent entry by 0.2 drugs. The effect is stronger for subsequent entrants that are lesser clinical advances, suggesting it is driven primarily by imitation.
K11|Screening for Good Patent Pools through Price Caps on Individual Licenses|Patent pools reduce prices when selling complementary inputs to technologies, but can also effectively cartelize markets when involving substitutes. Independent licensing, by reintroducing competition, ensures that only good pools form when there are two patent holders involved. For larger pools, independent licensing needs to be complemented by other policy tools. We propose to constrain the royalties for the patents individually licensed outside the pool with price caps replicating the pool's sharing rule. This information-free screening device works with asymmetries, even when licensors try to stabilize pools by readjusting the sharing rule in a way that may not reflect contributions.
K11|Exchange Efficiency with Weak Ownership Rights|"We show that efficient exchange obtains independently of the degree to which a legal system protects the rights of owners. We study a number of different legal rules, including property rules (strong protection), liability rules (any party can take the owner's asset but must pay a legally determined compensation), and even rules that protect the owner's interests very weakly (liability rules with a very low compensation level). Efficiency is obtained as long as the degree of protection provided by law and by the bargaining protocol is not ""too"" inversely correlated with a party's valuation of the asset."
K11|From Today's City to Tomorrow's City: An Empirical Investigation of Urban Land Assembly|Because cities are constrained by the boundaries of land ownership, fundamental urban modifications require land delineation changes. We evaluate whether there is enough land assembly--the joining together of two or more parcels of land--to put land to its highest value use. We hypothesize that in the absence of market frictions such as holdouts, the price of land sold for assembly should not exceed the price of land sold for other uses. Empirically, we find that to-be-assembled land in Los Angeles trades at a 15 to 40 percent premium and conclude that significant frictions prevent assembly.
K11|La notion de bail professionnel en droit OHADA et ses implications sur la théorie générale du fonds de commerce|"The last reform of the Uniform Act on General Commercial Law OHADA reconsidered several pieces of commercial law. The concept of leasing has not been spared. She, who was accompanied by the ""commercial"" substantive, has been transformed into ""commercial lease"". Question of style or simple semantics? Certainly not, because the legislature in 1997, had not previously dared revise the designation commercial lease that no longer fit with the extension of the beneficiaries he had devoted himself. With the reform of December 2010, the institution of the lease has just renamed. Parliament also confirmed the extension of the scope of economic actors involved in the protection of the lease. The regime of former Uniform Act was therefore not fully extended, particularly since we noted another significant change in the new text. Contrary to former Article 69 which devoted two cumulative criteria necessary for the implementation of the lease of the regime, including the situation in a populated city of more than 5,000 people and membership of local under lease to a designated class, the new text retains a single criterion, that of belonging to a local specific category. This mutation disrupts some basics of goodwill theory. Indeed, with the increasing scope of lessees, there is a sliding protection to professional trader. This causes result in a substitution of the lease of the foundation that passes from customer to the profession. The loss of the privileged place of business customers coupled with doctrinal and jurisprudential developments in the theory of civil customers, argue for an assimilation of the different customer categories."
K11|Romanian procedural and administrative particularities of the sale of lands to foreign persons|This study aims to examine the particularities of the procedures and legal instruments through which foreign persons, in the broadest sense of this term,3 may acquire, especially through sale-purchase contracts, agricultural lands situated outside of the built-up area, after Romania joined the European Union (1st of January, 2007). Likewise, this paper analyses specific international private law problems that may arise in relation with the application of the Romanian law regarding the legal transfer of agricultural and non-agricultural lands.
K11|International arbitration and its exclusion from the Brussels regime|The Brussels regime, which regulates the matters of transnational litigation excludes arbitration from its scope. Upon formation of the Brussels regime the existing instruments concerning arbitration - the United Nations Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and the 1961 European Convention on International Commercial Arbitration - were believed to be sufficient. The original Brussels Convention 1968 on recognition and enforcement of judgments delivered in the courts of the EU Member States expressly provided for the exclusion of arbitration. The following Brussels I Regulation followed the trend and reinforced the exclusion of arbitration from their material scopes. The rationale for doing so was primarily the prevention of parallel proceedings and irreconcilable judgments. The arbitration exclusion from the Brussels regime has caused a fair amount of confusion, especially regarding the extent and limits of the exclusion. That is, whether the arbitration agreement, the arbitral award and its consequences are covered by the exclusion or they may fall under the scope of the Brussels regulation if they constitute only an incidental question to the main cause of action? The confusion was illustrated in the ECJ judgment West Tankers, which generated negative feedback from the arbitration community and indicated the need for reform. The recently adopted Recast Regulation took it upon itself to clarify the relationship between arbitration and the EU regime of transnational litigation. The exclusion is reinforced yet again and its boundaries are specified in the Preamble. However, whether or not the concerns about the extent and objectives of arbitration exclusion have been at present eliminated, remains to be seen.
K11|La contractualisation des rapports pecuniaires entre epoux en droit camerounais|The matrimonial regimes in Cameroonian’s law is known nowadays as the venue of unexpected solutions in matters concerning divorce, corps’ separation and widowage because of severe confusions made by the Jurisprudence every time It’s sued to liquidate or share a matrimonial patrimony. Though, it has been long times stated that throughout a marriage’s agreement signed before the marriage celebration, spouses could organize their patrimonial relationship by themselves, choosing clearly and precisely their matrimonial regime. Such old and viable solution shows the place of contract in the Law of matrimonial regimes. It appears as one of the remedies against the incertitude of the jurisprudence in family’s patrimonial cases in Cameroon, where the customs are so heavy that even judges in charge of modern law, couldn’t resist in applying its solutions as they did in the KOUM’s case. To correct those incertitude in the “contractualization” of the patrimonial relationships in marriage remain the best solution. It can be possible according to the civil code by or without spouses will. Any way, it’s a means to modernize the Law of matrimonial regimes and reduce matrimonial unsolved cases.
K11|Investigating possession of human blood as a property in Iran’s law with regard to legal and Islamic jurisprudential commentaries on organ transplant|A question that most of jurists are faced with is, whether human blood is basically a property or not and is human the owner of his blood? Moreover, what is the difference between blood and other organs of the body from the viewpoint of ownership? If blood is a property, why human is not the owner? Unlike blood, there have been legal discussions on organ sale, where blood can be retrieved by the body while segregated organs are not retrievable by the body. Investigating various views about ownership of organs of the body, one can conclude that blood is a property owned by humans.
K11|Collateral in Italy: a legal and economic analysis of privileges, pledges and mortgages|The work presents a legal and economic analysis of how collateral works in Italy. Specific attention is focused on privileges, pledges and mortgages, because of the prominent role they play in banking relationships. The paper highlights the critical issues in the current legislative framework and discusses some recent regulatory changes. It argues in favour of a simplification of privileges, reserving them for involuntary or unsophisticated creditors. At the same time, it analyses the rationale of the recent modernization of pledges, which, among other things, allows debtors to retain control over an asset and to use it within the production process. The new repossession mechanisms are an important alternative to judicial foreclosure for liquidating collateral. However, fine-tuning them, along with creating appropriate safeguards tailored for debtors in difficulty, would make them more effective.
K11|Empirical Evidence on Conditional Pricing Practices|Conditional pricing practices allow the terms of sale between a producer and a downstream distributor to vary based on the ability of the downstream firm to meet a set of conditions put forward by the producer. The conditions may require a downstream firm to accept minimum quantities or multiple products, to adhere to minimum market-share requirements, or even to deal exclusively with one producer. The form of payment from the producer to the downstream firm may take the form of a rebate, marketing support, or simply the willingness to supply inventory. The use of conditional pricing practices is widespread throughout many industries, and the variety of contractual forms used in these arrangements is nearly as extensive as the number of contracts. This paper reviews empirical evidence on these arrangements.
K11|Innovation in the Seed Market: The Role of IPRs and Commercialization Rules|This article deals with the impact of legal rules on incentives in the seeds sector to create new plant varieties. The first category of rules consists in intellectual property rights and is intended to address a problem of sequential innovation and R&D effort. The second category concerns commercial rules that are intended to correct a problem of adverse selection. We propose a dynamic model of market equilibrium with vertical product differentiation that enables us to take into account the economic consequences of imposing either Plant Breeders’ Rights (PBRs) or patents as IPRs and either compulsory registration in a catalog or minimum standards as commercialization rules. The main result is that the combination of catalog registration and PBRs adopted in Europe is hardly supported by the model calibrated on data for wheat in France.
K11|Are Banks Bad for Boys? Estimating the Effect of Banks on Child Mortality, Education, and Fertility in Rural India|I investigate whether a large-scale bank expansion program affected parents' decisions to invest in the health and education of their children. From 1977 to 1990, the Indian government implemented a new licensing program to encourage the construction of banks in underserved rural communities. The timing of the bank expansion program is used as an instrument to account for the possible reverse causality of child mortality or education rates affecting bank expansion. An empirical analysis using large-scale Indian surveys finds that states with a more rapid expansion of rural banks did not have significantly lower child mortality overall. However, in households with a first-born daughter, in which discrimination against daughters and in favor of sons is exacerbated, excess female mortality declines with an increase in banks. This occurs through higher male mortality rather than lower female mortality. Similarly, an increase in banks has no effect on daughters' education, but it reduces sons' years of education. Both of these effects occur in a context of more banks causing lower fertility and a reduction in poverty rates, which if anything should lead to reduced child mortality and higher education levels.
K11|The Effect of Intellectual Property Rights on Domestic Innovation in the Pharmaceutical Sector|There is little empirical evidence concerning the effect of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protecting pharmaceutical products and processes on pharmaceutical domestic innovation. Indeed, existing literature does not provide a punctual estimate of this effect for developing countries. This paper fills this gap, by exploiting a self-constructed dataset which provides, for a 22-year period, information concerning IPR reforms involving pharmaceuticals for 74 developed and developing countries. The identification strategy exploits the different timing across these countries of two sets of IPR reforms. Domestic innovation is measured as citation-weighted domestic patent applications filed at the European Patent Office (EPO): the highly skewed distribution of the dependent variable, and the high number of zero observations, are taken into account using count data models. In particular, a Zero Inflated Negative Binomial model is adopted, to overcome previous literature assumption that all innovations are patented in the main markets of reference, and to take into consideration the choice not to patent at the EPO. Results show that innovation is sensitive to IPR protection, but not to its degree. Moreover, the effect is not long lasting. My study also finds that developing countries profit significantly less than developed ones from the protection, benefiting from an effect that is roughly half of that for developed countries. Consequent policy implications are examined, and include the conclusions that a “one size fits all” approach can be inappropriate, and that gradual reforms should be preferred to rare reforms that greatly alter the level of IPR protection.
K11|Property. Absolut Right. Social Function|The article presents the opinion according to which today we can speak rather of a relative character of ownership, while the social function of it is ever more present and the rights of the owner are subject to multiple legal requirements and limited in order to meet general interests of the community.
K11|Foreign Direct Investments And Their Non-Traditional Quality Factors. A Var Analysis In Romania And Bulgaria|The aim of this paper is to present an econometric analysis using VAR techniques for emphasizing the political institutional factors, economic freedom factors and the quality of labor force factors impacting on FDIs attracted in Bulgaria and Romania. We used yearly data series between 2000 and 2014, provided by the World Bank. These two countries display a very friendly climate (law income corporate tax), but they attracted large amounts of FDIs only for a short period of time at mid-2000s’. The foreign investments sharply dropped during the crisis, and the perspectives are not so good. The foreign investors claim that high corruption and bureaucracy greatly diminish the advantages of an attractive fiscal environment in these two specific countries.
K11|Crisis of copyrights authority|This paper aims to explain crisis of authority of copyrights that is to prove incoherence between copyrights and a copying culture. In institutional meaning it is a conflict between formal and informal institutions. A formal institution is copyrights and informal one is set of standards and social behavior patterns which could be called a copying culture. Goal of the paper is demonstration of basic factors determining the afore-mentioned incoherence and reasons for its persistence. Performance of the afore-defined goal is associated with verification of two hypotheses. The first states that the crisis of the copyrights appeared because of Internet (which is a technical tool of a contemporary society). The second hypothesis states that enforcement of formal rights observance is hampered since it is not supported by informal institutions. The paper is divided into three main parts. The first part demonstrates an extent of crisis of copyrights and some probable reasons of the crisis are considered. The second part includes case studies related to enforcement of the copyrights which is aimed to explain reasons for persistence of the crisis. The third part focuses on alternative solutions of the problem which is conflict between formal and informal institutions. The paper is based on scientific reports on information goods non-market trade in Poland, Germany, USA and Sweden.
K11|Non-market information goods circulation and the copying culture in the Internet era|Motivation: This paper deals with a relation between a phenomenon called a ‘copying culture’ and situation of information goods markets. Subject-matter was limited to phenomena taking place in the Internet and market & non-market exchange taking place via the Internet. Results: The copying culture is a significant social aspect which is reflected by activity of, among others, Internet users. Range of the phenomenon in question makes it cannot be ignored, especially, in context of economic efficiency that is profits from copyrights to works in form of information goods. The paper demonstrates a hypothesis that unauthorized copying via the Internet is a result of high level social consent to do so. The hypothesis in question results from observance of range of non-market information goods circulation, which is linked with impact of the copying culture. Aim: Goal of the paper is provision of evidences justifying the hypothesis by means of analysis of retrospective practice of information goods copying as well as case studies dealing with contemporary examples of their non-market circulation.
K11|Women's Liberation as a Financial Innovation|Property rights are at the heart of capitalism's ability to efficiently allocate resources. Historically, married women have been one of the groups with the greatest legal disabilities in this regard, to the benefit of their husbands. Starting in the second half of the 19th century, common law countries, which were entirely dominated by men, gave married women property rights. Before this ``women's liberation,'' married women were subject to the laws of coverture. Coverture had detailed laws as to which spouse had ownership and control over various aspects of property both before and after marriage. These laws created a strong disincentive for women to invest in financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, and even bank deposits. This paper develops a general equilibrium model with endogenous determination of women's rights in which these laws affect portfolio choices, leading to inefficient allocations. We show how technological advancement eventually leads to men granting rights, and in turn how these rights affect development. Exploiting cross-state variation in the timing of rights, we show that increases in non-agricultural TFP predict the granting of rights. The granting of rights in turn leads to a dynamic labor reallocation towards the non-agricultural sector, representing further development. Finally, we show that women's rights are associated with lower interest rates and greater financial intermediation, consistent with an increase in the supply of credit.
K11|Patent Pools in Input Markets|We show that patent pools formed by owners of perfectly complementary patents are anticompetitive if one of the licensors is integrated with a manufacturer. With vertical integration, the pool serves as coordination device, allowing patent holders to restrict supplies to the product market and share the larger profits of the affiliated manufacturer. These results are robust to entry, the contractual and competitive environments. The imposition of an unbundling and pass-through requirement makes patent pools socially desirable. We also show that this requirement is more effective than a mandated non-discriminatory policy enforcing FRAND commitments in screening anticompetitive pools.

K11|Problems and Prospects of the Land Market Development in Russia|The article formulates the problem of land ownership formation, and land market development. It has been found that the theory of institutional changes has a high methodological potential for the studies of land relations. It is proposed to use the institutional approach to the study of land ownership and transaction costs, whose growth hinders the development of the land market in Russia. According to the theory of R. Coase, the significance of transaction costs for the land market development was shown, and the conclusion about the need to reduce them was made. Taking into account the objective limitations of turnover of agricultural land category, it was proposed to assess the potential of development of the various sectors of land market in the country using the growth curve methodology. There was justified the expediency of evaluating the public and private sector of land market in terms of turnover, which expresses the ratio of the total land area of transactions in the segmental markets to the total amount of land in the definite form of ownership. The land transactions were evaluated and the forecast of the land market development in the Russian Federation was defined.
K11|Small price incentives increase women's access to land titles in Tanzania|We present results from a field experiment using price incentives to address two obstacles to women's access to formal land ownership. First, the price of formal land titles is often prohibitive, restricting access for both men and women. Second, when formal titles are issued, men are recorded as the sole owners of household land in the vast majority of cases. In theory, these problems may be in tension: requirements to grant women equal ownership may reduce the overall household demand for titling. In practice, we find no such trade-off: when residents of low-income, unplanned settlements in Dar es Salaam were offered price discounts for formal land titles, demand rose significantly. Price elasticity of demand was unchanged when price discounts were conditional on registering a woman as (co-)owner of household land. Furthermore, conditional price discounts achieved near gender parity in land ownership.
K11|Even the losers get lucky sometimes: New products and the evolution of music quality since Napster|Using comprehensive digital sales data by time and vintage on the US, Canada, and 15 European countries, we infer the evolution of music vintage quality, finding that vintage service flow has increased since 2000. We explain the result with unpredictability of music quality at the time of investment along with growing releases. Evidence shows (a) products with modest prospects at release, – from artists on independent labels and from new artists, – occupy a growing share of the top products; and (b) despite growth in the number of products, sales are growing more concentrated.
K11|Can buyer “mobility” reduce aggregation failures in land-assembly?|In this paper we examine whether site-development competition can be used to facilitate land assembly, in the absence of contingent contracts. In particular, we attempt to determine (1) whether competition can be induced among prospective sellers, (2) whether or not competition increases aggregation rates, and (3) what effects competition has on the distribution of surplus among the bargaining parties. We also study the incidence with which a buyer (endogenously) chooses to deal with a single “large parcel” owner vs. multiple “small parcel” owners. To do so, we make use of a laboratory experiment where all the relevant information about the project is common knowledge and landowner valuations are private information. Our results show that competition more than doubles aggregation rates, with aggregation rates of approximately 40% in the baseline, and at least 84% in the competitive treatments. We also find that developers have a strong preference to make transactions with landowners who have consolidated land holdings, doing so in 24/27 successful aggregations, providing empirical evidence that there is a link between the transactions cost associated with land-assembly and suburbanization, as suggested by Miceli and Sirmans (2007).
K11|Housing property rights and subjective wellbeing in urban China|This study explores the relationship between home ownership and subjective wellbeing in urban China. We first present a theoretical model examining the relationship between housing property rights and subjective wellbeing in China. We then test the predictions of the theoretical model using a nationally representative dataset. We find that not only home ownership but also the types of property rights one acquires matter for subjective wellbeing. Moreover, not only whether one has a home loan, but the type of home loan one has matters for subjective wellbeing.
K11|The governance of blockchain financial networks|Since the emergence of the virtual currency Bitcoin in 2009, a new, Internet-based way of recording entitlements and enforcing rights has increasingly captured the interest of businesses and governments. The technology is commonly called ‘blockchain’ and is often associated with a closely related phenomenon, the ‘smart contract’. The market is now exploring ways of using these concepts for financial assets, such as securities, legal tender and derivative contracts. This article develops a conceptual framework for the governance of blockchain-based networks in financial markets. It constructs a vision of how financial regulation and private law should set the boundaries of this new technology in order to protect market participants and societies at large, while at the same time allowing for the necessary room for innovation.
K11|Thou shalt not steal (from hard-working people)An experiment on respect for property claims|Abstract The institution of property is void without legal and social enforcement against theft. To address wasteful competition over resources, societies have long developed strategies that encompass -inter alia- behavioral traits, social norms and legal institutions to promote the respect and enforcement of property rights. On the other hand, a growing body of biological and ethological evidence suggests that several other animal species establish and respect some forms of property even in the absence of institutions. Would human beings respect others' property in the absence of institutions? Do people posses some innate sense of property, or do they respect property only because of legal and social enforcement? In this study, we explore this issue with a lab experiment that resembles a famous thought experiment proposed by Plato. As Plato sought to understand how one ought to behave when he or sheis completely shielded by the consequences of his actions,we study whether people respect property once full anonymity is granted. In this experiment, we implement a Free-Form Dictator game where participants can both give and take up to five scratchcards from a passive counterpart that they have either previously bought outside the lab with their own money (legal treatments) or gained inside the lab via an effort task (effortful treatments). In conclusion to the experiment, evidence is provided of a (weak) sense of property. We also provide evidence that property in the lab is better established through an effort tasks than through the use of subject's own real property brought from outside the lab.
K11|Working Paper: Rents and Inefficiency in the Patent and Copyright System: Is There a Better Route?|This paper analyzes the evidence for rents due to the patent and copyright systems for financing innovation and creative work. It notes research suggesting that in both the patent and copyright system, the costs in the form of monopoly pricing and rent-seeking activity outweigh the benefits. It then proposes alternatives to the patent and copyright system. The Kauffman Foundation helped support this work.
K11|"Il ""rent to buy"": problemi e prospettive di un contratto di recente tipizzazione"|"Il presente contributo si prefigge di analizzare brevemente l'istituto del ""rent to buy"" alla luce dei principali orientamenti dottrinali emessi dopo la sua regolamentazione legislativa e delle primissime pronunce giurisprudenziali. Oltre che sull'esame generale dei profili strutturali del contratto e della relativa disciplina, ci si è soffermati in particolare sulle caratteristiche del corrispettivo: certamente tra gli aspetti più innovativi che connotano questa nuova figura rispetto agli istituti tradizionali."
K11|Patents: A Means to Innovation or Strategic Ends?|This paper utilizes a data set of over 208,000 U.S. patents applied for between 1975 and 2010 to study development of strategic patenting over time and across industries. With received citations as a measure of patent social value, we use data envelopment analysis to estimate firm-level relative importance of strategic versus protective patenting. Our novel identification strategy reveals there was an almost universal drop in patent social value in the second half of the 1990s, signaling a shift towards the strategic use of patents. But the development of patenting strategies continued even after 2000 with semiconductor companies increasing their focus on patent value relative to companies from other industries. On average, aerospace and software companies preferred the production of valuable patents, but patenting strategies can differ vastly even among companies operating within one industry. The results confirm our expectations regarding the focus of aerospace companies on socially valuable patents.
K11|Price dynamics on residential property in Russia in 2015|The paper deals with the issues of price dynamics on residential property on secondary and primary markets
K11|Housing mortgage lending in Russia in 2015|In 2015, according to the data released by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, credit institutions extended 691,943 housing mortgage loans (HML) to the tune of Rb 1,147.339bn, which constituted 68.32% of the total amount of HML extended in 2014 and 65.04% in monetary terms. In the same period, 706,786 housing loans were originated totaling to Rb 1,168.222bn, which in quantity of loans comes to 66.71% and in monetary terms 64.14% of the extended loans.
K11|The market of land plots in Russia in 2015|According to the data released by the Rosreestr, the area of land plots owned by Russian nationals keeps decreasing and as of 1 January 2015 amounted to 115,400,000 ha or 6.8% of the land of the Russian Federation against 117m ha (6.84%) as of 1 January 2014. On the contrary, the area of land in public and municipal ownership and ownership of legal entities keeps growing. Within a year, the area of land plots owned by legal entities increased by 1.3m ha and amounted to 17.2m ha or 1.0% of the land of the Russian Federation. The area of land plots in public and municipal ownership increased by 37,900 ha. As of 1 January 2015, Russian nationals’ land shares decreased by 3.0m ha and amounted to 5.2% (89.3m ha) of the country’s land or 67.3% of land in private ownership. A decrease in the area of land in shared ownership is regarded as positive factor as land plots in shared ownership by virtue of incompleteness of that title are used inefficiently.

K11|Mortgage In The Russian Federation In November 2015|Over 10 months of 2015, entities of all patterns of ownership have built 792,000 fl ats with total fl oor space of 58.9 million sq. m., which climed to 104.2% of fl oor area commissioned as of 1 November 2014. For the category “all fl ats” the rate of accessibility decreased in 2015 on the primary and secondary housing markets to 2.49 and 2.54 years, respectively. Compared to 9 months of 2014, the number of registered plots of land by individuals for the same period of 2015 (429,157 certificates) down 12.61%. In comparison with last year, the number of housing mortgage loans (HML) for 10 months 2015 fell by 33.93% in quantitative terms (526,757 mortgages) and down 37.07% in value terms (Rb 872.82bn). As of 1 November 2015, the HML quality portfolio denominated in roubles has deteriorated: outstanding debt in percent to residual debt has moved up by 0.17 p.p. to 1.02%. Nevertheless, from March 2015, average weighted rate on rouble loans down 1.82 p.p. to 12.89%.
K11|Mortgage In The Russian Federation In November 2015|The volume of housing mortgage loans (HML) (Rb 985.29 bn) originated during January–November 2015 fell against the volume of HML originated over the same period of 2014 by 32.66% in quantitative terms and by 35.92% in monetary terms. The share of past-due debt in residual debt on HML for November 2015 has gone up in ruble loans by 0.02 p.p. to 1.05%, and on foreign currency loans – by 0.71 p.p. to 19.41%. Weighted average rate on HML in rubles extended during the month, for November 2015, has come to 12.29%, down 0.60 p.p. against October 2015 and down 2.42 p.p. maximum level posted in February 2015. The latter is due to the effective State program.
K11|New Amendments To Russia’S Privatization Legislation: Cosmetic Measures Or Further Deregulation?|Analysis of recent updates to the Russian privatization legislation in 2015 allows saying that the 2015 amendments as a whole aim to boost the process of privatization. The suggested enhancements for the information system of privatization of government-owned and municipal property and for the mechanism of selling such property are intended to render the entire privati - zation process more transparent while counteracting occurrences of corrup- tion and criminality. It has not gone unnoticed that the practice of narrowing the scope of the privatization legislation continues. Since the legislation came into force late in 2001, the number of property categories whose disposal goes beyond the scope of the provisions thereof has nearly doubled (to 20 from 11), some of which have been given a broader interpretation. The next few years will show what kind of eff ect the potential of the foregoing amendments has on the effectiveness of this process, bearing in mind the contribu- tion to meeting the federal budget defi cit and generating budget revenues at other levels of public authority.
K11|Mortgage In The Russian Federation In December 2015|In 2015, 691943 housing mortgage loans (HML) were originated totaling to Rb 1.15 trillion, which demonstrate a reduction against 2014 in quantitative terms by 31.68% and in value terms – by 34.96%. The HML portfolio quality deteriorate. In 2015 against 2014, outstanding debt denominated in rubles as a share of residual debt went up by 0.19 p.p. to 1.04% and in foreign currency – by 7.81 p.p. to 20.37%. In 2015, weighted average ruble rate on HML for the year against 2014 moved up by 0.88 p.p. to 13.33%, and weighted average rate in foreign currency moved up by 0.57 p.p. to 9.82%.
K11|Austerity: A Trend Across Russia’S Region|The year of 2015 was marked by a few troublesome trends in the crisis unfolding in Russia’s regions. The overwhelming majority of Russia’s territories ran a budget deficit while regional and municipal debts were piling up. A new trend towards drastic shrinking of consumption took hold. Furthermore, investment continued to decline for three consecutive years. On the other hand, the industrial sector downturn was moderate and geographically localized, and the unemployment rate continued to grow at slowest pace. The outlook for 2016 is negative: the adverse trends are expected to worsen.
K11|Privatization Program For 2014-2016: Formal Shifts And Uncertain Prospects|The outcome of the current privatiza on program, to be completed this year, will strongly depend on the general situation in the Russian economy, and in particular on the behavior of the domestttc stock market. In the explanatory documents a ached to the draft law on federal budget for 2016 submitted to parliament by the government, it is stated that the revenues from privatiza on are expected to amount to more than Rb 33.2bn. This goal does not appear to be quite realistic, though. The planned sum of budget revenue to be generated by this source in 2016 is comparable to the total amount of revenue generated by the privatiza on program for 2011–2013 over the entire 3-year period of its implementa on. However, the economic and political situation then was very diﬀerent from what we have been experiencing over the last two years (massive capital outflow, the introduction of economic sanctions, the ruble’s plummeting exchange rate, and the probability of protracted recession in the national economy).
K11|The Real Estate Market In The Russian Federation In Q1 2016|In Q1 2016, 224,000 ﬂats were built totaling to 15.6 mn sq. m, which constitutes 84% of the ﬂ oor space commissioned in Q1 2015. In Q1 2016, the vol ume of land mortgage loans extended to individuals exceeded by 52.8% the volume of land mortgage loans extended to individuals in Q1 2015 and its volume came to 79.13% of the total number of mortgage loans originated in Q1 2016. In Q1 2016, credit institutions extended to borrowers 188,300 housing mortgage loans (HML) totaling to Rb 323.4 bn, which by 48% exceeded the amount of housing mortgage loans originated in Q1 2015. As of 1 April 2016, outstanding debt on HML denominated in rubles in percent to residual debt went up by 0.06 p.p. against 2015 and constituted 1.08% Average weighted rate for March 2016 on HML denominated in rubles came to 12.86% against the maximum value of 14.71% for February 2015.
K11|State Property Management: Statistical Portrait Novelties|A new indicator framework for the performance measurement of state property management was adopted early last year. Basic characteristics of state property and of economic entities that are in state ownership have been presented on the basis of the initial data gathered from the framework. Transition to providing data in terms of legal forms, which was not the case under the old indicator framework for public sector monitoring, as well as a special focus on property (real estate, land, stakes (interest) of any size) given the value and liquidity thereof is the main novelty that the new framework offers.
K11|The real estate market in the Russian Federation in H1 2016|As for 1 August 2016, since the turn of the year 521,600 apartments were built totaling to 37.2 mn sq. m, which constitutes 92.6% of the floor area commissioned during the same period of 2015. Decline in the volumes of commissioned housing in 2016 was owing, first of all, to a reduction of housing floor area constructed by individuals. In H1 2016, the number of registrations of land mortgage loans extended to individuals exceeded by 33.6% the number of registrations of land mortgage loans extended to individuals in H1 2015 and constituted 79.02% of the total number of mortgages extended during 2016. In H1 2016, credit institutions issued 389,800 housing mortgage loans (HML) totaling to Rb 664.5bn, which by 44.2% exceeded the amount of housing mortgage loans originated in H1 2015. As of 1 July 2016, outstanding debt on HML denominated in rubles in percent to residual debt went up by 0.03 p.p. against 2015 and constituted 1.11%. Average weighted interest rate for June 2016 on HML denominated in rubles came to 12.99% exceeding by 0.48 p.p. interest rates of February 2016.
K11|Рынок Недвижимости Рф|За 10 месяцев 2015 г. организациями всех форм собственности построено 792 тыс. квартир площадью 58,9 млн кв. м, что соста- вило 104,2% к площади, введенной на 1 ноября 2014 г. Для категории «все квартиры» коэффициент доступности жилья (КДЖ) сни- зился в 2015 г. на первичном и вторичном рынках соответственно до 2,49 и 2,54 лет. По сравнению с 9 месяцами 2014 г. количество зарегистрированных ипотек земельных участков для физических лиц за аналогичный период 2015 г. (429157 актов) снизилось на 12,61%. В отличие от предыдущего года объем предоставленных ИЖК за 10 месяцев 2015 г. уменьшился на 33,93% по количеству кредитов (526757 кредитов) и на 37,07% в денежном выражении (872,820 млрд руб.). На 1 ноября 2015 г. качество портфеля ИЖК в рублях ухудшилось: просроченная задолженность в процентах от остаточной поднялась на 0,17 п.п. до 1,02%. Тем не менее, начиная с марта 2015 г., средневзвешенная ставка по кредитам в рублях снизилась на 1,82 п.п. до 12,89%.м.

K11|Новации Российского Приватизационного Законодательства: Косметические Меры Или Ускорение Разгосударствления?|Анализ изменений, появившихся в приватизационном законодательстве в 2015 г., позволяет говорить, что в целом правовые новации, сделанные в минувшем году, должны способствовать активизации приватизационного процесса. Предлагаемое улучшение информационного обеспечения приватизации государственного и муниципального имущества, и механизма его продажи в электронной форме призвано обеспечить большую прозрачность приватизационного процесса в целом, противодействуя явлениям коррупции и криминалитета. Нельзя не отметить продолжающееся расширение практики изъятий из приватизационного закона. С момента появления в конце 2001 г. количество категорий имущества, при отчуждении которого не применяются его нормы, выросло почти вдвое (с 11 до 20) при том, что часть из них получила расширенную трактовку. Ближайшие годы должны показать, насколько потенциал этих поправок к закону о приватизации скажется на результативности данного процесса, имея в виду вклад в покрытие дефицита федерального бюджета и пополнение бюджетной системы на других уровнях публичной власти.
K11|Ипотека В Рф|В 2015 г. предоставлены 691943 ИЖК на сумму 1,15 трлн руб., что свидетельствует о снижении по сравнению с 2014 г. количественного объема на 31,68% и в денежном выражении – на 34,96%. Качество портфеля ИЖК ухудшилось: просроченная задолженность за 2015 г. относительно 2014 г. в долях от остаточной задолженности увеличилась в рублях на 0,19 п.п. до 1,04%, а в иностранной валюте – на 7,81 п.п. до 20,37%. В 2015 г. средневзвешенная ставка по ИЖК за год относительно 2014 г. поднялась в рублях на 0,88 п.п. до 13,33%, а средневзвешенная за год ставка в иностранной валюте выросла на 0,57 п.п. до 9,82%.
K11|Приватизационная Программа 20142016 Гг.: Формальные Сдвиги И Неопределенные Перспективы|Итоги действующей приватизационной программы, которая завершается в текущем году, находятся в тесной зависимости от того, как будет складываться ситуация в российской экономике в целом и конъюнктура фондового рынка в частности. В сопроводительных документах к правительственному законопроекту о федеральном бюджете на текущий год общие поступления средств от приватизации прогнозируются в 2016 г. в объеме более 33,2 млрд руб. Достижение таких величин представляется весьма проблематичным. Предполагаемая к получению бюджетом сумма приватизационных доходов сопоставима с аналогичной величиной за все 3 года действия приватизационной программы 2011–2013 гг. Однако тогда была совершенно другая экономико-политическая ситуации, радикально отличающаяся от ситуации последних двух лет (массированный отток капитала, введение разнообразных санкций, снижение обменного курса рубля, вероятность затягивания рецессии в отечественной экономике).

На основе ее первых данных могут быть представлены базовые характеристики государственной собственности и относящихся к ней хозяйствующих субъектов. Основным новшеством новой системы является переход к представлению данных в разрезе организационно-правовых форм, чего не было в рамках прежней системы показателей мониторинга госсектора, а также больший акцент именно на имуществе (недвижимость, земля, пакеты акций различной величины) с учетом его стоимости и ликвидности.

We are comparing classical case of the US Founding Fathers with a number of modern attempts (Hungary, Georgia, Ukraine, Russia) to manage economic problems of young Democracies by means of ""constitutional regulation"". ""Constitution"" is defined here as a set of values and norms (not necessary fixed), which have become deeply entrenched and accepted among the people so the changes in these norms are realized at maximum cost"
K11|Technology Entry in the Presence of Patent Thickets|We analyze the effect of patent thickets on entry into technology areas by firms in the UK. We present a model that describes incentives to enter technology areas characterized by varying technological opportunity, complexity of technology, and the potential for hold?up in patent thickets. We show empirically that our measure of patent thickets is associated with a reduction of first time patenting in a given technology area controlling for the level of technological complexity and opportunity. Technological areas characterized by more technological complexity and opportunity, in contrast, see more entry. Our evidence indicates that patent thickets raise entry costs, which leads to less entry into technologies regardless of a firm?s size.
K11|Distortions in land markets and their implications to credit generation in India|Land and buildings are a preferred collateral for lenders in India due to its ease of valuation and disposal in the event of default. Yet several distortions afflict Indian land markets that make this exercise non-trivial. These distortions - some structural, some regulatory and some information driven - are costly and have far reaching implications on credit availability as lenders adopt conservative policies ex-ante to mitigate these costs. We examine some of these distortions in the Indian land markets in this paper and highlight their significance to the current debate on reforming bankruptcy framework in India. The first part of the paper discusses structural, regulatory and informational gaps that limit lenders' ability to lend against land as well as liquidate after default. In the second part, we propose some opportunistic and structural reforms in the land markets that could enable borrowers to effectively monetize land in credit markets.
K11|Conflict Resolution, Public Goods, and Patent Thickets|Postgrant validity challenges at patent offices rely on the private initiative of third parties to correct mistakes made by patent offices. We hypothesize that incentives to bring postgrant validity challenges are reduced when many firms benefit from revocation of a patent and when firms are caught up in patent thickets. Using data on opposition to patents at the European Patent Office we show that opposition decreases in fields in which many others profit from patent revocations. Moreover, in fields with a large number of mutually blocking patents, the incidence of opposition is sharply reduced, particularly among large firms and firms that are caught up directly in patent thickets. These findings indicate that postgrant patent review may not constitute an effective correction device for erroneous patent grants in technologies affected by either patent thickets or highly dispersed patent ownership. This paper was accepted by Lee Fleming, entrepreneurship and innovation .
K11|Academic copyright in the publishing game: a contest perspective|Abstract As scientists are motivated by readership rather than by royalties, one might doubt that academic copyright is required for stimulating research. Consequently, establishing an open access regime is currently intensively being discussed. We contribute to the literature by using a contest-model in which differently talented researchers compete for limited journals space. The contest perspective adds a rent-seeking motive into the publishing game which questions that private incentives for research are always too low due to the positive externalities of scientific progress. In our model, open access always leads to higher social welfare when incentives are too high. When incentives are too low, then open access is only superior if the benefits from larger readership is sufficiently high.
K11|The Property-Contract Balance|We identify a key trade-off between protecting property rights and enhancing reliance on contracts. For instance, when a dishonest intermediary transfers a good to an innocent buyer without the owner's consent, should the buyer or the owner retain the good? We show that the optimal rule maximizes the agents' valuation of the good rather than their incentives to protect property and inquire about title. Furthermore, enhancing reliance on contracts is more appealing in countries where fewer intermediaries are honest and law enforcement is more efficient. This is consistent with novel comparative-law data on the acquisition of ownership over movables.
K11|Large investors, regulatory taking and investor-state dispute settlement|This paper offers an economic analysis of an international investor-state dispute settlement regime (ISDS) in markets with large investors. It identifies a reason for strategic overinvestment by the domestic industry, leading to permissive regulation in the absence of ISDS. An “ideal” investor-state dispute settlement arrangement (efficiency- oriented, transaction-cost free, with untouchable, fully reliable, and unbiased judges) has positive and negative effects in this framework. It generates an equal level playing field for domestic and foreign investors, but it magnifies an existing overinvestment problem and may reduce world welfare. The results explain anecdotal evidence according to which ISDS that protects foreign investors is liked by the domestic industry and disliked by other interest groups in the host country.
K11|The diversity of agents and evolution of overlapping patents on electric vehicles|This article studies the inventive activity related to electric vehicles. Particularly, examining the relationship between the overlapping patents and a diverse population of agents: Companies, non-practicing entities, individual inventors and alliances. Based on information from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), period from 1976 to 2012, it is presented: 1) as from network analysis, the increasing complexity of inventive electric vehicles; 2) the characteristics and evolution of inventive activity and, 3) its relationship with the existence of overlapping patents. It is shown that the evolution of overlapping patents (from low to high complexity) is associated with greater complexity of technological knowledge as well as greater diversity of agents.
K11|Bankruptcy and Investment: Evidence from Changes in Marital Property Laws in the U.S. South, 1840-1850|We study the impact of the introduction of a form of bankruptcy protection on household investment in the U.S. South in the 1840s, which predated modern bankruptcy laws. During this period, certain southern states passed laws that protected married women's property from seizure in the case of insolvency, amending the common law default which vested a wife's property in her husband and thus allowed it to be seized for the repayment of his debts. Importantly, these laws only applied to newlyweds. We compare couples married after the passage of a law with couples from the same state who married before the passage of a law. Since states passed laws at different points in time, we can exploit variation in protection conditional on state and year of marriage. We find that the effect on household investment was heterogeneous: if most household wealth came from the husband (wife), the law led to an increase (decrease) in investment. This is consistent with a simple model where downside protection leads to both an increase in the demand for credit and a reduction in supply. Demand effects will only dominate if a modest fraction of total wealth is protected.
K11|Collective Action by Contract: Prior Appropriation and the Development of Irrigation in the Western United States|We analyze the economic determinants and effects of prior appropriation water rights that were voluntarily implemented across an immense area of the US West, abruptly replacing common-law riparian water rights. At the same time and place, vast private irrigation infrastructure added to the US capital stock. We build upon Ostrom and Gardner (1993) and model irrigation as a coordination problem to show how prior appropriation facilitated greater private infrastructure development than was possible under the baseline riparian system by i) securing access to water against future entry and ii) defining a property right that formed the basis for contracting around collective action problems among numerous, heterogeneous agents. We construct a dataset of 7,800 rights in Colorado, established between 1852 and 2013 including location, date, size, infrastructure investment, irrigated acreage, crops, topography, stream flow, soil quality, and precipitation to test the predictions of the model. We find that prior appropriation facilitated cooperation, doubling infrastructure investment and ultimately contributing between 3% and 21% of western state income in 1930. These outcomes are relative to the baseline alternative of a riparian system. The analysis reveals institutional innovation that informs our understanding of the development of property rights, prior appropriation, and contemporary water policy.
K11|Corporate Control around the World|"We provide an autopsy of the patterns of corporate control and ownership concentration in a dataset covering more than 40,000 listed firms from 127 countries over 2004−2012. Employing a plethora of original and secondary sources, big data techniques, and applying the Shapley-Shubik algorithm to quantify shareholder’s voting power we trace ultimate controlling shareholders from the complex, pyramidal, and often obscure corporate structures. First, we show that there are large differences in the type of corporate control (widely held firms with and without significant equity blocks, firms controlled by families, governments, and other public-private firms) across and within continents. Corporate structures appear persistent as the recent global financial crisis did not affect them much. Second, we examine the role of legal traditions on corporate control. There are economically large differences on corporate structure across legal families, with the share of controlled (widely-held) firms being the highest (lowest) in French civil-law countries, followed by German and then Scandinavian civil law countries. State ownership and control by individual/families via complex corporate structures is pervasive in civil-law countries. And while equity blocks are commonplace across widely-held firms all around the world and across all legal families, the share of widely-held firms with large blocks is the highest in French civil-law countries. Moreover, ownership concentration is considerably higher in French civil-law (and to a lesser extent in German civil-law) countries as compared to common-law countries. These patterns apply to very large, big, medium-sized and small listed firms and are not driven by regional differences, the level of economic development, or industrial structure, suggesting that legal origin has sizable long-lasting consequences on corporate structure. Third, as legal origin may affect corporate control via multiple channels, we examine the role of some likely mechanisms. We find that shareholder protection rights against self-dealing activities of insiders correlate strongly with corporate control and ownership concentration. Legal formalism and creditor’s rights do not seem to play a role. Yet, the ""reduced-form"" link between legal origin and corporate control (and ownership concentration) is also driven by entry and labour market regulation."
K11|Altering The Use Of Agricultural Into Construction Land - Practice And Trends| Preservation of agricultural land as an imperative of prosperity of agriculture of the Republic of Serbia needs to be observed through causal questions as well, such as change of purpose of agricultural land into construction land, which is necessarily followed by conversion, a decade-long problem. Insufficiently resolved current questions of the aforementioned within legislative framework open up the possibility for improper use and exploitation of agricultural land. It is necessary to regulate the issue of conversion of construction land by legislative regulations i.e. altering use rights into property rights on construction land, and by doing so, open the way to investments in the Republic of Serbia. With the analysis of the effects of conversion and the adoption of a special law on this issue, construction activity would further prosper. The aim of this paper is to assess adequately the current problems of consumption, preservation and actual implementation of transferring agricultural land to construction land, with a view of the facts, practices and tendencies.
K11|Changing the hearing date in the proceedings regarding the registration of rights acquired by usucapio|Article 230 of the New Civil Procedure Code assumes all provisions of Article 153 para. 3 of the old Civil Procedure Code. It may be concluded that there are no problems in this situation and the hearing date can be changed ex officio or at the request of any interested party when there are reasonable grounds. We must bear in mind, however, the way we relate to the civil action and not neglect the special procedural provisions - where they exist- in view of the correct enforcement of law. A particular situation, when the change of the hearing date encounters controversy, arises when a corroboration of the provisions of Article 230 of the New Civil Procedure Code with the provisions of Article 1051 of the New Civil Procedure Code on the usucapio procedure is required. The judicial practice demonstrates the existence of controversial situations we are trying to present herein, while trying to come up with proposals to improve the relevant legislation.

K11|Jurisprudential aspects regarding the action in annulment of the debtor’s patrimonial transfers, the debtor being in insolvency procedure|The study aims to present relevant aspects from the jurisprudential solutions of the High Court of Cassation and Justice in matters of the action in annulment of the patrimonial transfers of the debtor in insolvency procedure and of other judicial actions introduced by the procedure bodies or, by case, the participants to the procedure who are enabled to use the measures prescribed by the law for the purpose of restoring the debtor’s patrimony. The jurisprudential solutions adopted under the incidence of the former Law no.85/2006 on the insolvency procedure represent, in present, under diverse aspects, elements of continuity with the principles and rules established by the new law in this matter. Law no.85/2014 on the prevention insolvency procedures and of insolvency establishes the legal frame for the exertion of the measures having as purpose the restoration, in the debtor’s patrimony, of certain assets, transferred by the debtor to the fraud of the creditors’ interests, or of their value, in the scope of covering the passive part to satisfy the creditors’ interests. The new law continues the tradition of the former regulations in this matter but, also, brings some novelty elements such as the decrease or, in some cases, the increase of the duration of certain terms that the exertion of the mentioned judicial actions or their object refer to or the completion of the category of the persons entitled to introduce the mentioned judicial actions with the creditor who holds more than 50% of the value of the claims enlisted in the amount of claims.
K11|Superficies in the form of the right to superpose|The purpose of this paper is to present the current legal framework related to the superficies right in the form of the right to superpose, and especially to draw the attention and put certain question marks regarding the actuality or even the urgency of the need for regulation regarding the right to superpose. First, as a preliminary aspect, in order to emphasize the historical evolution of the superficies right, we will briefly present the development of this concept starting from the Roman law up to the present date. Second, by analysing the relevant legislation, the doctrine and the jurisprudence, the authors set themselves to present the main methods for constituting the superficies right. Third, the characteristics related to the right to superpose will be correlatively laid out. Fourth, the possibility to obtain a building permit on the basis of the right to superpose will also be analysed. Fifth, the recently entered-into-force legislative framework regarding the registration of the right to superpose and of the building thus erected is presented. Last but not least, the conclusions of this paper are presented, highlighting the necessity for more clearly defined rules regulating the legal status of the right to superpose, in order to avoid any confusions and inconsistencies in practice.
K11|La prise en compte du statut d'époux par le droit des affaires de l'Organisation pour l'Harmonisation en Afrique du Droit des Affaires (OHADA)|Taking into account the status of spouses by business law of the Organization for the Harmonization of African Business Law (OHADA) is referring to general commercial law and company law. The OHADA legislator values the status of spouses devoting equality between spouses, through the possibility for them to be able to be involved in low risk companies; the recognition of the de facto company between them and the right granted to each power, under the same conditions, benefit from the commercial lease originally attached to privileges. The consideration that the OHADA law grants the quality of husband appears in heritage protection thereof, insofar as it puts it away in case of depletion bad deal made by one of them . This is why the prohibition for spouses to be involved in the unlimited risk firms and the requirement of a separate trade as a condition for the spouse of the trader can also acquire the same status. But the heritage protection system spouse taken from the OHADA business law is supplemented by certain mechanisms of civil law, including matrimonial property regimes, although not all have the same efficiency. Indeed, among the two groups of matrimonial property regimes are known as separation schemes and those of the community property, only the first effectively protect the couple's assets. This objective likely was not assigned to the second from the design. These look more forward the merger of most of the assets of the couple without the slightest idea of calculation.
K11|Privatization in the name of public private partnership: the case of Tanzania Breweries Ltd., an evaluation|The policies of International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) have made significant impact in most developing countries, particularly in South of the Sahara. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is one of the policies spearheaded by these institutions. Countries like Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya, have experienced a wave of economic reforms in recent years. These reforms, to a larger extent, which have been inspired by International Institutions, have recently faced with a magnitude of concerns which is expressed in terms of whether the right kind of pre-conditions exists for these measures since some of the measures don’t produce the desired outcomes in some developing countries. The thrust of the evaluation has been on whether privatization through Public Private Partnership presents a profitable policy in Tanzania. In other words, if there is any evidence of significant performance of State Operated Enterprises after privatization. This research takes stock of the evidence in pre and post three privatized companies and shows that in competitive environment privatization has been a resounding success in improving performance of public enterprises.
K11|The institutions of Roman markets|I analyze the basis of the market economy in classical Rome, from the perspective of personal-versus-impersonal exchange and focusing on the role of the state in providing market-enabling institutions. I start by reviewing the central conflict in all exchanges between those holding and those acquiring property rights, and how solving it requires reducing information asymmetry without endangering the security of property. Relying on a model of the social choice of institutions, I identify the demand and supply factors driving the institutional choices made by the Romans, and examine the economic circumstances that influenced these factors in the classical period of Roman law. Comparing the predictions of the model with the main solutions used by Roman law in the areas of property, business exchange and the enforcement of personal obligations allows me to propose alternative interpretations for some salient institutions that have been subject to controversy in the literature, and to conclude with an overall positive assessment of the market-enabling role of the Roman state.
K11|Expiration of private property rights: a note|According to libertarian law, upon what occasions may a person’s private property rights in goods, commodities, in himself, be alienated from him? The present paper is an attempt to wrestle with this question. We consider abandonment, punishment, salvage, misplacement, liberation of property.
K11|Attention and Saliency on the Internet: Evidence from an Online Recommendation System|Using high-frequency transaction-level data from an online retail store, we examine whether consumer choices on the internet are consistent with models of limited attention. We test whether consumers are more likely to buy products that receive a saliency shock when they are recommended by new products. To identify the saliency effect, we rely on i) the timing of new product arrivals, ii) the fact that new products are per se highly salient upon arrival, drawing more attention and iii) regional variation in the composition of recommendation sets. We find a sharp and robust 6% increase in theaggregate sales of existing products after they are recommended by a new product. To structurally disentangle the effect of saliency on a consumer’s consideration and choice decision, we use data on individual transactions to estimate a probabilistic choice set model. We find that the saliency effectis driven largely by an expansion of consumers’ consideration sets.

K11|Technology Entry in the Presence of Patent Thickets|We analyze the effect of patent thickets on entry into technology areas by firms in the UK. We present a model that describes incentives to enter technology areas characterized by varying technological opportunity, complexity, and the potential for hold-up due to the presence of patent thickets. We show empirically that our measure of patent thickets is associated with a reduction of first time patenting in a given technology area controlling for the level of technological complexity and opportunity. Technological areas characterized by more technological complexity and opportunity, in contrast, see more entry. Our evidence indicates that patent thickets raise entry costs, which leads to less entry into technologies regardless of a firm’s size.
K11|Falling Off the Map: The Impact of Formalizing (Some) Informal Settlements in Tanzania|When the Tanzanian government formalized over 200,000 informal land claims by granting leasehold titles to residents of unplanned settlements in Dar es Salaam in 2004, a few neighborhoods in the initial plan were excluded due to missing satellite photos. We examine the impact of this low-cost, large-scale titling intervention a decade later in a regression discontinuity design using new survey data collected on either side of the arbitrary boundary created by the missing photos. We find significant, positive effects on housing investment, and indicative but not statistically robust increases in tenure security and reductions in land sales. There is no evidence that titles improved access to credit markets.
K11|Property rights and the stock market-growth nexus|Using threshold estimation techniques, this study examines whether the growth effect of stock market development differs according to the different levels of property rights and minority shareholders protection in a cross-section of 85 jurisdictions during the post-crisis period. The results demonstrate that the impact of stock market liquidity on growth is positive and significant only in jurisdictions where there is high level of property rights protection. Similar effect is discerned in the case of strong minority shareholders protection. Using the market size as a measure of stock market development, the paper also documents a positive growth effect of market size when property rights and minority shareholders protection are strong. However, there is mixed evidence in the low to medium degrees of protection. Further analyses using other broader governance indicators as threshold variables and instrumental variable threshold regressions reaffirm the main findings. The study upholds the “better finance, more growth” proposition and contributes to the identification of thresholds above which institutional quality can positively shape the impact of stock market on economic growth.
K11|“Selling Out” and the impact of music piracy on artist entry|There is a puzzle arising from empirical analyses of the impact of music piracy that this has caused declines in music revenue without a consequential decline, and perhaps even an increase, in the entry of artists and the supply of high quality music. There have been numerous explanations posited and this paper adds a novel one: that artists are time inconsistent and hence, tend to underweight fame over fortune when making future choices; i.e., the degree to which they will ‘sell out.’ Regardless of whether selling out is anticipated or not, the puzzle is resolved. When selling out is not anticipated, future expectations of piracy are not a concern as these only impact on monetary awards that are not driving entry. When selling out is anticipated, piracy actually constrains the degree to which artists sell out, and assured of that, raises entry returns. Implications and the role of publisher contracts are also explored.
K11|Revealing the rapist next door: Property impacts of a sex offender registry|How do homebuyers respond to perceived crime risks about sex offenders in the neighborhood? I evaluate local property and crime responses to Internet sex offender registry listings. Among more permanent listings, a nearby offender depresses house prices by up to 4 percentage points. I document that the majority of registered sex offenders are transient, with durations of less than 6 months at an address. While a growing literature suggests that housing stability is important in reducing criminal behavior, the market perceives heightened crime risks to be attached to the listings of registered offenders with more stable housing, but not to those who are transient or who have moved away. Prices correspond more strongly to long-term offender locations than to locations of actual sex crimes. I find small, localized reductions in rapes involving weapons within 0.1mi of offender addresses and increases in sex crimes farther away.
K11|Do property rights matter? Evidence from a property law enactment|This paper considers a property law enactment that gave creditors more rights over the assets underlying their secured loans to private firms and gave private firms more protections against the potential expropriation of their assets. We find that this property law enactment led to a significant increase in firm value. We also find that the law׳s impact on value was more profound for firms with more tangible assets, lower internal cash flows, and stronger growth opportunities, and less profound for politically connected firms. Taken together, our findings confirm the importance of property rights protection in enhancing firm value.
K11|The role of informational uncertainty in the decision to strategically default|This study identifies a severe gap between the financial backlash borrowers believe awaits them after strategic mortgage default and the reality that lenders rarely pursue deficiency judgments. This coupled with the social norm finding that borrowers widely view strategic default as immoral, leads us to recommend lenders and policymakers seeking to stem the tide of defaults to pursue a policy of informational opacity. We make several recommendations for how to carry out such a policy as well as what might need to change in society before the alternative policy of informational transparency becomes ideal.
K11|Factors underlying short sales|The short sale process has emerged as the most common alternative to the traditional foreclosure process in the recent mortgage crisis. This paper examines the factors that affect the liquidation outcome between these two ways of disposing the housing asset. We find that better quality borrowers such as those with higher credit scores and with full documentation status are more likely to prefer and obtain approval of short sales, involvement of mortgage insurance firms and second lien holders reduces short sales, and that state foreclosure laws such as longer foreclosure delay and the statutory right of redemption reduce short sales. The results have implications for ostensibly borrower-friendly measures promoted by governmental entities.
K11|Who is afraid of pirates? An experiment on the deterrence of innovation by imitation|In the policy debate, intellectual property is often justified by what seems to be a straightforward argument: if innovators are not protected against others appropriating their ideas, incentives for innovation are suboptimally low. Now, in most industries and for most potential users, appropriating a foreign innovation is itself an investment decision fraught with cost and risk. Nonetheless, standard theory predicts too little innovation. Arguably the problem is exacerbated by the sensitivity of innovators to fairness; imitators do get a free lunch, after all.
K11|Blight remediation in the Southeast: local approaches to design and implementation|Blight—or the proliferation of vacant, abandoned, or poorly maintained properties—is a critical community issue in many cities in the Southeast as in other regions of the United States, as economic shifts experienced in the past few decades have changed neighborhoods significantly. Municipalities dealing with this issue recognize what is well documented in the literature—that blight is associated with social, economic, environmental, and public health effects on neighborhoods. The recent recession has led to a surge of abandoned and bank-owned properties, disproportionately located in poor and unstable neighborhoods. The causes of blight vary by city and even by neighborhood, but many cities are dealing with blighted parcels as a result of some combination of suburbanization, population decline, job losses (particularly in the manufacturing sector), foreclosures, and natural events that render structures or lots unusable. Southeastern cities are also unique in that lower population densities often deter revitalization. {{p}} To understand how various blight remediation strategies have been implemented, we selected two case study communities for analysis, which included extensive interviews with local stakeholders. We chose New Orleans, Louisiana, and Macon, Georgia, based on their location, size, the extent of their blight issues, and their commitment to blight remediation. New Orleans and Macon have each experienced significant blight and are leaders in the Southeast in creating and refining robust strategies for combating blight. {{p}} This paper describes several findings in terms of regional blight remediation efforts. Lessons learned include the importance of data collection and visualization, the need for an overarching, jurisdiction-wide blight strategy, the value of transparent and realistic metrics, the need for strong leadership and strategic partnerships that leverage political will and resources, the need for public participation, and the effectiveness of strategies such as strong code enforcement and land banking over expropriation or eminent domain.

K11|Issues of RF State Treasury Property Management in Russia in 2014|Due to the radical character of market transformations that took place in the Russian economy in the 1990s, including reform of the ownership relations oriented to prompt privatization, for a long time there was no interest in the issues of public property management in Russia. Some progress in that sphere occurred after the crisis period of 1997–1998, when a certain shift in the government property policy priorities could be seen. The onset of a new phase in the ownership relations reform in Russia was triggered by the approval, by Decree of the RF Government No 1024 of 9 September 1999, of the Concept of State Property Management and Privatization in the Russian Federation (hereinafter – Concept). It was probably a symbolic event, in that for the first time since 1992 the issues of state property management were given priority over formal alterations to ownership forms.
