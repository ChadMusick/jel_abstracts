I10|Boosting quality education with inclusive human development: empirical evidence from sub-Saharan Africa|This study examines the importance of inclusive human development in promoting education quality in a panel of forty-nine Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Fixed Effects (FE) and Quantile Regression (QR) estimations. It is apparent from the OLS and FE findings that inclusive human development has a negative effect on the outcome variable. This negative effect implies that inclusive human development improves education quality. This result should be understood in the light of the fact that the adopted education variable is a negative economic signal given that it is computed as the ratio of pupils to teachers. Therefore, a higher ratio reflects diminishing education quality. From QR, with the exception of the highest quantile, the tendency of inclusive human development in reducing poor quality education is consistent throughout the conditional distribution of poor education quality. Policy implications are discussed.
I10|Inequality and the Economic Participation of Women in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Empirical Investigation|This study investigates the effect of inequality on female employment in 42 countries in sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2004-2014. Three inequality indicators are used, namely, the: Gini coefficient, Atkinson index and Palma ratio. Two indicators of gender inclusion are also employed, namely: female employment and female unemployment rates. The empirical analysis is based on the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM).The following main findings are established. First, inequality increases female unemployment in regressions based on the Palma ratio. Second, from the robustness checks, inequality reduces female employment within the frameworks of the Gini coefficient and Palma ratio.
I10|Inequality thresholds,Governance and gender economic inclusion in Sub-Saharan Africa|Inequality and gender economic exclusion are major policy concerns facing sub-Saharan Africa in the post-2015 development agenda. The study provides critical masses of inequality that should not be exceeded if governance is to promote gender economic participation. The research focuses on 42 countries in sub-Saharan Africa using annual data spanning from 2004 to 2014. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalized Method of Moments. The following findings are established. First, inequality (i.e. the Gini coefficient) levels that completely nullify the positive effect of governance on female labour force participation are 0.708 for political stability, 0.601 for voice & accountability, 0.588 for government effectiveness, 0.631 for regulatory quality, 0.612 for the rule of law, and 0.550 for corruption-control. Second, inequality thresholds at which female unemployment can no longer be mitigated by governance channels include: 0.561 (for political stability) and 0.465 (for the rule of law). Third, inequality levels that completely dampen the positive impact of governance on female employment are 0.608 for political stability, 0.580 for voice & accountability, 0.581 for government effectiveness, and 0.557 for the rule of law. As the main policy implication, for good governance to promote gender economic inclusion, inequality levels should not exceed established thresholds.
I10|How enhancing gender inclusion affects inequality:Thresholds of complementary policies for sustainable development|This study investigates how enhancing gender inclusion affects inequality in 42 African countries for the period 2004-2014. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalized Method of Moments. Three inequality indicators are used, namely, the: Gini coefficient, Atkinson index, and Palma ratio. The two gender inclusion measurements used include female labour force participation and female employment. The following main findings are established. There are positive net effects on inequality from the enhancement of gender inclusion dynamics. An extended threshold analysis is used to assess critical masses at which further increasing gender inclusion enhances inequality. The established thresholds are: (i) 55.555 ?employment to population ratio, 15+, female (%)?for the nexus with the Gini coefficient. (ii) 50 ?labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+)? and between 50 to 55 ?employment to population ratio, 15+, female (%)?, for the Atkinson index. (iii) 61.87 ?labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+)? for the Palma ratio. These established thresholds are worthwhile for sustainable development because, beyond the critical masses, policy makers should complement the gender inclusion policy with other measures designed to reduce income inequality. Some complementary measures that can be taken on board beyond the established thresholds could focus on enhancing, inter alia: information and communication technology, infrastructural development; financial inclusion and inclusive education.
I10|Income levels,governance and inlusive human development in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study examines how income-driven governance affects inclusive human development in Sub-Saharan Africa with data for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) and Tobit regressions. Nine bundled and unbundled concepts of governance are used: political (voice & accountability and political stability/no violence), economic (government effectiveness and regulation quality) and institutional (corruption-control and the rule of law) governances. The main finding is that ?middle income?-driven governance has a higher effect on inclusive human development than ?low income?-driven governance. Policy implications are discussed in the light of: (i) the contemporary relevance of findings; (ii) the pivotal role of a higher income level in the post-2015 sustainable development agenda; and (iii) inconsistent strands in the literature and in foreign aid policies.
I10|Health spending in Italy: the impact of immigrants|The welfare impact of immigration is a hot topic especially for countries at the external borders of the European Union. This paper studies how immigrants affect public health expenditure across Italian regions during the period 2003-2015. Identification strategy is based on shift{share instruments, which are also robust to pull factors that might attract immigrants in Italy and to internal migration of natives. We find that a 1 percentage point increase in immigrants over total population leads to a decrease in public health expenditure per capita by about 3.9% (i.e. around 70 euro per capita). This evidence is confirmed when focusing on needy immigrants from low income countries with less developed welfare systems. Among possible channels, we find no support for any crowding out effects from public to private health services by natives due to increasing immigration neither for the effect of entry barriers limiting the immigrants' reliance on public healthcare. Our results are driven by immigrants' demographic structure: foreigners are mostly males and younger workers that call for less health spending, according to a positive selection mechanism.
I10|Technical Efficiency and Corporate Structure of Italian Private Hospitals: Evidence from One-step Stochastic Frontier Analysis|This paper aims to identify the relationship between the output-oriented technical efficiency of Italian private hospitals and their ownership structure. Using the one-step Stochastic Frontier Analysis technique, we explain technical efficiency throughout a set of variables capturing the firm’s shareholder activity, ownership concentration, and managerial ownership. Results suggest that (1) technical efficiency is positively affected by managerial ownership, and (2) private hospitals are more efficient when ownership concentration is low.
I10|Disease management in diabetes care: when involving GPs improves patient compliance and health outcomes|Although the study of the association between interventions in primary care and health outcomes continues to produce mixed findings, programs designed to promote the greater compliance of General Practitioners and their diabetic patients with treatment guidelines have been increasingly introduced worldwide, in an attempt to achieve better quality diabetes care through the enhanced standardisation of patient supervision. In this study we use clinical data taken from the Diabetes Register of one Local Health Authority (LHAs) in Italy’s Emilia-Romagna Region for the period 2014-2015. Firstly, we test to see whether the monitoring activities prescribed for diabetics by regional diabetes guidelines, actually have a positive impact on patients’ health outcomes and increase appropriateness in health care utilization. Secondly, we investigate whether GPs’ participation in the local Diabetes Management Program (DMP) leads to improved patient compliance with regional guidelines. Our results show that such a program, which aims to increase GPs’ involvement and cooperation in following regional guidelines for best practices, achieves its goal of improved patient compliance with the prescribed actions. In turn, through the implementation of the DMP and the greater involvement of physicians, regional policies have succeeded in promoting better health outcomes and the improved appropriateness of health care utilization.
I10|Prices for and Spending on Specialty Drugs in Medicare Part D and Medicaid|In recent years, the prices charged for specialty drugs have become a source of concern for many policymakers. Such drugs typically treat chronic, complex, or rare conditions, frequently have high prices, and may require special handling or patient monitoring. They accounted for a growing share of total net drug spending from 2010 to 2015 in both Medicareâ€™s prescription drug benefit (Part D) and Medicaid. The net prices paid for specialty drugs are much higher in Medicare Part D than in Medicaid, and net spending on such drugs grew much faster in Medicare Part D than in Medicaid.
I10|Key Design Components and Considerations for Establishing a Single-Payer Health Care System|Some Members of Congress have proposed establishing a single-payer health care system in the United States to ensure that virtually everyone has health insurance. In a typical single-payer system, people enroll in a health plan operated by the government, and the receipts and expenditures associated with the plan appear in the governmentâ€™s budget. This report describes the primary features of single-payer systems, and it discusses some of the design considerations and choices that policymakers will face in developing proposals for establishing such a system.
I10|Prices for and Spending on Specialty Drugs in Medicare Part D and Medicaid: An In-Depth Analysis: Working Paper 2019-02|In this working paper, the Congressional Budget Office examines the prices paid for specialty drugs and spending on those drugs in Medicare Part D and Medicaid from 2010 to 2015. Specialty drugs treat chronic, complex, or rare conditions, frequently have high prices, and may require special handling or monitoring of patients. The retail prices paid to pharmacies for brand-name specialty drugs are similar in Medicare Part D and Medicaid, but net prices are much higher in Medicare Part D because rebates from manufacturers are substantially lower than in Medicaid. In 2015, the
I10|Sources and Preparation of Data Used in HISIM2â€”CBOâ€™s Health Insurance Simulation Model: Working Paper 2019-04|CBOâ€™s new health insurance simulation model, HISIM2, is a microsimulation model, meaning that it uses individual-level input data to simulate population behavior. Beginning with the spring 2019 baseline budget projections, CBO completely revamped the way it models consumer and employer behavior; the agency also updated to new sources of individual-level input data. This paper describes the input data and the procedures for adjusting and adding to those data to form the sample used by HISIM2. The new model has been designed to use the Current Population Survey as its main
I10|Social Capital and Health: A Meta-Analysis|This study investigates the extensive empirical literature on social capital and health using meta-analysis. Our final sample consists of 12,459 estimated effects taken from 450 studies. Our main result is that the overall mean size of the effect of social capital on health is very small, though it is statistically significant. This low association follows from a relatively large share of individually insignificant estimates, combined with the large sample sizes that characterize this literature. Furthermore, despite an extensive theoretical literature concerned with delineating different kinds of social capital, we find few systematic empirical differences. While cognitive social capital has a significantly stronger association with health than structural social capital, especially for mental health, the difference is empirically minor. There is no evidence of significant differences between bonding, bridging, and linking social capital.
I10|Dirty Density: Air Quality and the Density of American Cities|We study whether urban density affects the exposure of city dwellers to ambient air pollution using satellite-derived measures of air quality for the contiguous United States. For identification, we rely on an instrumental variable strategy, which induces exogenous variation in density without affecting pollution directly. For this purpose, we use three variables measuring geological characteristics as instruments for density: earthquake risks, soil drainage capacity and the presence of aquifers. We find a positive and statistically significant pollution-density elasticity of 0.13. We also assess the health implications of our findings and find that doubling density in an average city increases annual mortality costs by as much as $630 per capita. Our results suggest that, despite the common claim that denser cities tend to be more environmentally friendly, air pollution exposure is higher in denser cities. This in turn highlights the possible trade-off between reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and preserving environmental quality within cities.
I10|Changing Current Net Nutrition with Weight as a Measure of Net Nutritional Change with the Transition from Bound to Free Labor: A Difference-in-Decompositions Approach|A population’s weight conditioned on height reflects its current net nutrition and demonstrates health variation during economic development. This study builds on the use of weight as a measure for current net nutrition and uses a difference-in-decompositions technique to illustrate how black and white current net nutrition varied with the transition to free-labor. Adult black age-related weight gain was greater with the transition to free-labor yet was not as large as the adult white age related weight gain. Agricultural worker’s current net nutrition was better than workers in other occupations, and agricultural workers’ net nutrition was better than workers in other occupations but was worse-off with the transition to free labor. Nativity had the greatest effect with weight changes and the transition to free-labor. Within-group weight variation was greater than across-group variation.
I10|The Impact of New Drug Launches on Hospitalization in 2015 for 67 Medical Conditions in 15 OECD Countries: A Two-Way Fixed-Effects Analysis|There are two types of prescription drug cost offsets. The first type of cost offset – from prescription drug use – is primarily about the effect of changes in drug quantity (e.g. due to changes in out-of-pocket drug costs) on other medical costs. Previous studies indicate that the cost offsets from prescription drug use may slightly exceed the cost of the drugs themselves. The second type of cost offset – the cost offset from prescription drug innovation – is primarily about the effect of prescription drug quality on other medical costs. Two previous studies (of a single disease or a single country) found that pharmaceutical innovation reduced hospitalization, and that the reduction in hospital cost from the use of newer drugs was considerably greater than the innovation-induced increase in pharmaceutical expenditure. In this study, we reexamine the impact that pharmaceutical innovation has had on hospitalization, employing a different type of 2-way fixed effects research design. In lieu of analyzing different countries over time for a single disease, or different diseases over time for a single country, we estimate the impact that new drug launches that occurred during the period 1982–2015 had on hospitalization in 2015 for 67 diseases in 15 OECD countries. Our models include both country fixed effects and disease fixed effects, which control for the average propensity of people to be hospitalized in each country and from each disease. The number of hospital discharges and days of care in 2015 is significantly inversely related to the number of drugs launched during 1982–2005, but not significantly related to the number of drugs launched after 2005. (Utilization of drugs during the first few years after they are launched is relatively low, and drugs for chronic conditions may have to be consumed for several years to achieve full effectiveness.) The estimates imply that, if no new drugs had been launched after 1981, total days of care in 2015 would have been 163% higher than it actually was. The estimated reduction in 2015 hospital expenditure that may be attributable to post-1981 drug launches was 5.3 times as large as 2015 expenditure on those drugs.
I10|Body weight and United States economic development, 1840-1940|When traditional measures for material and economic welfare are scarce or unreliable, height and the body mass index (BMI) are now widely accepted measures that represent cumulative and current net nutrition in development studies. However, as the ratio of weight to height, BMI does not fully isolate the effects of current net nutrition. After controlling for height as a measure for current net nutrition, this study uses the weight of a sample of international men in US prisons. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, individuals with darker complexions had greater weights than individuals with fairer complexions. Mexican and Asian populations in the US had lower weights and reached shorter statures. Black and white weights stagnated throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Agricultural workers’ had greater weights than workers in other occupations.
I10|Birth in times of war - An investigation of health, mortality and social class using historical clinical records|While World War II (WWII) is often employed as natural experiment to identify long-term effects of adverse early-life and prenatal conditions, little is known about the short-term effects. We estimate the short-term impact of the onset of WWII on newborn health using a unique data set of historical birth records ranging from December 1937 to September 1941. Furthermore we investigate the heterogeneity of this effect with respect to health at birth and for different social groups. To evaluate potential channels for our results, we explore how birth procedures changed. While we do not find any effects on birth weight and asphyxia, perinatal mortality increases immediately after the onset of WWII. The mortality effect is driven by live births and strongest for very low birth weight infants. A decline in quality of medical care due to the sudden conscription of trained physicians to military service is the most likely mechanism for our findings.
I10|Voting Up? The Effects of Democracy and Franchise Extension on Human Stature|We study the health effects of the spread of democratic institutions and the extension of voting rights in 15 European countries since the middle of the nineteenth century. We employ both cross country and cohort variation in heights and employ a new instrument for democracy and the extension of the franchise, the effect of decolonisation on democracy in the colonising country's democratisation to identify the causal effect of democracy on heights. We find robust evidence of a link between democratic quality and human stature. The results indicate that the transition to democracy increased average male heights by 0.7 to 1 cm, equivalent to a one-decade average increase in stature across cohorts. Including the extension of the franchise to women increases the effect on average stature to about 1.7cm. The effect is driven by both political participation and contestation in reducing inequality and expanding health insurance coverage.
I10|The impact of age at arrival on education and mental health|Given the importance of education and mental health for labor market performance, we study how these outcomes are affected by the age at which refugees arrive in the country. We identify the causal impact of age at arrival by comparing siblings who share the same family background characteristics, but arrive at different ages. Given the importance of education and mental health for labor market performance, we study how these outcomes are affected by the age at which refugees arrive in the country. We identify the causal impact of age at arrival by comparing siblings who share the same family background characteristics, but arrive at different ages. We find significant and meaningful impacts of age at arrival on educational attainment, but not on mental health. Arriving one year earlier increases the probability to obtain a higher educational degree by 3.6 percentage points. We find this impact to be stronger for girls than for boys. We do not find evidence suggesting that the impact of age at arrival becomes more pronounced after a specific age. Our findings carry important policy implications for the allocation of scarce resources available for integration of refugees as we show that refugee children who arrive at an older age will have substantially reduced educational outcomes compared to those who arrive at a younger age. This also implies that child refugees arriving via family reunification would benefit substantially from reductions in asylum application processing time, even if realized reductions are small.
I10|Does Access to Health Care Mitigate Environmental Damages?|Differential access to health care is commonly cited as a source of heterogeneity in environmental health damages, yet little causal evidence exists to support such claims. We address this deficit in two settings by testing whether the negative impacts of ambient temperature exposure on mortality were mitigated by (1) access to primary care through the Community Health Center program, and (2) access to hospital care through the desegregation of Southern hospitals. The results demonstrate that increased access to health care can drive heterogeneity in environmental damages when the mode of care is sufficiently relevant to the damages suffered.
I10|The Impact of Car Pollution on Infant and Child Health: Evidence from Emissions Cheating|Car exhaust is a major source of air pollution, but little is known about its impacts on population health. We exploit the dispersion of emissions-cheating diesel cars—which secretly polluted up to 150 times as much as gasoline cars—across the United States from 2008-2015 as a natural experiment to measure the health impact of car pollution. Using the universe of vehicle registrations, we demonstrate that a 10 percent cheating-induced increase in car exhaust increases rates of low birth weight and acute asthma attacks among children by 1.9 and 8.0 percent, respectively. These health impacts occur at all pollution levels and across the entire socioeconomic spectrum.
I10|Health, Cognition and Work Capacity Beyond the Age of 50 International Evidence on the Extensive and Intensive Margin of Work|The rising cost of old-age dependency in Europe and elsewhere invariably leads to reforms aimed at raising the effective age or retirement. But do older individuals have the health/cognitive capacity to work longer? Following Cutler et al. (2012), this paper asks how much older individuals could work if they worked as much as their younger (50-54) counterparts in similar health/with equal cognitive performance. Contrary to existing papers, this one uses international, European, comparable panel evidence available in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). It considers both physical health and cognition; and health consists of subjective and objective measures. Also, it examines the extensive and intensive margins of work (employment and hours): existing papers only consider the former. Results are essentially fivefold. First, declines in health significantly affect employment. Second, the impact on hours is statistical significant but of much smaller magnitude. People suffering from ill health rarely adjust hours; they rather stop working altogether. Third, cognition is not fundamentally affected by ageing, and it adds little to our capacity to predict how work capacity evolves with age. Fourth, identification issues exist and must be addressed. They comprise unobserved heterogeneity across respondents, justification bias or proxying/measurement errors regarding health. Finally, declining health/cognition explain at most 31% of the actual labour supply reduction between 50 and 70. This confirms the existence of a, currently largely underused, work capacity among older individuals.
I10|Mothers and Fathers : Education, Co-residence and Child Health|We use four waves of Demographic and Health Surveys from Zimbabwe to evaluate the effect of mother’s and father’s education on child health outcomes. We identify causal effects using the 1980 education reform. A simultaneous-equation model is estimated to take into account possible selection and endogeneity biases. Our results suggest some specialization within parents, as mothers and fathers do not affect the same health outcomes of their under-5 children. Fathers matter more than mothers, and mother’s education improves health only when she is matched to a low-educated man. There is selection in our sample, as is usual. The inverse Mills ratio capturing the likelihood of living with one’s father or mother significantly affects child health. Last, parental educational sorting is shown to be important, so that estimation that does not take both mother’s and father’s education into account will produce biased results.
I10|The Effect of Maternal Education on Offspring's Mental Health|We estimate the causal effect of maternal education on the mental health of mother’s children in late adolescence and adulthood. Theoretical considerations are ambiguous about a causal effect of maternal education on children’s mental health. To identify the causal effect of maternal education, we exploit exogenous variation in maternal years of schooling, caused by a compulsory schooling law reform in West Germany. Based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, we ﬁnd no evidence of a causal protective effect of maternal education on children’s mental health. Instead, our empirical results suggest a moderate negative effect of maternal education on the daughters’ mental health. We ﬁnd no effects for the sons. Our investigation of potential mechanisms is consistent with the hypothesis that the negative effect of higher maternal labor supply outweighs the positive effect of an expansion in household resources.
I10|Mortality in Midlife for Subgroups in Germany|Case and Deaton (2015) document that, since 1998, midlife mortality rates are increasing for white non-Hispanics in the US. This trend is driven by deaths from drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related diseases, termed as deaths of despair, and by the subgroup of low-educated individuals. In contrast, average mortality for middle-aged men and women continued to decrease in several other high-income countries including Germany. However, average mortality rates can disguise important differences between subgroups and the phenomenon of increasing mortality rates might also be present for subpopulations in these countries. Hence, we analyze how mortality in midlife is changing for several important demographic subgroups in Germany over the 1990 to 2015 period with a focus on deaths of despair. Our results show a very clear pattern: We find that mortality rates declined between 1990 and 2015, with no increases in deaths of despair for any of the subgroups. Thus, our findings starkly contrast with those for the US.
I10|Kommunal medfinansiering og kampen for at forebygge indlæggelser: Viden om effekt / Municipal co-financing of regional health services and the fight to prevent hospital admissions: Knowledge about effects|Municipal co-payment is an arrangement where municipalities pay a variable amount to the regions whenever municipal citizens utilize regional health services, e.g. hospital services og GPs. The 5 Danish regions provide somatic and mental health services while municipalities mainly provide home nursing, home help, health visitors, rehabilitation, and child and youth dental services. Municipalities cannot employ physicians who actively treat patients. Municipal co-payment was introduced in 2007 in connection with the structural reform of municipalities and counties. The main idea was that economic incentives in the form of potential savings on co-payment would lead municipalities to look for alternatives to (some) regional health services. The municipalities have developed, among other things, acute beds (usually in conjunction with nursing homes) staffed by experienced home nurses that GPs can refer patients to instead of hospitalizing them, acute nursing teams that provide services in the homes of citizens, follow-home-service where home nurses follow discharged hospital patients to their homes (occasionally together with a GP) and evaluate care needs – in the hope of avoiding rehospitalizations. To the extent that these arrangements have been evaluated they are discussed in this paper. None have shown clear-cut indications of preventing or postponing hospitalizations. The paper services two aims: A literature review of above reports and an econometric analysis of panel data for 2007-2016/17. The econometric analysis did not show any significant effects on hospital admissions.
I10|Child Socio-Emotional Skills: The Role of Parental Inputs|Informed by the psychological literature and our empirical evidence we provide new insights into the technology of socio-emotional skill formation in middle childhood. In line with economic evidence, increasing parental inputs that enrich the child home environment and reduce stress has larger returns for children with higher socio-emotional skills in early childhood (complementarity), but only for levels of inputs that are high. For low levels of inputs, i.e. levels implying a stressful home environment, an increase has a higher return for children with lower socio-emotional skills in early childhood (substitutability). Consequently, well targeted policies can reduce middle childhood socio-emotional gaps.
I10|Parental Beliefs, Investments, and Child Development: Evidence from a Large-Scale Experiment|This paper experimentally estimates medium term impacts of a large-scale and low-cost parenting program targeting poor families in Chile. Households in 162 public health centers were randomly assigned to three groups: a control group, a second group that was offered eight weekly group parenting sessions, and a third group that was offered the same eight group sessions plus two sessions of guided interactions between parents and children focused on responsive play and dialogic reading. In spite of its short duration and intensity, three years after the end of the intervention, the receptive vocabulary and the socio-emotional development of children of families participating in either of the treatment arms improved (by 0.43 and 0.54 standard deviation, respectively) relative to children of nonparticipating families. The treatments also led to improvements in home environments and parenting behaviors of comparable magnitudes, which far outlasted the short duration of the intervention.
I10|“Does longevity impact the severity of traffic accidents? A comparative study of young-older and old-older drivers”|This article seeks to demonstrate differences in the severity of traffic accidents among two subgroups of older drivers – young-older (65–75) and old-older (75+). Spain, in common with other countries, has recorded an increase in its number of older drivers due to an increase in this population cohort, an increase that is set to become significant over coming years. Moreover, older drivers are now living and driving for longer periods given increasing levels of life expectancy for the elderly. The greater frequency and longevity of older drivers suggests the need to introduce a possible segmentation within this group at risk, in line with practices for drivers below the age of 65 (thus eliminating the generic interval of 65 and over as applied today in road safety data and in the automobile insurance sector). Here, we draw on data for 2016 provided by the Dirección General de Tráfico de España (Spanish Traffic Authority) and apply generalized additive and generalized linear models to demonstrate that accident severity and the expected costs of accidents increase when the driver is over the age of 75. We identify the factors related to the accident, vehicle and driver that have a significant impact on the probability of the accident being slight, serious or fatal for different age groups. Our results have obvious implications for regulators responsible for road safety policies – most specifically as they consider the need to introduce an upper age limit for driving – and for the automobile insurance industry, which to date has not examined the impact that the longevity of drivers is likely to have on their balance sheets.
I10|The Effects of Mass Layoffs on Mental Health|This article assesses the effects of mass layoffs on the mental health of workers remaining in plants after layoffs, using a French survey merged with administrative health insurance data covering the period 2010–2013. We rely on the consumption of psychotropic drugs prescribed by doctors as an indicator of mental health. Results show that mass layoffs induce a sizeable rise in the use of psychotropic drugs amongst job stayers: we measure an increase of 41% in psychotropic drug consumption rates amongst them after displacement, as compared with the pre-displacement period. We find evidence for a social gradient whereby employees belonging to the lowest socio-economic are more affected by the adverse effect of mass layoffs on their mental health, leading to psychotropic drug consumption, than those in the highest socio­-economic groups.
I10|Évaluation d’impact d’une nouvelle organisation en chirurgie orthopédique sur les parcours de soins|La coordination des soins avant et après une hospitalisation est importante pour améliorer la qualité de prise en charge des patients et l'efficience du système de santé. Différents protocoles de soins centrés sur le patient ont été développés dans la littérature médicale. Ils sont de plus en plus promus et employés dans les établissements de santé. Dans cette étude, nous évaluons l'impact de la mise en place d'un protocole de Réhabilitation améliorée après chirurgie (Raac) en chirurgie orthopédique sur les parcours de soins dans les cliniques privées. Les données mobilisées proviennent du Programme de médicalisation des systèmes d'information en Médecine, chirurgie, obstétrique (PMSI-MCO) concernant les patients ayant séjourné en établissement de santé pour pose de prothèse de hanche ou du genou dans les cliniques privées. Nous analysons l'impact de la Raac sur les durées de séjour, les modes de sortie (Soins de suite et de réadaptation (SSR) ou domicile) et la probabilité de réadmission à 30 et 90 jours. A partir de régressions en doubles différences, nous comparons les résultats des patients opérés dans les établissements labellisés Raac par le Groupe francophone de réhabilitation améliorée après chirurgie (Grace) avec ceux des patients pris en charge dans des cliniques témoins comparables. On isole l'effet de la Raac en prenant en compte l'impact potentiel d'autres facteurs tels que l'âge, le sexe du patient, son indice de co-morbidité et l'offre de soins proche de la résidence du patient. Les patients opérés dans un service de chirurgie qui pratique la Raac ont, en moyenne, une durée de séjour plus courte que ceux qui sont opérés dans un service de chirurgie classique (-0,4 jour). Ces patients ont une probabilité plus élevée de retour à domicile (OR 1,15), sans avoir un plus grand risque de réadmission. La labellisation Raac semble aussi avoir un impact positif sur le volume d'activité des établissements par le biais de la concurrence en qualité : toutes choses égales par ailleurs, les hôpitaux labélisés Raac ont enregistré un taux de croissance supérieur par rapport aux cliniques témoins.
I10|DyMH_LU: a simple tool for modelling and simulating the health status of the Luxembourgish elderly in the longer run|We are facing one of the most important demographic events of the last decades in Europe: the population ageing process. This process will have significant economic effects particularly on health. As most diseases are age-related, this process might imply a proportionally higher share of individuals with declining health. Being able to forecast the health status of the population can help to deal with concerns about the financial and social sustainability of several public policies including health. In this paper, we present the DyMH_LU model, a dynamic microsimulation model focused exclusively on the health status of the Luxembourgish population. One of its major characteristics is that it simulates more than sixty different diseases and limitations in the activities of daily living. All this simulated information can be aggregated in order to compute, for each period, the overall health status of each individual, the marginal distribution of each disease among the total population and the global health status of the entire population. The starting point of the DyMH_LU model is the information collected in 2015 in the Wave 6 of the SHARE database that targets individuals aged 51 or older. The simulation period covers 2017 until 2045.
I10|Education-health relationship: New evidence from a distributional perspective|Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), this paper identifies the education gradient in health and explores its underlying factors using a distributional approach. We start by constructing a separate health distribution for two education subgroups - the lower and higher educated - and compare the difference in the level of health between them at each point of the distribution. As a next step, we perform a semi-parametric decomposition exercise to explore which factors lie behind the observed health differential. In line with previous studies we find that, on average, higher educated people enjoy better health than those who are lower educated. We show, however, that the difference is not constant along the health distribution, with the gap being several times bigger at the top of the distribution than at its bottom. We also find that around 65 percent of the health gap between the lower and higher educated can be explained by the subgroup differences in demographic, labor market, and behavioral characteristics.
I10|Delivering Parenting Interventions through Health Services in the Caribbean|Integrating early childhood interventions with health and nutrition services has been recommended, however there is limited information on interventions that are effective and feasible for delivery through health services. In this trial we developed and evaluated a parenting program that could be integrated into primary health center visits.
I10|Measuring the Quality of the Home Environment of Young Children in Uruguay: Socioeconomic Gradients in the Home Inventory|Uruguay is one of very few countries in Latin America that has a nationally representative, longitudinal survey of early childhood development. In 2015–2016, during the second wave of the survey, an observational module on the home environment was administered at scale for the first time. The module included items from two subscales (responsiveness and acceptance) of a widely used instrument that measures the quality of the physical and emotional environment: the HOME inventory. We find that the set of items administered from the HOME has very good concurrent validity with child development and maternal personality traits, as well as with other relevant socioeconomic variables. In line with the literature, our analysis shows that children from the most vulnerable families are exposed to a lower-quality home environment—that is, less responsive and more punitive. Interestingly, Uruguayan children are exposed to better environments as compared to children in predominantly rural samples from the Latin America and Caribbean region; however, they present comparable environments when compared to similar samples from countries such as Brazil and Chile.
I10|Mortality in Midlife for Subgroups in Germany|Case and Deaton (2015) document that, since 1998, midlife mortality rates are increasing for white non-Hispanics in the US. This trend is driven by deaths from drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related diseases, termed as deaths of despair, and by the subgroup of low-educated individuals. In contrast, average mortality for middle-aged men and women continued to decrease in several other high-income countries including Germany. However, average mortality rates can disguise important differences between subgroups and the phenomenon of increasing mortality rates might also be present for subpopulations in these countries. Hence, we analyze how mortality in midlife is changing for several important demographic subgroups in Germany over the 1990 to 2015 period with a focus on deaths of despair. Our results show a very clear pattern: We find that mortality rates declined between 1990 and 2015, with no increases in deaths of despair for any of the subgroups. Thus, our findings starkly contrast with those for the US
I10|The Impact of Bullying Victimisation on Mental Wellbeing|We investigate the impact of nine types of adolescent (verbal, physical, indirect) school/domestic bullying on life satisfaction, and two mental health outcomes (emotional symptoms and hyperactivity/inattention) using the Understanding Society dataset during 2009-13. Bullying significantly increases hyperactive, inattentive and emotional symptoms and reduces life satisfaction. Non-domestic bullying has a stronger adverse impact on all three mental wellbeing outcomes. Domestic sibling victimisation does not affect life satisfaction. Lower levels of family income increase adolescent hyperactive/inattentive symptoms and reduce life satisfaction. Females are more vulnerable to emotional symptoms while males report higher levels of life satisfaction. Initial conditions precondition hyperactive and inattentive symptoms.
I10|The Phenomenon of Summer Diarrhea and Its Waning, 1910-1930|During the first two decades of the 20th century, diarrheal deaths among American infants and children surged every summer. Although we still do not know what pathogen (or pathogens) caused this phenomenon, the consensus view is that it was eventually controlled through public health efforts at the municipal level. Using data from 26 major American cities for the period 1910-1930, we document the phenomenon of summer diarrhea and explore its dissipation. We find that water filtration is associated with a 15-17 percent reduction in diarrheal mortality among children under the age of two during the non-summer months, but does not seem to have had an effect on diarrheal mortality during the summer. In general, we find little evidence to suggest that public health interventions undertaken at the municipal level contributed to the dissipation of summer diarrhea. Our results are relevant for many parts of the developing world today, where climate change is expected to affect the length and intensity of seasons as well as the incidence of diarrheal diseases.
I10|Modelling the Dynamic Effects of Elective Hospital Admissions on Emergency Levels in England|In England as elsewhere, policy makers are trying to reduce the pressure on costs due to rising hospital admissions by encouraging GPs to refer fewer patients to hospital specialists. This could have an impact on elective treatment levels, particularly procedures for conditions which are not life-threatening and can be delayed or perhaps withheld entirely. This study attempts to determine whether cost savings in one area of publicly funded health care may lead to cost increases in another and therefore have unintended consequences by offsetting the cost-saving benefits anticipated by policy makers. Using administrative data from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) in England we estimate dynamic fixed effects panel data models for emergency admissions at Primary Care Trust and Hospital Trust levels for the years 2004–13, controlling for a group of area-specific characteristics and other secondary care variables. We find a negative link between current levels of elective care and future levels of emergency treatment. This observation comes from a time of growing admissions and there is no guarantee that the link between emergency and elective activity will persist if policy is effective in reducing levels of elective treatment, but our results suggest that the cost-saving benefits to the NHS from reducing elective treatment are reduced by between 5.6 per cent and 15.5 per cent in aggregate as a consequence of increased emergency activity.
I10|Early Health, Risk Aversion and Stock Market Participation|To examine the relationship between early health status and financial decisions in adulthood, we link information on birth weight in 1966 from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort to data from the Finnish Central Securities Depository over the period of 1995-2010. We find that persons predisposed to poor health status in early childhood (indicated by low birth weight) avoid participating in the stock market in adulthood. The link between birth weight and stock market participation is partially explained by the fact that poor early health status leads to risk aversion. Early health status is not significantly related to the portfolio's value-growth tilt.
I10|The Impact of Car Pollution on Infant and Child Health: Evidence from Emissions Cheating|Car exhaust is a major source of air pollution, but little is known about its impacts on population health. We exploit the dispersion of emissions-cheating diesel cars-which secretly polluted up to 150 times as much as gasoline cars-across the United States from 2008-2015 as a natural experiment to measure the health impact of car pollution. Using the universe of vehicle registrations, we demonstrate that a 10 percent cheating-induced increase in car exhaust increases rates of low birth weight and acute asthma attacks among children by 1.9 and 8.0 percent, respectively. These health impacts occur at all pollution levels and across the entire socioeconomic spectrum.
I10|Child Socio-Emotional Skills: The Role of Parental Inputs|Informed by the psychological literature and our empirical evidence we provide new insights into the technology of socio-emotional skill formation in middle childhood. In line with economic evidence, increasing parental inputs that enrich the child home environment and reduce stress has larger returns for children with higher socio-emotional skills in early childhood (complementarity), but only for levels of inputs that are high. For low levels of inputs, i.e. levels implying a stressful home environment, an increase has a higher return for children with lower socio-emotional skills in early childhood (substitutability). Consequently, well targeted policies can reduce middle childhood socio-emotional gaps.
I10|Pre- and Post-Birth Components of Intergenerational Persistence in Health and Longevity: Lessons from a Large Sample of Adoptees|We use data on a large sample of Swedish-born adoptees and their biological and adopting parents to decompose the persistence in health inequality across generations into pre-birth and post-birth components. We use three sets of measures for health outcomes in the second generation: mortality, measures based on data on hospitalization and, finally, measures using birth outcomes for the third generation. The results show that all of the persistence in mortality is transmitted solely via pre-birth factors, while the results for the hospitalization measures suggest that at least three quarters of the intergenerational persistence in health is attributable to the biological parents.
I10|Mental Health, Schooling Attainment and Polygenic Scores: Are There Significant Gene-Environment Associations?|It is well-established that (1) there is a large genetic component to mental health, and (2) higher schooling attainment is associated with better mental health. Given these two observations, we test the hypothesis that schooling may attenuate the genetic predisposition to poor mental health. Specifically, we estimate associations between a polygenic score (PGS) for depressive symptoms, schooling attainment and gene-environment (GxE) interactions with mental health (depressive symptoms and depression), in two distinct United States datasets at different adult ages- 29 years old in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) and 54 years old in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS). OLS results indicate that the association of the PGS with mental health is similar in Add Health and the WLS, but the association of schooling attainment is much larger in Add Health than in the WLS. There is some suggestive evidence that the association of the PGS with mental health is lower for more-schooled older individuals in the WLS, but there is no evidence of any significant GxE associations in Add Health. Quantile regression estimates also show that in the WLS the GxE associations are statistically significant only in the upper parts of the conditional depressive symptoms score distribution. We assess the robustness of the OLS results to omitted variable bias by using the siblings samples in both datasets to estimate sibling fixed-effect regressions. The sibling fixed-effect results must be qualified, in part due to low statistical power. However, the sibling fixed-effect estimates show that college education is associated with fewer depressive symptoms in both datasets.
I10|The Effects of Stepwise Minimum Legal Drinking Age Legislation on Mortality: Evidence from Germany|"This study investigates the short-term mortality effects of two age-based restrictions on legal access to alcohol in Germany. We exploit sharp differences in legal access to alcohol at 16 and 18 years by implementing a regression discontinuity design. We find discontinuous increases in deaths at both age cutoffs, which are mainly driven by a ""novice driver effect"", whereas legal access to alcohol plays a marginal role at most. Overall, our results indicate that a stepwise introduction to alcohol has, at most, a minor impact on drunk driving and mortality at age 16 and 18 years. This study thus provides fresh impetus to the ongoing debate on the ""optimal"" MLDA legislation."
I10|Publication Bias and Editorial Statement on Negative Findings|"In February 2015, the editors of eight health economics journals sent out an editorial statement which aims to reduce the extent of specification searching and reminds referees to accept studies that: ""have potential scientific and publication merit regardless of whether such studies' empirical findings do or do not reject null hypotheses"". Guided by a pre-analysis, we test whether the editorial statement decreased the extent of publication bias. Our differences-in-differences estimates suggest that the statement decreased the proportion of tests rejecting the null hypothesis by 18 percentage points. Our findings suggest that incentives may be aligned to promote more transparent research."
I10|Parental Beliefs, Investments, and Child Development: Evidence from a Large-Scale Experiment|This paper experimentally estimates medium term impacts of a large-scale and low-cost parenting program targeting poor families in Chile. Households in 162 public health centers were randomly assigned to three groups: a control group, a second group that was offered eight weekly group parenting sessions, and a third group that was offered the same eight group sessions plus two sessions of guided interactions between parents and children focused on responsive play and dialogic reading. In spite of its short duration and intensity, three years after the end of the intervention, the receptive vocabulary and the socio-emotional development of children of families participating in either of the treatment arms improved (by 0.43 and 0.54 standard deviation, respectively) relative to children of nonparticipating families. The treatments also led to improvements in home environments and parenting behaviors of comparable magnitudes, which far outlasted the short duration of the intervention.
I10|Does Unemployment Worsen Babies' Health? A Tale of Siblings, Maternal Behaviour and Selection|We study the effect of unemployment on birth outcomes by exploiting geographical variation in the unemployment rate across local areas in England, and comparing siblings born to the same mother via family fixed effects. Using rich individual data from hospital administrative records between 2003 and 2012, babies' health is found to be strongly pro-cyclical. A one-percentage point increase in the unemployment rate leads to an increase in low birth weight and preterm babies of respectively 1.3 and 1.4%, and a 0.1% decrease in foetal growth. We find heterogenous responses: unemployment has an effect on babies' health which varies from strongly adverse in the most deprived areas, to mildly favourable in the most prosperous areas. We provide evidence of three channels that can explain the overall negative effect of unemployment on new-born health: maternal stress; unhealthy behaviours - namely excessive alcohol consumption and smoking; and delays in the take-up of prenatal services. While the heterogenous effects of unemployment by area of deprivation seem to be explained by maternal behaviour. Most importantly, we also show for the first time that selection into fertility is the main driver for the previously observed, opposite counter-cyclical results, e.g., Dehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004). Our results are robust to internal migration, different geographical aggregation of the unemployment rate, the use of gender-specific unemployment rates, and potential endogeneity of the unemployment rate which we control for by using a shift-share instrumental variable approach.
I10|Violent Conflict Exposure in Nigeria and Economic Welfare|Several papers have attempted to estimate and document the impact of conflict on several education, health and socioeconomic outcomes. One lesson from the past research is the heterogeneity in the effect of violent conflict across and within countries. In this paper we attempt to estimate the casual impact of conflict in Nigeria on welfare related outcomes. The 2009 insurgence of Boko Haram and the Fulani herdsmen versus farmers conflicts have led to a significant increase in violent conflict in the North Eastern and Central parts of Nigeria. However, bouts of violent conflict have existed in different communities across the country since independence. We estimate the average effect of violent conflict exposure on welfare, across Nigeria using the three waves of the Nigerian General Household Survey (GHS) panel combined with The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED). Employing a fixed effect approach, our results suggest that recent and long term exposure to conflict increased the incidence, intensity and severity of poverty in Nigeria. In addition we find that exposure to violent conflict also decreased household income.
I10|Temperature and Mental Health: Evidence from the Spectrum of Mental Health Outcomes|This paper characterizes the link between ambient temperatures and a broad set of mental health outcomes. We find that higher temperatures increase emergency department visits for mental illness, suicides, and self-reported days of poor mental health. Specifically, cold temperatures reduce negative mental health outcomes while hot temperatures increase them. Our estimates reveal no evidence of adaptation, instead the temperature relationship is stable across time, baseline climate, air conditioning penetration rates, accessibility of mental health services, and other factors. The character of the results suggests that temperature affects mental health very differently than physical health, and more similarly to other psychological and behavioral outcomes. We provide suggestive evidence for sleep disruption as an active mechanism behind our results and discuss the implications of our findings for the allocation of mental health services and in light of climate change.
I10|Residential Noise Exposure and Health: Evidence from Aviation Noise and Birth Outcomes|Exploiting recent concentration of flight patterns under a new Federal Aviation Administration policy (called NextGen), we examine the impact of exposure to excessive noise levels on birth outcomes. Using birth records that include mothers’ home addresses to measure airport proximity, we find the risk of low birth weight babies increases by 17 percent among mothers living near the airport in the direction of the runway. We utilize exogenous variation in noise exposure triggered by NextGen, which unintentionally increased noise in communities affected by the new flight patterns. Our finding informs policy-makers regarding the trade-off between flight optimization and human health.
I10|Taxes, traffic jam and spillover in the metropolis|This paper studies local governments' public policies in a metropolitan area plagued by traffic congestion, where both residents and workers consume local public goods. We develop a new spatial sub-metropolitan tax competition model which features a central city surrounded by suburban towns linked by mobile capital and mobile residents who commute to work. We show that Pareto-efficiency is achieved if towns can retain their workers using labor subsidies. Otherwise, traffic congestion in the city is inefficiently high and local governments respond by setting inefficient public policies: (1) the city over-taxes capital and under-taxes residents, which leads to too little capital and too many residents in the city; (2) local public goods are under-provided in the city and over-provided in the towns.
I10|Einsamkeit in Deutschland: Aktuelle Entwicklung und soziodemographische Zusammenhänge|In Deutschland fühlt sich etwa jede zehnte Person oft oder sehr oft einsam. Der Großteil von 60 Prozent hat dieses Gefühl nur selten oder nie. Das zeigen Auswertungen aktueller Daten des Sozio-ökonomischen Panels (SOEP) aus dem Jahr 2017. Entgegen der häufigen Annahme, dass die Einsamkeit in Deutschland zunimmt, zeigt der Ver-gleich von Daten aus den Jahren 2013 und 2017 einen leichten allgemeinen ückgang. Während sich im Jahr 2013 noch 10,5 Prozent aller Personen einsam gefühlt haben, sind es im Jahr 2017 noch 9,5 Prozent. Ein direkter personenbezogener Vergleich zeigt, dass in diesem Zeitraum etwa ein Viertel der Befragten einsamer geworden ist, fast ein Drittel ist im Jahr 2017 weniger einsam als vier Jahre zuvor. Einsamkeit tritt zwar häufiger bei älteren Personen auf, jedoch weist auch die mittlere Altersklasse der 30- bis 39-jährigen relativ hohe Werte auf. Am stärksten hat die Einsamkeit in diesem Zeitraum in den jüngeren Altersgruppen zugenommen. Die Daten weisen nicht auf eine deutliche Steigerung der Einsamkeit hin. Die gestiegene Auf-merksamkeit für das Thema und die Forderung nach Maßnahmen zur Verringerung und Präven-tion der Einsamkeit sind angesichts der starken negativen individuellen sowie gesamtwirtschaft-lichen Konsequenzen von Einsamkeit jedoch wichtig. Einige Zusammenhänge mit dem sozialen Umfeld sowie mit soziodemografischen Kriterien bieten Ansatzpunkte für die Ableitung von Maßnahmen. Dieser Report zeigt einige dieser Zusammenhänge auf: Eine häufigere Teilnahme an Freizeitaktivitäten ist mit geringerer Einsamkeit verbunden. Ein guter Gesundheitszustand sowie Erwerbstätigkeit sind tendenziell seltener mit Einsamkeit verbunden. Personen mit einem direkten Migrationshintergrund sind hingegen häufiger von dem Problem betroffen. Maßnahmen, die die identifizierten Faktoren Gesundheit, Erwerbstätigkeit sowie Verfügbarkeit und Erreichbarkeit von Freizeitaktivitäten betreffen, können daher indirekt positiv auf die Ein-samkeit wirken. Da Einsamkeit aber ein Problem mit vielschichten Ursachen und Zusammen-hängen ist, bedarf es für Deutschland weiterer Forschung. Dieser Report gibt daher einen Über-blick über den Stand und die Entwicklung und weist auf zukünftige Forschungsfelder hin.
I10|Survival of the weakest? Culling evidence from the 1918 flu pandemic|When a negative shock aﬀects a cohort in utero, two things may happen: ﬁrst, the population suffers detrimental consequences in later life; and second, some will die as a consequence of the shock, either in utero or early in life. The latter effect, often referred to as culling, may induce a bias in estimates of later life outcomes. When the health shock disproportionately affects a positively selected subpopulation, the long-term effects are overestimated. The 1918 ﬂu pandemic was plausibly more harmful to mothers of high socioeconomic status, as a suppressed immune system in mothers of low socioeconomic status may have been protective against the most severe consequences of infection. Using historical birth records from the city of Bern, Switzerland, we assess this concern empirically and document that a careful consideration of culling is paramount for the evaluation of the 1918 ﬂu pandemic and other fetal health shocks.
I10|MaÃ®triser les dÃ©penses de santÃ© face au changement dÃ©mographique : Une analyse de lâ€™Ã©volution des coÃ»ts Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital au QuÃ©bec|Ã€ partir de donnÃ©es mÃ©dico-administratives longitudinales sur les sÃ©jours Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital et les coÃ»ts au QuÃ©bec pour la pÃ©riode 1995-2012, une dÃ©composition de la variation des coÃ»ts de santÃ© Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital est effectuÃ©e afin dâ€™en analyser les principaux dÃ©terminants. Entre 1995 et 2012, la part des sÃ©jours hospitaliers a reprÃ©sentÃ© 86% de la hausse des coÃ»ts Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital, contre seulement 14% pour les services mÃ©dicaux Ã lâ€™acte. De 2008 Ã 2012, cette rÃ©partition a Ã©tÃ© respectivement de 41% et 59%. Sur la pÃ©riode la plus rÃ©cente observÃ©e, comme on aurait pu sâ€™y attendre du fait de la hausse des rÃ©munÃ©rations des mÃ©decins spÃ©cialistes, câ€™est donc la forte hausse des coÃ»ts des services mÃ©dicaux qui a le plus contribuÃ© Ã la hausse des coÃ»ts Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital. NÃ©anmoins, lâ€™augmentation des volumes dâ€™actes a davantage contribuÃ© Ã la hausse globale des coÃ»ts que la hausse des prix des actes. Il est de plus difficile dâ€™Ã©tablir un changement de comportement chez les mÃ©decins suite aux bonifications rÃ©centes des prix des actes, dans la mesure oÃ¹ la variation des volumes dâ€™actes apparaÃ®t assez dÃ©connectÃ©e de la variation des prix des actes. On montre enfin que lâ€™effet de vieillissement ne prÃ©domine pas tous les autres et semble avoir une relativement faible influence sur lâ€™Ã©volution des coÃ»ts de santÃ© Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital. Câ€™est donc davantage une combinaison des changements dans la prÃ©valence des maladies et des changements de pratiques qui ont eu pour effet dâ€™entraÃ®ner la hausse globale des coÃ»ts.
I10|The Impact of BMI on Mental Health: Further Evidence from Genetic Markers|We examine the relationship between BMI and mental health for young adults and elderly individuals using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and the Health & Retirement Study. While OLS estimates show that BMI is significantly associated with worse mental health in both young adulthood and old age, they are likely to be confounded by (i) unobserved factors that affect both BMI and mental health and (ii) reverse causality. To tackle confounding, we take two complementary approaches. First, we use a polygenic score for BMI as an IV and adjust for polygenic scores for other factors that may invalidate this IV. The IV estimates indicate that there is no statistically significant relationship between BMI and mental health for young adults, whereas there is a positive and statistically significant relationship for the elderly. Moreover, we show that IV estimates likely have to be interpreted as identifying a weighted average of effects of BMI on mental health mostly for individuals on the upper quantiles of the BMI distribution. Given potential remaining concerns about the validity of the IV, our second approach is to consider it an “imperfect” IV and estimate an upper bound on the average treatment effect for the corresponding population following Nevo & Rosen (2012). The estimated upper bounds reinforce the conclusions from the IV estimates: they show little evidence of a detrimental effect of BMI on mental health for young adults while being consistent with an economically meaningful effect for elderly individuals. Lastly, we explore some of the potential channels through which BMI may affect mental health for the elderly.
I10|Technological Progress and Health Convergence: The Case of Penicillin in Post-War Italy|"Throughout history, technological progress has transformed population health, but the distributional effects of these gains are unclear. New substitutes for older, more expensive health technologies can produce convergence in population health outcomes, but may also be prone to ""elite capture"" leading to divergence. This paper studies the case of penicillin using detailed mortality statistics and exploiting its sharply-timed introduction in Italy after World War II. We find penicillin reduced both the mean and standard deviation of infectious diseases mortality, leading to substantial convergence across disparate regions of Italy. Our results do not appear to be confounded by competing risks or mortality patterns associated with World War II."
I10|When Labor's Lost: Health, Family Life, Incarceration, and Education in a Time of Declining Economic Opportunity for Low-Skilled Men|The economic progress of US men has stagnated in recent decades. The labor force participation rate of men ages 25-54 peaked in the mid-1960s and has declined since then (according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics), while men's real median earnings have been flat since the early 1970s. These population averages mask considerably larger declines in participation among less-educated and non-white men as well as substantial increases in wage inequality. In this paper, we seek to illuminate the broader context in which prime-age men are experiencing economic stagnation. We explore changes for prime-age men over time in education, mortality, morbidity, disability program receipt, family structure, and incarceration rates. We focus on prime-age men, namely those ages 25-54, and on the years 1980-2016 (or 2017 when possible), encompassing much of the period of reduced economic progress for low-skilled men.
I10|Socialized Healthcare and Women's Fertility Decisions|This paper examines the effect of a nationwide healthcare reform implemented in Turkey on women's fertility decisions. The Family Medicine Program (FMP), introduced in 2005, provided a wide-range of primary healthcare services, free of charge, and achieved universal access by matching each citizen to a specific family physician, who operates at neighborhood clinics, called Family Health Centers, on a walk-in basis. Although reducing fertility was not specified among the goals of the reform, reproductive-health and family-planning services have been covered under the FMP. To establish causality, we exploit the staggered rollout of the FMP implementation across Turkish provinces over time using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy. Our estimates indicate that the FMP significantly reduced childbearing among both teenagers and women ages 20-29. These results can be explained by increased access to and reduced cost of reproductive-health and family-planning services. However, the patterns in which the program effect has evolved over time differs between the two groups of women in a way that provides additional insights about the mechanisms. For teenagers, the FMP had a direct effect on childbearing, reflected by an immediate and rapidly-increasing pattern, which is not surprising given the broad agreement about the negative consequences of teenage childbearing among government and public health officials, including those in Turkey. For women ages 20-29, however, the program had a gradual and slowly-increasing effect, which is consistent with an empowerment channel. This should be interpreted as an unintended consequence of the program because, if anything, Turkey is a country where the government's position is to encourage fertility behavior and discourage birth control practices among women at prime childbearing ages.
I10|An Empirical Framework for Sequential Assignment: The Allocation of Deceased Donor Kidneys|An organ transplant can improve a patient’s life while also realizing substantial savings in healthcare expenditures. Like many other scarce public resources, organs from deceased donors are rationed to patients on a waitlist via a sequential offer mechanism. The theoretical trade-offs in designing these rationing systems are not well understood and depend on agent preferences. This paper establishes an empirical framework for analyzing waitlist systems and applies it to study the allocation of deceased donor kidneys. We model the decision to accept an organ or wait for a more preferable organ as an optimal stopping problem, and develop techniques to compute equilibria of counterfactual mechanisms. Our estimates show that while some types of kidneys are desirable for all patients, there is substantial match-specific heterogeneity in values. We then evaluate alternative mechanisms by comparing their effect on patient welfare to an equivalent change in donor supply. Past reforms to the kidney waitlist primarily resulted in redistribution, with similar welfare and organ discard rates as the benchmark first come first served mechanism. These mechanisms and other commonly studied theoretical benchmarks remain far from optimal: we design a mechanism that increases patient welfare by the equivalent of a 14.2 percent increase in donor supply.
I10|The Phenomenon of Summer Diarrhea and its Waning, 1910-1930|During the first two decades of the 20th century, diarrheal deaths among American infants and children surged every summer. Although we still do not know what pathogen (or pathogens) caused this phenomenon, the consensus view is that it was eventually controlled through public health efforts at the municipal level. Using data from 26 major American cities for the period 1910-1930, we document the phenomenon of summer diarrhea and explore its dissipation. We find that water filtration is associated with a 15-17 percent reduction in diarrheal mortality among children under the age of two during the non-summer months, but does not seem to have had an effect on diarrheal mortality during the summer. In general, we find little evidence to suggest that public health interventions undertaken at the municipal level contributed to the dissipation of summer diarrhea. Our results are relevant for many parts of the developing world today, where climate change is expected to affect the length and intensity of seasons as well as the incidence of diarrheal diseases.
I10|The Role of Neonatal Health in the Incidence of Childhood Disability|We use linked birth and education records for all children born in Florida between 1992 and 2002 to assess the effects of neonatal health on the identification of childhood disabilities. We find that several measures of neonatal health are associated with disability incidence, although birthweight plays the most empirically relevant role. Using large samples of siblings and twins, we find that infant health influences multiple measures of disability and grade repetition in school. The association between birthweight and disability holds throughout the distribution of birthweight and across a range of socioeconomic characteristics, including maternal education and race.
I10|Do Stricter Immunization Laws Improve Coverage? Evidence from the Repeal of Non-medical Exemptions for School Mandated Vaccines|Nonmedical exemptions are widely shown to be associated with outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease. In response to a recent measles outbreak in 2015, California acted to increase immunization coverage by removing all nonmedical exemptions effective in 2016. Employing a unique dataset of county-level vaccination and exemption rates at Kindergarten entry, we exploit the recent policy change in California to estimate the impact of the repeal of nonmedical exemptions on immunization coverage for school-mandated vaccines. Relative to a diverse group of control states, our findings indicate that vaccination coverage increased for all required vaccines following the repeal, ranging from 2.5% for MMR to 5% for Polio. We also find a significant 3.4 percentage-point decline in nonmedical exemptions, accompanied by a 2.1 percentage-point increase in medical exemptions in counties that previously had high rates of nonmedical waivers. Our findings indicate that the repeal of nonmedical exemptions in California was only partially effective in improving vaccination coverage, and may have led parents to substitute between medical and nonmedical exemptions, leading to a net decline in total exemptions of just 1 percentage-point.
I10|Distributional Effects of Education on Health|This paper studies distributional effects of education on health. In 1972, England, Scotland, and Wales raised their minimum school-leaving age from 15 to 16 for students born after 9/1/1957. Using a regression discontinuity design and objective health measures for 0.27 million individuals, we find that education reduced body size and increased blood pressure in middle age. The reduction in body size was concentrated at the upper tail of the distribution with a 7.5 percentage point reduction in obesity. The increase in blood pressure was concentrated at the lower tail of the distribution with no effect on stage 2 hypertension.
I10|Are Quality-Adjusted Medical Prices Declining for Chronic Disease? Evidence from Diabetes Care in Four Health Systems|Improvements in medical treatment have contributed to rising health spending. Yet there is relatively little evidence on whether the spending increase is “worth it” in the sense of producing better health outcomes of commensurate value—a critical question for understanding productivity in the health sector and, as that sector grows, for deriving an accurate quality-adjusted price index for an entire economy. We analyze individual-level panel data on medical spending and health outcomes for 123,548 patients with type 2 diabetes in four health systems. Using a “cost-of-living” method that measures value based on improved survival, we find a positive net value of diabetes care: the value of improved survival outweighs the added costs of care in each of the four health systems. This finding is robust to accounting for selective survival, end-of-life spending, and a range of values for a life-year or, equivalently, to attributing only a fraction of survival improvements to medical care.
I10|The Impact of Medicaid on Medical Utilization in a Vulnerable Population: Evidence from COFA Migrants|In March 2015, the State of Hawaii stopped covering the vast majority of migrants from countries belonging to the Compact of Free Association (COFA) in the state Medicaid program. COFA migrants were instead required to obtain private insurance in the exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act. Using statewide administrative hospital discharge data, we show that Medicaid-funded hospitalizations and emergency room visits declined in this population by 69% and 42% after the expiration of Medicaid eligibility. This decrease occurred despite the fact that low-income COFA households were eligible for state-funded premium coverage for private insurance. Utilization funded by private insurance did increase, but not enough to offset the declines in Medicaid-funded utilization. Uninsured ER visits increased as a consequence of the expiration of Medicaid benefits. Paradoxically, we also find a substantial increase in Medicaid-funded ER visits by infants after the expiration of benefits.
I10|Are Syringe Exchange Programs Helpful or Harmful? New Evidence in the Wake of the Opioid Epidemic|In light of the recent opioid crisis, many public health entities have called for an expansion in syringe exchange programs (SEPs), which provide access to sterile syringes and facilitate safe needle disposal for injection drug users. This paper investigates the effects of recent SEP openings on HIV diagnoses and drug-related overdoses in the wake of the opioid crisis. I find that SEP openings decrease HIV diagnoses by up to 18.2 percent. However, I present new evidence that SEPs increase rates of opioid-related mortality and hospitalizations, suggesting that needle exchanges alone may be less effective than other interventions at stimulating recovery.
I10|Preschool Quality and Child Development|Global access to preschool has increased dramatically yet preschool quality is often poor. We use a randomized controlled trial to evaluate two approaches to improving the quality of Colombian preschools. We find that the first, which was rolled out nationwide and provides additional resources for materials and new staff, did not benefit children’s development and, unintentionally, led teachers to reduce their involvement in classroom activities. The second approach additionally trains teachers to improve their pedagogical methods. We find this addition offset the negative effects on teacher behavior, improved the quality of teaching and raised children’s cognition, language and school readiness.
I10|The Impact of the ACA Medicaid Expansion on Disability Program Applications|The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded the availability of public health insurance, decreasing the relative benefit of participating in disability programs but also lowering the cost of exiting the labor market to apply for disability program benefits. In this paper, we explore the impact of expanded access to Medicaid through the ACA on applications to the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) programs. Using the fact that the Supreme Court decision of June 2012 made the Medicaid expansion optional for the states, we compare changes in county-level SSI and SSDI caseloads in contiguous county pairs across a state border. We find no significant effects of the Medicaid expansion on applications or awards to either SSI or SSDI, and can reject economically meaningful impacts of Medicaid expansions on applications to disability programs.
I10|Four Facts Concerning Competition in U.S. Generic Prescription Drug Markets|We establish four facts concerning competition among U.S. generic drug suppliers, using IQVIA’s National Sales Perspective™ 2004Q4 – 2016Q3 data. We define a unique product market (“molform”), consisting of the combination of a molecule active ingredient and a route of administration formulation, aggregated over different dosages and strengths. We find: (i) supply exhibits substantial churning in entrants and exits; (ii) volume-weighted use concentrates in older generic molform cohorts; (iii) the extent of competition is greatest for the oldest molform cohorts and is smallest for the youngest molform cohorts. With a median of one competitor, the extent of competition in the youngest molform cohort is very limited; and (iv) supplier-molform annual revenues are typically small, are largest for relatively young drugs, but are heavily right skewed. These four facts provide an empirical platform on which to construct and empirically evaluate hypotheses regarding generic drug market structure, performance, and possible policy reforms.
I10|Health systems characteristics: A survey of 21 Latin American and Caribbean countries|In 2018, the Inter-American Development Bank and the OECD launched a survey to collect information on key health systems characteristics in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries. This paper presents the information provided by 21 of these countries. It describes country-specific arrangements to organise the population coverage against health risks and the financing of health spending. It depicts the organisation of health care delivery, focusing on the public/private mix of health care provision, provider payment schemes, user choice and competition among providers, as well as the regulation of health care supply and prices. Finally, this document provides information on governance and resource allocation in health systems (decentralisation in decision-making, nature of budget constraints and priority setting).
I10|Accounting for Timing when Assessing Health-Related Policies|The primary focus of this paper is to offer guidance on the analysis of time streams of effects that a project may have so that they can be discounted appropriately. This requires a framework that identifies the common parameters that need to be assessed, whether conducting cost-effectiveness or benefit-cost analysis. The quantification and conversion of the time streams of different effects into their equivalent health, health care cost or consumption effects avoids embedding multiple arguments in discounting policies. This helps to identify where parameters are likely to differ in particular contexts, what type of evidence would be relevant, what is currently known and how this evidence might be strengthened. The current evidence available to support the assessment of the key parameters is discussed and possible estimates and default assumptions are suggested. Reporting the results in an extensive way is recommended. This makes the assessments required explicit so the impact of alternative assumptions can be explored and analysis updated as better estimates evolve. Some projects will have effects across different countries where some or all of these parameters will differ. Therefore, the net present value of a project will be the sum of the country specific net present values rather than the sum of effects across countries discounted at some common rate.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
I10|Multi-criteria decision analysis for health technology assessment: addressing methodological challenges to improve the state of the art|Abstract Background Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) concepts, models and tools have been used increasingly in health technology assessment (HTA), with several studies pointing out practical and theoretical issues related to its use. This study provides a critical review of published studies on MCDA in the context of HTA by assessing their methodological quality and summarising methodological challenges. Methods A systematic review was conducted to identify studies discussing, developing or reviewing the use of MCDA in HTA using aggregation approaches. Studies were classified according to publication time and type, country of study, technology type and study type. The PROACTIVE-S approach was constructed and used to analyse methodological quality. Challenges and limitations reported in eligible studies were collected and summarised; this was followed by a critical discussion on research requirements to address the identified challenges. Results 129 journal articles were eligible for review, 56% of which were published in 2015–2017; 42% focused on pharmaceuticals; 36, 26 and 18% reported model applications, issues regarding MCDA implementation analyses, and proposing frameworks, respectively. Poor compliance with good methodological practice (
I10|Inequality and the Economic Participation of Women in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Empirical Investigation|This study investigates the effect of inequality on female employment in 42 countries in sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2004-2014. Three inequality indicators are used, namely, the: Gini coefficient, Atkinson index and Palma ratio. Two indicators of gender inclusion are also employed, namely: female employment and female unemployment rates. The empirical analysis is based on the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM).The following main findings are established. First, inequality increases female unemployment in regressions based on the Palma ratio. Second, from the robustness checks, inequality reduces female employment within the frameworks of the Gini coefficient and Palma ratio.
I10|How Enhancing Gender Inclusion Affects Inequality: Thresholds of Complementary Policies for Sustainable Development|This study investigates how enhancing gender inclusion affects inequality in 42 African countries for the period 2004-2014. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalized Method of Moments. Three inequality indicators are used, namely, the: Gini coefficient, Atkinson index, and Palma ratio. The two gender inclusion measurements used include female labour force participation and female employment. The following main findings are established. There are positive net effects on inequality from the enhancement of gender inclusion dynamics. An extended threshold analysis is used to assess critical masses at which further increasing gender inclusion enhances inequality. The established thresholds are: (i) 55.555 “employment to population ratio, 15+, female (%)”for the nexus with the Gini coefficient. (ii) 50 “labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+)” and between 50 to 55 “employment to population ratio, 15+, female (%)”, for the Atkinson index. (iii) 61.87 “labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+)” for the Palma ratio.These established thresholds are worthwhile for sustainable development because, beyond the critical masses, policy makers should complement the gender inclusion policy with other measures designed to reduce income inequality. Some complementary measures that can be taken on board beyond the established thresholds could focus on enhancing, inter alia: information and communication technology, infrastructural development; financial inclusion and inclusive education.
I10|The Evolution of Health over the Life Cycle|Recent studies have identified health dynamics and health shocks as major sources of risk over the life cycle. Health has implications for many economic variables includ- ing asset accumulation, labor supply, and income and wealth inequality. Despite the importance of health in economic studies, there is no unified objective measure of health status. In this paper we propose such a measure: frailty, defined as the cumulative sum of all adverse health indicators observed for an individual. There is overwhelming evidence in the gerontology literature that this simple measure is a strong predictor of mortality and other health outcomes. We construct a frailty index for individuals in the PSID, HRS and MEPS separately and make the following three observations. One, our constructed frailty index is remarkably consistent across the three datasets in terms of persistence, and dynamics of its distribution. This is in contrast to the most commonly used measure of health, self-reported health status. Two, individuals’ health decays at a substantially faster pace over the lifecycle when measured by frailty as opposed to self-reported health status. Three, health status is more persistent when measured by frailty as opposed to self reported health status. We estimate a dynamic process for frailty over the life cycle and show that an important driver of increasing inequality in health with age is dispersion in growth rates of frailty across individuals. Our frailty measure and dynamic process can be used by economists to study the evolution of health status over the life cycle and its implications.
I10|Opioids and the Labor Market|This paper finds evidence that opioid availability decreases labor force participation while a large labor market shock does not influence the share of opioid abusers. We first identify the effect of availability on participation using the geographic variation in opioid prescription rates. We use a combination of the American Community Survey (ACS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) county-level prescription data to examine labor market patterns across both rural and metropolitan areas of the United States from 2007 to 2016. Individuals in areas with higher prescription rates are less likely to participate after accounting for standard demographic factors and regional controls. This relationship remains significant for important demographic groups when increasingly strong panel data controls, including a full set of geographic fixed effects and measures of local labor market conditions in 2000, are introduced to the regressions. We also investigate the possibility of reverse causality, using the Great Recession as an instrument to identify the effect of weak labor demand on opioid abuse. The share abusing opioids did not increase after the onset of the Great Recession. The evidence on the frequency of abuse is more ambiguous since the identified increases could be the continuation of a pre-trend.
I10|Challenges Faced by Malaysian Parents in Caregiving of a Child with Disabilities|Objective - Caregiving of a child with special needs can increase the cost of raising the child and parent's stress. These two issues are commonly experienced by a parent who care for their special needs child themselves and the thought of challenges are different based on the disability of the child. Methodology/Technique - The challenges of raising a child with disability make it necessary for parents to work harder to to meet the cost of treatment. Meanwhile, levels of stress among those parents are understandably increased. Finding - Parents caring for a child with disability need to place greater emphasis on achieving a balance between their work, caring for their child and stress. Further, this paper includes a discussion on the cost of raising a disabled child and the increased levels of stress experienced by these parents. Novelty - The findings of this paper contribute to conceptual model on the challenges faced by Malaysian parents in caregiving for a child with special needs.
I10|The Impact of Public Health Insurance on Medical Utilization in a Vulnerable Population: Evidence from COFA Migrants|In March of 2015, the State of Hawaii stopped covering migrants from countries belonging to the Compact of Free Association (COFA) in the state Medicaid program, forcing COFA migrants to obtain private insurance in health insurance exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act. Using statewide administrative hospital discharge data, we show that Medicaid-funded hospitalizations and emergency room visits declined in this population by 69% and 42% after the expiration of Medicaid eligibility. Utilization funded by private insurance did increase but not enough to offset the declines in publicly-funded utilization. This resulted in a net decrease in utilization. Paradoxically, we also find a substantial increase in Medicaid-funded ER visits by infants after the expiration of benefits which is consistent with a substitution of ER visits for ambulatory care for the very young.
I10|The Role of Electricity Prices in Structural Transformation: Evidence from the Philippines|The Philippines provides an extreme example of Rodrikâ€™s observation that late developing countries experience deindustrialization at lower levels of per capita income than more advanced economies. Previous studies point to the role of protectionist policies, financial crises, and currency overvaluation as explanations for the shrinking share of the industry sector. We complement this literature by examining the role of electricity prices in the trajectory of industry share. We make use of data at the country level for 33 countries over the period 1980-2014 and at the Philippine regional level for 16 regions over the period 1990-2014. We find that higher electricity prices tend to amplify deindustrialization, causing industry share to turn downward at a lower peak and a lower per capita income, and to decline more steeply than otherwise. In a two-country comparison, we find that power-intensive manufacturing subsectors have expanded more rapidly in Indonesia, where electricity prices have been low, whereas Philippine manufacturing has shifted toward less power intensive and more labor-intensive subsectors in the face of high electricity prices.
I10|The Impact of Public Health Insurance on Medical Utilization in a Vulnerable Population: Evidence from COFA Migrants|In March of 2015, the State of Hawaii stopped covering the vast majority of migrants from countries belonging to the Compact of Free Association (COFA) in the state Medicaid program. As a result COFA migrants were required to obtain private insurance in health insurance exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act. Using statewide administrative hospital discharge data, we show that Medicaid-funded hospitalizations and emergency room visits declined in this population by 69% and 42% after the expiration of Medicaid eligibility. Utilization funded by private insurance did increase but not enough to offset the declines in publicly-funded utilization. This resulted in a net decrease in utilization. In addition, we show that uninsured ER visits increased as a consequence of the expiration of Medicaid benefits. Paradoxically, we also find a substantial increase in Medicaid-funded ER visits by infants after the expiration of benefits which is consistent with a substitution of ER visits for ambulatory care for the very young.
I10|Expanding Health Insurance for the Elderly of the Philippines|The Philippines expanded health insurance coverage of its senior citizens, aged 60 and older, in 2014. Employing data from two separate sources, we find that the expansion increased insurance coverage by approximately 16 percentage points. Instrumental variables estimates indicate that out-of-pocket medical expenditures more than doubled among the newly insured. We argue that this is most likely driven by an outward shift in the medical demand curve due to physician-induced demand. Quantile regression estimates indicate that these effects were the most pronounced among high utilizers. We show that the compliers, defined as those induced by the policy to obtain insurance, are disproportionately female and largely from the middle of the socioeconomic distribution. Finally, tests for selection indicate only moderate adverse selection into the treatment.
I10|Health condition and job status interactions: econometric evidence of causality from a French longitudinal survey|Abstract This article investigates the causal links between health and employment status. To disentangle correlation from causality effects, the authors leverage a French panel survey to estimate a bivariate dynamic probit model that can account for the persistence effect, initial conditions, and unobserved heterogeneity. The results highlight the crucial role of all three components and reveal strong dual causality between health and employment status. The findings clearly support demands for better coordination between employment and health public policies.
I10|Measuring multivariate risk preferences in the health domain|We investigate univariate and multivariate risk preferences for health (longevity) and wealth. We measure attitudes toward correlation and attitudes toward higher order dependence structures such as cross-prudence and cross-temperance, making use of the risk apportionment technique proposed by Eeckhoudt et al. (2007). For multivariate gains, we find correlation aversion and cross-prudence in longevity and wealth. For losses, we observe correlation seeking and cross-imprudence. We do not find clear evidence for cross-temperance. Our results indicate that longevity and wealth are considered to be substitutes for gains, but not for losses. Second, univariate (higher order) risk preferences are comparable for longevity and wealth, although somewhat closer to linearity for wealth. Third, we find evidence that attitudes toward dependence structures in the health domain are sign-dependent.
I10|Formal Care of the Elderly and Health Outcomes Among Adult Daughters|Health-care expenditures and the demand for caregiving are increasing concerns for policy makers. Although informal care to a certain extent may substitute for costly formal care, providing informal care may come at a cost to caregivers in terms of their own health. However, evidence of causal effects of care responsibilities on health is limited, especially for long-term outcomes. In this paper, we estimate long-term effects of a formal care expansion for the elderly on the health of their middle-aged daughters. We exploit a reform in the federal funding of formal care for Norwegian municipalities that caused a greater expansion of home care provision in municipalities that initially had lower coverage rates. We find that expanding formal care reduced sickness absence in the short run, primarily due to reduced absences related to musculoskeletal and psychological disorders. In general, we find no effects on long-term health outcomes.
I10|Pre- and Post-Birth Components of Intergenerational Persistence in Health and Longevity: Lessons from a Large Sample of Adoptees|We use data on a large sample of Swedish-born adoptees and their biological and adopting parents to decompose the persistence in health inequality across generations into pre-birth and post-birth components. We use three sets of measures for health outcomes in the second generation: mortality, measures based on data on hospitalization and, finally, measures using birth outcomes for the third generation. The results show that all of the persistence in mortality is transmitted solely via pre-birth factors, while the results for the hospitalization measures suggest that at least three quarters of the intergenerational persistence in health is attributable to the biological parents.
I10|Can Social Spending Cushion the Inequality Effect of Globalization?|This paper examines whether social spending cushions the effect of globalization on within-country inequality. Using information on disposable and market income inequality and data on overall social spending, and health and education spending from the ILO and the World Bank/WHO, we analyze whether social spending moderates the association between economic globalization and inequality. The results confirm that economic globalization – especially economic flows – associates with higher income inequality, an effect driven by non-OECD countries. Health spending is strongly associated with lower inequality, but we find no robust evidence that any kind of social spending negatively moderates the association between economic globalization and inequality.
I10|Strategies to prioritize prevention in the Greek primary healthcare system|The present study presents financial incentives for General Practitioners(GPs) to engage in specific preventive care services and describes new roles for nurses to provide recommendations regarding brief nutrition counseling. To calculate the total number of personnel required to provide nutrition counseling, we considered 4 elements: (1) published and estimated time required to deliver nutrition counseling (2) the number of the maximum patients seen per day (3) the annual workload of the provider and (4) the number of people requiring those services. We annualize the frequency of performing specific preventive care services by GPs based on the official recommendations by the American Cancer Society. One exclusive nurse could provide a plan of care, designed to help almost 20.000 individuals either maintain the assessed status or attain a healthier status. Screening tests for cervical, colon and breast cancer should be performed by GPs to at least 3.537.810 individuals of the total Greek population for the year 2018.
I10|An Unconventional Way to Support Health Expenditure|Here, we propose a taxation scheme towards the implementation of universal health care under Beveridge model. In our proposed framework, a small amount of health tax is imposed on each and every non-cash transaction including transactions through debit and credit card, credit transfer, direct debit and cheque which is found to be solely sufficient to cover up entire health expenditure of a nation. We have shown empirically that a $1.84$ USD levy on every non-cash transaction is enough to meet up the annual health expenditure in the CEMEA (Central Europe, Middle East and Africa) region. For Latin America (LA), Emerging Asia (EA), Mature Asia and the Pacific (MAP) and North America (NA) this value is found to be $4.51$, $2.04$, $15.93$ and $21.07$ USD respectively. Moreover, as the proposed levy is collectable electronically without any human intervention, no additional logistic support is required for the implementation of the scheme.
I10|Boosting quality education with inclusive human development: empirical evidence from sub-Saharan Africa|This study examines the importance of inclusive human development in promoting education quality in a panel of forty-nine Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Fixed Effects (FE) and Quantile Regression (QR) estimations. It is apparent from the OLS and FE findings that inclusive human development has a negative effect on the outcome variable. This negative effect implies that inclusive human development improves education quality. This result should be understood in the light of the fact that the adopted education variable is a negative economic signal given that it is computed as the ratio of pupils to teachers. Therefore, a higher ratio reflects diminishing education quality. From QR, with the exception of the highest quantile, the tendency of inclusive human development in reducing poor quality education is consistent throughout the conditional distribution of poor education quality. Policy implications are discussed.
I10|Subjective health status and immigration: Evidence across Europe|Background: Subjective health status and migration are critical issues in healthcare policy and strategic decision making. There are many health challenges to resolve and at the same time, migration has reached to historic highs, leading to different views among immigrants and natives, policy makers and habitants. Objective: Our research focuses on the subjective health status reported by European habitants, on its differentiation with respect to participants origin, and on whether various demographic, macroeconomic and other factors, such as the foreigners’ presence in a country, affect it. Setting and participants: Using survey data of 227,200 respondents from 22 countries and over the period 2002-2016, and employing logit estimation techniques, we analysed the effect of demographic, macroeconomic and other factors in shaping respondents’ subjective health status. Results: Our results demonstrate the important role of all demographic factors in shaping respondents’ subjective health status. Immigrants report a higher subjective health status, while macroeconomic conditions and foreign presence in a country do play an important role. A country healthcare provision state and health expenditures can moderate the negative effect of foreigners’ presence and thus the reported health status of natives. Conclusions: The factors influencing subjective health status are complex and interdependent. However, government policies should increase social cohesion, since, the latter is not only related to health care outcomes but also can be a tool for disseminating social inequalities.
I10|Family Decision Making for Educational Expenditure, New Evidence from Survey Data for Nigeria|This study examines the determinants of educational expenditures by households in Nigeria. Data from the Nigerian General Household Survey, Panel 2012/2013, Wave 2 was used and a double-hurdle model was employed for the analysis. The results suggest household income, the age, education, gender of the household heads and urban versus rural residence have a significant impact on the decision to spend on education. Such expenditures are income elastic overall, but are very different in magnitude for low income compared to higher income families. It is found that the income elasticity of education expenditures are approximately four times greater for households in the bottom two-thirds of the income distribution than for those on the top one-third of the income distribution.
I10|The Influence of Old-age Retirement on Health: Causal Evidence from the Finnish Register Data|Abstract We quantify the impact of old-age retirement on health using longitudinal Finnish register data for the period 2000–2012, which allows for a strict isolation of the effects of transition from work to retirement for both mental and physical health indicators. We use the lowest statutory eligibility age for full old-age pensions, 63 years, as an instrument in FE-IV estimation to ensure causal inference. We find that (1) retirement moderately decreases the use of antidepressants, especially for women; (2) the beneficial effects of retirement on the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal conditions are smaller and more diffused; (3) there is no robust evidence that retirement effects vary systematically among socioeconomic groups, although more robust declines in musculoskeletal diseases were observed among manual-labour men; and (4) the beneficial effects in antidepressant use can be extended to apply to most Finns retiring at ages 62–64 based on our test of external validity.
I10|It’s All in the Stars: The Chinese Zodiac and the Effects of Parental Investments on Offspring’s Cognitive and Noncognitive Skill Development|The importance of (early) parental investments in children’s cognitive and noncognitive outcomes is a question of deep policy significance. However, because parental investments are arguably endogenous, empirically estimating their importance poses a challenge. This paper exploits a rich and novel dataset, the China Family Panel Studies, and proposes a culture-specific instrumental variable based on the Chinese zodiac, in order to identify the impact of parental investments. By looking at the outcomes of children born just before and just after the cutoff for a “lucky” (or “nonlucky”) zodiac sign, we find that parents' investments have significant effects on their offspring’s development of both cognitive and noncognitive skills.
I10|The Impact of Bullying Victimisation on Mental Wellbeing|We investigate the impact of nine types of adolescent (verbal, physical, indirect) school/domestic bullying on life satisfaction, and two mental health outcomes (emotional symptoms and hyperactivity/inattention) using the Understanding Society dataset during 2009-13. Bullying significantly increases hyperactive, inattentive and emotional symptoms and reduces life satisfaction. Non-domestic bullying has a stronger adverse impact on all three mental wellbeing outcomes. Domestic sibling victimisation does not affect life satisfaction. Lower levels of family income increase adolescent hyperactive/inattentive symptoms and reduce life satisfaction. Females are more vulnerable to emotional symptoms while males report higher levels of life satisfaction. Initial conditions precondition hyperactive and inattentive symptoms.
I10|Technological Progress and Health Convergence: The Case of Penicillin in Post-War Italy|Throughout history, technological progress has transformed population health, but the distributional effects of these gains are unclear. New substitutes for older, more expensive health technologies can produce convergence in population health outcomes, but may also be prone to “elite capture” leading to divergence. This paper studies the case of penicillin using detailed mortality statistics and exploiting its sharply-timed introduction in Italy after World War II. We find penicillin reduced both the mean and standard deviation of infectious diseases mortality, leading to substantial convergence across disparate regions of Italy. Our results do not appear to be confounded by competing risks or mortality patterns associated with World War II.
I10|Taste Missions ? A new and innovative approach to improve pupil?s health through food literacy|What makes food, health and children so interesting? Food is one of the primary sources to human life that through a healthy lifestyle can be influencing the future of every individual. Especially children with their future ahead are an important target group that needs focus, since habits are often established at an early age (Piaget, 1969), which also is the case in regards to food and health. To secure the public health and wellbeing of future generations, and to ensure a more sustainable environment and world, we find that teaching children about food, nutrition and health is essential in order to develop a healthy relationship to food and eating habits (Bas?kale, et al., 2009). Learn4Health, an EU Erasmus+ project, was created in 2016 to develop new and innovative methods to food literacy in European schools, to promote a broader knowledge of the origin of food and food systems, and to foster better health practices through new knowledge and self-efficiency. In the project, we seek to develop several innovative and new approaches that aim to increase food knowledge through interdisciplinary hands-on activities. It is our belief, that such methods can foster motivation and a better understanding of when, what and how food is grown, and thereby improve pupils action competencies in relation to food and health now and in the long-term. This paper focuses on one of the Learn4Health activities, Taste Missions, developed, implemented and evaluated by Wageningen University & Research and aims to illustrate how hands-on food activities can benefit pupils in European public schools. Further, it will describe, analyze and conclude upon the activity, and finally, summarize by discussing Taste Missions in the larger Learn4Health context and in the broader perspective of the public by presenting the HOFA Handbook.
I10|Effective Public Health Twitter Messaging in a Diabetes Health Promotion Campaign|Local health departments have been challenged to find effective ways of conducting health promotion using social media. Because 40% of Twitter accounts in the Arab region originate in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), Twitter was chosen as the social media platform for the KSA Ministry of Health?s (MoH?s) ?Do Not Wait for Diabetes? (DNWD) health promotion campaign which began in November 2017. The existing Twitter account for the MoH?s National Diabetes Prevention and Control Program (NDPCP) was assigned to a doctoral student who is advised by a team with diabetes expertise that approves tweets before they are sent. Experiments with techniques to increase the number of ?impressions? (number of times the tweet is seen) and ?engagements? (the number of times an account engages with a tweet) were conducted. Twitter analytics is used to assess these techniques? efficacy. To promote diabetes-related events in particular geographic areas, tweets about these events can mention other local area accounts, such as for schools and local healthcare facilities. The NDPCP account has gained credibility and visibility through high-profile accounts with many followers retweeting the NDPCP tweets. Creating high-quality tweets that meet the information needs of users has also increased both impressions and engagements. Although the account continues to send approximately 2-3 tweets per day, the use of these techniques has increased impressions and engagements by over 100% monthly. Follow-up studies are planned to see if the DNWD Twitter campaign is associated with an increase in diabetes screenings at MoH healthcare facilities.
I10|An Approach to Fujimmon?s Growth Curve from Scammon ?New proposal for human growth curve model|Why do the proportions of the human body change with age? The essential meaning of that question cannot be understood without unraveling the process of human evolution. Moreover, even if the mechanisms of evolution were to be elucidated, the reasons why proportions must be changed or why we must evolve in that way and how far humans will continue evolving are likely to remain mysteries. However, the mechanisms for the changes in human body proportions can be explained. The present study explains not only the mechanisms for changes in body proportion but also, to construct a standard growth system for humans, confirms the reverification process of the growth curves proposed by Scammon almost 90 years ago and seeks to solve problems by offering the Fujimmon growth curves proposed by the author. In addition, the Fujimmon and Scammon growth curves are described on the same scale and the two are compared. The results indicate the basic ambiguity of curves described freehand and the clarity from the exactness provided by the mathematical functions described by the wavelet interpolation model. The validity and efficacy of the Fujimmon growth curves are then shown.
I10|Search for Obesity Cutoff Value Based on Health Information: Analysis from BMI fluctuation|Obesity refers to a state in which excessive fat is accumulated in the body. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), people with a body mass index (BMI) of ?25 are taken to be obese. This is the standard indicating increased risk of diseases such as myocardial infarction and stroke attributable to obesity. That is, it is considered to be an indicator below which risk is inhibited and people can live in health. However, the critical point for risk affecting health is not clear. If the risks associated with health information could be analyzed by degree of obesity, it may be possible to identify a cut-off value for obesity. In this study we assessed the level of health risk based on BMI fluctuations, calculated the mean health information values for each unit of BMI from 14 to 34, and analyzed fluctuations in each health information item based on BMI fluctuation. The results showed that the risk from blood pressure and maximum oxygen uptake increased together with fluctuations in BMI. With this it is thought that a new cutoff point for obesity risk can be established.
I10|Annual Trend of Physical Growth in Infant and Japanese High Economic Growth|The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has published measurement records on height, weight, chest circumference, and head circumference in 0 to 6 year-old children from 1960 to 2010 as indicators of physical development in early childhood in Japan. Physical development evaluation charts have been developed from these records using percentile methods, but reports on the trends in physical development over time are limited. This is because no method has been established to scientifically analyze physical growth. Even more difficult is investigating secular trends in physical growth and linking those trends to economic growth. In this study, we identified the first largest peak velocity (FLPV) during the year after birth in infant physical growth records (height, weight, chest circumference, head circumference), and applied the wavelet interpolation model to the variations over time in the identified FLPV. Next, we applied the wavelet interpolation model to the secular variations in GDP for the same years. We then applied a cross correlation function to the relationship between the curves of FLPV and GDP variations over time, and investigated how high economic growth acts as a controlling factor variations in physical development of young children over time. The speed of variation in the physical development of children over time was the greatest around 1980. By synchronizing GDP to that time, the results suggest that high economic growth is a controlling factor in the physical development of young children.
I10|Tracking Phenomenon of Physical Development during elementary School|The method generally used to assess motor ability in elementary school is the 10-step assessment in the new physical fitness test advocated by the by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan. However, no method of assessing physical fitness and motor ability has been established that considers changes with age in schoolchildren, who are in the growth stage. Specifically, no method to evaluate physical longitudinal data for individual children has been created. In this study, we constructed an aging span evaluation chart of motor ability using the wavelet interpolation method and applied it to longitudinal development data for motor ability in the physical ability of first to sixth grade elementary school students. Motor ability tracking was then examined with the application of this evaluation method. The results confirmed that motor ability tracked closely in first to sixth grade elementary school students. Therefore, this suggests that there is a trend for individuals with high motor ability in childhood to follow the same high level course afterward. Also, children with poor motor ability in particular may need early educational attention.
I10|Construction of Standardization System in Judgment for Young Children Obesity and Leanness|Body composition in children can be measured until about the age of 6 years using the impedance method, but in children below that age the findings are often treated as reference values. However, information on body composition is needed to verify body fatness in early childhood. In this study, we investigated the validity of obesity and leanness Judgment using a simple impedance analysis in young children, by comparing body fat percentage derived with the impedance method and body fatness judged from standard height and weight curves, with the aim of constructing a standardized system for judging obesity and leanness in young children. we constructed a 5-step mean evaluation together with body fat percentage statistics and judged levels of obesity and leanness. For judgments of obesity with regression evaluation of weight against height, we constructed a 5-step regression evaluation chart after deriving valid order regression polynomials, and determined levels of obesity and leanness based on them. The results of comparisons of the distributions of obesity and leanness judgments obtained with the two evaluations using the ?2 test showed no significant differences in all subjects from 3 to 5 years old.
I10|Issues in physical fitness of contemporary Japanese boys judged with evaluation criteria for the past|In this study, evaluation criteria for physique and physical fitness in early childhood were constructed with consideration of age-related changes. The wavelet interpolation model was used for data from young children in 1979, when physical fitness was at a high level in postwar Japan. This evaluation chart was then used to investigate the kinds of problems that could be indicated in the physical development of young children today, by evaluating their physique and physical fitness. Physical fitness was evaluated in 2,014 boys in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. Height, weight, 20 m dash, standing long jump, and tennis ball throw were measured from April to June, 2009. In constructing evaluation criteria for the past, data collected in 1979 for the same items as above were used. The subjects were 2,397 boys in Aichi Prefecture. An age-related change curve with a 5-step evaluation by age was drawn for the collected measurement data using the wavelet interpolation model, and an evaluation chart was constructed. The results showed that height was shorter at 3 years of age in 2009 than in 1979, but that later there was a tendency for height to catch up with that in 1979 with age. It is conjectured that this shows a faster maturation speed in boys compared with 30 years ago. There was more scattering in the lower level of the running and jumping ability aspects of physical fitness, while in throwing ability the level was obviously low at all ages. The results of this study indicate that issues related to the growth and development of young children today are underdevelopment in relation to the continuous display of leg muscle strength and innervation for alternating right and left movement of the arms and legs, immaturity in coordinated movement between the arms, trunk and legs, and low instantaneous muscle strength of the arms.
I10|Recent Trends in Physical Fitness and Motor Ability of Preschool Children -Trends in Japan since 2000-|In recent years, there has been concern in Japan of declining physical strength in early childhood. Consideration of lifestyle in modern society may provide suggestions on the appropriate level of physical strength and motor ability for modern children. Therefore, it may be necessary to show the physique and motor ability suitable for the generational background. The purpose of this study was to clarify the trends since 2000 in body shape, physical strength, and motor ability in early childhood in Japan. The data used were physique and motor ability data from 1969 to 2009 for young boys and girls in kindergartens and nursery schools in Aichi Prefecture surveyed by the Children?s Growth and Development Society. The study subjects were kindergarten and nursery school girls (age 3?5 years old) in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. Physique (height and weight), quantitative motor ability (20 m dash, standing long jump, tennis ball throw, side step, one-leg hop, jump rope, hanging from a horizontal bar, one-leg standing, and ball bouncing), and general motor ability (jump over and under) were compared in the 1999 and 2009 school years. The results revealed that, compared with ten years earlier, height was approximately 0.9 cm shorter in 4-year-old girls and weight was approximately 0.3 kg lighter in 3- and 4-year-old girls in 2009. In physical strength and motor ability, the time for jump over and under was shorter in 3-year-olds, the number of times a rope jumped was higher and the time hanging from a horizontal bar was longer, and the time for jump over and under was shorter in 4-year-olds. In 5-year-olds, only an increase in the number of times a rope jumped increased. The tennis ball throw and side steps were not significantly different from 10 years earlier in any of the ages. Although physique, strength, and exercise improved with growth, it was found that many items decreased or remained the same in all age groups compared to those 10 years ago.
I10|Improving interoperability in Healthcare using Hl7 FHIR|Data sharing within patients, hospitals and medical centers and the diversity of healthcare data still remain one of the main challenges in Albania. Exchanging health information is crucial because it can improve treatment, health care and decision-making process. FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is used as a standard for exchanging healthcare information in HL7 (Health Level 7). FHIR is based on the RESTful principles, so the resources can be accessed using HTTP and displayed in XML or JSON format. The aim of this paper is to analyse the use of FHIR standard in improving interoperability and integration of patient?s data between different hospital services and radiology service in Albania.
I10|Interdisciplinary Classification Studies|Classification of different kinds of objects is an important source of information in different areas of science. We show examples of classification diagrams of objects related to bioinformatics, medicine, and social science. In particular, we present a bioinformatics method designed by us and called 2D-Dynamic Representation of DNA/RNA Sequences [1,2]. In this non-standard approach the sequences are represented as point-masses in a 2D space. This mathematical method facilitates the creation of the classification diagrams in which different kinds of sequences are separated. Analogous diagrams we have obtained in social science - different groups of people are separated according to some, properly selected, criteria. In this case, a classifier is a kind of an answers to some questions. We have shown that this method can be a good tool for studies of the retirement threshold [3,4]. In the present work we also show some unpublished results related to the quality of life of the patients with voice disorders in inflammatory, neoplastic and neurological diseases of the larynx.[1] D.

I10|An investigation into software requirements for systems supporting task-shifted interventions|Background: There is a considerable shortfall in specialized health professionals worldwide to deliver health services and this shortfall is especially pronounced in low-middle income countries. This has led to the implementation of task-shifted interventions, in which specific tasks are moved away from highly qualified health workers to health workers with less training. The World Health Organisation has published recommendations for such interventions, but guidelines for software and systems supporting such interventions are not included. Objective: The objective of this paper is to formulate a number of software requirements for computer systems supporting task-shifted interventions. As the treatment of mental health problems is generally considered to be a task for highly trained health professionls, it poses interesting case studies for task-shifted interventions. Therefore, we will illustrate the use of the identified software requirements in a mobile system created for a task-shifted depression intervention to be provided to older adults in deprived areas of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Methods: Using a set of recommendations based on the World Health Organisationâ€™s guidance documentation for task-shifted interventions, we identified nine software requirements that aim to support health workers in management and supervision, training, good relationship with other health workers, and community embeddedness of the intervention. These nine software requirements were used to implement a system for the provision of a psychosocial depression intervention with mobile Android interfaces to structure interventions and collect data, and web interfaces for supervision and support of the healthcare workers delivering the intervention. The system was tested in a two-arm pilot study with 33 patients and 11 health workers. Eight of these 11 health workers participated in a â€˜usabilityâ€™ study subsequent to the pilot. Results: Qualitative and quantitative feedback obtained with the System Usability Scale suggest the system was deemed to have a usability of between â€˜OKâ€™ and â€˜Goodâ€™. Nevertheless, some participantsâ€™ responses indicate they felt they needed technical assistance to use the system. This was reinforced by answers obtained with â€˜Perceived Usefulnessâ€™ and â€˜Ease of Useâ€™ questionnaires, which indicated some users felt they had issues around correct use of the system and perceived ability to becoming skilful at using the system. Conclusions: Overall, these high-level requirements adequately captured the functionality required to enable the health workers to provide the intervention successfully. Nevertheless, the analysis of results indicated some improvements are required for the system to be useable in a task-shifted intervention. The most important of these are better access to a training environment, access for supervisors to meta-data such as duration of sessions or exercises to identify issues, and a more robust and human-error proof approach to availability of patient data on the mobile devices used during the intervention.
I10|Feasibility of a cluster randomized controlled trial of a psychosocial intervention to improve late life depression in socioeconomically deprived areas of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil (PROACTIVE)|Background: Depression is a common and recurrent condition among older adults and is associated with poor quality of life and increased health care utilization and costs. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of delivering a psychosocial intervention targeting depression, and to develop the procedures to conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) among older adults registered with primary care clinics in poor neighbourhoods of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Methods: We conducted a pilot study of a two-arm cluster RCT using a protocol developed previously (see accompanying paper). Two primary care clinics adhering to the Family Health Strategy were allocated to either the intervention or the control arm. In the control arm, patients received enhanced usual care consisting of staff training for improved recognition and management of depression. In the intervention arm, alongside the enhanced usual care, patients received a 17-week psychosocial intervention delivered by health workers assisted with an application installed in a tablet. Results: We randomly selected 579 of 2020 older adults registered in the intervention clinic to participate in the study. Among these individuals, 353 were assessed for depression and 40 (11.0%) scored at least 10 on the PHQ-9 and were therefore invited to participate. The consent rate was 33/40 (82%) with a resulting yield of 33/579 (5.7%). In the control arm, we randomly selected 320 older adults among 1482 registered in the clinic, 223 were assessed for depression and 28 (12.6%) scored 10 or above on the PHQ-9. The consent rate was 25/28 (89%), with a resulting yield of 25/320 (7.8%). Of the 33 who consented in the intervention arm, 19 (59.4%) completed all sessions. The mean PHQ-9 at follow-up (approximately 30 weeks after inclusion) was 12.3 (SD=3.7) and 3.8 (SD=3.9) in the control and intervention arms respectively. Follow-up rates were 92% and 94% in control and intervention arms, respectively. Conclusions: Identification and engagement of clinics, random selection and recruitment of individuals, baseline and follow-up assessment all proved to be feasible in primary care clinics in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Results support the development of a definitive cluster RCT.
I10|Crude oil futures trading and uncertainty|This paper examines the effect of different dimensions of uncertainty on expectations of WTI crude oil futures momentum traders at a daily level. We consider two concepts of uncertainty and two momentum trading indicators based on technical analysis. In addition, we also use wavelet techniques to decompose crude oil futures prices into different frequencies accounting for investors' sentiment at various horizons. To allow for different effects on the propagation mechanism of uncertainty shocks, we apply a time-varying Bayesian VAR approach. Our findings indicate that both measures of uncertainty affect momentum trading on the crude oil futures market in several periods, especially during the great recession between 2007 and 2009. For the decomposed futures prices our results also show that the reaction to uncertainty differs substantially across frequencies. High frequencies exhibit a very short-lived reaction to uncertainty while low frequencies show a persistent reaction to uncertainty shocks.
I10|Cigarette Prices and Driving Fatalities Among Youths|Deaths from motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of unintentional deaths in the United States. This paper investigates the effect of increases in cigarette taxes and prices following the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) on non-alcohol and alcohol-related motor vehicle fatalities among youths. I find that increases in cigarette taxes and prices are associated with a reduction in non-alcohol related accidents between 1998 and 2006 among 16-to-20 year olds.
I10|Maternal Education and Infant Health Gradient: New Answers to Old Questions|Recent studies have highlighted the importance of locality on well-being indicators such as health, later-life income, formation of human capital and fertility outcomes. By using data from the National Vital Statistics System, this paper provides an in-depth investigation of the well-documented relationship between mother's education and in- fant health. The study focuses on differential effects of mother's education on infant health outcomes across localities based on income status by using birthweight and low birthweight as measures for infant health. I find substantial non-linear effects of mothers' high school completion on infants' health outcomes and such effects are masked when specifying mother's education as a linear variable. More importantly, mother's education and infant health relationship is concentrated in relatively poorer geographic areas. This can partially be explained by drastic improvements in utilization of health services among educated mothers residing in poorer areas compared to mothers with lower levels of education. The overall findings imply that mother's education can act as a substitute for lack of external health inputs and provides cushion against adverse environmental factors in poorer areas.
I10|The Effect of Prenatal Exposure to Radiation on Birth Outcomes: Exploiting a Natural Experiment in Taiwan|We estimate the effect of prenatal exposure to radiation on infant health. By exploiting the 1983 Taiwanese radiation-contaminated buildings (RCBs) accident as a natural experiment, we compare birth outcomes between siblings and cousins exposed to different radiation levels. Given the 1983 accident was unanticipated and exposed cohorts were unaware of the risk until 1992, our design isolates the effect of radiation exposure during pregnancy from other effects. We provide the first evidence that prenatal exposure to a continuous low-level dose of radiation significantly reduces gestational length and increases the probabilities of prematurity and low birth weight.
I10|¿Qué tan bien recuerdan las madres? Una validación de datos de desempeños al nacer para Uruguay|To assess maternal and child well-being and health goals derived from national and international agreements, many household surveys collect information on reproductive, maternal and child health. However, scarce representative validation exercises are comparing these data to administrative records information at the individual level. In this study, we contrast household surveys against data from clinical histories and vital statistics information. Also, we explore whether the significance and magnitude of the relationships between the variables change depending on the data source used. Based on the merging of vital statistics microdata with the official Uruguayan Nutrition, Child Development and Health Survey (ENDIS), we analyze the accuracy in mothers recall of weeks of gestation and prenatal visits. In general terms, our exercise validates the use of survey data, even though the identification of premature births and early prenatal visits have significant differences. We find that the accuracy of the recall by mothers is high and the discrepancies are associated with lower maternal education levels, the recall period (child´s age), and the birth order. However, the incidence of prematurity and early uptake is underestimated by 20%. Although the (respective) association of gestational weeks and prenatal controls with birth weight shows similar signs in both data sources, the levels of significance and effects magnitude appear to be greater in the administrative records.
I10|Born in the Right Place? Health Ministers, Foreign Aid and Infant Mortality|To determine whether health ministers engage in regional favoritism, we hand-collect geocoded data on the birth regions of cabinet members in 45 African countries between 2001 and 2014. We combine this data with information on World Bank health aid projects and retrospective data on neonatal and infant mortality from Demographic and Health Surveys. We provide two pieces of evidence suggesting health ministers engage in favoritism. First, using administrative region and country-year fixed effects, we show that administrative regions receive more health aid when a region-born health minister is in office. Second, comparing siblings, we find that neonates (and possibly infants) born in the same region as the health minister are less likely to die. These two results imply that not only do country leaders exercise their power to influence the allocation of funds (as shown in previous literature), but so do cabinet members. We do not find any descriptive evidence that the lower neonatal (and possibly infant) mortality in health ministers' birth regions can be explained by the additional health aid allocated to these regions.
I10|How Enhancing Gender Inclusion Affects Inequality: Thresholds of Complementary Policies for Sustainable Development|This study investigates how enhancing gender inclusion affects inequality in 42 African countries for the period 2004-2014. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalized Method of Moments. Three inequality indicators are used, namely, the: Gini coefficient, Atkinson index, and Palma ratio. The two gender inclusion measurements used include female labour force participation and female employment. The following main findings are established. There are positive net effects on inequality from the enhancement of gender inclusion dynamics. An extended threshold analysis is used to assess critical masses at which further increasing gender inclusion enhances inequality. The established thresholds are: (i) 55.555 â€œemployment to population ratio, 15+, female (%)â€ for the nexus with the Gini coefficient. (ii) 50 â€œlabor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+)â€ and between 50 to 55 â€œemployment to population ratio, 15+, female (%)â€ , for the Atkinson index. (iii) 61.87 â€œlabor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+)â€ for the Palma ratio.These established thresholds are worthwhile for sustainable development because, beyond the critical masses, policy makers should complement the gender inclusion policy with other measures designed to reduce income inequality. Some complementary measures that can be taken on board beyond the established thresholds could focus on enhancing, inter alia: information and communication technology, infrastructural development; financial inclusion and inclusive education.
I10|Inequality Thresholds, Governance and Gender Economic Inclusion in sub-Saharan Africa|Inequality and gender economic exclusion are major policy concerns facing sub-Saharan Africa in the post-2015 development agenda. The study provides critical masses of inequality that should not be exceeded if governance is to promote gender economic participation. The research focuses on 42 countries in sub-Saharan Africa using annual data spanning from 2004 to 2014. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalized Method of Moments. The following findings are established. First, inequality (i.e. the Gini coefficient) levels that completely nullify the positive effect of governance on female labour force participation are 0.708 for political stability, 0.601 for voice & accountability, 0.588 for government effectiveness, 0.631 for regulatory quality, 0.612 for the rule of law, and 0.550 for corruption-control. Second, inequality thresholds at which female unemployment can no longer be mitigated by governance channels include: 0.561 (for political stability) and 0.465 (for the rule of law). Third, inequality levels that completely dampen the positive impact of governance on female employment are 0.608 for political stability, 0.580 for voice & accountability, 0.581 for government effectiveness, and 0.557 for the rule of law. As the main policy implication, for good governance to promote gender economic inclusion, inequality levels should not exceed established thresholds.
I10|Income Levels, Governance and Inclusive Human Development in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study examines how income-driven governance affects inclusive human development in Sub-Saharan Africa with data for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) and Tobit regressions. Nine bundled and unbundled concepts of governance are used: political (voice & accountability and political stability/no violence), economic (government effectiveness and regulation quality) and institutional (corruption-control and the rule of law) governances. The main finding is that â€˜middle incomeâ€™-driven governance has a higher effect on inclusive human development than â€˜low incomeâ€™-driven governance. Policy implications are discussed in the light of: (i) the contemporary relevance of findings; (ii) the pivotal role of a higher income level in the post-2015 sustainable development agenda; and (iii) inconsistent strands in the literature and in foreign aid policies.
I10|Subjective Probabilistic Expectations, Indoor Air Pollution, and Health: Evidence from cooking fuel use patterns in India|An increasing number of empirical studies have investigated the determinants of cooking fuel choice in developing countries, where health risk from indoor air pollution is one of the most important issues. We contribute to this stream of literature by examining individuals f subjective probabilistic expectations about health risks when using different types of fuel and their influence on cooking fuel usage patterns. We also explore how these patterns, in turn, affect health status. Using data collected from 557 rural Indian households, we find that subjective probabilistic expectations of becoming sick from dirty fuel usage have a negative influence on the fraction of days with dirty fuel usage in the household. The results also show that dirty fuel usage degrades the health of the individual. We then examine the effectiveness of information provision regarding the health risks of dirty/clean fuel usage. Our simulation demonstrates that although the provision of information results in statistically significant changes in the households f cooking fuel usage patterns and in the individuals f health status, the changes may be small in size.
I10|Cost-Effective Clinical Trial Design: Application of a Bayesian Sequential Stopping Rule to the ProFHER Pragmatic Trial|We investigate value-based clinical trial design by applying a Bayesian decisiontheoretic model of a sequential experiment to data from the ProFHER pragmatic trial. In the first applied analysis of its kind to use research cost data, we show that the model’s stopping policy would have stopped the trial early, saving about 5% of the research budget (approximately £73,000). A bootstrap analysis based on generating resampled paths from the trial data suggests that the trial’s expected sample size could have been reduced by approximately 40%, saving an expected 15% of the budget, with 93% of resampled paths making a decision consistent with the result of the trial itself. Results show how substantial benefits to trial cost stewardship may be achieved by accounting for research costs in defining the trial’s stopping policy and active monitoring of trial data as it accumulates.
I10|Are they coming for us? Industrial robots and the mental health of workers|We investigate how an increase in the robot intensity (the ratio of industrial robots over employment) affects the self-reported mental health of workers in Germany. To do so, we combine individual mental health data from the German Socioeconomic Panel with the deliveries of robots to 21 German manufacturing sectors provided by the International Federation of Robotics for the period 2002-2014 (every two years). Controlling for a range of individual and sectoral characteristics, and employing individual-, time- and sectoral fixed effects, we find that an increase in robot intensity of 10% is associated with an average decrease of 0.59% of the average mental health standard deviation. This suggests that in a fast automating sector (i.e. rubber and plastics), where the robot intensity increased by approximately 2000%, mental health would have decreased by 118% of one standard deviation. This effect seems to be driven by job security fears of individuals working in noninteractive jobs and the fear of a decline in an individual's economic situation. Moreover, further sample divisions into low, middle and high occupational groups shows that the negative effects are affecting mostly the middle-level occupational group. Splitting the sample according to different age groups shows that the mental health of younger workers is the most vulnerable to an increase in automation. Results are also robust to instrumenting the stock of robots, and to different changes in the sample.
I10|Time-inconsistent health behavior and its impact on aging and longevity|We integrate time-inconsistent decision making due to hyperbolic discounting into a gerontologically founded life cycle model with endogenous aging and longevity. Individuals can slow down aging and postpone death by health investments and by reducing unhealthy consumption, conceptualized as smoking. We show that individuals continuously revise their original plans to smoke less and invest more in their health. Consequently, they accumulate health deficits faster and die earlier than originally planned. This fundamental health consequence of time-inconsistency has not been addressed in the literature so far. Because death is endogenous, any attempt to establish the time-consistent first-best solution by manipulating the first order conditions through (sin-) taxes and subsidies is bound to fail. We calibrate the model with U.S. data for an average American in the year 2010 and estimate that time-inconsistent health behavior causes a loss of about 5 years of life. We show how price policy can nudge individuals to behave more healthy such that they actually realize the longevity and value of life planned at age 20.
I10|Incentivizing organ donation by swearing an oath: The role of signature and ritual|In China, United States and in many other countries, there is a serious gap between the demand and the supply of human organs for transplantation. To fill this gap, policy makers have made great efforts to promote organ donor registration. In this paper, we provide a novel organ donation incentive strategy, i.e. swearing an oath, and experimentally identify channels through which oath impacts organ donation. Our experimental results show that the impacts of oath work through the signature and ritual channels, i.e. voluntarily signing oath or swearing an oath accompanied by ritualized gesture significantly increase the organ donor registration rate. However, the oath alone does not affect organ donation behavior. In addition, we also find that the opt-out rule has a positive influence on donor registration rate only in Rounds 1-11 but not in Rounds 12-22. The donor registration rate is significantly reduced when changing from opt-out to opt-in rule, and it is unaffected when changing from opt-in to opt-out rule. These results indicate that the effect of opt-out rule may attenuate with experience.
I10|Health, Cognition and Work Capacity Beyond the Age of 50|The rising cost of old-age dependency in Europe and elsewhere invariably leads to reforms aimed at raising the effective age or retirement. But do older individuals have the health/cognitive capacity to work longer? Following Cutler et al. (2012), this paper asks how much older individuals could work if they worked as much as their younger (50-54) counterparts in similar health/with equal cognitive performance. Contrary to existing papers, this one uses international, European, comparable panel evidence available in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). It considers both physical health and cognition; and health consists of subjective and objective measures. Also, it examines the extensive and intensive margins of work (employment and hours): existing papers only consider the former. Results are essentially fivefold. First, declines in health significantly affect employment. Second, the impact on hours is statistical significant but of much smaller magnitude. People suffering from ill health rarely adjust hours; they rather stop working altogether. Third, cognition is not fundamentally affected by ageing, and it adds little to our capacity to predict how work capacity evolves with age. Fourth, identification issues exist and must be addressed. They comprise unobserved heterogeneity across respondents, justification bias or proxying/measurement errors regarding health. Finally, declining health/cognition explain at most 31% of the actual labour supply reduction between 50 and 70. This confirms the existence of a, currently largely underused, work capacity among older individuals.
I10|Short-Run Health Consequences of Retirement and Pension Benefits: Evidence from China|This paper examines the impact of the New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS) in China. Exploiting the staggered implementation of an NRPS policy expansion that began in 2009, we use a difference-in-difference approach to study the effects of the introduction of pension benefits on the health status, health behaviors, and healthcare utilization of rural Chinese adults age 60 and above. The results point to three main conclusions. First, in addition to improvements in self-reported health, older adults with access to the pension program experienced significant improvements in several important measures of health, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, and vision. Second, regarding the functional domains of mobility and self-care, we found that the females in the study group led in improvements over their male counterparts. Third, in our search for the mechanisms that drive positive retirement program results, we find evidence that changes in individual health behaviors, such as a reduction in drinking and smoking, and improved sleep habits, play an important role. Our findings point to the potential benefits of retirement programs resulting from social spillover effects. In addition, these programs may lessen the morbidity burden among the retired population.
I10|Conflict Exposure and Economic Welfare in Nigeria|Several papers have attempted to estimate and document the impact of conflict on numerous education, health and socioeconomic outcomes. One lesson from this research is the heterogeneity in the effect of violent conflict across and within countries. In this paper we attempt to estimate the casual impact of conflict in Nigeria on welfare related outcomes. The 2009 insurgence of Boko Haram and the Fulani herdsmen versus farmers conflicts have led to a significant increase in violent conflict in the North Eastern and Central parts of Nigeria. However, bouts of violent conflict has existed in different communities across Nigeria since independence. We estimate the general effect of conflict exposure on welfare, across Nigeria using the three waves of the Nigeria General Household Survey (GHS) combined with ACLED conflict data. Employing a fixed effect approach, our results suggest that recent and long term exposure to conflict increased poverty incidence, poverty gap and poverty severity in Nigeria.
I10|Mental Health, Schooling Attainment and Polygenic Scores: Are There Significant Gene-Environment Associations?|It is well-established that (1) there is a large genetic component to mental health, and (2) higher schooling attainment is associated with better mental health. Given these two observations, we test the hypothesis that schooling may attenuate the genetic predisposition to poor mental health. Specifically, we estimate associations between a polygenic score (PGS) for depressive symptoms, schooling attainment and gene-environment (GxE) interactions with mental health (depressive symptoms and depression), in two distinct United States datasets at different adult ages- 29 years old in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) and 54 years old in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS). OLS results indicate that the association of the PGS with mental health is similar in Add Health and the WLS, but the association of schooling attainment is much larger in Add Health than in the WLS. There is some suggestive evidence that the association of the PGS with mental health is lower for more-schooled older individuals in the WLS, but there is no evidence of any significant GxE associations in Add Health. Quantile regression estimates also show that in the WLS the GxE associations are statistically significant only in the upper parts of the conditional depressive symptoms score distribution. We assess the robustness of the OLS results to omitted variable bias by using the siblings samples in both datasets to estimate sibling fixed-effect regressions. The sibling fixed-effect results must be qualified, in part due to low statistical power. However, the sibling fixed-effect estimates show that college education is associated with fewer depressive symptoms in both datasets.
I10|The Impact of BMI on Mental Health: Further Evidence from Genetic Markers| We examine the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mental health for young adults and elderly individuals using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and the Health & Retirement Study. While ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates show that BMI is significantly associated with worse mental health in both young adulthood and old age, they are likely to be confounded by (i) unobserved factors that affect both BMI and mental health and (ii) reverse causality. To tackle confounding, we take two complementary approaches. First, we use a polygenic score for BMI as an instrumental variable (IV) and adjust for polygenic scores for other factors that may invalidate this IV. The IV estimates indicate that there is no statistically significant relationship between BMI and mental health for young adults, whereas there is a positive and statistically significant relationship for the elderly. Moreover, we show that IV estimates likely have to be interpreted as identifying a weighted average of effects of BMI on mental health mostly for individuals on the upper quantiles of the BMI distribution. Given potential remaining concerns about the validity of the IV, our second approach is to consider it an “imperfect” IV and estimate an upper bound on the average treatment effect for the corresponding population following Nevo & Rosen (2012). The estimated upper bounds reinforce the conclusions from the IV estimates: they show little evidence of a detrimental effect of BMI on mental health for young adults while being consistent with an economically meaningful effect for elderly individuals. Lastly, we explore some of the potential channels through which BMI may affect mental health for the elderly.
I10|Mortality shifts and mortality compression. The case of Norway, 1900-2060|Historically, official Norwegian mortality projections computed by Statistics Norway have consistently under-predicted life expectancy. The projected age distribution of deaths may be used to check if the official mortality projections are plausible. The aim of the paper is to verify whether the projections predict a continuation of the ongoing compression in mortality and of the steady upward shift in the ages at which people die. We use official period data on observed (1900-2015) and projected (2016- 2060) sex- and age-specific mortality to estimate the age distribution of life table deaths. We analyse trends in life expectancy at birth, modal and median ages at death, and standard deviation of the age distribution at ages > 30. The historical shifts towards longer longevity are projected to continue into the future. The projections suggest a steady increase in the modal and the median age at death for men and women towards values between 90 and 94 years in 2060. At present these ages are in the range 83-90 years. Simultaneously, deaths become more concentrated around the mean, as the standard deviation of the age distribution is projected to fall continuously. Statistics Norway’s projection methodology is capable of tracking ongoing processes of mortality shifts towards higher ages and a compression of mortality around the modal and mean ages. Mortality projections could potentially benefit from including assessments of the age distribution of deaths.
I10|Measuring income-related inequalities in risky health prospects|The measurement of health disparities is a key component for the assessment of health systems. One aspect of these disparities – which hitherto has received limited attention – is the risk people face about their future health. This paper integrates risk into the standard inequality measurement which measures the extent to which disparities in realized health are systematically associated with income. It develops a rank dependent inequality index that considers not only inequalities in expected future health but also the dispersion of individuals’ future health prospects. It is useful when a social planner wants to account for risk averse preferences in the assessment of income-related health inequalities. The empirical application using Australian longitudinal data highlights that neglecting risk underestimates income-related health inequalities since the poor were not only expected to be in worse health in the future, but also faced greater dispersion in their future health prospects compared to the rich.
I10|The kids are alright - labour market effects of unexpected parental hospitalisations in the Netherlands|Unexpected negative health shocks may have serious consequences for labour force participation, not only for those who incur the shock but also for their family members. In particular, adult children may spend substantial time providing informal care and may incur stress-induced mental health problems following a parental health shock, which may in turn lead to reductions in labour supply. We link administrative data on labour market outcomes, hospitalisations and family relations for the full Dutch population for the years 1999-2008 to evaluate the effect of an unexpected parental hospitalisation on the probability of employment and on conditional earnings for the working age population. Using a difference-in-differences model combined with coarsened exact matching and individual fixed effects, we find no effect of an unexpected parental hospitalisation on either the probability of employment or conditional earnings for Dutch men and women, and neither for the full population nor for subpopulations most likely to become a caregiver. These findings suggest that the extensive public coverage of formal long-term care in the Netherlands provides sufficient opportunities to deal with adverse health events of family members without having to compromise one’s labour supply.
I10|Health effects of caring for and about parents and spouses|Informal caregiving is a potentially attractive alternative to formal care but may entail health costs for the caregiver. We examine the mental and physical health impact of providing informal care and disentangle the caregiving effect – the effect of caring for someone in need – from the family effect – the effect of caring about someone in need. We account for potential endogeneity in the caregiving decision and control for previous health status using Arellano-Bond difference GMM models. We use four waves (2010-2013) of panel data from the Dutch Study on Transitions in Employment, Ability and Motivation (STREAM). We find that caregiving harms the mental health of caregivers; this effect is mainly present for spousal caregivers. A negative health shock of a family member also has a direct negative effect on mental health, providing evidence of a family effect. These findings imply that most studies may have overestimated the negative health effects of caregiving by not accounting adequately for the family effect. As the caregiving effect differs strongly between various types of caregivers, policies to counteract this effect should specifically target subgroups of caregivers that carry the largest burden of informal caregiving.
I10|Better off at home? Effects of a nursing home admission on costs, hospitalizations and survival|Aging-in-place policies substitute home care for nursing home admissions (NHA). They appear to be a win-win by keeping public spending in check and being in line with personal preferences, but have hitherto not been evaluated. We study the impact of NHA eligibility using Dutch administrative data and exploiting variation between randomly assigned assessors in their tendency to grant admission. The impact on mortality is zero, but with considerable effect heterogeneity. Moreover, aging-in-place policies come at the cost of increased curative care, especially hospital admissions, and do not reduce total healthcare spending, suggesting they may not be a win-win after all.
I10|Learning from failure in healthcare: Dynamic panel evidence of a physician shock effect|Procedural failures of physicians or teams in interventional healthcare may positively or negatively predict subsequent patient outcomes. We identify this effect by applying (non-)linear dynamic panel methods to data from the Belgian Transcatheter Aorta Valve Implantation (TAVI) registry containing information on the first 860 TAVI procedures in Belgium. We find that a previous death of a patient positively and significantly predicts subsequent survival of the succeeding patient. We find that these learning from failure effects are not long-lived and that learning from failure is transmitted across adverse events.
I10|Inference with difference-in-differences with a small number of groups: a review, simulation study and empirical application using SHARE data|Difference-in-differences (DID) estimation has become increasingly popular as an approach to evaluate the effect of a group-level policy on individual-level outcomes. Several statistical methodologies have been proposed to correct for the within-group correlation of model errors resulting from the clustering of data. Little is known about how well these corrections perform with the often small number of groups observed in health research using longitudinal data. First, we review the most commonly used modelling solutions in DID estimation for panel data, including generalized estimating equations (GEE), permutation tests, clustered standard errors (CSE), wild cluster bootstrapping, and aggregation. Second, we compare the empirical coverage rates and power of these methods using a Monte Carlo simulation study in scenarios in which we vary the degree of error correlation, the group size balance, and the proportion of treated groups. Third, we provide an empirical example using the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). When the number of groups is small, CSE are systematically biased downwards in scenarios when data are unbalanced or when there is a low proportion of treated groups. This can result in over-rejection of the null even when data are composed of up to 50 groups. Aggregation, permutation tests, bias-adjusted GEE and wild cluster bootstrap produce coverage rates close to the nominal rate for almost all scenarios, though GEE may suffer from low power. In DID estimation with a small number of groups, analysis using aggregation, permutation tests, wild cluster bootstrap, or bias-adjusted GEE is recommended.
I10|Inequidad en el acceso a los servicios de salud en Uruguay|En el año 2007 Uruguay comenzó una reforma del sector salud tendiente a la construcción de un Sistema Nacional Integrado de Salud, basado en un seguro público con provisión privada y pública, con el objetivo, entre otros, de universalizar el acceso a los servicios de salud. A partir de la primera Encuesta Nacional de Salud, realizada en 2014 en Uruguay, analizamos la inequidad horizontal en la utilización y el acceso a servicios médicos de la población de 18 años y más, y para diferentes subgrupos. Los resultados muestran inequidad horizontal a favor de las personas de mayor nivel socioeconómico en la realización de consultas médicas, uso de medicamentos y falta de acceso por motivos de costos. De la descomposición de los Índices de Concentración se destaca que el tipo de cobertura es de las variables que más impacta sobre la desigualdad, encontrando que la cobertura privada tiende a aumentarla y la pública a disminuirla. Finalmente, otro aspecto a destacar es que se encuentra inequidad para algunos estudios preventivos, como la realización del PAP en las mujeres y del examen de próstata en los hombres, estando concentrados este tipo de estudios entre los de mayor nivel socioeconómico.
I10|Le caratteristiche imprenditoriali delle farmacie di comunitÃ : unâ€™indagine esplorativa|In the last ten years, community pharmacies have undergone relevant normative interventions which have led from one side, to an increase in the number of competitors for dispensing activities, and from the other, to a pharmacistsâ€™ eventual role in the implementation of new care services. Faced with a transforming scenario, community pharmacists are expected to develop managerial and professional competences in order to respond to environmental challenges and safeguard both their profitability and their ability to fulfil the goals posed by the national health and pharmaceutical policies. The present study seeks to investigate to what extent community pharmacists perceive environmental turbulence and to what extent they believe to possesses entrepreneurial and managerial orientation, and self-efficacy, to build their pharmaciesâ€™ competitive advantage. A survey was prepared and a questionnaire have been sent to the pharmacists belonging to the provincial Association of Young Pharmacists of Agrigento, Italy. The results of the exploratory analysis are discussed along the paper in the light of the major changes community pharmacies are currently experiencing.
I10|La mortalité selon le revenu: estimation à partir de données européennes|Nous estimons la relation entre mortalité et revenu pour plusieurs pays européens dont la France. A partir d’une méthode de régression pondérée, l’espérance de vie par classe de revenu est dérivée de l’espérance de vie observée pour différents niveaux d’éducation. Nous distinguons plusieurs cohortes selon le sexe. Les résultats montrent que le différentiel de mortalité selon le revenu est plus important chez les hommes que chez les femmes et qu’il tend à augmenter légèrement avec l’âge. De fortes disparités entre pays sont cependant observées avec des inégalités faibles dans les pays nordiques et plus fortes dans les pays de l’Est. La France présente un différentiel de mortalité selon le revenu plutôt faible comparé aux autres pays de l’échantillon.
I10|Health Shocks, Human Capital, and Labor Market Outcomes|Health, human capital, and labor market outcomes are linked through complex connections that are not fully understood. We explore these links by estimating a flexible yet tractable dynamic model of human capital accumulation in the presence of health shocks using administrative data from Chile. We find that (i) human capital mitigates the negative labor market effects of health events, (ii) these alleviating effects operate through channels involving occupational choice, the frequency of exposure to health events, and access to health care, and (iii) the effect of health shocks on labor market outcomes is heterogeneous across industries and types of diagnoses.
I10|Social capital as disease prevention|Increasing demand for healthcare in developed countries raises concerns about the sustainability of spending on healthcare. Building on epidemiological, medical, economic, sociological and psychological research, I argue that a well-being and social capital crisis largely explains rising healthcare demand. There is compelling evidence that increasing dissatisfaction has caused an increase in morbidity and mortality rates in the US. A main policy recommendation is to tackle declining connections and the spread of social isolation in order to increase well-being and health. I review literature suggesting three domains where policies for social capital can be implemented: urban planning, schooling and regulation of advertising. Moreover, a crisis of trust between physicians and patients underlies the increasing phenomenon of defensive medicine that weighs substantially on healthcare spending. Policies aimed at tackling defensive medicine are discussed
I10|Human development thresholds for inclusive mobile banking in developing countries|This study assesses human development thresholds at which mobile banking mitigates poverty and inequality in 93 developing countries for the year 2011. Mobile banking entails: ‘mobile used to pay bills’ and ‘mobile used to receive/send money’, while the modifying policy indicator is the human development index (HDI). The empirical evidence is based on interactive quantile regressions. A summary of the findings shows that with increasing human development: (i) ‘mobiles used to pay bills’ contribute to reducing inequality in countries at the bottom and top ends of the inequality distribution, while (ii) ‘mobiles used to receive/send money’ have an appealing role in promoting inclusive development in all poverty distributions, with the exception of the top-end or 90th decile. The modifying thresholds of the HDI vary from 0.542 to 0.632 and 0.333 to 0.705 in inequality and poverty specifications, respectively. The relevance of the findings is discussed in light of the current transition from Millennium Development Goals to Sustainable Development Goals.
I10|Basic formal education quality, information technology, and inclusive human development in sub‐Saharan Africa|This study assesses the role played by basic formal education on the impact of information technology on inclusive human development in sub‐Saharan African countries during the period 2000–2012. The study aims to answer one critical question: What is the relevance of basic formal education in the effect of mobile phone penetration on inclusive human development in sub‐Saharan Africa when initial levels of inclusive human development are taken into account? The empirical evidence is based on instrumental quantile regressions. The findings of this study show that poor primary education dampens the positive effect of mobile phone penetration on inclusive human development. This finding should be understood from the perspective that the education quality indicator represents a policy syndrome because of the way it is computed, notably, the ratio of pupils to teachers. Hence, an increasing ratio indicates decreasing quality of education. It follows that decreasing quality of education dampens the positive effect of mobile phone on inclusive development. This tendency is consistent throughout the conditional distribution of inclusive sustainable human development. Policy implications are discussed.
I10|How enhancing information and communication technology has affected inequality in Africa for sustainable development: An empirical investigation|This study examines if enhancing information and communication technology reduces inequality in 48 countries in Africa for the periods 2004–2014. Three inequality indictors are used, namely, the Gini coefficient, Atkinson index, and Palma ratio. The adopted information and communication technology indicators include mobile phone penetration, internet penetration, and fixed broadband subscriptions. The empirical evidence is based on the generalised method of moments. Enhancing internet penetration and fixed broadband subscriptions has a net effect on reducing the Gini coefficient and the Atkinson index, whereas increasing mobile phone penetration and internet penetration reduces the Palma ratio. Policy implications are discussed in the light of challenges to Sustainable Development Goals.
I10|Security Transitions|How do foreign powers disengage from a conflict? We study the recent largescale security transition from international troops to local forces in the context of the ongoing civil conflict in Afghanistan. We construct a new dataset that combines information on this transition process with declassified conflict outcomes and previously unreleased quarterly survey data. Our empirical design leverages the staggered roll-out of the transition onset, together with a novel instrumental variables approach to estimate the impact of the two-phase security transition. We find that the initial security transfer to Afghan forces is marked by a significant, sharp and timely decline in insurgent violence. This effect reverses with the actual physical withdrawal of foreign troops. We argue that this pattern is consistent with a signaling model, in which the insurgents reduce violence strategically to facilitate the foreign military withdrawal. Our findings clarify the destabilizing consequences of withdrawal in one of the costliest conflicts in modern history and yield potentially actionable insights for designing future security transitions.
I10|Who voted for Brexit? Individual and regional data combined|Previous analyses of the 2016 Brexit referendum used region-level data or small samples based on polling data. The former might be subject to ecological fallacy and the latter might suffer from small-sample bias. We use individual-level data on thousands of respondents in Understanding Society, the UK's largest household survey, which includes the EU referendum question. We find that voting Leave is associated with older age, white ethnicity, low educational attainment, infrequent use of smartphones and the internet, receiving benefits, adverse health and low life satisfaction. These results coincide with corresponding patterns at the aggregate level of voting areas. We therefore do not find evidence of ecological fallacy. In addition, we show that prediction accuracy is geographically heterogeneous across UK regions, with strongly pro-Leave and strongly pro-Remain areas easier to predict. We also show that among individuals with similar socio-economic characteristics, Labour supporters are more likely to support Remain while Conservative supporters are more likely to support Leave.
I10|The effect of health shocks on financial risk preferences differs by personality traits|We investigate whether personality traits influence the impact of health shocks on financial risk preferences using 11 waves (1998-2008) from the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We model stock market participation and the share of risky assets in portfolios and stratify our sample into single person households and couples. Our results indicate that personality traits play a more important role in the portfolio choices for couples than for single people. Moreover, there are differences between women and men within couples, and between chronic and acute health shocks.
I10|Uncontrolled diabetes and health care utilisation: a bivariate Latent Markov model approach|While uncontrolled diabetes (UD) or poor glycaemic control is a widespread condition with potentially life-threatening consequences, there is sparse evidence of its effects on health care utilisation. We model the propensities to consume health care and UD by employing an innovative bivariate Latent Markov model which allows for dynamic unobserved heterogeneity, movements between latent states and the endogeneity of UD. We estimate the effects of UD on primary and secondary health care consumption using a panel dataset of rich administrative records from Spain and measure UD using a biomarker. We find that UD does not have a statistically significant effect on health care use. Furthermore, individuals appear to move across latent classes and increase their propensities to poor glycaemic control and health care use over time. Our results suggest that by ignoring time-varying unobserved heterogeneity and the endogeneity of UD, the effects of UD on health care utilisation might be overestimated and this could lead to biased findings. Our approach reveals heterogeneity in behaviour beyond standard groupings of frequent versus infrequent users of health care services. We argue that this dynamic latent Markov approach could be used more widely to model the determinants of health care use.
I10|Hyperbolic discounting can be good for your health|It has been argued that hyperbolic discounting of future gains and losses leads to time-inconsistent behavior and thereby, in the context of health economics, not enough investment in health and too much indulgence of unhealthy consumption. Here, we challenge this view. We set up a life-cycle model of human aging and longevity in which individuals discount the future hyperbolically and make time-consistent decisions. This allows us to disentangle the role of discounting from the time consistency issue. We show that hyperbolically discounting individuals, under a reasonable normalization, invest more in their health than they would if they had a constant rate of time preference. Using a calibrated life-cycle model of human aging, we predict that the average U.S. American lives about 4 years longer with hyperbolic discounting than he would if he had applied a constant discount rate. The reason is that, under hyperbolic discounting, experiences in old age receive a relatively high weight in life time utility. In an extension we show that the introduction of health-dependent survival probability motivates an increasing discount rate for the elderly and, in the aggregate, a u-shaped pattern of the discount rate with respect to age.
I10|An economic theory of depression and its impact on health behavior and longevity|In this paper, I propose an economic theory of depression and its impact on health behavior and longevity. Based on studies from happiness research, depression is conceptualized as a drastic loss of utility and value of life for unchanged fundamentals. The model is used to explain how untreated depression leads to unhealthy behavior and adverse health outcomes: depressed individuals are predicted to save less, invest less in their health, consume more unhealthy goods, and exercise less. As a result, they age faster and die earlier than non-depressed individuals. I calibrate the model for an average American and discus how depression enlarges the socioeconomic gradient of health and consider feedback effects of depression on earnings and of physical exercise on depression as well as a variety of depression shocks. Delays in treatment for depression in young adulthood are predicted to have significant repercussions on late-life health outcomes and longevity.
I10|How season of birth affects health and aging|We investigate how the season of birth affects human health and aging. For this purpose, we use five waves of the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) dataset and construct a health deficit index for 21 European countries. Results from log-linear regressions suggest that, on average, elderly European men age faster when they were born in spring and summer (compared to autumn). At given age, they have developed about 3.5 percent more health deficits. The bulk of the season effect is neither mediated through body height nor through education. In a subsample of Southern European countries, where the seasonal variation of sunlight is smaller, the season of birth plays an insignificant role for health in old age. In a subsample of Northern countries, in contrast, the season or birth effect gets larger. At given age, elderly Northern European men born in spring have developed on average 8.7 percent more health deficits than those born in autumn. In non-linear regression we find that the season effect increases with age suggesting that the speed of aging is also influenced by the season of birth.
I10|Illicit drugs and the decline of the middle class|Empirical evidence for the U.S. suggests that the consumption of intoxicants increases in association with the socio-economic deprivation of the middle-class. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we set up a task-based labor market model with endogenous mental health status and a health care system. The decline of tasks that were historically performed by the middle class and the associated decline in relative wages and socio-economic status increases the share of mentally ill middle class workers. Mentally ill workers can mitigate their hardships by the intake of illicit drugs or by consuming health goods. We argue that explaining the drug epidemic of the U.S. middle class requires an interaction of socio-economic decline and falling opioid prices. One factor in isolation is typically insufficient. Our analysis also points to a central role of the health care system. In our model, extending mental health care could motivate the mentally ill to abstain from illicit drug consumption.
I10|Long-run improvements in human health: Steady but unequal|There exists a steady trend at which later born cohorts, at the same age, are healthier than earlier born cohorts. We show this trend by computing a health deficit index for a panel of 14 European Countries and six waves of the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). We find that for each year of later birth, health deficits decline by on average 1.4 - 1.5 percent with insignificant differences between men and women, between countries, and over time. We argue that this trend approximates the rate of medical progress, broadly defined. The steady progress implies substantial delays of human aging. For example, the level of health deficits experienced at age 65 by individuals born 1920 is predicted to be experienced at age 85 by individuals born 1945. The potential health gains are not fully appropriated by individuals of low socio-economic status. Their health deficits decline at about the same rate but from a higher level, which means that we find long-run persistence of health inequality.
I10|From pain patient to junkie: An economic theory of painkiller consumption and its impact on wellbeing and longevity|In this paper, I propose a life cycle model of painkiller consumption that combines the theory of health deficit accumulation with the theory of addiction. Chronic pain is conceptualized as a persistent negative shock to lifetime utility that can be treated by pain relief medication. Individuals treated with opioid pain relievers (OPR) develop addiction, which increases their demand for opioids and reduces their welfare and life expectancy through side effects and potential overdose. I calibrate the model for a benchmark American and investigate the comparative dynamics of alternative drug characteristics, pain intensities, and ages of onsets of pain and their implications for welfare and life expectancy. Computational experiments are used to identify fully rational and imperfectly rational addiction behavior. Fully rational addicts quickly quit OPR use when new information about their addictive potential arrives. Imperfectly rational addicts further develop their addiction and switch to illicit opioid use. Likewise, a discontinued prescription helps fully rational addicts to quit quickly while it induces imperfectly rational individuals to take up heroin. I also discuss treatment of OPR addiction and the use of opioids in palliative care.
I10|I shouldn't eat this donut: Self-control, body weight, and health in a life cycle model|In this paper I discuss overweight and obesity and their repercussions on health deficit accumulation and longevity in a life cycle model. Individual decisions are conceptualized as the partial control of impulsive desires of a short-run self (the limbic system) by a rationally forward-looking long-run self (the prefrontal cortex). The short-run self-strives for immediate gratification through consumption of food and other goods. The long-run self reflects the consequences of eating behavior on weight gain and health, exercises to lose weight, invests money to improve health and saves for health expenditure in old age. Not conceding to short-run desires, however, entails an idiosyncratic utility cost of self-control. The model is calibrated to match food expenditure, exercise, and other choices of an average U.S. American. The results suggest that imperfect self-control reduces average lifetime by up to five years. I use the model to analyze the role of self-control, income, food prices, energy density, and medical progress in explaining obesity and to develop a test on whether obesity is driven by excessive desire for food or lack of self-control.
I10|How much Priority Bonus Should be Given to Registered Donors? An Experimental Analysis|Giving registered organ donors priority on organ waiting list can substantially increase the number of donors and save lifes. Evidence for these effects comes from recent experiments that implemented such priority rules in abstract laboratory environments. In these experiments, participants who registered as organ donors were fully prioritized over those who did not. In the field, however, registering as a donor is only one factor affecting the recipient’s score. In this paper, we provide a comparative statics analysis of the priority treatment by varying the number of bonus periods that a registered person can skip on the waiting list. We find that behavior is monotonic: giving more priority to registered donors leads to higher registration rates. Our results also indicate that a medium sized bonus improves registration rates as much as absolute priority (used in the previous literature).
I10|Immigration and the Reallocation of Work Health Risks|This paper studies the effects of immigration on the allocation of occupational physical burden and work health risks. Using data for England and Wales from the Labour Force Survey, we find that, on average, immigration leads to a reallocation of UK-born workers towards jobs characterized by lower physical intensity and injury risk. The results also show important differences across skill groups. Immigration reduces the average physical burden of UK-born workers with medium levels of education, but has no significant effect on those with low levels.
I10|Self-Employment Can Be Good for Your Health|Drawing upon theoretical insights from the Job Demand-Control model, which links occupational characteristics to health, this paper provides the first causal evidence of the physical and mental health consequences of self-employment. Specifically, I utilize German longitudinal data for the period 2002-2014 and difference-in-differences estimations and find that both switches from unemployment to self-employment (necessity entrepreneurship) and transitions from regular employment to self-employment (opportunity entrepreneurship) lead to health enhancements for entrepreneurs with and without employees. Specifically, necessity entrepreneurs experience improvements in mental but not physical health, while opportunity entrepreneurship is associated with both physical and mental health gains, which is in line with the theoretical predictions. Importantly, the health improvements cannot be explained by changes in income or working conditions and are not driven by personality and risk preferences or the local unemployment conditions. The results have implications for entrepreneurship theory and practice, current and would-be entrepreneurs as well as policy-makers.
I10|Can heterogeneity in reporting behavior explain the gender gap in self-assessed health status?|This paper explains the gender differences in self-assessed health status by providing a theoretical identification mechanism through a dynamic structural model which allows for heterogeneity in discount factors of individuals. Theoretical predictions are empirically tested and estimation results support the structural model implications. The authors conclude that accounting for heterogeneity in individual discount factors explains a significant portion of the gender gap in self-assessed health status.
I10|Cognition, Optimism and the Formation of Age-Dependent Survival Beliefs|[English] This paper investigates the roles psychological biases play in deviations between subjective survival beliefs (SSBs) and objective survival probabilities (OSPs). We model deviations between SSBs and OSPs through age-dependent inverse S-shaped probability weighting functions. Our estimates suggest that implied measures for cognitive weakness and relative pessimism increase with age. We document that direct measures of cognitive weakness and motivational attitudes share these trends. Our regression analyses confirm that these factors play strong quantitative roles in the formation of subjective survival beliefs: cognitive weakness rather than optimism is an increasingly important contributor to overestimation of survival chances in old age. [German] Diese Arbeit ist motiviert durch die klassische Ã¶konomische Frage, wie Entscheidungen Ã¼ber den Lebenszyklus von zeitlichen PrÃ¤ferenzen und dem Zeithorizont der Individuen beeinflusst werden. Insbesondere fokussieren wir darauf, wie Individuen ihre Ãœberlebenserwartungen bilden. Zufolge zahlreicher empirischer Studien unterschÃ¤tzen junge Menschen ihre Ãœberlebenschancen, wohingegen Ã¤ltere Menschen diese durchschnittlich Ã¼berschÃ¤tzen. Was ist die treibende Kraft hinter diesem altersabhÃ¤ngigen Muster der FehleinschÃ¤tzungen der ferneren Lebenserwartungen? Gibt es womÃ¶glich Effekte, die Ã¼ber einen Lern- und Erfahrungsprozess Ã¼ber Gesundheitsrisiken und -historien hinaus die EinschÃ¤tzung von Individuen hinsichtlich dieses Risikos beeinflussen? Dieses Paper erÃ¶rtert, dass psychologische Faktoren von entscheidender Bedeutung zur Beantwortung dieser Frage sind. Wir vergleichen subjektive Ãœberlebenserwartungen aus einer Haushaltsbefragung mit den dazu korrespondierenden objektiven Ãœberlebenswahrscheinlichkeiten, die wir basierend auf individuellen Charakteristika schÃ¤tzen (z.B. Alter, Geschlecht, Gesundheitshistorie). Wir dokumentieren, dass typische Verzerrungen auftreten: Bis zu einem Alter von 70 Jahren unterschÃ¤tzen Individuen ihre objektiven Ãœberlebenschancen, ab diesem Alter Ã¼berschÃ¤tzen sie diese. Um zu zeigen, dass psychologische Einstellungen wichtige Determinanten dieser Abweichungen zwischen subjektiven Ãœberlebenserwartungen und objektiven Ãœberlebenswahrscheinlichkeiten sind, schÃ¤tzen wir implizite psychologische Faktoren aus den beobachteten Differenzen. Wir zeigen, dass das implizite MaÃŸ sowohl an gemessenem Pessimismus, als auch an InsensitivitÃ¤t zur objektiven Wahrscheinlichkeit, mit dem Alter steigt. Diese Ergebnisse legen also nahe, dass Individuen im Durchschnitt im Alter pessimistischer werden und dass die FÃ¤higkeit, objektive Wahrscheinlichkeiten richtig einzuschÃ¤tzen, abnimmt. Daraufhin zeigen wir, dass direkte Messungen dieser psychologischen Faktoren diese Trends teilen: Daten Indices zu Pessimismus steigen, zu Optimismus sinken mit dem Alter und ein Index Ã¼ber kognitive SchwÃ¤che steigt ebenfalls mit dem Alter. Schlussendlich zeigen wir, dass diese direkten psychologischen MaÃŸe tatsÃ¤chlich wichtige quantitative Rollen in der Bildung subjektiver Ãœberlebenserwartungen spielen. Pessimismus fÃ¼hrt zu einer signifikanten UnterschÃ¤tzung, Optimismus zu einer ÃœberschÃ¤tzung von Ãœberlebenschancen und eine fehlende Kognition spielt eine zunehmend wichtige Rolle fÃ¼r die beobachtete ÃœberschÃ¤tzung der Ãœberlebenschancen, wenn Individuen Ã¤lter werden. Dieser Effekt dominiert, weshalb Ã¤ltere Menschen ihre Ãœberlebenserwartungen mehr und mehr Ã¼berschÃ¤tzen. Wir schlieÃŸen unsere Analyse mit einem Ausblick, der argumentiert, dass die treibenden KrÃ¤fte fÃ¼r Verzerrungen in WahrscheinlichkeitseinschÃ¤tzungen auf Ã¶konomische Entscheidungen im Allgemeinen nur mithilfe struktureller Lebenszyklusmodells studiert werden kÃ¶nnen, welches Wissenschaftlern ermÃ¶glicht, simultan multiple Risiken und die Beeinflussung der Erwartungsbildung Ã¼ber diese Risiken durch psychologische Faktoren zu berÃ¼cksichtigen.
I10|The Effect of Religiosity on Adolescent Risky Behaviors|We investigate the relationship between religiosity and risky behaviors in adolescence using data from a large and detailed cohort study of 14 year olds who have been followed for seven years. We focus on the effect of the self-reported importance of religion and on the risk of youths having early sexual intercourse, drinking underage, trying cigarettes, trying cannabis, and being involved in fighting at ages 14–17. We use school and individual fixed effects, and we control for a rich set of adolescent, school, and family characteristics, including achievements in standardized test scores at age 11, parental employment, and marital status. We also control for information on personality traits, such as work ethic, self-esteem, and external locus of control. Our results show that individuals with low religiosity are more likely to engage in risky health behaviors, whatever their combination of personality traits. These effects are robust to separate estimations for boys and girls and to the control variables used. Moreover, the results are essentially unchanged when we use Inverse Probability Weighted Regression Adjustment estimation methods – which provide causal estimates conditional on selection on observables only.
I10|Womb at work: the missing impact of maternal employment on newborn health|Parental leave policies across the globe have become much more generous than they used to be. This is also true for prenatal maternal leave. While this may be costly in the short run, little is known about the effect of maternal employment during pregnancy on newborn health. In this paper, I exploit three sharp policy changes on the duration of paid parental leave in Austria that strongly affected the share of mothers who work up to the 32nd week of pregnancy. I use administrative data from Austria on the working history of women linked to the full Austrian birth register and coupled with a regression discontinuity framework to identify the effect of prenatal employment on their offspring. Maternal employment during pregnancy with the second child reacts strongly to these policy changes. The share of employed mothers sharply declined in 1990 by 19.1 percentage points, increased in 1996 by 7.2 percentage points and declined again by 6.4 percentage points in 2000. None of these changes in prenatal employment translated into effects on newborn health measured via birth weight, gestational length, and Apgar scores. This result holds true for mothers of different socioeconomic backgrounds and across industries. The effect is precisely estimated, which suggests that prenatal employment prior to the 32nd week of pregnancy does not causally affect the fetus for measures visible at birth.
I10|Obesity inequality and the changing shape of the bodyweight distribution in China|Using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), this study analyses changes in bodyweight (BMI and waist circumference) distributions between 1991 and 2011 among adults aged 20+ in China. To do so, we quantify the source and extent of temporal changes in bodyweight and then decompose the increase in obesity prevalence into two components: a rightward shift of the bodyweight distribution (mean growth) and a (re)distributional skewing. Our analysis reveals a clear rightward distributional shift combined with a leftward skewing. Although the relatively large size of this skewing in the first decade analysed reflects an increase in obesity inequality, this inequality growth subsides in the second decade. Nevertheless, over the entire 20-year period, obesity inequality increases significantly, especially among females, younger age groups, rural residents and individuals with low socioeconomic status.
I10|Improving childcare quality at scale: the effects of “From Zero to Forever”|The focus in developing countries has shifted from increasing access to early childhood education to improving its quality. However, large scale studies of childcare quality improvement are scarce. In this paper we study the immediate and medium-term effects of a large-scale expansion of integrated early education services on child development, by analyzing the expansion of the Colombian national early childhood strategy known as “From Zero to Forever” between 2011 and 2013. The results indicate that the increased access to enhanced early education had a large immediate effect on language that still persists five years into the intervention.
I10|Early Stimulation and Nutrition: The Impacts of a Scalable Intervention|This paper evaluates the effects of the implementation of a structured early stimulation curriculum combined with a nutritional intervention through public large-scale parenting support services for vulnerable families in rural Colombia, known as FAMI, using a clustered randomized controlled trial. We randomly assigned 87 towns in rural areas to treatment and control and 1,460 children younger than 1 year of age were assessed at baseline. The interventions were also complemented with training, supervision and coaching of FAMI program facilitators. We assessed program effects on children’s nutritional status, and on cognitive and socio-emotional development; as well as on parental practices. The interventions had a positive and significant effect on a cognitive development factor based on the Bayley-III of 0.15 standard deviations. We also report a reduction of 5.8 percentage points in the fraction of children whose height-for-age is below -1 standard deviation. We do not find any effects on socio-emotional development. We report positive and statistically significant effects on the quality of the home environment (0.34 SD).
I10|Center-Based Care for Infants and Toddlers: The aeioTU Randomized Trial|Extensive research has shown comprehensive early intervention can improve the developmental outcomes of disadvantaged children. However, little is known about the effectiveness of center-based programs for infants and toddlers; relatively rare in the developing world and typically of low quality. This paper reports effects from a randomized trial of a center-based early care intervention on infants and toddlers in two communities in northern Colombia. Just eight months into the program results indicate large positive effects on language, cognitive development and overall development, with girls benefitting the most. No effects were observed for nutritional outcomes, socio-emotional development or the home environment.
I10|Clusters Of International Eq-5d Health-States Valuations|PURPOSE: Countries without EQ-5D general-population surveys might use valuations from another country with similar health valuations. This study aimed to identify whether there are groups of countries with similar health-state valuations. METHODS: A cluster analysis was performed for the 242 states of the EQ-5D valuations for 23 studies in 18 countries, excluding the perfect-health state. Clusters were identified by means of the Ward algorithm with the Euclidean measure and hierarchical clustering. RESULTS: 5 clusters were identified. Valuations are sensitive to the preference elicitation methodology. Some countries in the same cluster have cultural similarities but a particular cluster included otherwise dissimilar countries and methodologies. Using the states associated to diabetes and breast cancer, the choice of cluster is shown to be relevant for cost-utility analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Health-state valuations tend to be clustered in a few groups of countries. The clusters found might be useful for performing cost-utility analysis in countries without such valuations.
I10|What's Behind Her Smile? Looks, Self-Esteem, and Labor Market Outcomes|We explore how improving dental health affects economic, social, and psychological outcomes. Using a randomized intervention whereby an impoverished group in Chile received free dental care, including access to prostheses, we find that the treatment in the short-run: (i) significantly improved dental health of both men and women, (ii) had a significant and positive effect on women’s self- esteem, and (iii) positively impacted both employment rates and earnings among women. In the medium run, the effects on dental health and self-esteem persist but the treatment effects on labor market outcomes become statistically non significant, although still economically relevant among women with low levels of self esteem and among women missing at least one front tooth at baseline. We also find treatment effects on spending on appearance-related items, and improvements in the quality of relationships with partners including a reduction in verbal violence. The employment effects come mostly from the informal sector. Using several pieces of evidence, we document that the employment effects are consistent with a combination of increases in productivity and labor supply jointly with a possibly much smaller response of labor demand in the formal sector.
I10|Are substitute services a barrier to controlling long-term care expenditures?|In many developed countries long-term care expenditures are a major source of concern, which has urged policy makers to cost reductions. However, long-term care financing is highly fragmented in most countries and hence reducing total costs is complicated: spending reductions in one type of care may have spillover effects elsewhere in the system. These spillovers may be substantial, as we show using a reform in the financing of one type of publicly financed home care in the Netherlands, domestic help. We show that this reform not only affected consumption of this care type, but also the consumption of three other types of long-term care that are financed through another public scheme.
I10|Temperature, Climate Change, and Mental Health: Evidence from the Spectrum of Mental Health Outcomes|This paper characterizes the link between ambient temperatures and a broad set of mental health measures. We find that the realization of low temperatures leads to fewer self-reported days of poor mental health, fewer mental-health related emergency department visits, and fewer suicides. Conversely, exposure to more hot days is associated with more days of self-reported poor mental health, more mental health-related emergency department visits, and higher rates of suicide. We consider the efficacy of a number of potential mitigating factors including access to mental health services and residential penetration of air conditioning, among others. We find that the identified relationship is insensitive to all considered modulating factors and has not moderated over time, suggesting a lack of effective adaptation. We offer evidence for sleep quality as the mechanism by which temperatures impact mental health and discuss the implications of our findings in light of climate change.
I10|Wealth shocks and health outcomes: evidence from stock market fluctuations|Do wealth shocks affect the health of the elderly in developed countries? The economic literature is skeptical about such effects which have so far only been found for poor retirees in poor countries. In this paper I show that wealth shocks also matter for the health of wealthy retirees in the US. I exploit the booms and busts in the US stock market as a natural experiment that generated considerable gains and losses in the wealth of stock-holding retirees. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study I construct wealth shocks as the interaction of stock holdings with stock market changes. These constructed wealth shocks are highly predictive of changes in reported wealth. And they strongly affect health outcomes. A 10% wealth shock leads to an improvement of 2-3% of a standard deviation in physical health, mental health and survival rates. Effects are heterogeneous across physical health conditions, with most pronounced effects for the incidence of high blood pressure, smaller effects for heart problems and no effects for arthritis, diabetes, lung diseases and cancer. The comparison with the cross-sectional relationship of wealth and health suggests that the estimated effects of wealth shocks are larger than the long-run wealth elasticity of health.
I10|The Lasting Legacy of Seasonal Influenza: In-Utero Exposure and Labor Market Outcomes|Pregnancy conditions have been shown to matter for later economic success, but many threats to fetal development that have been identified are difficult to prevent. In this paper I study seasonal influenza, a preventable illness that comes around every year and causes strong inflammatory responses in pregnant women. Using administrative data from Denmark, I identify the effects of maternal influenza on the exposed offspring via sibling comparison, exploiting both society-wide influenza spread and information on individual mothers who suffer strong infections during pregnancy. In the short term, maternal influenza leads to a doubling of prematurity and low birth weight, by triggering premature labor among women infected in the third trimester. Following exposed offspring into young adulthood, I observe a 9% earnings reduction and a 35% increase in welfare dependence. These long-term effects are strongest for influenza infections during the second trimester and they are partly explained by a decline in educational attainment, pointing to cognitive impairment. This effect pattern suggests that maternal influenza damages the fetus through multiple mechanisms, and much of the damage may not be visible at birth. Taken together, these results provide evidence that strong infections during pregnancy are an often overlooked prenatal threat with long-term consequences.
I10|Feeling useless: the effect of unemployment on mental health in the Great Recession|Abstract This article documents a strong connection between unemployment and mental distress using data from the Spanish National Health Survey. We exploit the collapse of the construction sector to identify the causal effect of job losses in different segments of the Spanish labor market. Our results suggest that an increase of the unemployment rate by 10 percentage points due to the breakdown in construction raised reported poor health and mental disorders in the affected population by 3 percentage points, respectively. We argue that the size of this effect responds to the fact that the construction sector was at the center of the economic recession. As a result, workers exposed to the negative labor demand shock faced very low chances of re-entering employment. We show that this led to long unemployment spells, stress, hopelessness, and feelings of uselessness. These effects point towards a potential channel for unemployment hysteresis.
I10|Fatal Attraction? Extended Unemployment Benefits, Labor Force Exits, and Mortality|We estimate the causal effect of permanent and premature exits from the labor force on mortality. To overcome the problem of negative health selection into early retirement, we exploit a policy change in unemployment insurance rules in Austria that allowed workers in eligible regions to exit the labor force 3 years earlier compared to workers in non-eligible regions. Using administrative data with precise information on mortality and retirement, we find that the policy change induced eligible workers to exit the labor force significantly earlier. Instrumental variable estimation results show that for men retiring one year earlier causes a 6.8% increase in the risk of premature death and 0.2 years reduction in the age at death, but has no significant effect for women.
I10|Women’s care responsibilities, employment and health: a two countries’ tale|TPersistently low employment of women in some countries can still be attributed to a traditional perception of women’s role in society. According to observed data and prevailing social and cultural norms, women have been bearing the primary burdens of housework, childcare and other family responsibilities. The unequal share of these care responsibilities between women and men further worsens the disadvantages of women in balancing public and private life, with an impact on their employment and health outcomes. In this paper we investigate the role of family responsibilities in shaping employment and health outcomes by gender, in Italy and France before and after the economic downturn. We find results supporting the fact that gender differences in the share of responsibilities roles in the public and private sphere influence the employability and health perception of women.
I10|Do Working Hours Affect Health? Evidence from Statutory Workweek Regulations in Germany|This study estimates the causal effect of working hours on health. We deal with the endogeneity of working hours through instrumental variables techniques. In particular, we exploit exogenous variation in working hours from statutory workweek regulations in the German public sector as an instrumental variable. Using panel data, we run two-stage least squares regressions controlling for individual-specific unobserved heterogeneity. We find adverse consequences of increasing working hours on subjective and several objective health measures. The effects are mainly driven by women and parents of minor children who generally face heavier constraints in organizing their workweek.
I10|Herd Behavior in FDA Committees: A Structural Approach|Many important decisions within public and private organizations are based on recommendations from expert committees and advisory boards. A notable example is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's advisory committees, which make recommendations on new drug applications. Previously the voting procedure for these committees was sequential, however, due to concerns of herding and momentum effects the procedure was changed to simultaneous voting. Exploiting a novel dataset of more than ten thousand votes cast by experts in the FDA committees under both sequential and simultaneous voting, we estimate a structural model that allows us to measure the magnitude and importance of informational herding. We show that experts, voting on important scientific questions, are susceptible to herd behavior; on average 46% of the members take into consideration the sequence of previous votes when casting their vote, 17% of these voters actually herd i.e. change their vote from what they would have voted if ignoring the preceding votes.
I10|The Effect of Working Hours on Health|Does working time causally affect workers' health? We study this question in the context of a French reform which reduced the standard workweek from 39 to 35 hours, at constant earnings. Our empirical analysis exploits variation in the adoption of this shorter workweek across employers, which is mainly driven by institutional features of the reform and thus exogenous to workers' health. Difference-in-differences and lagged dependent variable regressions reveal a negative effect of working hours on self-reported health and positive effects on smoking and body mass index, though the latter is imprecisely estimated. Results are robust to accounting for endogenous job mobility and differ by workers' occupations.
I10|Sunlight and Protection Against Influenza|Recent medical literature suggests that vitamin D supplementation protects against acute respiratory tract infection. Humans exposed to sunlight produce vitamin D directly. This paper investigates how differences in sunlight, as measured over several years across states and during the same calendar month, affect influenza incidence. We find that sunlight strongly protects against influenza. This relationship is driven by sunlight in late summer and early fall, when there are sufficient quantities of both sunlight and influenza activity. A 10% increase in relative sunlight decreases the influenza index in September or October by 0.8 points on a 10-point scale. A second, complementary study employs a separate data set to study flu incidence in New York State counties. The results are strongly in accord. Remarkably, the national results are driven almost entirely by the severe H1N1 epidemic in fall 2009. That year the flu epidemic was intense, and it began early, so that September-October sunlight could play a major protective role. We also compare sunlight protection to protection produced by vitamin D supplementation in randomized trials. The sunlight effect was far greater. A plausible explanation is that exposure to sunlight is far broader, and sufficient to provide herd immunity.
I10|Growth, Employment, Poverty and Inequality in Tanzania|This paper shows that in Tanzania, economic growth contributes to job creation and employment opportunities, however, it does very little to curb income inequality. Using official data from various local sources compiled by the National Bureau of Statistics, the paper provides an explanation as to why the creation of wealth and employment opportunities in Tanzania fails to bring the level of poverty to a level roughly comparable to what is found in the region and to reduce inequality between the richer and the poorer segments of society.
I10|Female Economic Participation with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Advancement: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa|This study complements existing literature by investigating how the advancement in information and communication technology affects the formal economic participation of women. The focus is on 48 African countries for the period 1990-2014. The empirical evidence is based on Ordinary Least Squares, Fixed Effects and the Generalized Method of Moments regressions. The results show that improving communication technology increases female economic participation with the following consistent order of increasing magnitude: mobile phone penetration; internet penetration, and fixed broadband subscriptions. The findings are robust to the control for heterogeneities across countries. Policy implications are discussed.
I10|Poverty and development in Tanzania|The paper investigates the relationship between development, as measured by the GNI per capita and lived poverty in Tanzania which is measured on the basis of whether and how often respondents go, in the course of one year, without food, water, medical care, cooking fuel and cash income. By using the data collected by Afrobarometer in Tanzania, we are able to create one set of indicators that capture the extension of lived poverty, that is what percentage of the respondents, experiences deprivation, but we also develop a series of indicators that capture the severity of lived poverty, that is how frequently respondents experience this problem. Our statistical analyses reveal that while Tanzanian progress along the developmental path did not have a significant impact on the extension of lived poverty, it made a large and significant contribution to reduce its severity.
I10|Understanding Sub-Saharan Africaâ€™s Extreme Poverty Tragedy|Motivated by a recent World Bank report on achieving of Millennium Development Goals which shows that poverty has been declining in all regions of the world with the exception of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), this study puts some empirical structure to theoretical and qualitative studies on the reconciliation of the Beijing Model with the Washington Consensus. It tests the hypothesis that compared to middle income countries, low income countries would achieve more inclusive development by focusing on economic governance as opposed to political governance. The empirical evidence is based on interactive and non-interactive fixed effects regressions and 49 countries in SSA for the period 2000-2012. The findings confirm the investigated hypothesis. As the main policy implication, in order to address inclusive development challenges in the post-2015 development agenda in SSA, it would benefit low income countries in the sub-region to prioritise economic governance. Other theoretical and practical contributions are also discussed.
I10|Human development thresholds for inclusive mobile banking in developing countries|This study assesses human development thresholds at which mobile banking mitigates poverty and inequality in 93 developing countries for the year 2011. Mobile banking entails: ‘mobile used to pay bills’ and ‘mobile used to receive/send money’, while the modifying policy indicator is the human development index (HDI). The empirical evidence is based on interactive quantile regressions. A summary of the findings shows that with increasing human development: (i) ‘mobiles used to pay bills’ contribute to reducing inequality in countries at the bottom and top ends of the inequality distribution, while (ii) ‘mobiles used to receive/send money’ have an appealing role in promoting inclusive development in all poverty distributions, with the exception of the top-end or 90th decile. The modifying thresholds of the HDI vary from 0.542 to 0.632 and 0.333 to 0.705 in inequality and poverty specifications, respectively. The relevance of the findings is discussed in light of the current transition from Millennium Development Goals to Sustainable Development Goals.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
I10|Recent finance advances in information technology for inclusive development: a systematic review|Abstract The overarching question tackled in this paper is: to what degree has financial development contributed to providing opportunities of human development for those on low-incomes and by which information technology mechanisms? We systematically review about 180 recently published papers to provide recent information technology advances in finance for inclusive development. Retained financial innovations are structured along three themes. They are: (i) the rural-urban divide, (ii) women empowerment and (iii) human capital in terms of skills and training. The financial instruments are articulated with case studies, innovations and investment strategies with particular emphasis, inter alia on: informal finance, microfinance, mobile banking, crowdfunding, microinsurance, Islamic finance, remittances, Payment for Environmental Services (PES) and the Diaspora Investment in Agriculture (DIA) initiative.

I10|ICT, Financial Access and Gender Inclusion in the Formal Economic Sector: Evidence from Africa|The study investigates the relevance of information and communication technology (ICT) in modulating the effect of financial access on female economic participation. Female economic participation is proxied by female labor force participation, financial access is measured with deposit and credit channels while ICT is proxied by mobile phone penetration, internet penetration and fixed broadband subscriptions. The focus of the study is on 48 African countries for the period 2004-2014 and the empirical evidence is based on Generalized Method of Moments. Policy thresholds are established at which, ICT modulates financial access to induce favourable effects on female economic participation. These policy thresholds are: (i) 160 mobile phone penetration (per 100 people) for the deposit channel and (ii) 2.166 and 0.75 fixed broadband subscriptions per 100 people for respectively, the deposit mechanism and credit channel. Overall the study supports the importance of ICT in moderating financial access for enhanced female economic participation.
I10|Does corporate social responsibility (CSR) impact on development of women in small-scale fisheries of sub-Saharan Africa? Evidence from coastal communities of Niger Delta in Nigeria|While women are often key actors in fisheries, they are commonly excluded from making fisheries management decisions, often due to cultural norms. The objective of this investigation is to assess the impact of a new CSR model of multinational oil companies (MOCs) on development of women in small-scale fisheries in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. A total of eight hundred artisanal fisherwomen were sampled across the coastal communities of Niger Delta. Results from the use of logit model indicate that artisanal fisherwomen have remained widely excluded from the General Memorandum of Understandings (GMoUs) interventions in small-scale fisheries due to cultural norms of the people. This implies that if the cultural norms of the Niger Delta communities continue to restrain direct participation of the artisanal fisherwomen from GMoUsâ€™ intervention, achieving gender equity and cultural change would be limited in the region. The findings suggest that since fisheries, which is the traditional source of livelihood of the people are no longer viable and have significantly declined due to environmental oil degradation, GMoUsâ€™ intervention structure could focus on women playing key roles in fisheries management and conservation decision in Niger Delta region of Nigeria.
I10|Corporate Social Responsibility Initiatives in Nigeria and Rural Women Livestock Keepers in Oil Host Communities|Purpose â€“ The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the multinational oil companiesâ€™ (MOCs) corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in Nigeria. Its special focus is to investigate the impact of the global memorandum of understanding (GMoU) on rural women livestock keepers in the oil producing communities. Design/methodology/approach â€“ This paper employs a quantitative methodology. Data were collected from primary sources using participatory rural appraisal (PRA) technique. The use of participatory research technique in collecting CSR impact data especially as it concerns the small-scale women livestock keeper is based on the fact that it involves the people being studied, and their views on all the issues are paramount. The primary tool used for household survey (collection of the primary data) is a structured questionnaire which is divided into two sections. Section one of the instrument elicited information on the socio-economic characteristics of respondent, while the other section elicited information on the research questions. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data so as to answer the research questions and test the hypothesis. To answer the research questions, descriptive statistics of measurement of central tendency was used, and the results were presented in tables and charts. While in testing the hypothesis, inferential statistical tool-estimation of logit model (of receipt and non-receipt of MOCs CSR through the GMoU by rural women livestock keepers as function of selected socio-economic and domestic empowerment variables) was used. Findings â€“ The findings shows that GMoU model is gender insensitive as rural women rarely have direct access to livestock interventions except through their husband or adult sons; which is attributed to the cultural and traditional context of the people, anchored in beliefs, norms and practices that breed discrimination and gender gap in the rural societies. Research limitations/implications - The structured questionnaire was directly administered by the researchers with the help of local research assistants. The use of local research assistants was because of the inability of the researchers to speak the different local languages and dialects of the many ethnic groups of Ijaws, Ogonis, Ikweres, Etches, Ekpeyes, Ogbas, Engennes, Obolos, Isokos, Nembes, Okirikas, Kalabaris, Urhobos, Iteskiris, Igbos, Ika-Igbos, Ndonis, Orons, Ibenos, Yorubas, Ibibios, Anangs, Efiks, Bekwarras, Binis, Eshans, Etsakos, Owans, Itigidis, Epies, Akokoedos, Yakkurs, etc, in the sampled rural communities. Practical implication â€“ If the rural women do not feel GMoUs efforts to eliminate discrimination and promote equality in the livestock sector, feminized poverty would create a hostile environment for MOCs in the region. Social implication â€“ The livestock development in Nigeria can only succeed if CSR is able to draw on all the resources and talents, and if rural women are able to participate fully in the GMoUs intervention plans and programmes. Originality/value â€“ This research contributes to gender debate in livestock keeping from CSR perspectives in developing countries and rational for demands for social projects by host communities. It concludes that business has an obligation to help in solving problems of public concern, and that CSR priorities in Africa should be aimed towards addressing the peculiarity of the socio-economic development challenges of the country and be informed by socio-cultural influences.
