Q18|Production Risk and Farm Technology Adoption in Rain-Fed, Semi-Arid Lands of Kenya|This study provides empirical evidence on the effects of production risk on farm technology adoption among small holder farmers using plot-level data collected from two semi-arid districts in Kenya, Machakos, and Taita Taveta. We employed a two-stage approach to estimate a production function, and computed the mean and the production risk factors (both variance and skewness) from a production function using Antle’s (1983, 1987) moment-based approach. We then used these moment estimates, together with other household and plot-level characteristics in a pseudo-fixed effect probit model to determine the effects of production risk and farm and household-level variables on households’ decisions to adopt different kinds of farm technologies. In our estimations, by means of Mundlak’s approach (1978), we controlled for unobserved heterogeneities that could potentially be correlated to some of the observed explanatory variables and otherwise bias our estimates. We also addressed the potential endogeneity issues in our estimation using a two-stage IV estimation procedure. Our results showed that, among others, yield variability and the risk of crop failures indeed affect technology adoption decisions in low-income, rain-fed agriculture. But, the direction and magnitude of effects depend on the farm technology under consideration. The results explain why poor farm households in rain-fed and risky production environments are reluctant to adopt new farm technologies with potential production gain because, at the same time, they involve enormous down-side risks. This result underscores the fact that productivity gains are necessary, but not sufficient, conditions to attract farmers to adopt new technologies and agricultural innovations. Risk implications matter. Technology- and location-specific production-risk coping strategies need to be designed to successfully upscale profitable farm technologies across poor farm households in low income countries.
Q18|Mutual Funds and the Income Stabilization Tool in the EU: retrospect and prospects|Higher frequency and intensity of extreme weather events strengthen the need for integrated risk management. EU Regulation No. 1305/2013 allows subsidies for insurance instruments, for mutual funds compensating production losses, and for mutual funds to compensate for income losses. The EU toolkit in this respect has been largely underutilized, and an integrated EU policy for risk management has not been developed. The existing EU technical documents explaining the content and details do not provide clear explanations and interpretation of the current regulations and so more efficient guidelines for Mutual Funds and sectoral Income Stabilization Tools should be developed. This could be facilitated by establishing a platform for public consultation, knowledge sharing and learning which would include stakeholders, farmer unions’ representatives and academics, to help the process of building shared experiences or even common benchmarks. The platform would be part of a dissemination and innovation effort to capitalize knowledge in a learning curve and would act as a catalyst for the implementation of MFs and ISTs.
Q18|Can RCTs help improve the design of CAP|We illustrate how randomized controlled trials (RCTs) could be used as a learning tool to shed light on various aspects of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). RCTs are quasi-absent from the CAP evaluation toolbox, despite their frequent use to evaluate other European Union policies, or agricultural policies in developing countries. We draw upon existing debates on the role of RCTs in policy-making to derive a list of points of attention. We then consider four specific examples of evaluation questions for the CAP, and based on examples drawn from agricultural and social policies in developing and developed countries, argue that the RCT toolbox has the potential to significantly add to existing approaches to evaluating and designing components of the CAP.
Q18|A meta-analysis of the price and income elasticities of food demand|Food demand elasticities are crucial parameters in the calibration of simulation models used to assess the impacts of political reforms or to analyse long-term projections, notably in agricultural sectors. Numerous estimates of these parameters are now available in the economic literature. The main objectives of this work are twofold: we seek first to identify general patterns characterizing the demand elasticities of food products and second to identify the main sources of heterogeneity between the elasticity estimates available in the literature. To achieve these objectives, we conduct a broad literature review of food demand elasticity estimates and perform a meta-regression analysis. Our results reveal the important impacts of income levels on income and price elasticities both at the country (gross domestic product-GDP) and household levels: the higher the income is, the lower the level of elasticities. Food demand responses to changes in income and prices appear to follow different patterns depending on the global regions involved apart from any income level consideration. From a methodological viewpoint, the functional forms used to represent food demand are found to significantly affect elasticity estimates. This result sheds light on the importance of the specification of demand functions, and particularly of their flexibility, in simulation models.
Q18|Les performances économiques de l’élevage européen : de la « compétitivité coût » à la « compétitivité hors coût »|"The European Union (EU) has, since a long time, an important role in the international livestock industry chains, both in terms of production and trade. In spite of a strong restructuring movement, mainly due to factor productivity gains, European livestock brings together farms that are still very heterogeneous in terms of productive combinations, size, social structuring, intensification and economic performance. To report on it, and based on data issued from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), an analysis of the diversity of structural and economic situations is conducted for farms specializing in the production of milk, beef and pigs/poultry, for the ten most productive EU Member States in animal production. This stage is a necessary prerequisite for reflection which begins after on the main levers of the economic performance of European animal productions. Two types of levers are then distinguished. The first concerns ""cost competitiveness"". It successively discusses the substitutions between factors of production, the economies of scale, the geographical concentration of production, the structuring of sectors and the influence of agricultural policies. The second concerns « non-cost competitiveness ». It deals with the sanitary quality of animal productions, the differentiation of products and production processes, and the conditions for the capturing of added value induced by producers."
Q18|L’internationalisation des marchés en productions animales|[paper in French] Animal production accounts for 16% of international agri-food trade. The growing imbalance between supply and demand for animal products in Asian countries, where consumption is growing, particularly in China, stimulates trade for the benefit of the major exporting countries: the European Union (EU), the United States, New Zealand, Brazil and Australia. While this development offers trade opportunities for countries with a structural surplus, purchases fluctuate from year to year and price competition is very strong, despite the qualitative requirements of some countries. The EU, which has a positive trade balance in dairy products and pork, but a negative one (in monetary terms) in beef and poultry meat, is the world's largest exporter of animal products (with 22% of the extra-EU trade in 2016). This article analyses the evolution of trade in animal products using customs statistics data (BACI and COMEXT) from 2000 to 2016. It presents the evolution of international trade for different types of goods (dairy products, beef, pork, poultry meat) and highlights the trade trajectories (patterns) of the main net importing countries (China, Japan and Russia) and net exporting countries (India, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, the United States and the EU).
Q18|State Trading Deregulation and Prairie Durum Wheat Production|We estimate the impact of the 2012 removal of the Canadian Wheat Board’s (CWB) single-desk on the spatial pattern of durum wheat acres in Western Canada. We analyze changes in durum seeded acres with a panel regression and Census Agricultural Region data from 2004–2016. Our results indicate that removal of the CWB single-desk had a significant impact on total durum production in Western Canada. In addition, we find that the spatial distribution of durum wheat acres shifted towards drier areas, an improvement in the efficiency of resource allocation.​
Q18|Agriculture productivity gains and their distribution for the main EU members|This article seeks to highlight the performance of the farm sector in the main EU countries. Based on the productivity surplus account method (PSAM), our performance analysis includes all elements of the profit and loss account, which is one of the limits of the traditional index number approach. Moreover, this method also shows the way in which productivity gains observed in each country have been distributed among the main stakeholders. A specific focus is on the state’s as well as the farmers’ roles in this distribution game.
Q18|Economy-wide analysis of food waste reductions and related costs|Reducing food waste has become a policy priority in recent years as many studies show that a significant amount of food is wasted at various stages of the food supply chain. However, the economic impacts of food waste reduction have not been studied in depth as most of the studies in the literature ignore the cost and feedback effects. The aim of this report is to develop a general framework to analyse the economic impacts of reducing food waste in EU28 in both a global and a regional context in support of the EU policy making process on food waste reduction. For the purposes of this study, we employ the CGEBox toolbox which is a flexible, extendable, and modular code basis for CGE modelling. The default configuration of CGEBox used in this study covers the global economy with a detailed representation of the agriculture and food production sector whereas the EU28 is modelled at NUTS-II level. The impact of a food waste reduction equal to 5% of the intermediate input use of food processing sectors under two different cost assumptions is analysed in the scenarios. Firstly, in the cost neutral scenario, we assume that the cost of reducing food waste is equal to the monetary savings for the food processing industry. Secondly, in the pessimistic scenario, we assume that the cost of reducing food waste is twice as much as the cost savings made by reducing food waste. The results suggest that a unilateral commitment by the EU to reducing food loss and waste would most likely decrease the competitiveness of the EUâ€™s food processing. Reduced demand for primary agricultural inputs would shrink the EUâ€™s agricultural sectors, putting pressure on farm incomes and land prices. The contribution to global food security would be very minor. The impact on emissions relevant to climate change at global level is also minor, with a very limited contribution within the EU.
Q18|Managing the Impact of Climate on Migration: Evidence from Mexico|This paper uses state-level data on migration flows between Mexico and the U.S. from 1999 to 2011 to investigate the migration response to climate shocks and the mitigating impact of an agricultural cash-transfer program (PROCAMPO) and a disaster fund (Fonden). While lower than average precipitations increase undocumented migration, especially from the most agricultural states, Fonden amounts decrease the undocumented migration response to abnormally low precipitations during the dry season. Changes equalizing the distribution of PROCAMPO and favoring vulnerable producers in the non irrigated ejido sector mitigate the impact of droughts on migration, especially for a high initial level of inequality.
Q18|Устойчивост На Селското Стопанство В България<BR>[Sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture]|"This paper gives answer to topical and debated research and practical questions at the current stage of development of Bulgarian agriculture - „what is sustainability of agriculture"", „how to assess sustainability of agricultural in the conditions of EU CAP implementation in the country“, and „which are critical factors for improvement of socio-economic and environmental sustainability in the sector“. Evolution of the „concept“ of agrarian sustainability and the major approached for its assessment are discussed More precise definition of sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture is suggested and the requirements for the system of its assessment are characterised. For the first time a new „governance“ pillar of agrarian sustainability is included along with the universally accepted economic, social and environmental pillars (aspects). Practically applicable for the specific conditions of Bulgarian agriculture holistic framework for assessing sustainability level of agrarian systems of different types (sector, sub-sector, region, ecosystem, agricultural farm) is suggested. The later included 25 principles, 66 criteria, and 163 indicators and reference values for assessing integral, governance, economic, social and environmental sustainability as well as approach for their calculation, integration and interpretation. Approbation of the elaborated framework in assessment of agrarian sustainability at various levels (national, sub-sector, region, (agro)ecosystem, and farm) is made on the base of official statistical, etc, information and original farm surveys. Critical factors for improving sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture are identified, and recommendation made for amelioration of research and assessment practices, public policies and farming strategies for sustainable development.

Q18|Multilevel assessment of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria|The goal of this study is to unpack sustainability in terms of understanding and evaluation using as a case Bulgarian agriculture. A hierarchical system for assessing agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria at national, regional, sub-sectoral, ecosystem and farm level is proposed. It includes 3 aspects(pillars), 17 principles, 35 criteria, and 46 indicators and reference values for evaluating sustainability as well as approach for their integration and interpretation. Assessment is made of agrarian sustainability in the country at various level using aggregate macro and farm level micro data. The assessment has found out that there is a considerable differentiation in the level of integral and aspects sustainability of different type of farms, ecosystems, subsectors and regions. Nevertheless, results on the integral agrarian sustainability based on macro aggregate and micro farm data are quite similar. The later indicates that both approaches are reliable and could be simultaneously used according to the level of analysis, needs of decision makers, and available data. Major factors encouraging improving economic sustainability are market demand and price; direct state subsidies; market competition; financial capability; participation in public support programs; possibility of benefitting immediately; possibility of benefitting in the near future; tax preferences; possibility of benefitting in the long term; and integration with buyers of farm products. Main factors encouraging the enhancement of social sustainability are personal convictions and satisfaction; social recognition of individual contribution; immediate benefits for other people and groups; regional community initiatives and pressure; access to advisory services; European Union policy; and existing regional problems and risks. Important factors encouraging environmental sustainability are problems and risks existing at the global scale; official regulations, standards, and norms; existing regional problems and risks; and European Union policies. Public policies and instruments that improve economic sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture include: direct area-based payments; national top-ups for products and livestock; modernization of agricultural holdings; green payments; support for semi-market farms. At the same time the impact of national and European policies on social and environmental sustainability is relatively weak. Having in mind the importance of holistic assessments of this kind for improving agrarian sustainability, farm management and agrarian policies, they are to be expended and their precision and representation increased. The latter requires a closer cooperation between and participation of all interested parties as well as improvement of the precision through enlargement of collected statistical data, number of surveyed farms, and incorporating more “objective” data from field tests and surveys, monitoring, expertise of professionals in the area, etc.
Q18|Sustainability of agro-ecosystems in Bulgaria|Ecosystem approach has been increasingly incorporated in the management and evaluation of sustainability levels. Despite huge progress in the theory and practice of this new area, still there is no consensus on how to assess the sustainability of agro-ecosystems due to diverse understandings, approaches, methods, employed data, etc. In Bulgaria there are practically no deep studies on sustainability level of diverse agro-eco-systems. This paper tries to fill the blank and assesses the sustainability level of agro-ecosystems of different type in Bulgaria. First a holistic hierarchical framework for assessing integral, economic, social and ecological sustainability of agro-ecosystems in Bulgaria is suggested including 17 principles, 35 criteria, and 46 indicators and reference values. After that, an assessment is made on overall and aspects sustainability of large (agro)ecosystems in North-Central, South-Eastern, South-Central and South-Western geographic regions, and particular main and specific types of agro-ecosystems of the country - mountainous, plain-mountainous, plain, riparian (Struma, Maritza, Yantra), southern Black Sea, mountainous area with natural constraints, non-mountainous area with natural constraints, protected areas and reserves, Western Thracian Plain, Middle Danube Plain, Dupnitsa and Sandansko-Petrich Valley, Sredna Gora Mountains and Western Rila Mountains. The assessment is based on first-hand information collected though in-depth interviews with the managers of “typical” farms in the respective ago-ecosystems. The study has found out that there is a considerable differentiation in the level of integral sustainability in agricultural ecosystems of different types. Furthermore, there are substantial variations in the levels of economic, social and ecological sustainability of agro-ecosystems of different type, and the critical indicators enhancing or deterring overall and particular sustainability of individual agro-ecosystems. Results of the integral agrarian sustainability level of this study, based on the micro agro-ecosystem (farm) data, are similar to the previous assessment based on the aggregate sectoral (statistical, etc.) data. There are large differences in the impact of socio-economic, institutional, behavioral, international, natural, etc. factors and individual public policy instruments on the sustainability of farming enterprises of different types and agro-ecosystems. Having in mind the importance of holistic assessments of this kind for improving agrarian sustainability, farm management and agrarian policies, they are to be expended and their precision and representation increased.
Q18|Sustainability of agricultural sub-sectors in Bulgaria|In Bulgaria, like in most countries, the comprehensive assessments on agrarian sustainability are mostly at sectoral or farm levels while there is practically no in-depth study on sustainability at sub-sector (industry) level. This paper tries to fill the gap and assess the sustainability of different sub-sectors in Bulgarian agriculture. First a holistic hierarchical framework for assessing integral, economic, social and ecological sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture is suggested including 17 principles, 35 criteria, and 46 indicators and reference values. After that, an assessment is made on the overall and aspects sustainability of major crop, livestock and mixed subsectors of Bulgarian agriculture. The assessment is based on first-hand information collected though in-depth interviews with the managers of “typical” farms in analysed industries. The study has found out that there is a considerable differentiation in the level of integral and aspects sustainability in individual sub-sectors in Bulgaria, with mixed livestock-breeding, mixed crop-growing, and perennial crops sub-sectors having the highest integral sustainability, while pigs, poultry and rabbits; vegetables, flowers and mushrooms, and mixed livestock-crops subsectors the lowest one. There are also substantial variations in the levels of economic, social and ecological sustainability of different agricultural sub-sectors and individual indicators with the highest and lowest values showing (critical) factors enhancing and deterring particular or overall sustainability of evaluated agro-industries. Results on the integral agrarian sustainability level of this study based on the micro sub-sector (farm) data are similar to the previous assessment based on the aggregate sectoral (statistical, etc.) data.
Q18|Анализ На Състоянието На Системата За Споделяне На Знания И Иновации В Селското Стопанство В България<BR>[Analysis of the State of the System of Sharing of Knowledge and Innovations in Bulgarian Agriculture]|This study analyses the state and development of the system of sharing of knowledge, innovations and digitalisation of Bulgarian agriculture. First, the scope of the study and information sources are outlined. After that analysis is made of the state and evolution of the research and development activity in Bulgaria. Following is the analysis of the state and development of major agents in the system of sharing knowledge and innovations in agriculture and the relations - the system of agrarian research, the system of agrarian education, advises and consultations, and the system of application of agrarian innovations. Next, the state and evolution of the digitalisation in agriculture and rural regions are analysed. After that the results of an expect assessments on the state, efficiency and factors of development of the system of sharing of knowledge, innovations and digitalisation in agriculture are presented. Finally, conclusions of the study are made.
Q18|Изследване На Екологическите Дадености И Културни Ресурси За Развитие На Туризма В Селските Райони На България И Китай<BR>[Study of ecological endowments and cultural resources for tourism development in rural areas of Bulgaria and China]|The research target is to analyse the development degree of the rural tourism in all its varieties in Bulgaria and China, its role for achievement of a sustainable and diversified development, as well as to assess the synergic effects of the protection and restoration of the ecologic and cultural wealth and to create a tourist product for a sustainable and viable rural development. The study was made on the base of a detailed examination of the existing Bulgarian and foreign literature in the area of the sustainable development of the tourism in rural areas. The elaborated methodology provides a reliable and complex assessment of the synergy of tourism development in rural communities on the conservation, the sustainable use of ecological and cultural resources, as well as the contribution to the overall development of the local economy. In the scientific literature and the contemporary scientific thought more attention is paid to the strengths, natural and other conditions to be turned into a driving force for preserving and vitalising rural communities. The tourism is conceived as a sector with a special promising opportunity for the development of these territories. The formation of a sustainable and recognisable tourist product in rural areas is based on multiple elements: climate, locality, sand, sea, landscape, infrastructure, hospitality, life quality, life style, health and regional specificity. For the aims of the study has been chosen two pilot municipalities in Bulgaria – Strelcha and Hissarya. Both municipalities are neighbouring geographically, but belonging to two different administrative regions – Pazardzhik and Plovdiv. The economies of the two pilot municipalities although similar, show several differences as a result of different reasons, analysed in-depth. One feature in common for both pilot regions and one of the most significant resource for the tourism development in these municipalities is the hot mineral springs. The research of the situation and the opportunity of hot water use enable making analysis of the effects and contributions of this resource for the regions. It is established that both in Bulgaria and in China, according to the particularities, similar in nature but different in form and specificity approaches have been applied to create a sustainable tourism product by creating tourist clusters based on the regional resources of the regions, which will lead to the utilisation of potential touristic capital. Wonderful prerequisites are available, which should be examined in a long-term outlook, for Bulgarian natural conditions, specific for rural areas, to become an attractive tourist product for the growing and increasingly developing demand of the Chinese tourist industry and of the rising flow of Chinese travellers.
Q18|Counter sanctions and well-being population of Russia: econometric analyses|This article examines the impact of counter-sanctions on the welfare of Russia’s population. We build a multiple-choice model and calculate the probability of being in a particular group of well-being based on the price (cost) of consumed counter-sanctions goods. The next step is the construction of a structural demand-supply system for estimating similar domestic good’s production elasticities. By knowing elasticity estimates we determine the price response to particular import closure. According to our estimates Russia's counter-sanctions led to an increase in poverty by 2.64 %.
Q18|Does Agricultural investment still promote economic growth in China? Empirical evidence from ARDL bounds testing model|One of the major unresolved research issues in agriculture is the question as to whether agricultural investments still a promoter of economic growth at the regional and local levels. The concern is not with the agricultural benefits, principally measured as food security, but whether there are additional development benefits from these investments. In this paper, we have developed a new approach to study the impact of agricultural investment on economic growth. By taking the case of China, this study is based on the Auto-Regressive Distributive Lags (ARDL) approach that is proposed by Pesaran et al (2002). The empirical estimate yields interesting results. In the short and long terms, agricultural investment has a positive effect on economic growth. The findings of this research have important implications for further policy designs that seek to maintain the agricultural sector in China in the future.
Q18|Does Agricultural Trade promote Chinese economic growth? ARDL Approach|Since the beginning of the third millennium, the Chinese agricultural exports increase at a strong pace. In this context, this paper aims to answer the question if the agriculture trade promotes Chinese economic growth by employing the ARDL bounds testing for the study period from 1984 to 2017. In the long-run, our highlights reported that domestic investment and agricultural exports have a positive effect on economic growth. However, agricultural imports have a significant negative impact on growth. In the short-run, our insights reported a positive and significant effect of domestic investment, agricultural imports and agricultural exports on economic growth. The positive impact of agriculture exports on growth is due to the importance of agriculture in terms of creating jobs and opportunities for the economy as a whole. Also, sufficient national investment in the agriculture sector leads to enlarging these opportunities and then improves the Chinese economic growth.
Q18|Testing for Exuberance Behavior in Agricultural Commodities of Pakistan|One of the basic aims of the sustainable development goals is to reduce poverty, hunger and malnutrition across the globe. It is believed that commodity booms have severe impacts on developing countries where households spend large share of their disposable income on food. Thus, hitting the poor’s ability buy necessities such as food and energy. Pakistan being a developing economy has a large share of its exports that depends on the agriculture sector in which price is the main determinant and plays a key role. In last decade, an increasing trend has been observed in agricultural commodity prices leading to food insecurity, poverty and inflation in the economy. Thus, it is essential to figure out the price bubbles in the agriculture sector. In this regard, present study is preliminary in nature and takes a lead in addressing this important issue and finds out the bubbles in agricultural commodity prices of Pakistan. The empirical analysis is carried out by employing recently developed state of art GSADF approach developed by Phillips et al. (2015) and making use of monthly data of seven key agricultural commodities in Pakistan spanning over the period of 18 years (2000M1 to 2018M5). The findings suggest the occurrence of bubbles in all price series with some interesting facts. Some relevant policy recommendations are discussed as well.
Q18|A meta-analysis of the price and income elasticities of food demand| Food demand elasticities are crucial parameters in the calibration of simulation models used to assess the impacts of political reforms or to analyse long-term projections, notably in agricultural sectors. Numerous estimates of these parameters are now available in the economic literature. The main objectives of this work are twofold: we seek first to identify general patterns characterizing the demand elasticities of food products and second to identify the main sources of heterogeneity between the elasticity estimates available in the literature. To achieve these objectives, we conduct a broad literature review of food demand elasticity estimates and perform a meta-regression analysis. Our results reveal the important impacts of income levels on income and price elasticities both at the country (gross domestic product-GDP) and household levels: the higher the income is, the lower the level of elasticities. Food demand responses to changes in income and prices appear to follow different patterns depending on the global regions involved apart from any income level consideration. From a methodological viewpoint, the functional forms used to represent food demand are found to significantly affect elasticity estimates. This result sheds light on the importance of the specification of demand functions, and particularly of their flexibility, in simulation models.
Q18|L’internationalisation des marchés en productions animales| Animal production accounts for 16% of international agri-food trade. The growing imbalance between supply and demand for animal products in Asian countries, where consumption is growing, particularly in China, stimulates trade for the benefit of the major exporting countries: the European Union (EU), the United States, New Zealand, Brazil and Australia. While this development offers trade opportunities for countries with a structural surplus, purchases fluctuate from year to year and price competition is very strong, despite the qualitative requirements of some countries. The EU, which has a positive trade balance in dairy products and pork, but a negative one (in monetary terms) in beef and poultry meat, is the world's largest exporter of animal products (with 22% of the extra-EU trade in 2016). This article analyses the evolution of trade in animal products using customs statistics data (BACI and COMEXT) from 2000 to 2016. It presents the evolution of international trade for different types of goods (dairy products, beef, pork, poultry meat) and highlights the trade trajectories (patterns) of the main net importing countries (China, Japan and Russia) and net exporting countries (India, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, the United States and the EU).
Q18|Are small farms really more productive than large farms?|We revisit the long-standing empirical evidence of an inverse relationship between farm size and productivity using rich microdata from Uganda. We show that farm size is negatively related to yields (output per hectare), as commonly found in the literature, but positively related to farm productivity (a farm-specific component of total factor productivity). These conflicting results do not arise because of omitted variables such as land quality, measurement error in output or inputs, or specification issues. Instead, we reconcile the findings emphasizing the role of farm-specific distortions and returns to scale in traditional farm production. We exploit unique regional variation in land tenure regimes in Uganda in evaluating the role of farm-specific distortions. Our findings point to the limited value of yields (or land productivity) in establishing the farm size-productivity relationship. More generally, we demonstrate the limitation of using farm size in guiding policy applications.
Q18|Social inclusion in an alternative food network: values, practices and tensions|This paper explores challenges a consumer food cooperative must address to combine social inclusion and embeddedness in its urban environment with the food quality standards it targets. While the difficulty in making alternative food networks (AFNs) socially accessible is well documented, little is known about organizational practices that foster inclusion in AFNs. Our research—based on over 100 participant observations of meetings held at the cooperative and on food activities with members of community organizations—has generated insight on how a participative process—through collective decisions, knowledge exchanges and workslot commitments—could facilitate or restrain social inclusion. Our results suggest that promotion of the value of equality for the largest number is hindered by differences in food, material and consumer cultures between cooperative members and non-members. The value of equality for the largest number is pragmatically applied through social inclusion regarding food supply and voluntary work participation.
Q18|Trade-offs between carbon sequestration, landscape aesthetics and biodiversity in a cost-benefit analysis of land use options in Norway|Norway is considering a national afforestation program for greenhouse gas (GHG) sequestration on recently abandoned semi-natural pastureland. However, the program may have negative impacts on landscape aesthetics and biodiversity. We conducted a national choice experiment survey to estimate non-market benefits of the afforestation program, compared to an alternative program of recovering pastures and the status quo of natural reforestation. Combining the preference data with secondary data on costs, we derive the social net return on land use alternatives. We find that restoring half of the abandoned pastures for grazing yields the highest net present value. Rural households closer to abandoned pastures are the largest beneficiaries of this policy due to the value they place on pastures and their disutility of natural reforestation. Their willingness to pay (WTP) for recovering pastures is more than three times that of urban households, while non-use values derived from carbon sequestration and biodiversity seem more constant across space. The net present value of all land use alternatives are still positive when limiting the aggregation of WTP to rural households, and when allowing for the presence of substantial hypothetical bias in benefit estimates and for cost increases. Results indicate that landscape and biodiversity values are substantial and should be considered when designing agricultural and climate policies.
Q18|Managing the Impact of Climate on Migration: Evidence from Mexico|This paper uses state-level data on migration flows between Mexico and the U.S. from 1999 to 2011 to investigate the migration response to climate shocks and the mitigating impact of an agricultural cash-transfer program (PROCAMPO) and a disaster fund (Fonden). While lower than average precipitations increase undocumented migration, especially from the most agricultural states, Fonden amounts decrease the undocumented migration response to abnormally low precipitations during the dry season. Changes equalizing the distribution of PROCAMPO and favoring vulnerable producers in the non irrigated ejido sector mitigate the impact of droughts on migration, especially for a high initial level of inequality.
Q18|Introducing a development policy perspective into CAP Strategic Plans|National CAP Strategic Plans have been proposed by the Commission as a key instrument in its legal proposal for the CAP post 2020 to shift EU agricultural policy to a more performance-based framework. Member States are required to draw up these plans using a transparent process and to involve as partners relevant public bodies, economic and social partners, and relevant bodies representing civil society. This paper discusses how national stakeholders might ensure that these CAP Plans deliver on commitments to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, as well as take into account the interests of developing countries. It reviews the proposed framework for these Strategic Plans and identifies the most important elements that development interests should try to influence. The new approach will require significant organisation at the national level to ensure that the CAP post 2020 takes full account of the interests of developing countries.
Q18|Are Small Farms Really more Productive than Large Farms?|We revisit the long-standing empirical evidence of an inverse relationship between farm size and productivity using rich micro data from Uganda. We show that farm size is nega- tively related with yields (output per hectare), as commonly found in the literature, but positively related with farm productivity (a farm-specific component of total factor pro- ductivity). These conflicting results do not arise because of omitted variables such as land quality, measurement error in output or inputs, or specification issues. Instead, we reconcile the findings emphasizing decreasing returns to scale in farm production and farm-specific distortions. We exploit regional variation in land tenure regimes in Uganda in evaluating the role of farm-specific distortions. Our findings point to the limited value of yields (or land productivity) in establishing the size-productivity relationship. More generally, we highlight farm size as an ineffective instrument for policy implementation since size is deeply con- founded by distortions in developing countries.
Q18|The Effects of Land Markets on Resource Allocation and Agricultural Productivity|We assess the effects of land markets on misallocation and productivity by exploiting policy-driven variation in land rentals across time and space arising from a large-scale land certification reform in Ethiopia, where land remains owned by the state. Our main finding from detailed micro panel data is that land rentals substantially reduce misallocation and increase agricultural productivity. Our evidence builds from an empirical difference-in-difference strategy, an instrumental variable approach, and a calibrated quantitative macroeconomic framework with heterogeneous household-farms that replicates, without targeting, the empirical effects. These effects are nonlinear, impacting more farms farther away from efficient operational scale, consistent with our theory. Using our model, we find that more active land markets reduce inequality, an important concern for the design of land policy. We also find that the positive effects of land markets are mainly driven by formal market rentals as opposed to informal rentals. Finally, our analysis also provides evidence that land markets increase the adoption of more advanced technologies such as the use of fertilizers.
Q18|How Do Agro-Pastoral Policies Affect the Dietary Intake of Agro-Pastoralists? Evidence from Niger|We investigate the mechanisms underlying the effect of agricultural policies directed toward pastoralist households on their dietary intake. To do so, we pursue a mediation analysis while referring to theoretical agricultural household models. We decompose the total effect of selected policies on pastoralist dietary intake into an indirect effect, i.e., the effect that operates through pastoral profits, and a residual direct effect. Using an agro-pastoral survey conducted in Niger in 2016, the effects of extension services associated with better access to markets are found to be channeled through households’ annual profits from cattle and sheep raising, while this is not the case for private veterinary services and low-cost livestock feed programs. Extension services may foster specialization in cattle and sheep raising, which may incentivize households to move toward a nomadic lifestyle and change their food habits and thereby have detrimental consequences on their calorie intake. Besides, other life choices could be spurred or hampered by policies, such as migrations and radicalization.
Q18|Choosing between Hail Insurance and Anti-Hail Nets: A Simple Model and a Simulation among Apples Producers in South Tyrol|There is a growing interest in analysing the diffusion of agricultural insurance, seen as an effective tool for managing farm risks. Much atten- tion has been dedicated to understanding the scarce adoption rate despite high levels of subsidization and policy support. In this paper, we analyse an aspect that seems to have been partially overlooked: the potential competing nature between insurance and other risk management tools. We consider hail as a single source weather shock and analyse the potential competing effect of anti-hail nets over insurance as instruments to cope with this shock by presenting a simple theoretical model that is rooted into expected utility theory. After describing the basic model, we perform some comparative static analysis to identify the role of individual elements that are shaping farmers' decisions. From this exercise it results that the worth of anti-hail nets compared to insurance is an increasing function of the overall risk of hail damages, of the farmers' level of risk aversion and of the worth of the agricultural output. Finally, we develop a simulation model using data related to apple production in South Tyrol, a Northern-Italian province with a relatively high risk of hail. The model generally confirms the results of the comparative static analysis and it shows that, in this region, anti-hail nets are often superior than insurance in expected utility terms.
Q18|Modeling the Switch from Hail Insurance to Anti-Hail Nets|In several areas of the world, hail is one of the most detrimental atmospheric phenomenon for agriculture, causing a significant loss of output and, consequently, of farms’ revenues. Despite being a highly stochastic and localized phenomenon, thus allowing for a sustainable insurance market to hedge against its detrimental effects, this last is often subsidised. The present paper tries to figure out if the promotion of an alternative hedging instrument, anti-hail nets, could help to increase the actuarial soundness of the hail insurance market. In the first part of the paper a simple model is presented showing that the relation between the differential profitability of anti-hail nets versus insurance and the plot specific versus the average expected damage has an inverse U-shape. This implies that incentives to anti-hail nets could cause low risk farmers to exit the insurance market more likely than high risk ones. Such finding is confirmed by the empirical investigation, further showing that higher per-hectare output values and being located in an area strongly affected by hail increase the chance of a plot to be hedged through anti-hail nets.
Q18|Nutritional Inequality: The Role of Prices, Income, and Preferences|In the U.S., lower income households have a less healthy consumption basket than higher income ones. This paper studies the drivers of such nutrition inequality. I use longitudinal home-scanner data to estimate a demand system on food products, and measure the contribution of prices, disposable income and preferences to nutrition inequality. Disposable income and preferences have a predominant and quantitatively similar role in explaining consumption basket differences across income groups. Instead, prices have a limited effect. Further, I merge nutritional label information to assess, through a series of counterfactual exercises, the effect of income subsidies on nutrition quality. For example, I show that increasing the budget of a low-income household to the average level of the higher income households (a 45% increase in food expenditures) leads to an increase in protein consumption of approximately 5% and a decrease in sugar consumption of approximately 10%.
Q18|Factors Explaining the Dynamics of Agricultural Technology Adoption: Evidence from Senegal's Rain Maize Farmers|This paper analyses the adoption dynamics of improved rainfed maize seeds disseminated in Senegal in 2013 by the West African Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP). We group maize producers into five groups (non-adopters, laggards/abandoners, late adopters, followers and pioneers/innovators) and take into account the heterogeneity of unobservable characteristics of the producers. In the pioneers/innovators group, the availability of labour, household size, shocks, and frequency of access to advice positively influence adoption, whereas financial constraints and high numbers of plots reduce the probability of adoption. Producers in the followers’ category tend to be older and more educated than are those in the other categories. However, food insecurity and shocks such as diseases hamper adoption. For the group of late adopters, household size and available storage infrastructures explain adoption. However, the number of plots and shocks reduce their probability of adoption. Laggards tend to face shocks and food insecurity.
Q18|Información Crediticia para la Formulación de Política Pública: El Caso del Banco Agrario y la Sustitución de Cultivos de Uso Ilícito|La política de sustitución de cultivos de uso ilícito pasa por escoger, para un lugar determinado, unos pocos cultivos como alternativas de sustitución. Esta elección debe hacerse con indicadores de rentabilidad que generalmente no están disponibles por la falta de información. Este artículo propone utilizar información de las bases de datos del Banco Agrario de Colombia para guiar esta decisión. En particular, mostramos cómo se puede usar la información de morosidad de cartera y de colocaciones del banco para construir indicadores de rentabilidad de los cultivos en municipios con cultivos de coca. Estos indicadores se correlacionan positivamente con medidas de ingreso por hectárea a nivel de cultivo-municipio construidas con el Censo Nacional Agropecuario y las Evaluaciones Agropecuarias Municipales. Por último, presentamos para cada municipio los dos cultivos con el mejor desempeño según estos indicadores. Estos cultivos podrían ser alternativas viables de sustitución.
Q18|La dinámica espacial de la coca en Colombia: ¿cómo una hidra?|Una aproximación empírica para 2012-2016 a la eficacia y eficiencia de las políticas de control de los cultivos de coca. Lo primero según un modelo espacial de datos de panel, desagregando la expansión según las contribuciones del contagio espacial, de las políticas de control y su efecto balón, así como de factores exógenos. Mientras lo segundo, mediante la simulación de réplicas espaciales o efectos de largo plazo sugiere diferencias de eficiencia entre los instrumentos de política.
Q18|Determinantes de la productividad agrícola|Uno de los grandes desafíos que enfrenta el país es disminuir la desproporción en el desarrollo social y económico de las zonas urbanas y rurales. Para entender los retos detrás de este desafío es necesario tener una mirada comprensiva de las diferencias en las condiciones urbanas y rurales, tanto en términos de inclusión social, como productiva. En términos sociales los datos parecen mostrar la existencia de un círculo perverso que limita la acumulación de educación en las zonas rurales que, junto con unas bajas opciones de inserción productiva, conduce a un mercado de trabajo con unas condiciones precarias de empleabilidad, que se ve reflejado en bajos ingresos y pobreza. En cuanto al sector productivo, se observa que el acervo de condiciones naturales del país se encuentra en un nivel bajo de utilización, al mismo tiempo aquellos recursos que se utilizan no responden a su verdadera vocación productiva. En esa vía, se indago por los niveles de productividad agrícola y sus determinantes para varios cultivos (agroindustriales, frutales y cereales), teniendo en cuenta los diferentes niveles de la actividad agrícola: las características propias de los productores y de sus unidades productivas; de los aspectos institucionales con los que se cuenta (acceso a crédito, instrumentos de fomento, etc.), así como los aspectos las características geográficas (distancia a los centros principales de acopio, facilidad de acceso a los mercado, etc.).
Q18|Adecuación de tierras y el desarrollo de la agricultura colombiana: políticas e instituciones|La adecuación de tierras, en general, y el riego, en particular, desempeñan un papel muy importante en el crecimiento y el desarrollo de la agricultura. Por ejemplo, la irrigación impacta la mayor productividad de los cultivos, lo que repercute en un mayor nivel de ingresos de los agricultores y en la reducción de la pobreza rural. En Colombia, a pesar de que la política agropecuaria ha tenido como uno de sus principales instrumentos la adecuación de tierras, en la actualidad, la utilización del riego en las actividades agropecuarias se encuentra lejos de sus potenciales. Esto contrasta con los avances que en esta materia han tenido algunas naciones latinoamericanas (como Brasil, Chile, México y Perú). Dada la importancia que tienen la adecuación de tierras y el riego para el crecimiento y el desarrollo de la agricultura y el sector rural, así como el importante potencial de expansión que tiene el sector agropecuario del país, Fedesarrollo adelantó el presente estudio, cuyo objetivo es establecer la situación actual de la adecuación de tierras y el riego en Colombia y, con base en dicho análisis, proponer las medidas de política e institucionales necesarias para expandir el uso del riego en las actividades agropecuarias.
Q18|RÃ©formes agricoles, emploi et rÃ©duction de la pauvretÃ© : une analyse en Ã©quilibre gÃ©nÃ©ral dynamique|Le Niger ambitionne de mobiliser et valoriser ses ressources en eau pour satisfaire ses besoins dâ€™irrigation.

This study evaluates the impact of large-scale water mobilization on macroenomic aggregates: agricultural production, employment, household income, and poverty. The dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model was used to set up a first scenario to examine the repercussions of an increase of groundwater production and another scenario on the effects of a growth of surface water supplies. The results, estimated over a period of 15 years, show transmission mechanisms according to the preferred types of investments. In both scenarios, we observe a significant improvement of agricultural production, economic growth, and agricultural household income. However, the effects are obviously more important with greater efforts to mobilize surface waters.

It contribution to GDP is estimated on average at 35%. In agricultural sector, 83% of women produce 75% of food production despite their limited access to land and productive resources. Faced to these constraints, the Government has adopted measures to improve the living conditions of rural women through their access to land and agricultural inputs in particular. Our study uses a static computable general equilibrium model to assess the macroeconomic and sectorial effects of these measures on women's employment and income. Results show that, increasing the supply of land, agricultural equipment, and reducing the cost of fertilizer contribute to food security, economic growth and improve living conditions of women through job creation and improved household income.
Q18|Consumers’ Perception of Food Safety Risk From Vegetables: A Rural - Urban Comparison|Rapid urbanization brings challenges to managing food safety in Vietnam. Today, consumers pay more attention to the safety of food, particularly vegetables. This paper investigates the impact of consumer perception of food safety risk on self-reported vegetable consumption and then compares the determinants of risk perception between the rural and the urban region. We conducted a survey and observe a decline in self-reported vegetable consumption as a consequence of heightened risk perception among residents in the Hanoi area. The differences, as well as the similarities in the underlying drivers of risk perception, were identified across regions. In both regions, information about food incidents and perceived consequence of hazards associated with vegetables shaped risk perception of vegetables. Respondents’ age, education, and trust in food retailers at wet markets determined risk perception in the rural area, but not in the urban region. Personal experience with vegetable poisoning, whether the household was growing vegetables, perceived control over hazards, and trust in responsible institutions only influenced risk perception in the urban region. We suggest that these spatial disparities in behaviours should be taken into account in designing and implementing risk communication programs and food safety policies in Vietnam.
Q18|External Societal Costs of Antimicrobial Resistance in Humans Attributable to Antimicrobial Use in Livestock|Antimicrobial use in animal agriculture contributes to antimicrobial resistance in humans, which imposes significant health and economic costs on society. These costs are negative externalities. We review the relevant literature and develop a model to quantify the external costs of antimicrobial use in animal agriculture on antimicrobial resistance in humans. Parameters required for this estimate include: 1) the health and economic burden of antimicrobial resistance in humans, 2) the impact of antimicrobial use in animal agriculture on antimicrobial resistance in animals, 3) the fraction of antimicrobial resistance in humans attributable to animal agriculture, and 4) antimicrobial use in animals. We use a well-documented historic case to estimate an externality cost of about $1500 per kilogram of fluoroquinolones administered in US broiler chicken production. Enhanced data collection, particularly on parameters 3) and 4), would be highly useful to quantify more fully the externalities of antimicrobial use in animal agriculture.
Q18|The changing landscape of agricultural markets and trade: prospects for future reforms|This report synthesises OECD work analysing agricultural policies, markets and trade. It highlights recent developments in agricultural markets and policies and considers how these have changed the source and nature of the gains from multilateral reform, and considers opportunities for further reforms.In large part, gains from further reform come from the opportunities to increase income and jobs through increasing agro-food sector participation in global and domestic value chains. Countries can enhance the overall competitiveness of their agro-food sectors though more open trade policies and reducing the impacts of measures that raise trade costs. This includes reducing distorting domestic support and market access barriers, including to agro-food imports; ensuring that non-tariff measures are appropriate, transparent, and science-based; and reducing barriers to services trade.
Q18|Navigating pathways to reform water policies in agriculture|This report offers a guide on potential reform pathways towards sustainable agriculture water use, based on a thorough review of selected past water and agriculture reforms and extensive consultation with policy experts. A theory of change is developed that emphasises the importance of flexibility in the timing and design of reform processes to achieve practical and effective policy changes. Governments should prepare future reforms, via continued research, education, and governance efforts, to help take advantage of reform opportunities when the timing is right. Five necessary conditions are identified for a successful reform process: (i) support evidence-based problem definition, objective setting and evaluations; (ii) ensure that governance and institutions are aligned with the policy change; (iii) engage stakeholders strategically and build trust; (iv) rebalance economic incentives to mitigate short run economic losses; and (v) define an adjustable smart reform sequencing that provides flexibility in the long run. These conditions are found to be necessary to implement four challenging policy changes: charging water use in agriculture; removing subsidies that negatively impact water resources, regulating groundwater use and addressing nonpoint source pollution. But the relative effort that governments need to devote to fulfilling each of the five conditions will vary depending on the policy change.
Q18|China’s grains policy: Impacts of alternative reform options|Reforming China’s grain policy could have significant implications for both domestic and international markets. China has begun to reform its price support policies for several commodities, replacing them with commodity specific area payments. The assessment of policy reform scenarios for grains, using two partial equilibrium models, show that China would maintain more than 80% of self-sufficiency in wheat and maize, and more than 95% in rice. The increase in its grain imports could increase international prices, in particular for wheat and rice. A gradual approach to reforming market price support with compensatory payments would smooth the potential impacts on domestic and world commodity markets, as well as on domestic farm income. While the reform of price support policies benefit consumers the most, more decoupled area payments could also have a greater impact on farm income without increasing the overall cost to society as well as environmental performance of agriculture. Lower costs of managing public grain stocks would equally reduce the budgetary cost of reforms.
Q18|Evaluating the environmental impact of agricultural policies|The relationship between agricultural support policies (adapted from the OECD Producer Support Estimate (PSE) classification) and a selection of environmental impacts are analysed in a range of country settings, using a farm-level and a market-level model. Based on the methods and environmental indicators used, market price support and payments based on unconstrained variable input use were the most environmentally harmful among the various PSE measures. Decoupled support payments based on non-current crop area were the least harmful, even when considering their impacts on the behaviour of risk averse farmers. The impacts of support policies that clearly change the competitiveness of one production activity in relation to another, such as payments based on current crop area or on animal numbers, were more equivocal. Support payments subject to environmental constraints can improve environmental outcomes compared to coupled support without restrictions, however, they can also have unintended environmental impacts.
Q18|Bio-economy and the sustainability of the agriculture and food system: Opportunities and policy challenges|The bio-economy is gaining increasing prominence in the policy debate, with several countries developing bio-economy strategies to decouple economic growth from dependence on fossil fuel, as well a pathway to supporting some of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement. This report analyses the opportunities and policy challenges facing the bio-economy in transitioning to a more sustainable agro-food system. It provides an overview of national bio-economy- strategies based on a literature review and information provided by governments in response to a questionnaire.
Q18|Integrating gender analysis into food & nutrition security early warning systems in West Africa|Integrating gender dimensions into early warning systems is critical to support equitable crisis prevention and response. This paper investigates the extent to which food and nutrition security early warning systems (FNS EWS) in the Sahel and West Africa are gender-responsive and highlights existing gaps at national and regional levels. Progress has been made by key partners and stakeholders towards strengthening the gender analysis of FNS EWS, however, these efforts have not led to a unified reconfiguration of joint FNS EWS mechanisms to be more gender-responsive. More concerted efforts are required to assess and track the gender dimensions of FNS EWS to inform more equitable emergency prevention and response. This paper provides timely policy directions to support stakeholders’ efforts in strengthening the gender-responsiveness of early warning systems in the Sahel and West Africa.
Q18|Intégrer l’analyse sexospécifique dans les systèmes d’alerte précoce pour la sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle en Afrique de l’Ouest|L’intégration de la problématique femmes-hommes dans les systèmes d’alerte précoce est essentielle afin de prévenir et gérer les crises de façon plus équitable. Cette Note examine la prise en compte dans les systèmes d’alerte précoce pour la sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle (SAP-SAN) au Sahel et en Afrique de l’Ouest du genre. Elle identifie les lacunes aux niveaux national et régional. Il en ressort que les partenaires et parties prenantes ont renforcé la capacité d’analyse sexospécifique de ces systèmes. Mais ces avancées n’ont pas abouti à une refonte uniforme des mécanismes conjoints auxquels font appel les SAP-SAN afin de les rendre plus sensibles aux disparités qui existent entre les sexes. Des efforts plus concertés s’imposent pour déterminer les aspects de la problématique femmes-hommes à intégrer dans les SAP-SAN et en assurer le suivi pour des systèmes de prévention et de gestion de crise plus équitables. Ce document présente des pistes pour appuyer ces efforts.
Q18|Participatory Guarantee Systems for organic farming: reclaiming the commons|Using the definition developed by Hess and Ostrom (2007), we consider the content of organic farming labels as a system of intellectual common-pool resources. Access to this resource is threatened by phenomena of enclosure and commodification. Third party certification, which is controlled by private competitive operators, is becoming the unique channel to gain legal access to public labels in many countries. However, the high cost of this certification may exclude a large part of the community at the origin of the resource – especially small diversified farmers. It also threatens resource renewal. In this article, we describe an alternative mechanism called participatory guarantee systems (PGS). Participatory certification is based on peer-review assessment (involving producers from the community), additional control mechanisms are also mobilized according to the context, in order to measure compliance with the standard’s specifications. PGS encourage producers to share knowledge, support ongoing learning processes and, thus, resource renewal. Drawing on design principles from Ostrom’s approach, we analyse ten PGS initiatives in the world – Nature et Progrès (France), Ecovida (Brazil), Certified Naturally Grown (United States), Organic Farm New Zealand, the Asociacion Nacional de Productores/as Ecologicos (Peru), Vietnam PGS, PGS India, Ngong Organic Farmer Association (Kenya), Good Market Organic PGS (Sri Lanka) and BioSPG du Conseil National de l'agriculture Biologique (Burkina Faso) – and discuss their robustness and sustainability. We demonstrate their relatively robustness in terms of self-organization and suggest that their current development in many countries contribute to a re-appropriation of the commons. ....French Abstract: En utilisant la définition développée par Hess et Ostrom (2007), nous considérons le contenu des labels d'agriculture biologique comme un système de ressources communes intellectuelles. L'accès à cette ressource est menacé par des phénomènes de privatisation et de marchandisation. La certification par tiers qui fait appel à des opérateurs privés indépendant est devenu le seul moyen d'accéder aux labels publics dans de nombreux pays. Cependant, le coût élevé de cette certification peut exclure une grande partie de la communauté à l'origine de la ressource - en particulier les petits agriculteurs diversifiés. Elle menace également le renouvellement de la ressource. Dans cet article, nous décrivons un mécanisme alternatif appelé système de garantie participative (SPG). La certification participative est d’abord basée sur une évaluation par les pairs (impliquant les producteurs de la communauté), des mécanismes de contrôle supplémentaires sont également mobilisés en fonction du contexte, afin de mesurer la conformité à la norme. Les SPG encouragent les producteurs à partager leurs connaissances, à appuyer les processus d'apprentissage continu et, par conséquent, à renouveler la ressource commune. En nous basant sur les principes de conception d'Ostrom, nous analysons dix initiatives de SPG dans le monde - Nature et Progrès (France), Ecovida (Brésil), Certified Naturally Grown (États-Unis), Organic Farm New Zealand, Asociacion Nacional de Productores/as Ecologicos (Pérou), Vietnam PGS, PGS India, Ngong Organic Farmer Association (Kenya), Good Market Organic PGS (Sri Lanka) et BioSPG du Conseil national de l'agriculture biologique (Burkina Faso). Nous démontrons leur relative robustesse en termes d'auto-organisation et suggérons que leur développement actuel dans de nombreux pays contribue à une réappropriation des communs.
Q18|Attitude of European and Chinese consumers toward food products from IPM: results from a survey|The paper aims to illustrate the factors that can influence the choices of European and Chinese consumers of products obtained with a lower use of pesticides (IPM methods). The results, obtained from a survey, allow identifying the most aware categories, those still far from a complete knowledge of IPM methods and their potential. They can also suggest useful policies to achieve a more sustainable consumption behavior.
Q18|Crop and Conflict: exploring the impact of Inequalityin Agricultural Production on Conflict Risk|Recent attempts to find a robust empirical correlation between climate variability, crop production and civil conflict risk have been quite inconclusive. In this paper, we argue that the ambiguity in empirical findings may be partly due to a general tendency to treat agricultural production in absolute terms, while neglecting the importance of the relative deprivation triggered by unequal distribution in crop yields across locations and between groups. To test this hypothesis, we rely on high-resolution global gridded data on the local yield of four main crops for the period 1981-2017, and calculate the level of inequality in crop production by means of a Gini index using the grid-cell information on yearly crop yields both at the country level and between identity based groups (regional and ethnic). In addition, for each level of spatial disaggregation, we compute the Gini coefficient using information on crop production from rural grid-cells only. Our results reveal a strong and robust association between crop inequality and the probability of conflict outbreak. This effect is particularly pronounced in the case of inequality among rural areas. Climatic variability, on the other hand, is shown not to increase significantly the destabilizing effect of crop inequality. We also find that akin ethnic competition and discrimination along ethnic lines represent good predictors of conflict outbreak, especially in the case of ethnic conflicts, and when the between-group inequality in crop production is calculated along ethnic boundaries.
Q18|Drivers of farmers’ willingness to adopt extensive farming practices in a globally important bird area|Agri-environmental schemes have become an integral tool of land use management policies in ecologically valuable river valleys, that are commonly recognized as very important bird habitats. When high adoption of extensive agricultural practices is not only a political goal, but also a necessary condition for conservation of vulnerable ecosystems, understanding of farmers’ preferences is utterly important. Therefore, we use the case of Biebrza Marshes – a wetland complex and one of the largest wildlife refuges in Europe, which is located in northeastern Poland – and employ stated preference methods to investigate farmers’ preferences for adopting several agricultural practices, such as precision fertilization, crop diversification, catch crops, peatland protection, extensive use of meadows, and the reduction of livestock stocking density. Farmers’ willingness to participate in selected practices is explained using farms’ and farmers’ characteristics, subjectively and objectively measured farmers’ environmental knowledge, as well as by experimentally controlled information treatments about environmental benefits of agri-environmental contracts. The results provide new insights into the sources of farmers’ preference heterogeneity and show how different motivations relate to participation in agri-environmental schemes. Based on the results and consultations with local stakeholders, we make recommendations for a more efficient design and targeting of land use management instruments, including future agri-environmental schemes.
Q18|Trade and dietary diversity in Eastern Europe and Central Asia|In public and academic debates, the linkages between agricultural markets and nutrition across the world are vividly discussed. This paper contributes to the ongoing debate by analyzing the relationship between greater openness to trade and dietary diversity. It focuses on the post-communist countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia where trade reforms as part of the economic and political transition provide a natural experiment for studying the effects of trade openness on agricultural markets and consumer behaviour. Reduction in trade barriers, for instance in the context of the accession to the WTO and the EU, and the gradual integration with world markets after 1991 had implications for diets through changes in production, prices and incomes. We utilize country-level panel data for 26 post-communist countries in the period 1996-2013 to assess the effects of trade costs, openness to trade and incomes on dietary diversity measured by the Shannon entropy index. The results arising from fixed effects and instrumental variables estimation are consistent with previous findings that income growth affects dietary diversity positively and provide novel evidence that trade barriers reduce variety of products available in domestic markets, in particular fruits and vegetables.
Q18|Implementing result-based agri-environmental payments by means of modelling|From a theoretical point of view, result-based agri-environmental payments are clearly preferable to action-based payments. However, they suffer from two major practical disadvantages: costs of measuring the results and payment uncertainty for the participating farmers. In this paper, we propose an alternative design to overcome these two disadvantages by means of modelling (instead of measuring) the results. We describe the concept of model-informed result-based agri-environmental payments (MIRBAP), including a hypothetical example of payments for the protection and enhancement of soil functions. We offer a comprehensive discussion of the relative advantages and disadvantages of MIRBAP, showing that it not only unites most of the advantages of result-based and action-based schemes, but also adds two new advantages: the potential to address trade-offs among multiple policy objectives and management for long-term environmental effects. We argue that MIRBAP would be a valuable addition to the agri-environmental policy toolbox and a reflection of recent advancements in agri-environmental modelling.
Q18|Soda Wars: The Effect Of A Soda Tax Election On University Beverage Sales|We examine how soda sales changed due to the campaign attention and election outcome of a local excise tax on sugar‐sweetened beverages. Using panel data of beverage sales from university retailers in Berkeley, California, we estimate that soda purchases relative to control beverages significantly dropped immediately after the election, months before the tax was implemented in the city of Berkeley or on campus. Supplemental scanner data from off‐campus retailers reveal this result is not unique to the university setting. Our findings suggest soda tax media coverage and election outcomes can have larger effects on purchasing behavior than the tax itself. (JEL D12, H20, C23, I38, Q18)
Q18|Agriculture in 2018: decline or growth?|Over recent years, agriculture – if we choose to look at available data prior to their adjustment based on the results of the All-Russia Agricultural Census – has been growing at a sufficiently high rate: in 2013 – by 5.8 percent, in 2014 – by 3.5, in 2015 – by 2.6, in 2016 – by 4.8, and in 2017 – by 2.5 percent3. Overall, growth over the course of 5 years amounted to 20.7 percent. Based on Rosstat’s current statistics, managers on both the federal and regional levels describe the development pattern of the agroindustrial complex (AIC) as a breakthrough and a leap forward. We likewise mentioned this fact in our overviews released over several previous years2. However, in 2018, there were some problems involved in the estimation of the growth rate both for 2018 and for the previous years.
Q18|A meta-analysis of the price and income elasticities of food demand|Food demand elasticities are crucial parameters in the calibration of simulation models used to assess the impacts of political reforms or to analyse long-term projections, notably in agricultural sectors. Numerous estimates of these parameters are now available in the economic literature. The main objectives of this work are twofold: we seek first to identify general patterns characterizing the demand elasticities of food products and second to identify the main sources of heterogeneity between the elasticity estimates available in the literature. To achieve these objectives, we conduct a broad literature review of food demand elasticity estimates and perform a meta-regression analysis. Our results reveal the important impacts of income levels on income and price elasticities both at the country (gross domestic product-GDP) and household levels: the higher the income is, the lower the level of elasticities. Food demand responses to changes in income and prices appear to follow different patterns depending on the global regions involved apart from any income level consideration. From a methodological viewpoint, the functional forms used to represent food demand are found to significantly affect elasticity estimates. This result sheds light on the importance of the specification of demand functions, and particularly of their flexibility, in simulation models.
Q18|Effect of subsidies on technical efficiency excluding or including environmental outputs: An illustration with a sample of farms in the European Union| With a sample of farms in the European Union (EU) and Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) data completed by additional data, we illustrate how the effect of farm subsidies on technical efficiency changes when environmental (good or bad) outputs are incorporated in the calculation of technical efficiency. Results indicate that the effect of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) operational subsidies on farm technical efficiency changes when environmental outputs (in this study: greenhouse gas emissions, nitrogen balance and ecological focus areas) are taken into account in the efficiency calculation: some effects change significance, and more importantly, some effects change sign.
Q18|Reality of Food Losses: A New Measurement Methodology|Measuring food loss, identifying where in the food system it occurs, and developing effective policies along every stage of the value chain are essential first steps in addressing the problem of food loss in developing countries. Food loss has been defined in many ways, and disagreement remains regarding proper terminology and measurement methodology. Although the terms “post-harvest loss,” “food loss,” and “food loss and waste” are frequently used interchangeably, they do not refer consistently to the same aspects of the problem. In addition, none of these classifications includes pre-harvest losses. Figures regarding food loss remain highly inconsistent, precise causes of food loss remain undetected, and success stories of decreasing food loss remain few. We improve over this measurement gap on food losses by developing and testing the methodology traditionally used with three new methodologies that aim to reduce the measurement error in assessing the magnitude of food loss. The methods account for losses from the pre-harvest stage through product distribution and include both quantity loss and quality deterioration. We apply the instrument to producers, middlemen, and processors in seven staple food value chains in five developing countries. Throughout the different estimation methodologies, losses at the producer level represent between 60 and 80 percent of total value chain losses, while the average loss at the middleman and processor level lies around 7 and 19 percent, respectively. Differences across methodologies are salient, especially at the producer level. While the estimation results from the three new methods implemented are close and the differences are mostly not statistically significant, the aggregate self-reported method reports systematically lower loss figures. Finally, our results show the major reasons behind the losses identified for each commodity and country. Specifically, we find that they included pests and diseases and lack of rainfall. When looking at the produce left in the field, the major reason for the loss is a lack of appropriate harvesting techniques. Finally, the loss reported at the post-harvest level is due mostly to damage done during selection, as a result of workers’ lack of training and experience in selecting the produce. Therefore, technology, improved seeds and the proper soil management techniques together with better market access could help to substantially reduce the losses at the producer level.
Q18|Interstate competition in agriculture: Cheer or fear? Evidence from the United States and China|Understanding how interstate competition affects agricultural production in the United States and China is important, as the international food market depends heavily on these two giants. This article aims to evaluate the overall effects of multi-dimensional interstate competitions on agricultural production, which is achieved using spatial production functions and model averaging methods. Using panel data, this article finds that interstate agricultural competition ought to be encouraged in the United States due to their positive impacts on spillovers and productivity but should be discouraged in China as it leads to negative spillovers and a decrease in productivity. Additionally, intrastate competition increases productivity in the United States but conversely decreases productivity in China. Other major drivers of productivity growth in the two countries are also found to vary, which provides evidence of a centrally planned system in China compared with the market system in the United States. U.S. agriculture enjoys the benefits of competition thanks to agricultural industrialization and a competitive market, while the planned system with government interference found in China has benefits as well as detriments. Food policy implications are also discussed.
Q18|Harmonization of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards in Cocoa Trade: How Competitive are the Major Exporting Countries?| The importance of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) standard stems from its usefulness in ensuring plant, animal and human safety. However, stringency and multiplicity of the export standards stand in the way of achieving gains of trade globalization and true competitiveness by developing countries that are mostly exporters of primary agricultural produce. To this end, this study analyzed the effect of stringency of SPS standards on the competitiveness of cocoa exporters from the perspectives of individual importing countries and harmonized standards. The study found out that the increasingly stringent global standards improved trade rather than hampering it, exporting countries lost huge revenue in the absence of harmonization and exporters competitiveness was dependent on market type and scale of trade. The study recommended that cocoa exporting countries should take care of hindrances to supply-side factors, engage in country and market-specific negotiations on standards harmonization at the WTO and get involved in inter-governmental engagements.

Q18|Jobs and Agricultural Policy: Impact of the Common Agricultural Policy on EU Agricultural Employment|This paper investigates the relationship between EU agricultural subsidies and the outflow of labor from agriculture. We use more representative subsidy indicators and a wider coverage (panel data from 210 EU regions over the period 2004-2014) than has been used before. The data allow to better correct for sample selection bias than previous empirical studies. We find that, on average, CAP subsidies reduce the outflow of labor from agriculture, but the effect is almost entirely due to decoupled Pillar I payments and the impact of Pillar II is mixed. Coupled Pillar I payments have no impact on reducing labor outflow from agriculture, i.e. on preserving jobs in agriculture. The impact of Pillar II is mixed. Our estimates predicts that a decline of 10 percent of the CAP budget would cause an extra 16,000 people to leave EU agriculture each year. A 10 percent decoupling would save 13,000 agricultural jobs each year.
Q18|Employment Effects of CAP Payments in the UK Non-Farm Economy|The effects of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) payments on indirectly generated non-farm jobs in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are central to job creation. This chapter examines whether there are differences in these effects according to business location (rural or urban), the agricultural supply chain, and according to CAP pillars, using both static and dynamic models of employment. The results suggest positive net spillovers of CAP payments to non-farm employment. Although their magnitudes are small, they are economically significant. In general, Pillar 1 has a stronger positive employment effect than Pillar 2, but Pillar 2 payments have a stronger positive effect per Euro spent in rural areas and within the agricultural supply chain.
Q18|Employment effects of CAP payments in the UK non-farm economy|This paper investigates the effects of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) payments on the indirectly generated non-farm jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises, which are central to job creation. It examines whether there are differences in the effect according to business location – rural or urban, the agricultural supply chain and according to CAP Pillars. A microeconomic approach is employed, based on firm data from FAME dataset combined with detailed subsidies information from Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The generalised method of moments (system GMM) is used to estimate the effect of CAP payments in both static and dynamic models of employment. The results suggest positive net spillovers of CAP payments to non-farm employment. Although the magnitude of the effect is small, it is economically significant. In general, Pillar 1 has a stronger positive employment effect relative to Pillar 2. However, Pillar 2 payments have a stronger positive effect per Euro spent in rural areas and within agricultural supply chain.

Q18|Simulateur pédagogique des effets de répartition des soutiens de la PAC au niveau nation|[texte en français] The latest reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which was decided by the Member States of the European Union in 2013, has again modified some of the modalities with which the different types of direct payments are allocated to farmers. The reform concerns first Pillar « decoupled » payments as well as « coupled » payments, and leaves Member States with a great flexibility in how to implement the various policy measures inside a common framework. In this paper, we present a tool (which was developed with Excel and is compatible with the LibreOffice package) which allows to simulate the implementation of the main aspects of the reform, and to assess their impacts both in terms of payment distribution across farms and in terms of income. Being an educational tool, it is neither an academic effort which would precisely model the impact of the latest reform, nor a device which would permit to estimate the exact amount of support a specific farmer could claim in practice. It is based on the French strand of the Farm Accounting Data Network (FADN) and allows to analyse the choices made by France in 2013, shedding light on the underlying rationale which may have motivated the decisions. Because its initial purpose was the lifelong training of agricultural yet non-CAP or non-economics specialist professionals, the proposed simulation tool comes with a user-friendly interface and has also already been used for the initial training of Agrocampus Ouest students and with an even larger audience during the INRA’s 70th birthday Open Days in Rennes in 2016. Building on these experiences, we are currently incorporating this simulation tool inside an Agreenium-IAVFF MOOC dedicated to the economics of the European agricultural policy.
Q18|On the role of probability weighting on WTP for crop insurance with and without yield skewness|A growing number of studies in finance and economics seek to explain insurance choices using the assumptions advanced by behavioral economics. One recent example in agricultural economics is the use of cumulative prospect theory (CPT) to explain farmer choices regarding crop insurance coverage levels (Babcock, 2015). We build upon this framework by deriving willingness to pay (WTP) for insurance programs under alternative assumptions, thus extending the model to incorporate farmer decisions regarding whether or not to purchase insurance. Our contribution is twofold. First, we study the sensitivity of farmer WTP for crop insurance to the inclusion of CPT parameters. We find that loss aversion and probability distortion increase WTP for insurance while risk aversion decreases it. Probability distortion in losses plays a particularly important role. Second, we study the impact of yield distribution skewness on farmer WTP assuming CPT preferences. We find that WTP decreases when the distribution of yields moves from negatively- to positively-skewed and that the combined effect of probability weighting in losses and skewness has a large negative impact on farmer WTP for crop insurance.
Q18|Information Transmission under Increasing Political Tension – Evidence for the Berlin Produce Exchange 1887-1896|This article studies the effects of increasing political uncertainty on the functioning of futures markets. For this purpose, we utilize a unique natural experiment, namely the discussions around and the final coming into force of the German Exchange Act of 1896. Using static and time-varying vector error correction models, the empirical analysis shows that, although early futures markets exhibit a high degree of operational efficiency, increasing political tensions were related to a declining dominance of the futures market in the price discovery process. In summary, we provide a strong illustration of the negative consequences of misplaced regulatory attempts caused by strong political interests.
Q18|Operationalizing the SAARC Food Bank: Issues and Solutions|The SAARC Food Bank (SFB) embodies collective effort of South Asian countries to ensure food security at times when emergencies lead to largescale disruptions in food production, transportation, accessibility and availability. In view of the urgent need for an appropriate institutional architecture to address the ever-rising food security concerns in South Asia, issues of proper operationalization of the SFB have assumed critical importance. This paper enquires into the underlying reasons why this regional arrangement has failed to deliver the expected results and how to raise the efficacy of the SFB in order for it to service its stated mandate of deploying food reserves to affected areas during food emergencies. Based on a comparative study of select international best practices and primary surveys, the paper offers concrete recommendations for determination of thresholds that should define food emergency situations, modalities of distribution of food from the SFB, design of pricing strategies, maintenance of the food stock and ensuring quality of the reserves, derestriction of trade in food grains during emergencies, establishment of a dispute settlement mechanism, and options for institutional tie-ups with similar outfits.
Q18|Division of Labour Amongst Innovation Intermediaries in Agricultural Innovation Systems: The Case of Indonesia|Innovation intermediaries are individuals and organisations that enhance connectivity amongst constituencies of national, sectoral, and regional systems of innovation, thereby facilitating knowledge spillover. This paper articulates the whole picture of Indonesia’s agricultural innovation system, with a special focus on how different innovation intermediaries play different roles in technology transfer and knowledge dissemination. First, the public sector accounts for more than half of the actors involved in research and extension, but insufficient routes to transfer local needs to the public sector impede efficient feedback. Second, village unit cooperatives are closely associated with extension workers, suggesting the presence of a feedback mechanism, but many of them face serious financial distress. Third, private agricultural research and development and extension are organised and managed efficiently where they involve fewer internal actors working in an environment with minimal bureaucracy. However, a vague regulatory environment makes it difficult for multinational enterprises to hold a positive view towards agricultural research and development and extension from the public sector. Last, the changing governance system and the ensuing shift in political decision-making have introduced uncertainties to the arrangement of actors and resources in the system, which may take some time to resolve.
Q18|Impact of religious participation, social interactions and globalisation on meat consumption: evidence from India|From both health and environmental policy perspectives, it is advisable to ensure that individuals maximise the nutritional gains from eating meat, without having a significantly adverse environmental impact, i.e. sustainable meat consumption pathways are imperative. This is especially true for developing countries, where rising incomes and growing populations have meant that meat consumption has also risen. India is an example of a country where a large share of the population has been vegetarian due to religious and cultural factors, although this is rapidly changing. In this paper, we hypothesise that social interactions and globalisation are two factors that explain this shift in consumption behaviour, especially amongst Hindu households. These hypotheses are based on the theoretical findings of Levy and Razin (2012). The empirical results show that Hindus that are members of religious groups are less likely to eat meat than non-member Hindus, whereas Hindus that are members of non-religious types of groups are more likely to eat meat than non-members. We also find that Hindu households that frequently use sources of media such as newspapers, the radio or television are more likely to consume meat compared to Hindus that do not. This paper provides important policy implications, both in terms of the formulation of Nationally Recommended Diets in developing countries, and in terms of identifying the channel of influence of both social networks and globalisation on social and religious norms, consumption behaviour, and ultimately, on climate change.

Q18|Управление И Оценка На Аграрната Устойчивост – Опит, Предизвикателства И Уроци От България И Китай<BR>[Governing and assessment of agrarian sustainability - experiences, challenges, and lessons from Bulgaria and China]|This paper applies interdisciplinary approach and assesses the system of governance and the level of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria and China. The first part presents a holistic and practically applicable for the contemporary conditions of development of Bulgarian and Chinese agriculture framework for assessing the system of governance and the level of agrarian sustainability. The suggested approach is broadly experimented in Bulgaria for assessing the governance system of agrarian sustainability and the sustainability level of Bulgarian agriculture. In the second part the system of governance of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria is analyzed and the efficiency of institutional environment and diverse market, private, collective, public and hybrid modes are evaluated. In the third part an assessment is made on the economic, social, environmental and integral sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture at national, sectoral, regional, ecosystem and farm levels. Factors for improving agrarian sustainability are also identified and the innovation activity and sustainability of alternative agriculture estimated. In the fourth part the governance and sustainability in Chinese agriculture at national, regional and local levels is analyzed, and results of a number of in-depth studies from Shanghai area are presented. Comparative study is also made on the systems of governance and the levels of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria and China. Finally, the experiences and challenges in the governance and assessment of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria and China are summarized and directions for improvement of research, management and assessment practices suggested.
Q18|Efficiency of sustainability management in Bulgarian agriculture|This paper applies a holistic framework for assessing efficiency of environmental and sustainability management in Bulgarian agriculture. Initially the multiprinciple, multictiteria and mulriindicator framework for assessing environmental and sustainability management in agriculture is outlined. After that environmental sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture at national and farms levels is evaluated. Finally, factors for improving environmental and sustainability management in agricultural farms in the country are identified. Our assessment at national and farm level have found out that there are significant discrepancies in efficiency levels based on aggregate national data and assessment (perception) of farm managers. Therefore, in management practices all kind of data have to be used in order to be able to take efficient decision at different managerial levels. Having in mind the importance of holistic assessments of efficiency of environmental and sustainability management in agriculture, and the enormous benefits for the farm management and agrarian policies, such studies are to be expended and their precision and representation increased.
Q18|The Impact of Agricultural Trade on Economic Growth in North Africa: Econometric Analysis by Static Gravity Model|The contribution of this paper is investigating the influence of agricultural exports and agricultural imports on economic growth in North Africa Countries since it’s never been processed before. To endeavor this purpose annual data was collected for the period 1982 – 2016 and was tested by using correlation analysis and the static gravity model. Empirical analyses show that agricultural trade has a positive correlation with gross domestic product, but it appears that agricultural exports and gross domestic product have a weak correlation. The static gravity model estimation shows that agricultural exports have a positive on economic growth. However, agricultural imports have not any effect on economic growth. These results appear that agricultural exports are a fountain of economic growth in North Africa Countries. For this reason, it is very important to refine agricultural investment, and create more dynamic agricultural trade openness policies.
Q18|Impact of governing modeson agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria|Specific system of governance in different countries, regions, subsectors, etc., eventually determines the speed and type of socio-economic development. Despite its big academic and practical importance, in Bulgaria and other countries in East Europe, there are very few empirical studies on dominating governing structures in agriculture, and their impact(s) on agrarian sustainability. In this paper the interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics framework is incorporated, and the impact of diverse market, private, collective, public and hybrid modes of governance on agrarian sustainability at the current stage of development in Bulgaria assessed. First, the methodological framework of the study is outlined. After that dominating governing modes in Bulgarian farms of different juridical type, size, specialization, ecological and geographical location are identified, and their impacts on agrarian sustainability and its economic, social, and environmental pillars evaluated. In conclusion implications for further research, public policy improvement, and private managerial strategy formation are presented. Agricultural producers of different use quite unlike mixture of effective market, private, collective and hybrid modes for governance of their activities and relations. Individual factors and modes most contributing to improvement of agrarian sustainability at the current stage of development are: manager’s personal convictions and initiatives, farms resources and innovation potential, near future profit and benefits strategies, market prices levels and dynamics, area-based EU subsidies, and informal agreements. Research on relations between the governing structure and agrarian sustainability is to continue though increasing representation, and the spectrum of specific governing modes used by farms of different type as well as assessments of the impact of institutions on agrarian sustainability and the impact of the governance at different hierarchical levels. The latter however, requires a new kind of micro and macro data, and a close cooperation between all interested parties.
Q18|Efficiency of agrarian governance in Bulgaria|Empirical studies on efficiency of the governance system in agriculture are very rare. That is a consequence of both theoretical and practical challenges. The criteria and approach for assessing social efficiency are still debated while appropriate statistical, accountancy, etc. data for evaluation diverse mechanisms and modes of governance are not readily available. This is a first attempt for a comprehensive empirical study on the efficiency of the system of agrarian governance in Bulgaria. Since there is a social “contract” about sustainable agrarian development in EU and Bulgaria, the impact to sustainability is taken as a criterion for assessing the social efficiency of the governance system. The interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics framework is incorporated, and the impact of institutional environment and diverse market, private, collective, public and hybrid modes of governance on agrarian sustainability at the current stage of development in Bulgaria assessed. First, the methodological framework of the study is outlined. After that impact of major components of institutional environment of agrarian sustainability evaluated. Following, dominating governing modes in Bulgarian farms of different juridical type, size, specialisation, ecological and geographical location are identified, and their impacts on agrarian sustainability assessed. In conclusion implications for further research, public policy improvement, and private managerial strategy formation are presented.
Q18|Institutions and sustainability – insights from Bulgarian agriculture|The specific system of governance is a critical factor, which to a great extent (pre)determines the type and speed of development in different countries, industries, regions, communities, etc. This article tries to fill the gap and assesses the impact of institutional environment on agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria. The interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics framework is applied and assessment made on specific effects of major components of the “external” institutional environment on agrarian sustainability level in different administrative, geographical and ecological regions, subsectors of agriculture, and farms of various juridical type and size. Our study has found out that individual elements of external institutional, market and natural environment affect quite unequally farms of different types, individual subsectors of agriculture, and specific ecological and geographical regions. This type of studies is to be expended and their precision and representation increased. The latter however, requires a close cooperation between all interested parties, and participation of the farmers, agrarian organisations, local and central authorities, interest groups, research institutes and experts, etc.
Q18|Determinants of Agricultural Technology Adoption in Chókwè District, Mozambique|The main objective of this work was to analyze the factors influencing the adoption of agricultural technologies in Chókwé district. In order to carry out the study, a sample of 150 farmers from the administrative posts of Lionde, Chókwè-sede, Xilembene and Macarretane obtained through a randomized stratified sampling approach was submitted to the survey to obtain primary data. Based on a bivariate probit model, factors that influence the adoption of two agricultural technologies, namely improved seed and mechanization were identified. The results show that factors such as schooling, farm size, purchasing power and market access influence the adoption of improved seed and mechanization. On the other hand, access to extension services reduces the propensity to adopt improved seed.
Q18|On the Drivers of Global Grain Price Volatility : an empirical investigation|A vast number of studies examined the determinants of price volatility in agricultural markets. It is clear that the joint influence of several causes may generate market instability, but the partial contribution of different factors is still debated. We investigate how market-based drivers influence the global price volatility of three major grains: wheat, corn, barley. We adopt a Seemingly Unrelated Regression Equations model, in order to investigate potential common patterns and to control for the influence of external drivers. We compare inter-annual, intra-annual, and global volatility, to conclude on short-run and long-run dynamics of markets instability. We quantify the negative relationship linking (temporal) arbitrage and grain price volatility and conclude on the effects of supply movements on price volatility.

Q18|A model of the dynamics of household vegetarian and vegan rates in the U.K|Although there are many studies of determinants of vegetarianism and veganism, there have been no previous studies of how their rates in a population jointly change over time. In this paper, we present a flexible model of vegetarian and vegan dietary choices, and derive the joint dynamics of rates of consumption. We fit our model to a pseudo-panel with 23 years of U.K. household data, and find that while vegetarian rates are largely determined by current household characteristics, vegan rates are additionally influenced by their own lagged value. We solve for equilibrium rates of vegetarianism and veganism, show that rates of consumption return to their equilibrium levels following a temporary event which changes those rates, and estimate the effects of campaigns to promote non-meat diets. We find that a persistent vegetarian campaign has a significantly positive effect on the rate of vegan consumption, in answer to an active debate among vegan campaigners.
Q18|The Impact of Exchange Rate Dynamics on Agricultural Output Performance in Nigeria|Abstract The study investigated the possible asymmetric effect of real exchange rate dynamics on agricultural output performance in Nigeria over the period of 1981 to 2016 by collecting data from secondary sources. The study employed a combination of stationary and nonstationary variables as was found out through the ADF unit root test. Based on the Bounds test for cointegration, a long-run relationship was absent between real exchange rate and agricultural output, irrespective of specifications. Generally, the result of model estimation showed that the significant drivers of agricultural output are real exchange rate (log-levels), real appreciation and depreciation (after some lags), industrial capacity utilization rate, and government expenditure on agriculture (after some lags). ACGSF loan exerted positive and insignificant influence on agricultural output. In addition, though the effect of real appreciation was larger than that of real depreciation, the present study could not find any evidence in support of the asymmetric effect of real exchange rate dynamics on agricultural output performance in the Nigerian economy. It is therefore suggested that fiscal and monetary authorities in Nigeria should work in unison at ensuring that the full potentials of the agricultural sector are harnessed for the growth and development of the country.

Q18|Inspection regimes and regulatory compliance: How important is the element of surprise?|Regulatory compliance is often promoted via unannounced inspections where firms found to be in violation of environmental, health, or safety regulations face punishments. When compliance is costly to firms, a key aspect of this approach is that the timing of inspections is unannounced and difficult to anticipate, lest firms comply only when they believe an inspection is likely. With data from Los Angeles (LA) County food-service health inspections, I estimate how the (in)ability to anticipate inspection timing affects compliance using a novel approach. Many facilities such as hotels, grocery stores, or food courts, consist of multiple food-service establishments sharing a single physical location. Multiple establishments within a single facility are commonly, though not always, inspected on the same day; meaning all but one of the establishments involved likely anticipate the timing of their next inspection to a considerable extent. Within such facilities, I show that establishments perform significantly worse on days in which they receive the sole inspection conducted at their facility. These sole inspections detect 7.75% more violations, 9.1% more inspection score point deductions, and 16.3% more major critical violations (the most severe violations of the county health code).
Q18|Can locally available foods provide a healthy diet at affordable costs? Case of Armenia|Nutrition-related health problems, such as obesity, stunting, anemia, and high blood pressure are common in Armenia. A large portion of the population lives below the national poverty line, and consumes less than the necessary energy intake per day. Linear programming is used in this study of diet optimization to create a healthy diet model for children and adults of different ages at the minimum cost. The model is based on culturally appropriate food products. The study finds that, while average Armenians can afford a healthy diet, their current dietary choices do not meet the requirements of Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). Moreover, people earning minimum salary need to spend more than half of their monthly income on food to afford a healthy diet. Based on the study’s findings, several policy recommendations are made.
Q18|Agricultural Policy and Long-Run Development: Evidence from Mussolini’s Battle for Grain|This paper explores the effect of agricultural policies on industrialization and economic development over the long run. I analyze the differential effect of the Battle for Grain, implemented by the Italian Fascist regime to achieve self-sufficiency in wheat production, on the development path across areas of Italy. Employing time variation, along with cross-sectional variation in the suitability of land for implementing the advanced wheat production technologies, I find that the policy had unintended positive effects on industrialization and economic prosperity which have persisted until the present day. Furthermore, I find that the positive effect of the Battle for Grain on human capital accumulation was instrumental in this process, suggesting that the complementarity between human capital and agricultural technology may be a critical mechanism through which agricultural productivity may enhance the development of non-agricultural sectors.
Q18|Do Agricultural Raw Materials Imports Cause Agricultural Growth? Empirical Analysis from North Africa|The aim of this paper is to study empirically the impact of agricultural raw materials imports on agricultural growth since it never done before. We have made this study in the context of three countries from North Africa (Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt) for the period 1965 – 2016. By using cointegration analysis and vector error correction model, empirical analysis proves that agricultural raw materials imports produce a positive effect on agricultural growth in the long run for all the three countries and cause agricultural growth in the short run in the case of Tunisia and Egypt. It is seen that agricultural raw materials imports are a source of economic growth in the agricultural sector. For this reason, countries of North Africa should adopt to integrate foreign technology imports and not technological innovation to stimulate agricultural sector.

Q18|The impact of financial inclusion on rural food security experience: a perspective from low-and middle-income countries|The paper analyses the impact of using single, combinations and the range of three different formal financial services – savings, credit and payments – on the personal food security experience in rural areas across 88 low-and middle-income countries. It takes advantage of Global Findex database and Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) – both included in the 2014-round of Gallup World Poll that collects data at individual-level and comparable worldwide. Our outcome variable of interest is the individual’s probability of experiencing food insecurity related to difficulties in access to food and which we measure through FIES. Econometrically, we employ different matching techniques: entropy balancing, matching on propensity scores and fully interacting linear matching in order to assess the consistency of estimated impacts. The results indicate mixed food security effects depending on the type of service used. Use of savings accounts significantly decreases, use of credit significantly increases and use of formal payment services has no effect on the individual’s probability of experiencing food insecurity. Our findings are consistent with the view that the specific features rather than the range of services offered by formal financial sector is determinative in the final food security experience, especially when they can be assigned to positive income effects.
Q18|Постижения И Предизвикателства На Устойчивото Аграрно Развитие В България И Китай<BR>[Achievements and challenges of sustainable agrarian development in Bulgaria and China]|This paper summarizes the main achievements and most important challenges of agrarian sustainable development in Bulgaria and China at current stage. The study has found out that, in the last several decades in Bulgaria and China took place unprecedented modernization of institutional structure in agriculture as legislation and regulation framework has been innovated along with the extent and modes of public intervention/and support to the sector, the importance and diversity of provide and collective structure of production, marketing, food security, eco-management, etc. Simultaneously in Bulgaria and China and in the individual regions of each country exists a considerable specificity of socio-economic conditions, natural resources, institutional structure, cultural and historical development, efficiency of public governance and multiple challenges. The contemporary agrarian development in both countries is characterized with a number of similar socio-economic and ecological challenges most important of which are: low comparative productivity and competitiveness of a great portion of agricultural production; unequal public support to different type of farms, subsectors of production and regions of the country; increasing discrepancies in income and living standards of population in different regions, sectors of economy and type of economic organizations; insufficient involvement of all interested parties at all levels of decision making, control, sustainability assessment, etc.; aging of population in rural areas and lack if young and qualified labors in farms; existence of large informal sector with uncontrolled products for quality, safety, intellectual property, ecology, etc. and with dominating informal (including illegal) structures; significant adverse impact of agrarian development on agricultural lands, waters, air, biodiversity, etc.; serious risks for food security in the future in accordance with the trends in production and consumption, etc. Having in mind the importance of such comparative studies they have to continue and deepen with the employment of micro economic and other data, in-depth and case studies, etc.
Q18|Farewell to Agriculture? Productivity Trends and the Competitiveness of Agriculture in Central Asia|Agricultural productivity in the Central Asian republics of the USSR stopped growing from the late 1970s and declined in the 1990s when the transition to the market occurred. As a result, most agricultural goods were uncompetitive on the both the domestic market and the world market, and the agricultural trade balance deteriorated as imports grew faster than exports. Although there have been a few success stories – cereals in Uzbekistan, meat production in Azerbaijan, oil seeds in Kazakhstan – the overall picture is not one of agriculture as the driving force of the region’s future growth. We argue, however, that the relative decline of agriculture is consistent with international experience. In ‘economic miracle’ countries, the share of agriculture fell faster than in other countries because the sector donated labour to the industrial sector, which was the engine of growth. The problem in Central Asia is not the slow growth of agricultural output, but the slow growth of productivity in agriculture, which fails to increase the competitiveness of agricultural products and leads to an inability of the rural population to move to more productive industrial activities.
Q18|The Effects of Non‐tariff Measures on Agri‐food Trade: A Review and Meta‐analysis of Empirical Evidence|The increasing policy interest and academic debates on non‐tariff measures (NTMs) has stimulated a growing literature on how NTMs affect agri‐food trade. The empirical literature provides contrasting and heterogeneous evidence, with some studies supporting the ‘standards as catalysts’ view, and others favouring the ‘standards as barriers’ explanation. To the extent that NTMs can influence trade, understanding the prevailing effect, and the motivations behind one effect or the other, is a pressing issue. We review a large body of empirical evidence on the effect of NTMs on agri‐food trade and conduct a meta‐analysis to disentangle potential determinants of heterogeneity in estimates. Our findings show the role played by the publication process and by study‐specific assumptions. Some characteristics of the studies are correlated with positive significant estimates, others covary with negative significant estimates. Overall, we found that the effects of NTMs vary across types of NTM, proxies used for NTMs, and levels of detail of studies. The estimated effects are also influenced by methodological issues and publication processes.
Q18|Agricultural Productivity and Food Supply Stability in Sub-Saharan Africa: LSDV and SYS-GMM Approach|Food supply fluctuations remain a major challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In this regard, this study empirically examined the impact of agricultural productivity on food security stability in 37 selected countries in SSA from 1990 to 2016, using the pooled, least square dummy variable (LSDV), random and system generalized methods of moments (SYS-GMM) models. The study adopted per-capita food supply variability (PCFSV) as a measure of food security stability while agriculture value-added contribution to gross domestic product (AGVA) and crop production (CRPROD) were selected indicators of agricultural productivity. The LSDV and SYS-GMM model estimations revealed that agricultural productivity and the control factors contributed significantly, though with a mix of positive and negative effects, to food security stability in the selected countries in SSA during the period under review. The LSDV model showed that AGVA had no statistically significant positive effect on food security stability, however, this was corrected in the SYS-GMM model, but with a positive impact. The study concludes that stability in food security is achieved and sustained by improving agricultural productivity. Based on the findings, the study recommended that food security stability should be improved by enhancing agricultural productivity through ensuring effective implementation of pro-agriculture growth policies in SSA
Q18|How Is Climate Change Affecting Thailand’s Agriculture? A Literature Review with Policy Update|Agriculture in developing countries is the most sensitive economic sector when it comes to climate change. Thailand is one of the developing countries where agriculture plays a significant role and is likely vulnerable to the changing climate. Past studies investigated the impacts of climate change on Thailand’s agricultural sector, but they are fragmented, lack of synthetic results linking to national climate change policies. The objectives of this article are to review and synthesize recent studies investigating the climate change impacts on Thailand’s agricultural sector and update the current state of climate change policies in the sector. Several policies implications can be extracted from the study.
Q18|On the Evolution of Trade and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards: The Role of Trade Agreements|Trade agreements and trade measures are policy instruments thought to favour trade by providing a degree of harmonisation among members. We analyse how the agri-food trade and the incidence of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards (SPSs) have evolved within countries sharing agreements. We examine, through a regression discontinuity design, whether the approval of agreements affects the evolution of trade and SPSs over time, and quantify the trade effects of SPSs. We also provide differences before and after the introduction of agreements, and among the most regulated agri-food products. Findings show that trade agreements tend to favour the increase of trade and the reduction of policy measures between members. However, regulation inequalities exist across trade agreements covering different geo-economic areas: after the approval of agreements, the existence and the importance of SPSs become relevant among developing countries, whereas the pervasiveness of SPSs becomes less stringent between developed and developing countries. Our analyses also prove that trade agreements and trade measures are trade-enhancing only at aggregate level: product-specific analyses show that cereal is the only sector that benefits from the joint influence of trade agreements and SPSs. The harmonisation of SPSs within agreements may be determinant in avoiding distortions in favour of members.
Q18|The Benefits of Country-specific Non-Tariff Measures in World Wine Trade|During the last decades, significant changes in trade regulations are modifying the global trade of wine. The number of non-tariff measures (NTMs) implemented in the wine sector is relevant: a large number of country-specific NTMs, set in the occasion of trade agreements, have been adopted. The impact of these policy instruments on trade is not always clear, nor quantified at global scale. We investigate the effects that country-specific NTMs are showing on global imports of wine. In particular, we estimate a gravity model to explain how and to what extent country-specific NTMs influence wine trade, and we disentangle these effects for different segments of the international market of wine. Our results suggest that country-specific NTMs tend to favour imports of wine. Differences emerge across market segments and types of regulations. In particular, the Technical Barriers to Trade favour (friction) bottled (bulk) wine; pre-shipment inspections enhance imports of bottled wine; the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards and the export-related measures are the most trade-enhancing NTMs, regardless of the market segment.
Q18|On the impact of non-tariff measures on trade performances of African agri-food sector|The increasing interest of policymakers and academics on non-tariff measures (NTMs) has stimulated a growing literature on their effects on agri-food trade of African countries. The empirical evidence, however, are ambiguous: some studies suggest that NTMs are trade barriers, others suggest they have a catalyst role for trade. Understanding the drivers of these contrasting effects and the prevailing one would allow to draw important conclusions. We review, through a meta-analytical approach, a set of empirical studies that quantify the effects of NTMs on African agri-food trade. We find a prevalence of the trade-impeding effects. Our results also help explaining differences in NTMs’ effects due to methodological and structural heterogeneity. Moreover the effects of NTMs vary across types of NTMs and analysed commodities. We conclude by comparing our findings with existing literature and emphasize which research areas deserve further investigation such as intra-Africa trade or trade effects of technical NTMs.
Q18|Impact of Climate Variability on Staple Food Crops Production in Northern Togo|This study assesses the impact of climate variability on staple food crops production in the Northern regions of Togo using cereal and climate data over the period of 1972-2013. The linear mixed model and generalized linear mixed model are used. The results indicate that maize is the most vulnerable cereal affected by the inter-seasonal and the intra-seasonal variability of temperature and precipitation compared to sorghum and rice in the study areas. However, encouraging water management in rain-fed agriculture would increase the rice production in the study areas. Policy towards the adoption of new technology to improve maize yields and cope with climatic risks is needed. The investment in rain-fed water management, promoting the use of drought-tolerant seeds and improvement of agro-meteorological information and their integration in farmers’ decision making are needed.
Q18|Столица Казахстана: Институциональная Среда Агропродовольственного Рынка, Инфраструктура Продовольственного Снабжения Мегаполиса<BR>[The capital of Kazakhstan: the institutional environment of the agri-food market, the infrastructure of food supply of the megalopolis]|The resource base and market institutions of food supply of the suburban area of the capital of Kazakhstan are investigated.

Q18|Reinvigorating Cambodian agriculture: Transforming from extensive to intensive agriculture|In this paper we analysis to identify the factor constraining on Cambodian agriculture in transforming from extensive to intensive agriculture. The objective of this study was to examine the general situation of Cambodian agriculture by comparing with neighboring countries in Southeast Asia from a period of 22 years (1996 – 2018) through cultivate areas, technical using, technologies using, fertilizer using, agricultural infrastructure system, agricultural production cost, agricultural output, agricultural market and climate change. The results show that the Cambodian agriculture sector is still at a level where there is significant need to improve the capacity of farmers, the new technologies use and the prevention of climate change. However, the production cost is still high cost and agricultural output has been in low prices. It also causes for farmers to lose confidence in farming and they will be stop working in the sector. Moreover, we also have other policies to improve agriculture sector in Cambodia.
Q18|Oil price volatility spillover effects on food prices in Nigeria|Studies have been done on oil price volatility spillover effects on the prices of food in both pre-crisis and post-crisis periods. However, what has been sparingly studied is oil price volatility spillover effects on urban prices of food and rural prices of food. The disparity in the rural-urban spending in Nigeria is an area that can further be explored by evaluating the effects of oil price volatility spillover on prices of food in these areas. This study therefore adopts GARCH (1, 1)-TY model to evaluate the impulse response function and variance decomposition of these effects on prices of food in pre-crisis and post-crisis periods. Findings show that in full sample and post-crisis periods both aggregate price of food (APF) and urban average price of food (APFU) positively respond to oil price shocks while rural average price of food (APFR) responds negatively to oil price shocks. However, the response of the urban average price of food proves to be more significant in the post-crisis periods as it appears relatively most affected in this period by a greater percentage of oil price shocks.
Q18|A preliminary test on risk and ambiguity attitudes, and time preferences in decisions under uncertainty: towards a better explanation of participation in crop insurance schemes|The exposure of farmers to different (and increasing) risks has been recognized by the EU policy, which supports several risk management tools through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Despite the vulnerability of the agricultural sector, and the attention paid at the EU level, the uptake of such tools is generally low across EU countries. The Italian case is emblematic: the uptake of subsidized crop insurance contracts is low, limited to few products, and concentrated in few areas. Coherently, the interest of policy makers toward explaining these characteristics and in gaining insights on the interventions that may help promoting participation is intense. This contribution investigates behavioral aspects linked to choices under risk and ambiguity, and account for time preferences in order to mimic the scenario faced by the potential adopters of the subsidized crop insurance contracts in Italy. Data are collected through questionnaires submitted to students from agricultural colleges in three administrative regions located in northern, central and southern Italy. Results show that attitude toward risk, ambiguity, and impatience are correlated with the intrinsic characteristics of respondents. In addition, some of those attitudes may help explaining decisions under uncertainty. Despite the empirical analysis is preliminary and focused on students, it allowed to validate a promising methodological approach capable of explaining farmer’s willingness to adopt (or renew) insurance contracts. By accounting for (currently under-investigated) behavioral aspects, it is likely to prove useful to re-design or implementing, more effectively, the current policies.
Q18|The Cost- Benefit Analysis for Resilience in the Sahel Enhanced on Vulnerable households in Burkina Faso and Niger|The CBA for Burkina Faso and Niger, evaluated the projects for the interventions implemented in agriculture, poultry, and small ruminant value chains (VCs). The interventions, investment costs, and the number of beneficiaries in the VC for this CBA were such that agricultural VC interventions, Resilience and Economic Growth in the Sahel – Accelerated Growth (REGIS-AG’s) beneficiaries were 41,224 and 61,254 farmers respectively. This program assessed the “Sustainable Livelihoods Component” with a focus on Conservation Farming (CF). This encompasses the use of an assortment of climate-adapted farming practices to intensify agricultural productivity in the cowpea, millet, and sorghum VCs, with the objective of increasing the income of households and access to food. CF was introduced to 58,670 farmers in Burkina Faso and 24,280 farmers in Niger. The beneficiaries from the cowpea VC were 21,700 and 23,322 for the poultry VC, which was on chicken production the intervention reached 13,157 and 13,801 beneficiaries in Burkina – Faso and Niger, respectively.
Q18|Simulateur pédagogique des effets de répartition des soutiens de la PAC au niveau national| The latest reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which was decided by the Member States of the European Union in 2013, has again modified some of the modalities with which the different types of direct payments are allocated to farmers. The reform concerns first Pillar « decoupled » payments as well as « coupled » payments, and leaves Member States with a great flexibility in how to implement the various policy measures inside a common framework. In this paper, we present a tool (which was developed with Excel and is compatible with the LibreOffice package) which allows to simulate the implementation of the main aspects of the reform, and to assess their impacts both in terms of payment distribution across farms and in terms of income. Being an educational tool, it is neither an academic effort which would precisely model the impact of the latest reform, nor a device which would permit to estimate the exact amount of support a specific farmer could claim in practice. It is based on the French strand of the Farm Accounting Data Network (FADN) and allows to analyse the choices made by France in 2013, shedding light on the underlying rationale which may have motivated the decisions. Because its initial purpose was the lifelong training of agricultural yet non-CAP or non-economics specialist professionals, the proposed simulation tool comes with a user-friendly interface and has also already been used for the initial training of Agrocampus Ouest students and with an even larger audience during the INRA’s 70th birthday Open Days in Rennes in 2016. Building on these experiences, we are currently incorporating this simulation tool inside an Agreenium-IAVFF MOOC dedicated to the economics of the European agricultural policy.
Q18|On the role of probability weighting on WTP for crop insurance with and without yield skewness|A growing number of studies in finance and economics seek to explain insurance choices us- ing the assumptions advanced by behavioral economics. One recent example in agricultural economics is the use of cumulative prospect theory (CPT) to explain farmer choices regarding crop insurance coverage levels (Babcock, 2015). We build upon this framework by deriving willingness to pay (WTP) for insurance programs under alternative assumptions, thus extend- ing the model to incorporate farmer decisions regarding whether or not to purchase insurance. Our contribution is twofold. First, we study the sensitivity of farmer WTP for crop insurance to the inclusion of CPT parameters. We find that loss aversion and probability distortion in- crease WTP for insurance while risk aversion decreases it. Probability distortion in losses plays a particularly important role. Second, we study the impact of yield distribution skewness on farmer WTP assuming CPT preferences. We find that WTP decreases when the distribution of yields moves from negatively- to positively-skewed and that the combined effect of proba- bility weighting in losses and skewness has a large negative impact on farmer WTP for crop insurance.
Q18|Measuring Rice Yield from Space: The Case of Thai Binh Province, Viet Nam|Despite a growing interest in using satellite data to estimate paddy rice yield in Southeast Asia, significant cloud coverage has led to a scarcity of usable optical data for such analysis. In this paper, we study the feasibility of using two alternative sources of satellite data—(i) surface reflectance fusion data which integrates Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images, and (ii) L-band radar backscatter data from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) PALSAR-2 sensors—to circumvent the cloud cover problem and estimate yield in Thai Binh Province, Viet Nam during the second growing season of 2015. Our findings indicate that although Landsat– MODIS fusion data are not necessarily beneficial for paddy rice mapping when compared with only using Landsat data, fusion data allows us to estimate the peak value of various vegetation indexes and derive the best empirical relationship between these indexes and yield data from the field. We also find that the L-band radar data not only has a lower performance in paddy rice mapping when compared with optical data, but also contributes little to rice yield estimation.
Q18|In-Kind Transfer and Child Development: Evidence from Subsidized Rice Program in Indonesia|In the aftermath of the Asian financial crises, the Indonesian government launched a subsidized rice program called RASKIN in 1998 to moderate the shocks of food price inflation and reduced employment to poor households. The program has been continued since then with an objective to provide food security to poor families and is currently the largest in-kind transfer in Indonesia. Using data from five rounds of the Indonesian Family Life Survey covering the period of 1993–2014, we examine the impact of RASKIN on children’s health status. Using the difference-in-difference estimator, we find that children from the households that are beneficiaries of the RASKIN program show improved health status as measured by various anthropometric measures. We further investigate the long-run gains from RASKIN by tracing the health status of children aged between 0 and 5 years old in 1993 and 1997, respectively, until their adolescence/adulthood. We find evidence of improved anthropometric health outcomes for these children in later years. The gains are found to be higher for children who started receiving the subsidized rice in the early years of childhood.
Q18|Volatility Linkages between Energy and Food Prices: Case of Selected Asian Countries|We examine the linkages between energy price and food prices over the period 2000–2016 by using a Panel-VAR model in the case of 8 Asian economies: Bangladesh, the People’s Republic of China, Indonesia, India, Japan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Our results confirm that energy price (oil price) has a significant impact on food prices. According to the results of impulse response functions, agricultural food prices respond positively to any shock from oil prices. The findings from variance decomposition reveal that shares of oil prices in agricultural food price volatilities are the largest. In the second period 4.81%, and in the 20th period 62.49%, of food price variance is explained by oil price movements. We offer new policy insight. Since We also found that the impact of biofuel prices on food prices is statistically significant but explains less than 2% of the food price variance. However, by increasing the demand for biofuel, especially in advanced countries, there should be more concern about the global increase in agricultural commodities prices and endangering food security, especially in vulnerable economies.
Q18|Agricultural policy and long-run development: evidence from Mussolini's Battle for Grain|This paper explores the effect of agricultural policies on industrialization and economic development over the long-run. I analyze the differential effect of the \textit{Battle for Grain}, implemented by the Italian Fascist regime to achieve self-sufficiency in wheat production, on the development path across areas of Italy. Employing time variation, along with cross-sectional variation in the suitability of land for the implementation of the advanced wheat production technologies, I find that the policy had unintended positive effects on industrialization and economic prosperity which persisted until the contemporary period. Furthermore, I find that the positive effect of the \textit{Battle for Grain} on human capital accumulation was instrumental in this process, suggesting that the complementarity between human capital and agricultural technology may be a critical mechanism through which agricultural productivity may enhance the development of non-agricultural sectors.
Q18|Climate resilience pathways of rural households: evidence from Ethiopia| Climate variability and extreme events continue to impose significant challenges to households, particularly to those that are less resilient. By exploring the resilience capacity of rural Ethiopian households after the drought shock occurred in 2011, using panel data, this paper shows important socio-economic and policy determinants of households' resilience capacity. Three policy indications emerge from the analysis. First, government support programmes, such as the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP), appear to sustain households' resilience by helping them to reach the level of pre-shock total consumption, but have no impact on the food-consumption resilience. Secondly, the 'selling out assets strategy' affects positively households' resilience, but only in terms of food consumption ' not total consumption. Finally, the presence of informal institutions, such as social networks providing financial support, sharply increases households' resilience by helping them to reach preshock levels of both food consumption and total consumption.
Q18|The system-wide impact of healthy eating: assessing emissions and economic impacts at the regional level|Encouraging consumers to shift their diets towards to a lower meat/lower calorie alternative has been the focus of food and health policies across the world. The economic impact on regions has been less widely examined, but is likely to be significant, where agricultural and food activities are important for the host region. In this study we use a multi-sectoral modelling framework to examine the environmental and economic impacts of a dietary change, and illustrate this using a detailed model for Scotland. We find that if household food and drink consumption follows healthy eating guidelines, it would reduce both Scotlandâ€™s â€œfootprintâ€ and â€œterritorialâ€ emissions, and yet may be associated with positive economic impacts, generating a â€œdouble dividendâ€ for both the environment and the economy. Furthermore, the likely benefits to health suggest the potential for a â€œtriple dividendâ€ . The economic impact however depends critically upon how households use the income previously spent on higher calorie diets.
Q18|Targeting mechanisms for cash transfers using regional aggregates|Abstract We propose an empirical method for improving food assistance scoring and targeting, which minimizes under-coverage and leakage of food and cash assistance programs. The empirical strategy relies on a joint econometric estimation of food insecurity and economic vulnerability indicators at the household level, using data-driven instead of predetermined quantiles. We applied the method to recent micro data on Syrian refugees in Lebanon, to explore how regional and community-based aggregates can improve the targeting effectiveness of aid programs, notably food aid by the World Food Program in Lebanon. Our results confirm that using regional aggregates are useful for augmenting the Balanced Poverty Accuracy Criterion, and our method performs much better than the current policy in terms of targeting effectiveness and accuracy for economically vulnerable households.
Q18|Decomposition of changes in the consumption of macronutrients in Vietnam between 2004 and 2014|Vietnam is undergoing a nutritional transition like many middle-income countries. This transition is characterized by an increase in per capita total calorie intake resulting from an increase in the consumption of fat and protein while the carbohydrate consumption decreases. This paper proposes to highlight the sociodemographic drivers of this transition over the period 2004–2014, using Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey data. We implement a method of decomposition of between-year differences in economic outcomes recently proposed in the literature. This method decomposes the between-year change in various indicators related to the outcome distribution (mean, median, quantiles, etc.) into (1) the effect due to between-year change in the conditional distribution of the outcome given sociodemographic characteristics, or “structure effect”, and (2) the effect due to the differences in sociodemographic characteristics across years, or “composition effect”. In turn, this last effect is decomposed into direct contributions of each sociodemographic characteristics and effects of their interactions. The composition effect, always positive, generally outweighs the structure effect when considering the between-year changes in distributions of per capita calorie intake or calorie intake coming from protein or fat. The effects of changes in the composition of the Vietnamese population thus overcome the effects of changes in preferences of the same population. This finding is reversed in the case of carbohydrates. Food expenditure and household size appear to be the main contributors to the composition effect. The positive effects of these two variables explain well most of the between-year shifts observed in the calorie intake distributions. Urbanization and level of education contribute negatively to the composition effect, with the noticeable exception of fat where the effect of urbanization is positive. But these two variables effects are negligible compared to those of food expenditure and household size.
Q18|Sustainable diets: are nutritional objectives and low-carbon-emission objectives compatible?|Food systems in developed countries face one major challenge, namely the promotion of diets that are both healthy and generate less greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE). In this article, we review papers evaluating the impact of a change in diets on both health and GHGE. We address the following questions: How big are the health and environmental impacts that could be induced by a switch to healthier diets? What is, in monetary value, the relative importance of the health impact and the environmental impact? Is it possible to design an economic policy that increases global welfare taking into account externalities on both health and the environment? Since the way the change in diet is modeled is a key issue, we classify papers according to the methodology used for simulating diet changes: ad-hoc scenarios, optimized diets and economic modelling. We find that it is possible to design economic policies that have positive impacts on both dimensions. Because the substitutions / complementarities between food products are complex, it is not granted that a policy targeting one dimension will generate positive effects on the other dimensions. However, given the diversity of substitution and complementarity possibilities between products, it is possible to design a policy that does improve both dimensions. A carbon-based policy that targets the products with a high GHG content (e.g. meat products) and reinvests the revenues collected with the tax to subsidize the consumption of fruits and vegetables is likely to have positive effects on both dimensions.
Q18|Macronutrient balances and body mass index: a new insight using compositional data analysis with a total at various quantile orders|Vietnam launched the national Expanded Program on Immunization in 1981. Since then, this program has contributed signi cantly to the improvement of child health and to the reduction of child mortality rate. Despite of the fact that the coverage of the national EPI keeps expanding, the number of children who complied with the recommended immunization schedule remains low. This article studies the progress of the timeliness childhood immunization compliance among children between 0-5 years of age in Vietnam from 2006 to 2014 and analyzes the socio-economic factors that account for the changes of the compliance rate during this period. The dataset is extracted from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey in 2006 and 2014. We rst identify the socio-economic factors that impact on the vaccination compliance rate using a logistic regression model. Next, we apply the decomposition method to determine the contribution of each factor on the evolution of the timeliness childhood immunization compliance. The progress of the timeliness childhood immunization has been positive and the major contribution comes from the structure e ect (unmeasured e ect). Rural areas show a stronger improvement as of 2014. Among the socio-economic factors, mother education and birth order are the ones that have the larger in uence on the childhood immunization compliance rate. However, these factors have di erent implications in urban and rural areas. These ndings are critical to the current context of Vietnam where the government is designing a strategy focusing on the e ectiveness rather than the traditional coverage indicator.
Q18|Climate Resilience Pathways of Rural Households. Evidence from Ethiopia|This paper explores the resilience capacity of rural Ethiopian households after the drought shock occurred in 2011. The work develops an original empirical framework able to capture the policy and socio-economic determinants of households’ resilience capacity by making parametric statistical assumption on the resilience distribution. To this end, the analysis employs a two-wave representative panel dataset aligned with detailed weather records while controlling for a large set of household- and community-level characteristics. The analysis shows that the majority of these factors affects significantly resilience capacity only in the group of households affected by the drought shock, suggesting that the observed effect relates to the adaptive capacity enabled by these factors, rather than a simple welfare effect. Three policy indications emerge from the findings of the empirical model. First, government support programmes, such as the PSNP, appear to sustain households’ resilience by helping them to reach the level of pre-shock total consumption, but have no impact on the food-consumption resilience. Secondly, the “selling out assets strategy” affects positively on households’ resilience, but only in terms of food consumption. Finally, the presence of informal institutions, such as social networks providing financial support, sharply increases households’ resilience by helping them to reach pre-shock levels of food and total consumption. Policies incentivizing the formation of these networks, through the participation of households to agricultural cooperative, agricultural associations, or community projects, may also help farmers in recovering their wealth level after a weather shock.
Q18|Periurban Agriculture: do the Current EU Agri-environmental Policy Programmes Fit with it?|In the European Union (EU) periurban agriculture is under the same agri-environmental policy regime designed for general agriculture. We argue that the specific needs of periurban agriculture may justify ad hoc agri-environmental policy measures. We present results from a Choice Experiment (CE) performed on a sample of 600 people living in the municipality of Milan, which was designed to assess the willingness to pay (WTP) for ecological benefits generated by four agri-environmental practices implementable in the periurban area and already included in the Rural Development Programmes of the Lombardy region. Results suggest that a large population share is willing to pay to support an increase in the use of the agricultural practices studied with an average WTP ranging between 5.6 to 16.3 euro/person/year, according to the type of practice. These results are in contrast with their current low level of adoption. The sub-optimal uptake rate is likely due to an insufficient per hectare compensating payment, which is too low to cover the income foregone consequent to the adoption of sustainable agriculture measures in this area. The mismatch between the low uptake rate and the high social benefits generated by the four agri-environmental agricultural practices sheds light on the need to design agri-environmental policy programmes specifically targeted to periurban areas, where the costs of compliance with AEMs are high and the social benefits of their adoption are large.
Q18|How to Make Farming and Agricultural Extension More Nutrition-Sensitive: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial in Kenya| We analyze how agricultural extension can be made more effective in terms of increasing smallholder farmers adoption of pro-nutrition technologies, such as biofortified crops. In a randomized controlled trial with farmers in Western Kenya, we implemented several extension treatments and evaluated their effects on the adoption of beans that were biofortified with iron and zinc. Difference-in-difference estimates show that intensive agricultural training tailored to local conditions can increase technology adoption considerably. Within less than one year, adoption of biofortified beans increased from almost zero to more than 20%. Providing additional nutrition training further increased adoption by another 10-12 percentage points, as this has helped farmers to better appreciate the technology s nutritional benefits. These results suggest that effective nutrition training through agricultural extension services is possible. Providing marketing training did not lead to additional adoption effects, although the study period may have been too short to measure these effects properly. This study is a first attempt to analyze how improved designs of agricultural extension can help to make smallholder farming more nutrition-sensitive. More research in this direction is needed.

Q18|A Study on Taiwan s Food Dollar Series| Abstract For understanding the distribution of food dollar which we pay for our expenditure and how much Taiwanese farmers will earn from food dollar in the value added agriculture of Taiwan, this paper examines, with a filter of U.S. ERS food dollar series, Taiwan s food dollar series, including marketing bill series, industry group series, and primary factor series using Input-Output accounts of Taiwan. For sustainable development in Taiwan, it is better to transform from traditional agriculture to value-added agriculture. Since enhancing the competitiveness of agriculture and pursuing inclusive growth, it would be necessary to pay attention to farmers value and consider both farmers and agricultural supply chain to implement the effective and comprehensive agricultural policy.

Q18|Nutritional and economic impact of 5 alternative front-of-pack nutritional labels: experimental evidence|We study in a laboratory framed field experiment the impact of five Front of Pack labels (FOPL) on the nutritional quality and cost of a daily consumption basket. We employ a difference in difference experimental design, between subjects, to cleanly identify the impact of FOPL. 691 subjects issued from the general population shop twice within a catalog of 290 products: a first time without and a second unan-nounced time with labels. Purchases are real. We test five different labels and compare result against a benchmark treatment in which subjects shop twice with no labels. Labels include the existing Multiple Traffic Lights, Reference Intakes and Health Star Rating, and two newly proposed designs: NutriScore, a 5-color synthetic label, and SENS, a frequency-based recommendation label. We measure nutritional quality using the FSA score. All labels but Reference Intakes significantly improve nutritional quality. NutriScore is significantly more effective than all other labels, followed by the Australian Health Star and Multiple Traffic Lights. The nutritional improvements due to the labeling come at an economic cost, as the average cost of 2000Kcal increases for all labels. Nonetheless, we show that the extra cost for a unit nutritional improvement is borne mainly by richer households. Behaviorally, change is concentrated in the extremal categories of each label. Easier to understand labels have a higher impact and crowd out more successfully other information cues like ingredients lists and nutritional tables.
Q18|Assessing the distributional effects of carbon taxes on food: inequalities and nutritional insights|A carbon tax on food could contribute to emissions mitigation and act as a strong signal to economic actors. However, tax regressivity is a major disadvantage. This article addresses equity issues by several means. First, this article includes reallocation proposals in a revenue-neutral approach of several emission-based carbon taxation scenarios at the consumption level on food. Second, this article develops these proposals’ distributional incidence, and it evaluates the role of carbon pricing in policy impacts. With a carbon-based approach, the differing emission potentials of food groups highlight the relevance of using proteins as a tax base to redirect animal to plant sources in the diet. Thus, a scenario taxing foods rich in animal proteins and subsidizing plant proteins ones is built. Scanner data on French households in 2010 are analyzed. Several GHG emissions indicators and related nutritional impacts, such as diet quality scores and the shift from animal to plant proteins, are evaluated. Using individual changes in food expenditure, distributional effects based on continuous distribution and inequality indexes are measured, allowing the discussion of the policy options of a targeted vs nontargeted tax and a revenue-neutral approach in the food sector.
Q18|Impact of European food safety border inspections on agri-food exports: Evidence from Chinese firms|The cost of complying with a sanitary standard is certain. However, such measure introduces uncertainty for exporters in relation to border rejections. Shipments may fail to pass inspections and may be refused entry into the importing country. This risk is shaped by variance in the quality of the exported product, and the stringency of the border controls. We examine how the risk of rejection at European borders on safety grounds is affecting Chinese agri-food exporters. We combine information from the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed with Chinese firm-level export data by product, destination and year for the period 2000–2011. Information externalities and reputation effects are important. Border rejections amplify the turnover among firms at the extensive margin of trade. This risk is curbing small exporters and resulting in a concentration of Chinese exports among big exporters.
Q18|Peeling back the onion: Using latent class analysis to uncover heterogeneous responses to stated preference surveys|We develop validity tests for application to stated-preference estimates of WTP to reduce mortality risk, i.e., value per statistical life (VSL), and apply these to data obtained by surveying a representative sample of French adults over the internet. These tests (WTP nearly proportional to risk reduction, insensitive to small differences in baseline risk, increasing in income, and consistent with budget constraints) are satisfied by a conventional single-regression analysis of our data. Using latent class analysis (LCA), we identify important differences between respondents in their consistency with the validity tests and control for much of this heterogeneity. Estimates of VSL from the latent class that is consistent with the validity tests are smaller than estimates from the standard analysis. We estimate mean VSL for adults of about 2 million € and for children (based on parents' WTP) of about 6 million €.
Q18|Do European Agri-environment Measures Help Reduce Herbicide Use? Evidence From Viticulture in France|Agri-environmental schemes (AES) are a central component of the European environmental policy, but few of these schemes have been carefully evaluated and doubts are often expressed about their effectiveness. We use original data collected from winegrowers who participated in an AES targeting non-point source pollution from herbicides in 2011 and 2012 in the South region of France. Using the variation in the implementation of the scheme across time and space and a matching approach, we show that the quantity of herbicides used by participants in the scheme in 2011 ranges from 38 to 53% below what they would have used without the scheme and this percentage is between 42 and 50% in 2012. Further, our results suggest that least demanding AES options are effective in avoiding pollution peaks when weed pressure is high, whereas more demanding AES options guarantee an overall reduction in herbicide use, even during relatively easy farming years in which less weed pressure is experienced.
Q18|Can RCTs help improve the design of CAP|We illustrate how randomized controlled trials (RCTs) could be used as a learning tool to shed light on various aspects of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). RCTs are quasi-absent from the CAP evaluation toolbox, despite their frequent use to evaluate other European Union policies, or agricultural policies in developing countries. We draw upon existing debates on the role of RCTs in policy-making to derive a list of points of attention. We then consider four specific examples of evaluation questions for the CAP, and based on examples drawn from agricultural and social policies in developing and developed countries, argue that the RCT toolbox has the potential to significantly add to existing approaches to evaluating and designing components of the CAP.
Q18|Nutritional and economic impact of 5 alternative front-of-pack nutritional labels: experimental evidence|We study, in a laboratory framed field experiment, the impact of five Front of Pack labels (FOPL) on the nutritional quality and cost of a daily consumption basket. We employ a difference in difference experimental design, between subjects, to cleanly identify the impact of FOPL. 691 subjects issued from the general population shop twice within a catalog of 290 products: a first time without and a second unannounced time with labels. Purchases are real. We test five different labels and compare result against a benchmark treatment in which subjects shop twice with no labels. Labels include the existing Multiple Traffic Lights, Reference Intakes and Health Star Rating, and two newly proposed designs: NutriScore, a 5-color synthetic label, and SENS, a frequency-based recommendation label. We measure nutritional quality using the FSA score. All labels but Reference Intakes significantly improve nutritional quality. NutriScore is significantly more effective than all other labels, followed by the Australian Health Star and Multiple Traffic Lights. The nutritional improvements due to the labeling come at an economic cost, as the average cost of 2000Kcal increases for all labels. Nonetheless, we show that the extra cost for a unit nutritional improvement is borne mainly by richer households. Behaviorally, change is concentrated in the extremal categories of each label. Easier to understand labels have a higher impact and crowd out more successfully other information cues like ingredients lists and nutritional tables.
Q18|From Maputo to Malabo: Public Agricultural Spending and Food Security in Africa|Africa is the world's biggest battleground in the fight against hunger. African governments and the international development community have increasingly focused on finding ways and means to end hunger and ensure the right to food to the continent's burgeoning population. Public spending on agriculture is one such measure. This study examines the role government spending on agriculture has played in enhancing Africa's state of food security during the past 25 years. We examine whether this relationship varies over time and space. We explore various aspects of food security and check whether spending on research and development follows the same patterns as the overall public agriculture spending. We find little evidence of significant beneficial effects of public agricultural spending on food security as a whole. However, food security has improved in countries which spend more on agriculture. Spending on agricultural research and development too has shown a useful impact on Africa's food security. There also exists some evidence in favour of public spending's size and time effects. We conclude that the commitment by African government in the Maputo Declaration to allocate 10% of public spending to agriculture appears to be pertinent. JEL Classifications: 011, 055, Q18
Q18|Remittances and Dutch Disease: A Meta-Analysis|Remittance flows are an important source of foreign exchange for various developing countries around the world. Given their growing importance in the last decade, their role in inducing Dutch disease symptoms in the developing countries has been extensively studied. However, the results of the analyses so far have been mixed. In this study, we conduct a meta-analysis of existing literature to estimate the over all effect of remittances on receiving countries’ real effective exchange rate (REER). We run fixed and random effect meta-analysis on studies taken from EconLit, Google Scholar and various working paper series and examine a total of 53 regressions taken from seven published and unpublished studies. We come up with evidence of a net appreciation of real exchange rate in the developing countries. Both the fixed and random effect models indicate a highly significant impact of foreign remittances on the REER. The results show also that the nature of the dependent variable, countries considered and the econometric technique used influence the impact of remittances REER, However the type of data (panel or times series) does not affect the results. Our investigations support the presence of selection bias. The findings support the view that in spite of their utility for the recipient households, remittances pose a challenge to the developing country on the macroeconomic level.
Q18|On the role of probability weighting on WTP for crop insurance with and without yield skewness| A growing number of studies in finance and economics seek to explain insurance choices us- ing the assumptions advanced by behavioral economics. One recent example in agricultural economics is the use of cumulative prospect theory (CPT) to explain farmer choices regarding crop insurance coverage levels (Babcock, 2015). We build upon this framework by deriving willingness to pay (WTP) for insurance programs under alternative assumptions, thus extend- ing the model to incorporate farmer decisions regarding whether or not to purchase insurance. Our contribution is twofold. First, we study the sensitivity of farmer WTP for crop insurance to the inclusion of CPT parameters. We find that loss aversion and probability distortion in- crease WTP for insurance while risk aversion decreases it. Probability distortion in losses plays a particularly important role. Second, we study the impact of yield distribution skewness on farmer WTP assuming CPT preferences. We find that WTP decreases when the distribution of yields moves from negatively- to positively-skewed and that the combined effect of proba- bility weighting in losses and skewness has a large negative impact on farmer WTP for crop insurance.
Q18|Farm Size, Technology Adoption and Agricultural Trade Reform: Evidence from Canada|Using detailed census data covering over 40,000 farms in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada, we document the vast and increasing farm size heterogeneity, and analyze the role of farm size in adapting to the removal of an export subsidy in 1995. We find that larger farms were more likely to switch to new labor-saving tillage technologies in response to the large negative shock to grain prices caused by the reform. Small- and medium-sized farms responded to the reform by adopting the more affordable minimum tillage technology. We develop a simple model of heterogeneous farms and technology adoption that can explain our findings. The results suggest that farm size plays a crucial role in determining farm-level adaptation to agricultural trade reform. Consistent with the Alchian-Allen hypothesis, the increase in per-unit trade costs due to the reform was associated with farms shifting their production of crops from low-value wheat to higher value canola.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q18|Measuring the Impact of Agricultural Production Shocks on International Trade Flows|The purpose of this study is to measure the sensitivity of traded quantities and trade unit values to agricultural production shocks. We develop a general equilibrium model of trade in which production shocks in exporting countries affect both traded quantities and trade unit values. The model includes per-unit trade costs and develops a methodology to quantify their size exploiting the trade unit value data. Using bilateral trade flow data for a large sample of countries and agricultural commodities we find that the intensive margin of trade is relatively inelastic to production shocks, with a 1 percent increase in production leading to a 0.5 percent increase in exports. We also find that per-unit trade costs are large, comprising 15 to 20 percent of import unit values on average. Overall, our results suggest that there is room for improving trade as a mechanism for coping with food production volatility.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q18|Fertilizer and Sustainable Intensification in Africa|The paper investigates the important role of fertilizer to enhance sustainable intensification and food security in Sub-Saharan Africa based on a multi-disciplinary literature review. The review starts with a macro-perspective taking population growth, economic development and climate change into account. This is complemented with a micro-perspective summarizing findings from comprehensive micro-data in selected African countries. Agronomic, environmental and economic profitability implications of fertilizer use are reviewed. An assessment is made whether small farmers in Africa should be considered rational or partly irrational agricultural decision-makers and whether this can affect fertilizer use. I then discuss some controversial and promising policy approaches that may have the potential to enhance sustainable intensification and nutrient use efficiency in African agriculture before I conclude.
Q18|The Economics of Fertilizer Subsidies|Fertilizer and other input subsidies have been a prominent component of agricultural policies in many Asian and African countries since the 1960s. Their economic and political rationale is scrutinized with emphasis on the second generation of targeted input subsidy programs that were scaled up in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) after 2005. The extent to which they full-fill the goal of being ‘market smart’ is assessed after inspecting the potential for such subsidies in SSA. The new fertilizer subsidy programs do not live up the market smart principles and suffer from severe design and implementation failures. While a clear exit strategy was one of the key principles, this principle has been neglected with the result that most current programs are more ‘sticky’ than ‘smart’. They have only partially achieved the intended impacts and have resulted in a number of unintended negative impacts. Redesign should start from a pilot stage testing basic mechanisms.
Q18|2018 Iowa State University Land Value Survey: Overview|"Farmland represents over 80 percent of all U.S. farm assets, and is arguably often a farmer's single largest investment item, a major source of collateral, and a key component of the farmer's debt portfolio. Since 1950, the Iowa State University Land Value Survey has been the only data source that provides a county-level land value estimate for each of the 99 counties in Iowa. The 2018 Iowa State University Land Value Survey reported a 0.8 percent decrease to $7,264 per acre in average Iowa farmland values from November 2017 to November 2018. This modest drop is the fourth decline in Iowa farmland values over the past five years and represents a 17 percent decline from the 2013 peak in nominal land values, or a 24 percent drop in inflation-adjusted values. The recent decline is largely attributable to lower commodity prices, higher interest rates, and to some extent the trade disruptions. On the other hand, the magnitude of this decline is still very modest and overall the land market is largely stable. In general, the results from the 2018 Iowa State University Land Value Survey echo results from other surveys, which all showed relatively stable farmland market trends.

Q18|Livestock Transfers, Food Security and Women’s Empowerment: Evidence from a Randomized Phased-in Program in Nicaragua|This paper explores the impact of a livestock transfer program, that targeted small-holder female farmers with high levels of food insecurity in Nicaragua. For this purpose, the three dimensions of food security are assessed (i.e. access, availability and food use). The analysis uses a double difference estimation combined with a propensity score matching to capture the effects of program participation on a sample of 1200 farmers, representative of treatment and control groups. Also, taking advantage of a randomized phased-in, the findings are tested for a smaller sample of beneficiary farmers. The results confirm that program participation improve households’ food security through higher income from livestock sales and home consumption from own production (i.e. access and availability). Also, some evidence is found that food use is also improved by greater protein intake. Moreover, positive impacts on women’s empowerment and gender parity within the household are found, mainly driven by higher level of associativity.
Q18|Looking beyond the farm and household: Determinants of on-farm diversification in India|"This paper analyses the factors affecting on-farm diversification decision. Notwithstanding the influence of farm and household conditions, studies have also highlighted the role of external pull factors on farm diversification. Though appraised in scholarship, this aspect has eluded an empirical scrutiny in literature. Taking India as a case, this study shows that apart from farm and household factors, there is a broader agro-ecological and structural feature which impacts on-farm diversification decision. Correcting for endogeneity in a seemingly unrelated system of ordered probit models, a ""three-stage"" residual inclusion model is estimated. The findings show that proximity to social infrastructure such as schools, colleges, and access to public transport matters for diversification. Results also show that though urbanization may increase demand for variety of products, it might as well impinge upon farm labor supply as non-farm opportunities also rises with urbanization. Thus, the underlying structure of the local economy also merits attention while understanding on-farm diversification process."

Q18|Unfair trading practices in the dairy farm sector: Evidence from selected EU regions|This report examines the incidence of unfair trading practices (UTPs) in the dairy food supply chain. Drawing insights from data collected through a field survey among dairy farmers in five selected EU regions (France, Germany, Poland and Spain) we seek to understand the presence of UTPs across different stages of contract development. The survey data were collected in 2017 and in total it includes 1248 observations. We identify a total of 17 UTPs across all different phases of contract development. Results show that 98% of surveyed farmers have reported at least one UTP.

Q18|An Apple a Day? Adult Food Stamp Eligibility and Health Care Utilization Among Immigrants|In this study, we document the effect of Food Stamp access on adult health care utilization. While Food Stamps is one of the largest safety net programs in the U.S. today, the universal nature of the program across geographic areas and over time limits the potential for quasi-experimental analysis. To circumvent this, we use variation in documented immigrants' eligibility for Food Stamps across states and over time due to welfare reform in 1996. Our estimates indicate that access to Food Stamps reduced the likelihood of an adult visiting a physician more than twice in one year, but had no significant effect on the likelihood of having any physician visits. This result does not appear to be due to changes in physical or mental health, or due to individuals with common chronic health conditions, leaving open the possibility that changes in nutrition or resources may reduce the need for physician visits. Additionally, we find that for single women, Food Stamps increased the affordability of specialty health care, which may have further reduced the need for physician visits. These findings have important implications for cost-benefit analyses of the Food Stamp program, as reductions in health care utilization due to Food Stamps may offset some of the program's impact on the overall government budget due to the existence of government-provided health insurance programs such as Medicaid.
Q18|Do Walmart Supercenters Improve Food Security?|This paper examines the effect of Walmart Supercenters, which lower food prices and expand food availability, on household and child food insecurity. Our food insecurity-related outcomes come from the 2001-2012 waves of the December Current Population Study Food Security Supplement. Using narrow geographic identifiers available in the restricted version of these data, we compute the distance between each household’s census tract of residence and the nearest Walmart Supercenter. We estimate instrumental variables models that leverage the predictable geographic expansion patterns of Walmart Supercenters outward from Walmart’s corporate headquarters. Results suggest that closer proximity to a Walmart Supercenter improves the food security of households and children, as measured by number of affirmative responses to a food insecurity questionnaire and an indicator for food insecurity. The effects are largest among low-income households and children, but are also sizeable for middle-income children.
Q18|Trade and terroir. The political economy of the world’s first geographical indications|The world’s first geographical indications (GIs) were in the wine sector and focused on the delineation of the location of production, the ‘terroirs’: the Burgundy wines in the fifteenth century, the Port wines and Chianti wines in the eighteenth century, and the Champagne wines in the early twentieth century. We analyze the causes for the introduction of these GIs (‘terroirs’) and for changes in their delineation (expansion) later on. Trade played a very important role in the creation of the ‘terroirs’ but the mechanisms through which trade stimulated GIs varied. For the Port and Chianti GIs it was exports to foreign markets (Britain) that were crucial; for Burgundy it was domestic trade to Paris; and for the Champagne GI it was not exports but pressure from wine imports and new wine regions that played a crucial role. For the expansions of the GIs later in history, other factors seem to have been more important. Expansions of the GIs in the years and centuries after their introduction followed (1) major changes in political power; (2) the spread of a new philosophy in liberal and free markets across Europe; (3) and infrastructure investments which opened up markets and made exports cheaper from “new” producers.
Q18|Jobs and Agricultural Policy : Impact of the Common Agricultural Policy on EU Agricultural Employment| This paper investigates the relationship between agricultural subsidies and the outflow of labor from agriculture. We use new and more representative subsidy indicators than have been used before and panel data from 215 EU regions over the period 2004-2014. The data allow to correct better for sample selection bias than previous empirical studies. We find that, on average, CAP subsidies reduce the outflow of labor from agriculture, but the effect is entirely due to decoupled payments and rural development payments. Coupled payments have no impact on reducing labor outflow from agriculture, i.e. on preserving farm employment. Acknowledgement :
Q18|The Value of Terroir. A historical analysis of Bordeaux and Champagne geographical indications|Previous studies on the value of terroir, or more generally geographical indications (GI), used hedonic techniques. We use historical data and exploit temporal and geographical variations in the introduction of wine GIs in early twentieth century France to study the impact on the price of specific wines in the years and decades following their introduction. We find large effects of GIs on prices of some Champagne wines, but no significant impact on Bordeaux or other Champagne wines.
Q18|Regional differences in willingness to pay for organic vegetables in Vietnam|The concern about vegetable safety, together with a booming population and the rise of the middle class has made Vietnam become a potential market for organic vegetables. This paper investigates the determinants of willingness to pay (WTP) for organic vegetables in Hanoi, Vietnam with a particular attention to regional differences and the effect of risk perception. Using Contingent Valuation Method to analyze the data from a sample of 498 consumers in Hanoi, the paper shows that the perceived use values of organic vegetables, trust in organic labels, and disposable family income increased WTP for organic vegetables in both urban and rural regions. Though risk perception of conventional vegetables was high in both regions, such heightened risk perception just translated into the WTP in the rural region. In addition, the percentage of home-grown vegetables in the total vegetable consumption of the family influenced the WTP in the rural region only. Moreover, being an organic purchaser was positively related to the WTP in the urban region but not in the rural region. The paper also discusses three policy implications for Vietnam to boost the demand for organic food.
Q18|Brown Sugar, how come you taste so good? The impact of a soda tax on prices and consumption|Increasing obesity-related problems and rising healthcare expenditures have led governments in developed countries to consider the introduction of soda taxes. We study a recent such tax, implemented in Portugal, using extremely detailed panel data from one of the two largest retailers in the country, covering the period between February 2015 and January 2018. We take advantage of the tax breakdown by sugar levels to examine how soda prices and quantities purchased reacted. For identification, we rely on di erence-in-differences models with various vectors of fixed effects, comparing each group of products to water. For drinks with more than 80 grams of sugar per liter, results indicate almost full price pass-through to the consumer. For drinks with less than 80 grams of sugar per liter, price pass-through surpassed 100%. Regarding consumption, our findings suggest stockpiling behavior in the quarter when the tax was approved and before it was actually implemented. In the implementation period, there are no significant changes in quantities purchased for most beverages vis-a-vis water, with the exception of soda drinks with comparatively low levels of sugar. This suggests that benefits of the soda tax in terms of reducing sugar intake are mainly due to reformulation, as producers reduced the sugar content of some drinks to fall below the 80 grams per liter threshold.
Q18|Do Walmart Supercenters Improve Food Security?|This paper examines the effect of Walmart Supercenters, which lower food prices and expand food availability, on household and child food insecurity.

Q18|Synergies and trade-offs between adaptation, mitigation and agricultural productivity: A synthesis report|This report develops quantitative and qualitative frameworks to test the possibility of systematically assessing a range of policies and their intended and unintended effects. The analysis spans the three policy objectives of enhanced productivity, climate change mitigation, and climate change adaptation. The preliminary findings and lessons learned are drawn from two applications of a qualitative framework (France and the Netherlands), where information was gathered through a wide-ranging questionnaire, and from two applications of a quantitative modelling framework which was tested using data from Finland and from selected sites in one region of the United States.
Q18|Modelling Policy Coherence Between Adaptation, Mitigation and Agricultural Productivity|This paper develops theoretical and quantitative analysis to identify the potential synergies and trade-offs inherent in various policy instruments that address agricultural productivity, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and water quality objectives. The theoretical model used describes crop production choices made by farmers given different sets of government policies and whereby crop yields can be impacted by climate change. Quantitative results on the basis of Finnish data show that decoupled area payment appears to provide more trade-offs than other policy instruments as it increases greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nutrient runoff, and decrease total factor productivity and social welfare relative to a situation with no policy. Nitrogen fertiliser tax, a soil GHG emission tax, and a subsidy for green set-aside perform well with respect to all other objectives with the exception of adaptation to climate change. These policy instruments significantly reduce GHG emissions and nutrient runoff, and thus their social welfare performance is high.
Q18|The role of agriculture in global GHG mitigation|Agriculture is a major emitter of greenhouse gases. Its potential to contribute to limiting global warming to less than 2oC by the end of the century is substantial by reducing direct emissions in crop and livestock production, by reducing indirect emissions associated with changes in land use, and by increasing carbon sequestration. Technological advancements and changes in consumer preferences that result in land-sparing are particularly promising options given food security concerns. Gains in total factor productivity will also enhance the sector’s competitiveness. Changes in domestic and trade policies are essential to maximize mitigation potential. In the absence of global application of carbon pricing, international co-ordination is needed to ensure that national mitigation efforts result in carbon reallocation, i.e. shifts in the location of production to low emissions sources. Measures of emissions relative to the economic contribution of agricultural activities can be insightful for identifying national mitigation priorities.
Q18|Reforming water policies in agriculture: Lessons from past reforms|Agriculture’s water quality and quantity challenges continue to grow in many regions of the world. Policy solutions have been identified, but not always applied where needed nor implemented effectively. This report analyses eight past water and agriculture policy changes in OECD countries with the aim to identify steps towards adopting and implementing such solutions effectively. Selected reforms are assessed systematically via an institutional change analysis and a cross-cutting comparison of political economy factors. A characterisation of reforms is proposed according to the scope of the reform process, the scope of the reform’s action, and the involvement of governments in the design of reforms and their implementation. The comparison of agriculture and water policy changes shows that introducing reforms can be facilitated by exogenous factors, including droughts and floods, and reform design features. Meanwhile, the outcome of reforms can be affected by their geographical scale and scope, the dynamic pattern of reform pathways, and compensation for farmers. There are, however, trade-offs between the effects of these factors on the reform’s ambition, effectiveness, efficiency, and flexibility.
Q18|Land use and ecosystem services|This report assesses the crucial drivers of ecosystem services and proposes actions to develop a more effective policy mix. Several elements form the basis of this report. First, a literature review provides an overview of the state and trends of ecosystem services linked to agriculture, including issues related to land use. Secondly, results are presented from a quantitative model developed to illustrate the potential benefits of improving policy design as well as to investigate synergies and trade-offs among ecosystem services. This report also includes a review of experiences in an inventory of ecosystems in selected countries and policy initiatives that address ecosystem services linked to agriculture.
Q18|Agro-food trade, GVCs and agricultural development in ASEAN|The countries that compromise the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have expanded their involvement in global agro-food trade through strong regional production growth and increasing consumer demands from population growth and higher incomes. Regional and international agro-food markets have thus become an important source of income and food for the regions producers and consumers. However, growth in trade has lessened in recent years with projections suggesting a further slowing over the medium term. This study explores the role that agro-food trade and participation in agro-food global value chains (GVC) has had on regional agro-food sectors and current barriers that are holding the region back from unlocking the full benefits of further integration into regional and global agro-food markets. It finds that although GVC engagement has increased regional agro-food growth between 2004 and 2014, gaps remain in the level of regional integration. Results from the analysis suggest that reducing the remaining tariff and non tariff barriers, and creating an enabling environment to allow agricultural producers to better access service inputs, will help spur sector growth and agricultural incomes.
Q18|ASEAN rice market integration: findings from a feasibility study|This study explores feasibility of regional rice market integration by examining the impacts on production and trade, with a specific focus on the adjustment impacts for rice producers. It seeks to set out policy measures required to better integrate the rice markets of Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) countries and the role that trade policy can play to help the agricultural sector adjust to pressures created from freer trade in rice within this region. While regional rice market integration can deliver more rice at lower prices to the regions consumers, this study finds significant adjustments to the rice sectors will be required in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. However, opportunities through lowering tariff barriers with existing key trading partners of free trade agreements has the scope to create more employment and value adding opportunities in all agricultural sectors to offset the losses from regional rice market integration. The study suggests a number of measures are necessary to build trust in regional markets to allow rice market integration to take place. This includes an agreement to ban export restrictions. Furthermore, while broader trade reforms will help create new opportunities for agricultural sectors across the ASEAN region, flanking policies and investments in the enabling environment are still required for the sectors to take full advantage of these opportunities.
Q18|Boosting productivity and living standards in Thailand|The Prosperity pillar of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development calls for an integrated approach based on boosting productivity through diversification, upgrading technology and innovation, and increasing employment and entrepreneurship. Thailand needs to address all these challenges to achieve high-income country status by 2036. Over the past decade, limited structural reform and capital investment have held back productivity growth and improvements in well-being, and Thailand has lost ground vis-à-vis regional comparators. More recently, however, economic growth has started to regain momentum helped by a pick-up in global trade, which has supported exports, and by a substantial public infrastructure investment programme. Moving forward, Thailand will need to boost productive capacity in the face of intensified competition with regional peers and rapid demographic ageing. In addition, productivity gains will be increasingly necessary to drive growth. Key areas of focus include improving human resource development, encouraging technology diffusion via cluster development, promoting innovation and digitalisation, improving the SME policy framework and expanding regional integration, as emphasised in the government’s 12th Plan and Thailand 4.0. This Working Paper relates to the Initial Assessment report of the Multi-dimensional Country Review of Thailand (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/multi-dimensional-review-thailand.htm)
Q18|Agriculture, Food and Jobs in West Africa|The food economy is the biggest employer in West Africa accounting for 66% of total employment. While the majority of food economy jobs are in agriculture, off-farm employment in food-related manufacturing and service activities is increasing as the food economy adapts to rapid population growth, urbanisation and rising incomes. Given the importance of the food economy in generating employment, its current structure and projected changes have major implications for the design of jobs strategies. This paper quantifies and describes the structure of employment in the food economy across four broad segments of activities: agriculture, processing, marketing and food-away-from home. It also examines some of the emerging spatial implications, in particular rural-urban linkages and rural employment diversification, which are related to the transformations that are reshaping this sector. Finally, it looks at policy considerations for designing targeted employment strategies that leverage the links between agricultural productivity, off-farm employment and rural-urban areas and ensure inclusiveness, particularly for youth and women.
Q18|Disentangling urban and rural food security in West Africa|Strategies to fight hunger and early warning systems often focus on identifying food crises rather than longer-term trends, and concentrate on rural areas. Data on the food and nutrition security situation of West Africa’s growing urban population is scarce and fragmented. Using geo-referenced information available in the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), this report estimates the total number and prevalence of under-nutrition and over-nutrition in West Africa for both urban and rural areas. The analysis reveals that almost 110 million people in West Africa are not receiving the correct nutrition for their needs. Over 58 million people in the region are underweight, 22 million of which live in cities. Another 52 million are either overweight or obese, the large majority of whom are adult urban dwellers. This situation reveals the severity of the “double burden” of under- and over-nutrition. It also calls for greater efforts to identify appropriate metrics to monitor food and nutrition security in urban areas.
Q18|Agriculture, alimentation et emploi en Afrique de l’Ouest|L’économie alimentaire est le premier employeur en Afrique de l’Ouest, avec 66% de l’emploi total. Bien que la majorité de ces emplois soient encore dans l’agriculture, les activités non agricoles liées à l’alimentation progressent à mesure que le secteur s’adapte à l’évolution démographique, à l’urbanisation et à la croissance des revenus. Compte tenu du nombre d’emplois concernés, disposer d’une vision claire des perspectives de l’économie alimentaire est essentiel. Cette Note vise à quantifier et décrire la répartition de l’emploi dans les segments de l’agriculture, de la transformation, de la commercialisation et de la restauration hors domicile. Elle analyse les implications spatiales des transformations en cours, en particulier les interactions urbain-rural et la diversification de l’emploi rural. Enfin, elle propose des pistes politiques pour des stratégies d’emploi ciblées qui optimisent les synergies entre productivité agricole, emploi non agricole et interactions urbain-rural, et garantissent l’inclusion, en particulier des jeunes et des femmes.
Q18|Distinguer sécurité alimentaire urbaine et rurale en Afrique de l'Ouest|Les stratégies de lutte contre la faim et les systèmes d'alerte précoce se concentrent souvent sur les zones rurales et l'identification des crises alimentaires, plutôt que sur les tendances à plus long terme. Les données sur la sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle des populations urbaines, en forte croissance, sont rares et parcellaires. En utilisant les informations géoréférencées des Enquêtes démographiques et de santé (EDS), cette Note estime le nombre total et la prévalence de la sous-nutrition et de la surnutrition en Afrique de l'Ouest aussi bien en milieu rural qu’urbain. L'analyse révèle que près de 110 millions de personnes en Afrique de l'Ouest n’ont pas une alimentation adéquate à leurs besoins nutritionnels. Plus de 58 millions de personnes souffrent d'insuffisance pondérale, dont 22 millions en ville. Les autres 52 millions sont en surpoids ou obèses, dont la grande majorité sont des citadins de plus de 15 ans. Ces résultats montrent la gravité du «double fardeau» de la sous-nutrition et surnutrition et appellent à renouveler les efforts en matière de développement d’outils de suivi de la sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle en milieu urbain.
Q18| ¿Semillas mejoradas como escape de la pobreza? Evidencia cualitativa y cuantitativa para la sierra sur del Perú| El presente trabajo tiene como finalidad esclarecer y cuantificar los potenciales efectos de la adopción de tecnologías agrícolas ―semillas mejoradas― en la reducción de la pobreza rural, enfocándose en los hogares productores a pequeña escala en los Andes peruanos del sur. Para ello se emplea un método de análisis basado en el ‘propensity score matching’ para hallar las relaciones causales del tratamiento. Los resultados indican que existe una relación robusta y significativa entre la adopción de dichas tecnologías y el bienestar de los agricultores, aunque estos resultados dependen en gran medida del tamaño de la parcela y de la proporción regada de la misma. Asimismo, la evidencia cualitativa indica que la asistencia técnica y capacitación (semillas y tecnificación del riego) deben de ser implementadas tomando en cuenta las características idiosincráticas y culturales de los poblados andinos, además de hacerlos parte del planteamiento de la solución al problema de la baja productividad agrícola. El reto de mitigar la pobreza debe pasar por un acompañamiento no solo durante el proceso de producción agrícola, sino también en el proceso de articulación al mercado y organización empresarial de los productores.

Q18|Establishing the Link Between Poverty and Changes in Climatic Conditions in the Philippines|This paper investigates whether changes in climatic conditions significantly contribute to incidence of poverty in the Philippines. Due to the lack of sufficient regional estimates of poverty, this study utilized food cpi data to proxy for poverty level. The relationship between poverty level and food cpi were tested and found to be moving in parallel direction, and hence, could be substituted for each other for this study’s purposes. The relationship between poverty and food prices has also been verified in the literature, as higher food prices is the dominant variable that results in higher poverty levels. The results show that higher agricultural wages as well as extreme climate-influenced shocks such as El Niño and La Niña were significant determinants of poverty. Higher agricultural wage benefits agricultural workers, but the income effect may be small, and that overall, the net effect of is higher food prices that, in turn, exacerbates overall poverty. The negative impact of El Niño and La Niña on food prices (and therefore, poverty level) could be attributed to the consistent and appropriate government response to these weather shocks, which have stabilized supply of food. Government programs to stock up on rice during weather shocks, and the automatic assistance to farmers during calamities, have had the overall effect of neutralizing the potential poverty impacts of climate-related shocks. These are useful insights in carving out a climate-resilient economic development plan, and emphasize the importance of timely and appropriate government action and adaptation programs.
Q18|On structural change, the social stress of a farming population, and the political economy of farm support|A rationale for providing support to the farm sector in the course of economic development and structural change is a growing gap between the incomes of non‐agricultural workers and the incomes of farmers. Drawing on a model that enables us to analyze the level of social stress experienced by farmers as employment shifts from the farm sector to other sectors, we find that even without an increasing gap between the incomes of non‐agricultural workers and the incomes of farmers, support to farmers might be needed/can be justified. This result arises because under well‐specified conditions, when the size of the farm population decreases, those who remain in farming experience increasing aggregate social stress. The increase is nonlinear: it is modest when the outflow from the farm sector is relatively small or when it is large, and it becomes more significant when the outflow is moderate. This finding can inform policymakers who seek to alleviate the social stress of the farming population as to the timing and intensity of that intervention.
Q18|Do Campaign Contributions from Farmers Influence Agricultural Policy? Evidence From a 2008 Farm Bill Amendment Vote to Curtail Cotton Subsidies|Farmers in the United States receive billions of dollars per year from federal farm support programs. While the nature of these programs has evolved since the Great Depression, they both persist and expand with the passage of every farm bill. This paper studies the political activities of individual farmers and the political action committees that represent their interests by exploiting a vote to amend the 2008 farm bill that, had it passed, would have curtailed a cotton subsidy program. I find evidence that cotton farmers contribute substantially to campaigns in the House of Representatives. The more a cotton farmer receives in farm subsidies, the more likely they are to make political contributions. Further, there is evidence that cotton farmers contribute substantially to non-local races, and that these contribution patterns closely resemble those of cotton political action committees. Results on the effectiveness of these contributions in influencing legislative outcomes is inconclusive. Key Words: Agricultural Policy, Lobbying, Rent Seeking, Campaign Finance
Q18|Campaign Contributions Made by Farmers: Does Geography Affect Behavior?|This essay contains a reduced form analysis of campaign contributions made by subsidy receiving farmers, in order to better understand if contribution strategies for campaigns in the House of Representatives by individual farmers differ based on whether or not the candidate represents their local congressional district, a non-local congressional district within the donor?s state, or an out of state congressional district. This is accomplished by applying a Tobit model to a panel of contributions, recording zero values of farmers in a given congressional district contribute nothing to a given legislator. Results indicate that farmers appear to contribute heavily to local campaigns regardless of the power of the legislator to influence agricultural legislation, while the ability of legislators to influence agricultural legislation becomes a more important driver of campaign contributions in more distant elections.

Q18|Farmer Campaign Finance: Determinants of Contributions to Political Action Committees|Over the years, farmers have effectively lobbied for advantageous farm policy through organizing effective political action. An extensive literature studies the activities of farming political action committees (PACs), and the effects these activities have on farm programs. This literature treats farming PACs as exogenous entities. However, the origins of their funding support remains unexplored. This research empirically assesses possible determinants of political contributions from farmers to farming PACs, using a correlated random effects Tobit model to assess the impact of farm production characteristics and policy regimes on contributions to farming PACs and political parties.

Q18|Agricultural Disaster Payments: Are They Still Politically Allocated?|This paper studies the allocation of agricultural disaster subsidies. Exploiting a regime change in agricultural disaster policy which occurred with the passage of the 2008 Farm Bill, disaster subsidy disbursement under both the 2005-2007 Crop Disaster Program and the SURE program that ran from 2008-2014 are estimated, and the effects of political factors on subsidy disbursement are compared. Results indicate that the transition from ad-hoc emergency disaster programs to a permanent agricultural disaster program did not reduce the political allocation of agricultural disaster subsidies, in contrast to results from the FEMA disaster payment literature.

Q18|Brexit No Deal: The Budgetary Impact on CAP - Greece and the EU27|The EU and the UK are currently negotiating the framework of a new bilateral relationship as a result of the UKâ€™s decision to leave the EU. This briefing paper explores the direct consequences of Brexit on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Budget of the European Union for final years (2019-2020) of the current Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) and investigates the ramifications for CAP Budgets of all EU Member States with a case study of Greece. Drawing on various recent contributions to the debate on the consequences of Brexit and the future of Europe, such as the research for the EU AGRI Committee and the budgetary research conducted by Alan Matthews. The paper will evaluate the scenario that the UK leaves the EU without a deal on the 29th March 2019 resulting in no transition deal or financial settlement. This scenario would leave an unprecedented funding gap for final year and three quarters of the current MFF period. This paper will also evaluate the options the EU has in order to limit the budgetary impact. The negotiations see both the EU and UK increasing rhetoric of a â€˜No Dealâ€™ outcome and both preparing for the consequences of a â€˜No Dealâ€™, thus the significance of understanding the potential implications of a â€˜No Dealâ€™ is of increasing importance.
Q18|Cincuenta años de la economía del Cesar: De la agroindustria del algodón a la extracción del Carbón|El Cesar es uno de los cuatro departamentos del Caribe colombiano que se constituyeron en la década de los sesenta del siglo XX. En los cincuenta años transcurridos desde su creación, su economía experimentó cambios estructurales ya que pasó de ser una región primordialmente agropecuaria a ser una economía minera. Este estudio analiza la historia económica cesarence basada en tres etapas de su desarrollo: (i) los primeros 12 años correspondieron a una bonanza económica generada por la agroindustria del algodón, donde tuvo un alto crecimiento económico y alcanzó uno de los mayores ingresos per cápita del país; (ii) luego, entró durante dos décadas en una etapa de estancamiento, por la crisis algodonera que afectó otras actividades como la ganadería y, además, fue un periodo de inseguridad en el campo por las acciones de grupos al margen de la ley; y (iii) en los últimos 17 años la minería de carbón se ha convertido en la actividad que genera el mayor porcentaje de su producto interno bruto y provee regalías que han incrementado las arcas de los presupuestos municipales y departamental. **** ABSTRACT: Cesar was one of the four departments in the Colombian Caribbean region that was constituted 1960s. During the last five decades its economy has faced important structural changes, such as going from an agricultural model to a mining dependent economy. This paper analyzes the economic history of the department based on three stages of its development. The first 12 years corresponded to the boom of the cotton agroindustry, where the main characteristic was a high economic and population growth, with one of the highest per capita income in the country. Then, the department went through a two decade stagnation period mainly caused by the cotton’s production crisis where some other primary sector activities were also affected. On top of that, it was a period of increasing violence due to the terrorist actions from illegal armed groups. The last period of analysis covers the last 17 years where coal mining strengthened and became the activity that generates the highest participation of Cesar’s gross domestic product and provides economic resources for municipal and departmental governments.

Q18|La persistencia de la coca en Colombia: El suplicio de SÍSIFO|Un estudio empírico para 1999-2016 sobre las dinámicas de las superficies de coca a escala municipal, analizando su persistencia y su endogeneidad con las políticas de control: erradicación aérea y manual, el desarrollo alternativo, las incautaciones y la destrucción de laboratorios. Las extensiones de los cultivos contemplan tanto la cosecha, como la siembra, utilizando información censal y sumándole un estimativo de la erradicación, respectivamente. Los hechos estilizados muestran altibajos en esfuerzos y resultados, así como limitadas integralidad y cobertura. Con información completa para 543 municipios, la relación entre las áreas y las políticas fue estimada mediante un modelo dinámico de datos de panel, considerando las relaciones de endogeneidad y temporalidad, mostrando una elevada inercia de la coca y exogeneidades anuales, las cuales fueron mitigadas parcialmente por los efectos rezagados de la erradicación y del desarrollo alternativo, quedando pendiente de intervenir sus determinantes estructurales.
Q18|Respuesta del consumidor a la información sobre la huella de carbono de los alimentos: un análisis usando un experimento de elección discreta|Resumen El alto impacto ambiental de la demanda por proteína animal para la alimentación humana hace imperativo que los individuos modifiquen sus patrones de consumo hacia dietas más sostenibles. El uso de etiquetas ambientales en los alimentos puede ser una alternativa para lograr dicho objetivo. A través de un experimento de elección este estudio encuentra que el atributo huella de carbono es relevante a la hora de elegir un plato de almuerzo. Se discute cómo podrían informar estos resultados el diseño de estrategias para inducir decisiones de compra más sostenibles. Palabras clave: etiquetado de los alimentos, provisión de información ambiental, experimento de elección. Clasificación JEL: C93, D12, Q18. Abstract Rising animal-based foods consumption is having major negative effects on the environment. Shifting diets can thus contribute to a sustainable food system. Food labeling is one among several instruments to encourage more sustainable eating. Using a discrete choice experiment, this study founds that giving information about the the carbon foodprint of food have the potential to affect consumers’ choices, making more likely the consumption of a meal with a greater content of plant-based protein. We discuss how this findings could inform policy making. Keyword: food labeling, carboon foodprint, shifting diets, discrete choice experiment. JEL Codes: C93, D12, Q18.
Q18|Política comercial agrícola: nivel, costos y efectos de la protección en Colombia|Tras la ola de procesos de apertura comercial en el mundo, en las décadas finales del siglo pasado, el análisis de la política comercial pareció haber perdido importancia, tornándose incluso aparentemente irrelevante, tanto en el ámbito académico, como en el político. Dos hechos determinaron, sin embargo, la resurgencia del tema: el primero, el considerable incremento en la aplicación de medidas no arancelarias al comercio internacional, y segundo la emergencia de nuevos modelos, nuevas metodologías y especialmente mejores fuente de información, que permiten una mejor comprensión, tanto de los efectos de los acuerdos bilaterales, como de la implementación unilateral de políticas comerciales. La protección arancelaria y para-arancelaria ha sido una pieza fundamental de la política comercial agrícola del país. Sus resultados han sido, sin embargo, decepcionantes: en la última década, el valor de la producción agrícola a precios básicos ha pasado de representar el 5.9% del PIB en 2005, a 4.6% en 2014. Las exportaciones, por su parte, a precios básicos, han pasado del 1% del PIB al 0.6%, mostrando inequívocos signos de bajo dinamismo. Dados los diversos impactos derivados de la protección al sector agropecuario colombiano, Fedesarrollo en asocio con la Universidad EAFIT, adelantaron el presente estudio que tiene como objetivo establecer la situación actual de la protección agrícola en Colombia y los efectos y los costos que ella representa para los sectores agrícola y agroindustrial así como para los consumidores finales. El estudio consta, además de la introducción, de nueve capítulos. En el primer capítulo se revisa el tema del impacto teórico que la protección tiene sobre los sectores protegidos, sobre la economía en su conjunto y sobre el bienestar de la sociedad. En el segundo se presenta una breve descripción de la evolución de la política comercial agrícola desde mediados del siglo XX. En el tercero se presenta la evolución de la producción y el comercio agropecuario y agroindustrial del país durante las últimas décadas y se detallan las principales características del comercio agrícola de exportación e importación. En el capítulo cuatro se analiza, para el período 1990-2015, la evolución del arancel nominal de los bienes agropecuarios y agroindustriales, el comportamiento de las franjas de precios para algunos de estos productos y se calcula el arancel efectivo de las importaciones agropecuarias y agroindustriales. En el capítulo cinco se hace un análisis de la evolución de las medidas no arancelarias (técnicas y no técnicas) aplicadas a las importaciones agropecuarias y agroindustriales adoptadas en Colombia desde la liberación comercial de los años noventa. En el capítulo seis se presentan los resultados de los principales estudios realizados recientemente sobre los niveles de la protección a la agricultura colombiana y los niveles de apoyo recibidos por los productores agropecuarios. En el capítulo siete se hace un análisis sobre los efectos de la protección sobre la producción, el comercio y el consumo de los principales productos importables agropecuarios y agroindustriales. En el capítulo ocho se hace una breve revisión de literatura reciente sobre el uso de modelos de equilibrio general computable en el análisis de políticas comerciales y se presenta el modelo que EAFIT ha desarrollado para medir estos efectos y los resultados y las conclusiones básicas de los ejercicios realizados sobre el manejo de la política comercial agropecuaria en Colombia. Finalmente, en el capítulo nueve se realiza una simulación alternativa de la eliminación total y parcial de las medidas arancelarias y no arancelarias en la economía, siguiendo los ejercicios presentados en el capítulo anterior, utilizando el modelo de equilibrio general computable de Fedesarrollo, distinto al utilizado en el capítulo ocho, con el fin de darle robustez y consistencia a los resultados encontrados.
Q18|A General Equilibrium Model of Optimal Alcohol Taxation in the Czech Republic|This paper provides a general equilibrium theoretical model of alcohol taxation and empirically estimates the model. For this purpose, we use a model determined by both externality corrections and fiscal considerations as the tax increase is assumed to immediately change other governmental policies such as labour taxation or medical expenditures. The results of our analysis show that under most parametric scenarios, the current Czech tax rate on beer and wine is below its optimal level and that the fiscal component has a significant impact on the optimal level of tax.
Q18|Estimating the Value of Crop Diversity Conservation Services Provided by the Czech National Programme for Agrobiodiversity|We estimate the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for conserving crop varieties for ten years in the Czech Republic using a double-bounded dichotomous choice model to analyze data collected with an online contingent valuation survey administered to a main country-wide sample of 1037 respondents and a smaller sub-sample of 500 representative of the agricultural region of South Moravia. Mean WTP was found to be about $9 for both the Czech and S. Moravian sub-samples, corresponding to country-wide benefits of $68 million. These benefits increase by 5% for every ten varieties conserved, implying total welfare benefits of $80 million for a program conserving the maximum number of 35 additional crop varieties. The study reveals the previously unmeasured social benefits of crop conservation activities in the Czech Republic, and illustrates an empirical approach of potential value for policymakers responsible for determining funding levels for genetic resource conservation.
Q18|The Impact of Agricultural Subsidies on Farm Production: A Synthetic Control Method Approach|Czech farmers experienced an enormous exogenous shock when they joined the common agricultural market (CAM) and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 2004. Using the World Bank's dataset, we apply the synthetic control method to establish a counterfactual case of the Czech Republic food production index in the absence of the CAM and CAP. The results show that the Czech Republic would have had a higher food index if it had not entered the CAM and CAP. Moreover, we show that the CAP and CAM had different impacts on farms in the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, which have the most comparable agriculture according to the results of the synthetic control method.
Q18|Periurban Agriculture: do the Current EU Agri-environmental Policy Programmes Fit with it?| In the European Union (EU) periurban agriculture is under the same agri-environmental policy regime designed for general agriculture. We argue that the specific needs of periurban agriculture may justify ad hoc agri-environmental policy measures. We present results from a Choice Experiment (CE) performed on a sample of 600 people living in the municipality of Milan, which was designed to assess the willingness to pay (WTP) for ecological benefits generated by four agri-environmental practices implementable in the periurban area and already included in the Rural Development Programmes of the Lombardy region. Results suggest that a large population share is willing to pay to support an increase in the use of the agricultural practices studied with an average WTP ranging between 5.6 to 16.3 euro/person/year, according to the type of practice. These results are in contrast with their current low level of adoption. The sub-optimal uptake rate is likely due to an insufficient per hectare compensating payment, which is too low to cover the income foregone consequent to the adoption of sustainable agriculture measures in this area. The mismatch between the low uptake rate and the high social benefits generated by the four agri-environmental agricultural practices sheds light on the need to design agri-environmental policy programmes specifically targeted to periurban areas, where the costs of compliance with AEMs are high and the social benefits of their adoption are large.
Q18|Assessing the Productivity Consequences of Agri-Environmental Practices When Adoption Is Endogenous| We address the general problem of selection bias, endemic to analyzing the effects of any policy where adoption is voluntary, with empirical application to environmental policies for agriculture. Many voluntary practices for mitigating the environmental impacts of agriculture provide external benefits while lowering productivity. Policy analysis of the productivity consequences is complicated by the fact that decision-makers can choose their own policy levers, an action that ruins any notion of random assignment. We introduce an identification strategy to correct this kind of endogeneity, combining classic methods from stochastic frontier analysis and selection models. Applying it to micro-level data from Finnish grain farms, we find that more efficient producers are more likely to enroll in subsidized practices. And, because these practices tend to reduce yield, frontier analysis without the endogeneity correction greatly understates productivity losses. In other words, naively basing the frontier estimator on the subset of less productive farms leads to downward bias in the resulting frontier estimates. In fact, average inefficiency more than doubles after the correction in this case. An outlier investigation also suggests that the lowest decile of farms are responsible for most of the selection bias in the uncorrected model.
Q18|Income variability, evolving diets, and demand for processed foods in Nigeria| We present evidence on evolving dietary patterns in Nigeria using three waves and six total rounds of household consumption data from the Nigerian Living Standards and Measurement Surveys between the years of 2011 and 2016. First, following conventional definitions in the literature, we show that Nigeria has not shown any aggregate increase in consumption of highly processed foods over this time period, contrary to studies elsewhere in the region. In fact, consumption of highly processed foods at home has decreased, while food away consumed away from home has risen substantially. We then show that estimates of food expenditure elasticities of different food types are highly sensitive to different estimation approaches, raising concerns regarding the existing evidence base on food consumption patterns reliant on estimation of food expenditure elasticities. Different specifications can lead to broadly differing conclusions about whether highly processed food is either the most or least elastic food category. In our preferred specifications, we find that elasticity of demand for food away from home is highest for the relatively wealthy and in the urban South. Within households, elasticities are highest in times of scarcity, suggesting that households cut food away from home when resources are relatively scarce.
Q18|Eradicating poverty by 2030: Implications for Income Inequality, Population Policies, Food Prices (and Faster Growth?)|The paper examines whether the planned eradication of poverty to the year 2030 part of the SDG strategy is compatible with the expected trends in key economic variables such as GDP growth, population growth, income inequality and food prices. To do so, the paper develops a comparativestatic, poverty-accounting model that allows to simulate to 2030 the impact on SDG1 of the fastest improvements recorded for the above four variables during the last 30 years. Numerous model simulations show that – even under the most favorable assumptions – between 16 and 28 countries (mainly from Africa) out of the 78 analyzed will not reach the SDG1 target. Policy suggestions on how to improve on such results are presented at the end.
Q18|The farm income problem in the European Union: a research framework and a longitudinal empirical evaluation|In this paper we first discuss the several empirical challenges that researchers had to face when considering the farm income problem. Therefore, we offer a brief but systematic review of the empirical literature on the farm problem since the seminal Gardner's paper of 1992. Taking into consideration the state of the art, we use data for the European countries from EU-SILC (Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) survey for the period 2005 - 2015 to carry out an empirical evaluation of the farm income problem in the European Union using a longitudinal panel approach to estimation and considering alternative definitions of the group of farm households. Similar to previous studies we don't find a strong evidence for the farm income problem in the European Union. The only exception is the group Central Eastern countries, where farm households are poorer that the rest of the population but only when they are defined according to a broad definition. Conversely, families mainly relying on farming as a source of income (narrow definition of agricultural households) show income levels similar to the rest of the population both at the EU level and across different geographic areas.
Q18|Growth factors in the agriculture of Russia|In 2017, the harvest of cereals, including wheat, Russia’s top agricultural export commodity, hit its record high. This happened mostly due to a significant rise in wheat harvest against the three previous years (Tables 34, 35). At the same time, the record-high harvest caused problems with the transportation of grain from the regions of the Siberian Federal District. Agricultural producers also note a decline in the profitability of agricultural production (on the average, by 8.4 percent, to 12-14 percent[1]) due to the accelerated growth in the prices of inputs by comparison with that of the sales price of grain, which lagged behind because of the record-high harvest.
Q18|Eradicating Poverty by 2030: Implications for Income Inequality, Population Policies, Food Prices (and Faster Growth?)|The paper examines whether the planned eradication of poverty to the year 2030 part of the Sustainable Development Goals strategy is compatible with the trends expected over the next 15 years in key economic variables such as GDP growth, population growth, income inequality and food prices. To do so, the paper develops a comparative-static, poverty-accounting model that allows to simulate to 2030 the impact on SDG1 (poverty eradication) of the fastest improvements recorded for the above four variables during the last 30 years. Numerous model simulations show that â€“ even under the most favorable assumptions â€“ between 16 and 28 countries (mainly from Africa) out of the 78 analyzed will not reach the SDG1 target. Policy suggestions on how to improve on such results are presented at the end of the paper.
Q18|Voter behavior and government performance: Empirical application in Ghana|Electoral competition is a democratic mechanism to guarantee high governmental performance. In reality, however, it often leads to policy failure due to Government Capture and Government Accountability. An understanding of both phenomena has to be based on voter theory and nowadays the probabilistic voter model is the workhorse model applied in voter studies. In this paper we first proceeded to derive a theoretical model to estimate voter behavior including three voting motives: non-policy oriented, policy oriented and retrospective oriented. Then, we derived government performance indicators to estimate Capture and Accountability based on marginal effects and relative importance of the three components. Subsequently, we tested our theory estimating a probabilistic voter model for Ghana using own election survey data. In particular, we calculated different mixed logit model specifications and, to allow heterogeneity, we followed the latent class approach. Using the results of the estimations, we were able to calculate marginal effects and relative importance of each voting motive and we found that the non-policy component is the most important whereas the retrospective component is the less relevant. Finally, the government performance indicators were estimated and they suggest that, although the political weights are unequally distributed in Ghana, the government is partially accountable towards the voter and elections provide an effective mechanism to promote democracy.
Q18|Large-Scale Farms and Smallholders: Evidence from Zambia|In light of the surge in large-scale farms in developing countries, concerns have been raised that smallholders may be negatively affected. There is, however, very little evidence beyond case studies to support these claims. Drawing on nationally representative household data sets and an inventory of large-scale farms in Zambia, this study investigates the relationship between large-scale farms and smallholders. First, we analyse the geographical contexts of wards that host large-scale farms and show that large-scale farms are found in wards with good infrastructure and soil quality. Second, we adopt a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impacts of large-scale farms on smallholders' area cultivated, maize yields, and access to fertiliser. We find that smallholders in wards with large-scale farms increase their area cultivated and maize yields, but have lower fertiliser usage. This hints at positive spillovers at the extensive and intensive margins but not at improved access to agricultural inputs. It is likely that these results are also driven by the emergence of medium-scale farms in these regions.
Q18|Engaging religious actors in addressing famine emergencies|The United Nations in February 2017 declared a famine emergency in light of the imminent danger of starvation facing an estimated 20 million people in four countries, and appealed urgently for US$4 billion to meet immediate needs. Other countries face grave food shortages that present urgent humanitarian needs and undermine long term prospects for peace and development. A feature of contemporary hunger crises is their tight links to conflicts. Religious institutions and leaders are actively involved in the immediate and specific famine situation affecting African nations and Yemen and in efforts to end the conflicts that are the primary cause of famine. More broadly, religious leaders are acting to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2, Zero Hunger, by 2030. The imperative to act on hunger is shared across religious divides, and the common purpose that binds different religious communities portends well for peacebuilding and progress in the affected areas. Religious actors should thus be an integral part of the international response to famine emergencies as well as to the Zero Hunger challenge. The urgent crises are pertinent for G20 members and should be prominent on G20 agendas. G20 attention and support to religious roles could enhance responses to the famine and peacebuilding in affected areas and thus contribute to unlocking the potential of the affected countries. Interfaith and intrafaith action on SDG 2, highlighted as part of the global agenda, can speed progress towards Zero Hunger.
Q18|Storage infrastructure and agricultural yield: Evidence from a capital investment subsidy scheme|In a developing economy, the availability of storage infrastructure is considered essential for two purposes; the reduction of post-harvest losses resulting in food shortage, and allowing for gains from inter-temporal trade due to potential arbitrage opportunities arising out of volatility in food grain prices. This paper provides empirical evidence on a lesser studied impact of storage infrastructure, viz, agricultural yield. The author exploits potentially exogenous variation generated by the intensity of access to a capital investment subsidy program for construction and renovation of rural godowns in India to identify causal effects of better storage on yield. He finds that the program led to an increase in rice yield by 0.3 tons per hectare, approximately a 20% increase compared to the baseline. A potential mediating channel for such an effect would be reduced storage costs facilitating better investments in productive inputs. As supportive evidence, the author finds that fertilizer consumption increased by 21% in response to the intervention.
Q18|Monitoring agricultural productivity for sustainable production and R&D planning|Argentina's G20 presidency has emphasized the need to improve soil management and sustainably increase agricultural productivity to achieve an inclusive and resilient food future. While increased agricultural productivity can improve economic welfare and help address food security problems by benefiting both consumers and producers simultaneously, it also must address the depletion of already scarce natural resources. In the context of a changing climate, sustainable and resilient agricultural production forms a major cornerstone of both adaptation and mitigation strategies. The global community needs to have the proper tools with which to monitor sustainable agricultural productivity gains, identify countries and sectors lagging behind, and commit R&D efforts accordingly to address the challenges ahead. As such, it is suggested that 1) an international consortium should monitor agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) to provide international comparisons and track performance over time; 2) the G20 should acknowledge and address the issue of sustainable productivity measurement, and; 3) the G20 should support more in-depth research into the relationship between agricultural TFP and agricultural R&D.
Q18|Redirecting investment for a global food system that is sustainable and promotes healthy diets|More and better quality private sector investment in food systems will be needed if countries are to achieve their Sustainable Development Goals. The key challenge addressed in this paper is how investment in food systems can be redirected such that it is both adequate to drive dynamic food system development and has the quality of promoting inclusive and sustainable systems. Three areas of action are considered: instruments that translate growing consumer awareness of the sustainability aspects of food system development into SDG compliant investment; instruments that encourage investment in food systems in high-risk contexts; and improvements to food system governance. The paper articulates three key areas in which the G20 should take action: (i) to strengthen global platforms for the benchmarking and coordination of private sector sustainability initiatives; (ii) to provide support to the coordinated implementation of voluntary guidelines to foster SDG-compliant investment in higher risk contexts; and (iii) to promote greater coordination between multilateral fora to strengthen the global governance of complex and interlinked food system challenges.
Q18|Large-scale farms and smallholders: Evidence from Zambia|In light of the surge in large-scale farms in developing countries, concerns have been raised that smallholders may be negatively affected. There is, however, very little evidence beyond case studies to support these claims. Drawing on nationally representative household data sets and an inventory of large-scale farms in Zambia, this study investigates the relationship between large-scale farms and smallholders. First, we analyse the geographical contexts of wards that host large-scale farms and show that large-scale farms are found in wards with good infrastructure and soil quality. Second, we adopt a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impacts of large-scale farms on smallholders' area cultivated, maize yields, and access to fertiliser. We find that smallholders in wards with large-scale farms increase their area cultivated and maize yields, but have lower fertiliser usage. This hints at positive spillovers at the extensive and intensive margins but not at improved access to agricultural inputs. It is likely that these results are also driven by the emergence of medium-scale farms in these regions.
Q18|Reduzierung von landwirtschaftlichen Stickstoffeinträgen in Gewässer: Die Wirksamkeit von Beratung am Beispiel der hessischen WRRL-Beratung|Stickstoffemissionen aus der Landwirtschaft belasten neben anderen Stickstoffquellen Gewässer und andere Umweltmedien, sowohl in Deutschland als auch in anderen Ländern der Europäischen Union und weltweit. Um Landwirte2 von Handlungsänderungen zu überzeugen, werden neben regulativen und ökonomischen Instrumenten in einigen Regionen Beratungsinstrumente angewandt und für die zukünftige Politikgestaltung diskutiert. Es ist jedoch nur sehr begrenzt möglich, die Effektivität von Beratungsdiensten zu beurteilen, und daher ist es unklar, wie hoch die Kostenwirksamkeit von Gewässerschutzberatungen ist. Um zur Lösung dieses Problems beizutragen, wurde als Fallstudie eine Wirkungsanalyse der hessischen Gewässerschutzberatung im Rahmen der EU-Wasserrahmenrichtlinie mit einem aus Empirie und Theorie abgeleiteten Set von Indikatoren durchgeführt. Den Kern der Studie bildete eine standardisierte Befragung, die mit Antworten von 1.477 beratenen und nicht beratenen Landwirten quantitative Analysen erlaubte. Die Befragung wurde vor allem durch Vorinterviews und durch Validierungsrunden mit Beratern und Landwirten sowie durch Transkripte von 18 qualitativen Vertiefungsinterviews mit Landwirten ergänzt.

Q18|Der ELER in der gemeinsamen Agrarpolitik nach 2020: Wie bewerten EvaluatorInnen die europäischen Verordnungsentwürfe?|"Auf der Grundlage langjähriger Evaluierungserfahrung werden die von der Europäischen Kommission (EU-KOM) im Juni 2018 vorgelegten Verordnungsentwürfe zur Gemeinsamen Agrarpolitik (GAP) nach 2020 in Bezug auf den Europäischen Landwirtschaftsfonds für die Entwicklung des ländlichen Raums (ELER) einer Bewertung unterzogen. Lassen die Verordnungsentwürfe im Vergleich zur laufenden Förderperiode potenzielle Verbesserungen im Umsetzungsregime und eine stärkere Fokussierung auf effektiven Ressourcen- und Tierschutz sowie Impulse für die ländliche Entwicklung erwarten? Unser vorläufiges Fazit fällt ambivalent aus. Die neue Rollenverteilung zwischen EU und Mitgliedstaaten eröffnet Chancen. So wird letzteren mehr Spielraum, aber auch Verantwortung in der Gestaltung ihrer Programme in der Form nationaler GAPStrategiepläne und ihrer Umsetzungssysteme zugewiesen. Die Regelungen für den aufzustellenden GAP-Strategieplan auf Mitgliedstaatsebene berücksichtigen aber die spezifische Situation föderaler Staaten unzureichend. Auch die stärkere Ergebnisorientierung bleibt ein eher inhaltsleeres Schlagwort. Im Kern wird das bestehende Monitoringsystem fortgeschrieben. Es ist aber als Grundlage des jährlichen Leistungsabschlusses zukünftig mit erhöhten Anforderungen an die Datenqualität und Sanktionen verbunden. Erhebliche Investitionen z. B. in IT-Systeme sind erforderlich, die eine ""Entlastungsrendite"" der Verwaltung durch angemessenere Verwaltungs- und Kontrollsysteme schmälern. Inhaltlich setzt der GAP-Strategieplan für den ELER für zentrale Zukunftsthemen keine neuen Impulse und Anforderungen. Es liegt bei den Mitgliedstaaten, wie ambitioniert sie ihren Strategieplan ausgestalten. Durch die Verknüpfung mit Sanktionen kann der Leistungsrahmen entgegen seiner Zielsetzung hierfür eine eher kontraproduktive Wirkung entfalten."
