E70|Are Long-Horizon Expectations (De-)Stabilizing? Theory and Experiments|Most models in finance assume that agents make trading plans over the infinite future. We consider instead that they are boundedly rational and may only form forecasts over a limited horizon. We explore how participants in financial markets trading over finite horizons affect the level and the volatility of the price. In our theoretical model, agents with different planning horizons may hold different expectations over those horizons and trade the asset accordingly. We derive testable implications in the lab under various theories of expectation formation over those horizons. Then we design a laboratory experiment to test these theoretical implications against human behaviour. Our experiment confirms most of our theoretical hypotheses. Short-horizon trading favors deviations of the asset price from fundamentals. By contrast, a modest share of long-horizon traders is enough for the price to stabilize around its fundamental value. This is because short-horizon traders tend to coordinate their price forecasts using non-fundamental factors, such as recent price trends, in choosing their trading strategies. Long-horizon traders hold more heterogeneous views about future price developments, which prevents such trend-chasing behaviour.
E70|Bounded Rationality, Monetary Policy, and Macroeconomic Stability|This paper estimates a Behavioral New Keynesian model to revisit the evidence that passive US monetary policy in the pre-1979 sample led to indeterminate equilibria and sunspot-driven fluctuations, while active policy after 1982, by satisfying the Taylor principle, was instrumental in restoring macroeconomic stability. The model assumes “cognitive discounting”, i.e., consumers and firms pay less attention to variables further into the future. We estimate the model allowing for both determinacy and indeterminacy. The empirical results show that determinacy is preferred both before and after 1979. Even if monetary policy is found to react only mildly to inflation pre-Volcker, the substantial degrees of bounded rationality that we estimate prevent the economy from falling into indeterminacy.
E70|Do Monetary Policy Announcements Shift Household Expectations?|We use daily survey data from Gallup to assess whether households' beliefs about economic conditions are influenced by surprises in monetary policy announcements. We first provide more general evidence that public confidence in the state of the economy reacts to certain types of macroeconomic news very quickly. Next, we show that surprises about the federal funds target rate are among the news that have statistically significant and instantaneous effects on economic confidence. In contrast, surprises about forward guidance and asset purchases do not have similar effects on household beliefs, perhaps because they are less well understood. We document heterogeneity in the responsiveness of sentiment across demographics.

E70|Behavioural New Keynesian models|This paper provides a bird’s eye view of the behavioural New Keynesian literature. We discuss three key empirical regularities in macroeconomic data which are not accounted for by the standard New Keynesian model, namely, excess kurtosis, stochastic volatility, and departures from rational expectations. We then present a simple behavioural New Keynesian model that accounts for these empirical regularities in a straightforward manner. We discuss elaborations and extensions of the basic model, and suggest areas for future research.
E70|Inflation Expectations of Households: Do They Influence Wage-Price Dynamics in India?|This paper examines the usefulness of survey-based information on inflation expectations of households in the analysis of inflation dynamics in India. As household inflation expectations do not satisfy the statistical properties of rationality and unbiasedness, hybrid versions of New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) are used to study whether survey-based measures of inflation expectations can be used as proxy for forward looking expectations to predict inflation in India. While both 3-months ahead and 1-year ahead household inflation expectations emerge statistically significant in explaining and predicting inflation, effectively they work as substitutes of backward looking expectations given that household expectations are found to be adaptive. When transmission of inflation expectations to inflation is assessed through wage dynamics, no robust evidence is found for expectations induced wage pressures influencing CPI inflation. Shortterm food and fuel shocks explain significant part of variations in inflation expectations of households. Notwithstanding limited evidence on spillover of inflation expectations of households to wages and prices, the high degree of observed inflation persistence and significant sensitivity of inflation expectations to food and fuel shocks warrant sustained emphasis of monetary policy on wellanchored inflation expectations.
E70|The State of DSGE Modelling|This survey and assessment of the state of DSGE modelling is structured around six key criticisms levelled at the approach. The first is fundamental and common to macroeconomics and microeconomics alike - namely, problems with rationality and expected utility maximization. The second is that DSGE models examine fluctuations about an exogenous balanced growth path and there is no role for endogenous growth, either medium or long-term. The third consists of a number of concerns associated with systems estimation. The fourth is another fundamental problem with any microfounded macro-model - that of heterogeneity and aggregation. The fifth and sixth concerns focus on the rudimentary nature of earlier models that lacked unemployment and a banking sector.
E70|Falling Behind: Has Rising Inequality Fueled the American Debt Boom?|We want to explain the rise of household debt in the US since 1980. We present a mechanism that is consistent with the following stylized facts: (i) Real mortgage debt, (ii) debt-service-to-income ratios and (iii) house sizes (in sqft) have increased since the 1980 across all income quintiles. This is despite (iv) real incomes have stagnated for the bottom 50% since the 1980s. Our mechanism is based on other-regarding preferences. Rich agents upgrade their houses to match their risen incomes. Poorer agents want to substitute future consumption for a bigger house today (in order to “keep up with the richer Joneses”). Holding prices constant, debt will necessarily increase since houses are durable and require large payment upfront, but only low maintenance costs in the future. We build a tractable model consistent with these facts and extend it to quantitative a model to show that the partial equilibrium results go through in general equilibrium.
E70|Political economic uncertainty in a small & open economy: the case of Uruguay|It has been well documented by the macroeconomic literature the negative effects of economic policy instability on economic uncertainty and investment decisions. In changing environments, agents prefer to delay investment decisions in fixed capital, ultimately leading to the depression of economic activity. Uruguay, as a small and open economy of South America, has historically faced strong external shocks. Therefore, not only local instability of economic policy affects, also international and regional ones affect macroeconomic volatility and growth. With the objective of quantifying and analyzing uncertainty and volatility in the Uruguayan economy, we built an uncertainty composite index adapting the methodology proposed by Baker, Bloom & Davis (2015). In order to address how local and global economic policy uncertainty affects the volatility of the Uruguayan economy we include in the composite index, local and external uncertainty indicators. We represent local uncertainty by agent's divergence on expectations about the future of the exchange rate. In order to account for both, regional and global shocks, we include uncertainty indicators of the relevant economic-world for Uruguay. Empirical strategy is based on a combination of statistical methods of principal components analysis and time series techniques. We test two alternative indexes, both of them starting in January 2004. Our results show that although both uncertainty indexes seem to be good predictors of the volatility for the whole period, they losses predictability power in the last years.
E70|Measuring Biases in Expectation Formation|We develop a general framework for measuring biases in expectation formation. The method is based on the insight that biases can be inferred from the response of forecast errors to past news. Empirically, biases are measured by flexibly estimating the impulse response function of forecast errors. The framework does not require precise knowledge of the true data-generating process, and it nests all major existing models of expectations. Monte Carlo simulations show that the method is able to detect biases in empirically relevant settings. We illustrate the methodology using data on inflation forecasts. Our framework can guide future models of expectations.
E70|Should I default on my mortgage even if I can pay? Experimental evidence|We study strategic default in the laboratory, i.e. in a controlled experiment. Subjects are initially endowed with a house and a mortgage (we use neutral wording in the experiment), and must decide at each period in which their mortgage is alive among three options: making the mortgage payment, selling the house, or walking away from their house and defaulting on their mortgage. At each point in time, we can observe whether defaulters can afford to make the mortgage payment, and thus, directly compute the number of strategic defaulters. Subjects default in the right periods and quite fast learn what they should consume. We find experimental support for the “double trigger” hypothesis: individuals faced with low income and low house prices are more likely to default. We observe that subjects default less than optimal, and this decision is significantly affected by social norm concerns in the context of the experiment. Individuals under-consume in the first periods of life: they are “cautious” when indebted. Both introducing a 50% probability of recourse and a Responsible Homeowner Reward are very effective in preventing default in the lab, especially by individuals receiving a bad shock to income.
E70|Information Costs and Sequential Information Sampling|We propose a new approach to modeling the cost of information structures in rational inattention problems: the â€œneighborhood-basedâ€ cost functions. These cost functions have two properties that we view as desirable: they summarize the results of a sequential evidence accumulation problem, and they capture notions of â€œperceptual distance.â€ The first of these properties is connected to an extensive literature in psychology and neuroscience, and the second ensures that neighborhood-based cost functions, unlike mutual information, make accurate predictions about behavior in perceptual experiments. We compare the implications of our neighborhood-based cost functions with those of the mutual information in a series of applications: security design, global games, modeling perceptual judgments, and linear-quadratic-Gaussian settings.
E70|Monetary and Fiscal Policy in a Cash-in-advance Economy with Quasi-geometric Discounting|In this paper, we analyze monetary and fiscal policies in a dynamic general equilibrium model in which households have a preference of quasi-geometric discounting and face a cash- in-advance constraint. From this policy analysis, we obtain the following two outcomes. First, when the government can control only the money supply, the Friedman rule is optimal. Second, when the government can also control income tax rates, the Friedman rule may not be optimal.
E70|Banks’ leverage behaviour in a two-agent new Keynesian model|We study the distributive effects of a negative shock to banks assets in a saver-capitalist model. We analyze how this kind of heterogeneity affects macroeconomic variables and the distribution between savers and capitalists through banks leverage procyclicality. The distributive effects are non-favourable to savers and long lasting. Lower risk aversion of capitalists strengthens and lengthens the procyclicality of leverage, leading to a lower decrease of savers’ income and consumption. Whilst stricter regulatory requirements are favourable to savers, a tougher inflation targeting is unfavourable to savers. The model is robust to the combined introduction of labour market frictions and hysteresis, which together generate an amplification and lengthening of the recessionary and distributive effects unfavourable to savers.
E70|Beauty contests and the term structure|A novel decomposition highlights the scope for information to influence the term structure of interest rates. Based on the law of total covariance, we show that real term premia in macroeconomic models contain a component that depends on covariances of realised stochastic discount factors and a component that depends on covariances of expectations of those stochastic discount factors. The impact of different informational assumptions can then be identified by looking at their effect on the second, expectational, component. If agents have full information about technology in a simple macro-finance model then the conditional covariance of expectations is low, which contributes to the real term premia implied by the model being at least an order of magnitude too small, a result that is unchanged if some components of technology are unobservable or observed with noise. To generate realistic term premia, we draw on the beauty contest literature by differentiating between private and public information and introducing the possibility of strategic complementarities in the formation of expectations. A quantitative version of the model is found to explain a significant proportion of observed term premia when estimated using data on expectations of productivity growth from the Survey of Professional Forecasters.
E70|Optimism, pessimism, and short-term fluctuations|Economic theory offers several explanations as to why shifting expectations about future economic activity affect current demand. Abstracting from whether changes in expectations originate from swings in beliefs or fundamentals, we test empirically whether optimism and pessimism about the economy trigger short-term fluctuations in private consumption and investment. Under the assumption that cyclical movements in private consumption and investment growth are exogenous to potential output growth forecasts far into the future, our results are consistent with the idea of private economic agents learning about future potential output growth and adjusting their current demand accordingly. We also propose a simple Keynesian model to illustrate that revisions in expected future income can affect short-term equilibria, in line with the results of the empirical analysis.
E70|Enhancing central bank communications with behavioural insights|In this joint Bank of England and Behavioural Insights Team study, we test the effectiveness of different approaches to central bank communications. Using an online experiment with a representative sample of the UK population, we measure how changes to the Bank of England’s summaries of the Inflation Report impact comprehension and trust in its policy messages. We find that the recently introduced Visual Summary of the Inflation Report improves comprehension of its main messages in a statistically significant way compared to the traditional executive summary. We also find that public comprehension and trust can be further improved by making the Visual Summary more relatable to people’s lives. Our findings thus shed light on how central banks can improve communication with the public at a time when trust in public institutions has fallen, while the responsibilities delegated to central banks have increased.

E70|Can firms see into the future? Survey evidence from Germany|This paper presents new evidence on the expectation formation process of firms from a survey of the German manufacturing sector. First, firms become too optimistic after their business has improved, consistent with the over-extrapolation of their experience. Second, firms extrapolate improvements in their business more than deteriorations. Third, firms are more optimistic (pessimistic) than usual during business cycle peaks (troughs), suggesting that they do not anticipate reversals. Fourth, the German reunification provided a positive exogenous shock to the business of West German products. The industries most positively affected by the shock initially over-extrapolated the past downward trend just as much as the less affected industries, and thus failed to anticipate the reversal. Fifth, more overoptimistic firms subsequently report larger inventories and lower profits, suggesting that expectation errors entail (opportunity) costs. Sixth, older and larger firms show a smaller extrapolation bias, indicating that time and resources can alleviate the extrapolation bias. Seventh, firms that expect their business to improve tend to also expect their prices to increase, suggesting that firms mostly try to forecast demand shocks as opposed to supply shocks. Overall, these observations suggest that firms have a limited ability to anticipate changes in their activity and extrapolate their experience too much.
E70|Internal Rationality, Heterogeneity, and Complexity in the New Keynesian Model|This paper studies the dynamic behaviour of a workhorse New Keynesian model in which households and rms can be fully rational or internally rational. First, we derive the model with a xed proportion n of agents fully rational and a xed proportion (1-n) of agents internally rational, in a similar manner to Massaro (2013). In this model, we establish two propositions. First, a decrease in the proportion of fully rational agents does not destabilise the system if the rational expectations determinacy condition for the monetary rule holds. Second, the rational expectations determinacy condition is identical to the stability condition for the model in which all agents are internally rational. We then extend the model to include predictor selection along the lines of Branch and McGough (2010). In this model, we establish two further propositions. First, the rational expectations determinacy condition ensures local determinacy and stability as the cost of being fully rational becomes in nitely negative. Second, if the model starts from a position of indeterminacy, an increase in the xed cost of being fully rational can lead to the loss of local stability via a Hopf bifurcation. A rational route to randomness follows from this, which we explore numerically. Taken as a whole, these results indicate that complex dynamics in the internally rational New Keynesian model are closely associated with monetary policy failures. Finally, we consider the robustness of our results to changes in the monetary policy rule.
E70|E Many Pluribus Unum: A Behavioural Macro-Economic Agent Based Model|In this paper we develop a Hybrid Macroeconomic ABM. The economy is populated with firms heterogeneous in term of financial fragility, measured via the Equity Ratio. Firms are maximizing profit by choosing capital, which can not be raised on the stock market. Therefore they have to rely on a loan charged by the External Finance Pre- mium that is decreasing in the Equity Ratio; profits are retained as net worth. The economy is populated also with consumers, whom optimize their utility holding individual non-rational ex- pectations; thus they are heterogeneous in their expectations. The expectations formation process is the Heuristic Switching Model: given a fixed set of heuristics, agents choose the one which has performed the best in the past; this model has been extrapolated and validated in several Learn to Forecast Experiments. Thanks to the Variant Representative Agent approach, there can be built bottom-up a macro- economic system which encapsulates the heterogeneity by considering relevant moments rather than the whole the distributions of the heterogeneous characteristics of the agents. The emergent macro-economic system will be described by an optimized IS, a Taylor Rule and a Phillips Curve; thus the model tries to bridge NK-DSGE with ABM. The proposed approach result in a macro-economic system with a reduced dimensionality, thus it is analytical tractable and it resumes macroeconomic thinking: the ABM is used to link periods and keep track of the individual distribution, while the macro-economic model is a frame that pictures the value of the fundamentals given the distributions. The model is put at work through a fiscal shock and it shows it capabilities in disentangling the transmission of a shock in its direct and indirect effect: the former are the ones directly caused by the shocked variable, the latter instead derive from the evolution of the distributions. Moreover the model is also able to distinguish the contributions to the shock of the Representative Agent Component opposed to the Heterogeneous Agent Component. .
E70|Rational Inattention and Sequential Information Sampling|We propose a new principle for measuring the cost of information structures in rational inattention problems, based on the cost of generating the information used to make a decision through a dynamic evidence accumulation process. We introduce a continuous-time model of sequential information sampling, and show that, in a broad class of cases, the choice frequencies resulting from optimal information accumulation are the same as those implied by a static rational inattention problem with a particular static information-cost function. Among the static cost functions that can be justified in this way is the mutual information cost function proposed by Sims (2010), but we show that other cost functions can be micro-founded in this way as well. In particular, we introduce a class of “neighborhood-based” cost functions, which make it more costly to undertake experiments that can produce different results in similar states, and show that the predictions of this alternative rational inattention theory better conform with evidence from perceptual discrimination experiments.
E70|Paternalism and Pseudo-Rationality|Resource allocations are jointly determined by the actions of social planners and households. In this paper, we highlight the distinction between planner optimization and household optimization. We show that planner optimization is a partial substitute for household optimization and that this is still true when households have private in- formation about their preferences. We illustrate a novel identification problem: some aggregate equilibrium properties that are implied by household optimization are also implied by planner optimization. A rational utilitarian planner enacts policies that cause the Euler equation to hold on average in a population of non-optimizing households, which we refer to as pseudo-rationality. Hence, widely studied allocative optimality conditions also arise in an allocatively inefficient economy with a rational planner, who uses tools such as default savings and Social Security to influence the consumption choices of myopic and passive households. Accordingly, aggregate classical optimization tests implemented with data from economies with paternalistic governments cannot reveal whether households would make optimal decisions on their own.
E70|Internal rationalityuyuyuy, heterogeneity and complexity in the New Keynesian model|This paper studies the dynamic behaviour of a workhorse New Keynesian model in which households and firms can be fully rational or internally rational. First, we derive the model with a fixed proportion n of agents fully rational and a fixed proportion (1-n) of agents internally rational, in a similar manner to Massaro (2013). In this model, we establish two propositions. First, a decrease in the proportion of fully rational agents does not destabilise the system if the rational expectations determinacy condition for the monetary rule holds. Second, the rational expectations determinacy condition is identical to the stability condition for the model in which all agents are internally rational. We then extend the model to include predictor selection along the lines of Branch and McGough (2010). In this model, we establish two further propositions. First, the rational expectations determinacy condition ensures local determinacy and stability as the cost of being fully rational becomes infinitely negative. Second, if the model starts from a position of indeterminacy, an increase in the fixed cost of being fully rational can lead to the loss of local stability via a Hopf bifurcation. A rational route to randomness follows from this, which we explore numerically. Taken as a whole, these results indicate that complex dynamics in the internally rational New Keynesian model are closely associated with monetary policy failures. Finally, we consider the robustness of our results to changes in the monetary policy rule.
E70|Monetary And Fiscal Policy Design At The Zero Lower Bound: Evidence From The Lab|The global economic crisis of 2007–2008 has pushed many advanced economies into a liquidity trap. We design a laboratory experiment on the effectiveness of policy measures to avoid expectation‐driven liquidity traps. Monetary policy alone is not sufficient to avoid liquidity traps, even if it preventively cuts the interest rate when inflation falls below a threshold. However, monetary policy augmented with a fiscal switching rule succeeds in escaping liquidity trap episodes. We measure the effect of fiscal policy on expectations, and report larger‐than‐unity fiscal multipliers at the zero lower bound. Experimental results in different treatments are well explained by adaptive learning. (JEL E70, C92, D83, D84, E52, E62)

E70|An analysis of the bottlenecks affecting the production and deployment of maize seed in Eastern and Southern Africa| The publication describes outcomes of a study conducted in 2007/08 to analyze the bottlenecks affecting the production and deployment of maize seed in eastern and southern Africa. The objectives of the study were to provide a better understanding of the factors limiting the production and deployment of improved maize seed in Africa, and to contribute to increasing the efficiency of variety release, seed production and seed dissemination for new drought tolerant maize varieties. The study identified a number of institutional bottlenecks affecting the maize seed value chain, in particular in the area of policy, credit availability, seed production, germplasm and marketing. To address these bottlenecks and improve the efficiency of seed production and deployment to African farmers, the authors recommended a coordinated effort from policy makers, private and public organizations and farmers. The study was supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Howard G. Buffett Foundation
