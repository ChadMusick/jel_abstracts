Novelty – The findings of this research emphasise the importance of the joint relationship between personality and situational factors on transfer of training. These findings allow the researcher to understand how opportunity to perform enables trainees to express their personality and enhance their performance.
M19|Work Engagement: The Impact of Psychological Capital and Organizational Justice and Its Influence on Turnover Intention|Objective - To remain competitive, organizations must be able to adapt to change and increase their performance. In order to increase performance, organizations must focus on how they manage their employees, including how to retain them. Previous studies have shown that work engagement (WE) has a positive effect on employee retention (Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004). The JD-R Model suggests that WE is influenced by enhancing personal and job resources (Schaufeli, 2017). This research aims to investigate the impact of both of those resources on WE. The personal resource measured in this study is psychological capital while the job resource measured is organizational justice. Furthermore, this research also aims to determine the extent to which WE can be used to predict employee turnover. Methodology/Technique - A quantitative method is implemented in this study by distributing a Utrecth Work Engagement Scale, Psychological Capital Questionnaire, Organizational Justice Questionnaire, and Turnover Intention Scale to 243 employees working in a manufacturing company in Jakarta, Indonesia. Findings - The results of this research conclude that psychological capital and organizational justice have a significant effect on WE (F= 15.231; p
M19|Psychosocial Safety Climate and Burnout: The Mediating Role of Challenge and Hindrance Demands|Objective – In recent years, the prevalence of job burnout among Malaysian research universities (RU) academics has accelerated due to the demands of teaching, in addition to administrative work, consultation, research, and publications. Methodology/Technique – This study reviews literature relating to burnout, and the use of Psychosocial Safety Climate (PSC) to create a better working environment by managing demands and providing a high level of resources to deal with demands or tasks at work. This study presents a better job design by PSC through challenge and hindrance demands which may decrease the level of burnout among RU academicians. Therefore, this paper suggests that challenges and hindrance demands are a potential mediator of the relationship between PSC and burnout. Findings – This study concludes that PSC can be used to minimize burnout among academics by providing references for an excellent job design, enhancing job demands whilst diminishing hinderance demands. Novelty – RU management or policy-makers may apply PSC in their design of the role of academics within their institution, so that the related work policies, practices, and procedures are enhanced. This method is crucial to ensure that the challenge and hindrance demands of academicians are properly managed to reduce their risk of burnout.
M19|The Relationship between Leadership Style and Employee Outcomes: The Mediating Role of Organizational Commitment|Objective - The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between transformational leadership styles and job performance and the mediating role of organizational commitment in the relationship between transformational leadership style and job performance in State-Owned Banks in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Methodology/Technique - The data used to evaluate the model was gathered from the State-Owned Banks in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. 200 permanent employees of those State-Owned Banks participated in the survey. The Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), using LISREL software was employed to examine the relationship among the constructs in this study, which are transformational leadership style, organizational commitment, and job performance. Finding - The findings of this study conclude that transformational leadership style significantly affects job performance and organizational commitment, whereas organizational commitment significantly influences job performance. Briefly, organizational commitment mediates the relationship between transformational leadership styles and job performance in State-Owned Banks in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Novelty - Most of the previous studies were carried out in western countries, raising doubts about generalizations in research results in developing countries such as Indonesia. Therefore, the novelty of this research is carried out in the context of developing countries, especially in State-Owned Banks in West Kalimantan, Indonesia.
M19|Human Capital and Social Capital as Moderators of Start-up Support and Start-up Success|Objective - Start-up support has not received enough research attention although it is an integral element of the start-up ecosystem that provides resources and services in the form of various support to start-ups. There is a need to explore the effectiveness of various start-up support because the question as to whether such supports contribute to start-up success remains unanswered. Methodology/Technique - While human capital and social capital has been linked to entrepreneurial success, little is known about how these capitals moderate the effect of start-up access to support. Finding - This paper contributes to start-up literature by presenting a conceptual framework appropriate to investigate the effect of a start-up's access to support on start-up success as well as how this effect is accentuated by the human and social capital of start-up entrepreneurs. Novelty - Further understanding of how human capital and social capital could strengthen the contribution of support to start-up success represents an important direction for future entrepreneurship research. This paper also discusses the limitations of relevant previous research and offers suggestions for future research.
M19|How Commitment, Satisfaction, and Cost Fluctuations Influence Customer Loyalty|Objective - The purpose of this study is to investigate which factors have a stronger influence on final purchase decisions from the perspective of the chemical market. The factors under consideration are customer satisfaction, commitment and cost fluctuations. Methodology/Technique - By understanding the factors that influence purchase decisions, a chemical company or other industrial company can place greater focus on the factors that will improve or enhance customer loyalty. The research design is a conclusive-descriptive and quantitative method. Findings & Novelty - The results of the analysis confirm that customer commitment and satisfaction have a stronger influence on customer loyalty, compared to fluctuating costs. Satisfaction does not have a direct influence on loyalty, except where commitment is used as a mediator.
M19|Scientific Knowledge in Management and its Praxeology|"Objective - The praxeology recognized by some theorists as the relevance of the results of the research process for managerial and academic practice, is evidenced by others as absent. The purpose of this paper is to propose an evaluation of the results of the research process in management, particularly in the ""doctoral theses"" in management in Colombia over the last 9 years, from a reflexive approach as the epistemology of human sciences and critical performativity that allows us to answer the question: What is the level of knowledge praxeology generated in doctoral theses in management in Colombia? Methodology/Technique - The work proposes to start with an exploratory sequential approach to identify the categories of praxeological focus in the literature and theses. Then, a strategy of quantitative evaluation of the observable aspects in the theses is designed. Finally, the strategy is applied to the theses and the results are documented. Findings & Novelty - The current scope of this proposal is limited to the information that will be collected in the observation of doctoral theses. The results should be interpreted considering this restriction. This proposal presents an approach to interpret the praxeological focus from the functionalist explanation to the comprehensive in doctoral research in management where the traditional scheme has been positivism."
M19|Increasing Employee's Job Satisfaction Through the Implementation of Transformational Leadership and Work Stress Level Management|Objective - The objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between transformational leadership, work stress and job satisfaction. Based on previous studies, we proposed that work stress will mediate the relationship between transformational leadership and employees' job satisfaction. Methodology/Technique - Data was collected from 248 employees working in three organizations in Java Island, Indonesia. To test the hypotheses, we used regression analysis and a boostrapping approach with a Macro Process. Finding - The results of this study show that transformational leadership has a positive relationship with employee job satisfaction. However, transformational leadership does not have significant relationship with work stress. This therefore means that there is no mediation of work stress either. Novelty – This empirical study provides a first glance at the correlation between the variables. Future studies should consider using more participants from across Indonesia to properly reflect the cultural difference among other provinces. Type of Paper - Empirical.
M19|Ambidextrous Leadership in Manufacture Industry in Indonesia|Objective - Leadership has evolved (Cogliser & Brigham 2004) and has become more dynamic than ever before (McClean et. al. 2019). Prior research has shown that ambidexterity generates persistent and conflicting demands within an organization (Koryak et. al. 2018), while others have been successful (Diaz- Fernandez, Pasamar-Reyes & Valle-Cabrera, 2017). This paper highlights the strengths and challenges of two popular leadership styles in Indonesia, namely: transactional leadership and transformational leadership using two concepts of ambidextirity, exploitation and exploration. Ambidextirity is believed to be the answer to recent market shifts and can also help organisations to solve future problems. However, there is not a clear theory to determine when, where, and how to use ambidexterity. Methodology/Technique - This study uses a systematic literature review (Okoli et. al., 2014, Okoli & John, 2015), 5 in-depth interviews, a case study and reports from Ministry of Commerce to provide a solid theory of ambidexterity. The writer concludes that having ambidextrous skills in leadership is mandatory for the manufacturing industry and will guarantee future success (Tushman & O'Reilly, 2012). Finding - There are some barriers in implementing ambidextrous capabilities in leadership, namely cognitive conflicts, inertia, and confusion pressure on when and how to balance both transactional leadership and transformational leadership. The writer suggests that high transactional leadership and high transformational leadership will increase firm performance. Novelty – This paper has several limitations such as the unavailability of data on ambidextrous leadership in Indonesia, the limited scope as this research is conducted in manufacturing industries which might have different results in other industries, and the relatively short period of data collection. Future studies should address these limitations. Type of Paper - Review.

M19|A Parallel Study of the Corporate Social Responsibility Engagements for the Hotel and Gaming Enterprises in an Emerging Economy ? Hong Kong and Macao Perspectives|This study explored the evolving controversial subject of Corporate Social Responsibility engagements effect in an emerging economy based on the Hong Kong & Macao perspectives. The research proposed to examine and review the rationale and experiences of the CSR engagements by two hotel-gaming enterprises in Hong Kong and Macao. The research methodology adopted a mixed-qualitative approach. The qualitative content analysis drew on data from interviews, live forum presentation reporting and desktop studies embedded the non-participation observation approaches.The study findings identified the direct and indirect motives and outcomes of the management views and general public perceived relevance in the CSR engagements. The results implied that the hotel enterprise's management took an outside-in approach to weight the CSR programs from one?s own internal intent. The hotel enterprise's CSR engagement levels reflected that the top management linked the enterprise's direction and business performance versus the long term CSR objectives for the local community. The initial good intent can be misaligned from the CSR outcomes. The management board values and norms played a key role in endorsing the voluntary CSR engagements and practices in order to comply with the imposed government policy or regulation. In addition, the CSR awareness among employees were relatively lower while the marketing unit inserted inadequate effort to advocate CSR, versus the management board proactively announced details in the annual management reporting to nurture positive public perception. The research findings provide thoughts of the latent evolving reality to the contextual CSR engagements in the emerging economies inputted to the business management implications.

M19|Control(-ling): Known/Unknown|Controlling – a very powerful word. When someone hears it, he/she feels influence and power. Controlling is an English word; unfortunately it isn‘t used just in the English language. When you hear this word, you might have the feeling that everything is clear to you. In fact, it is not all that clear. You have to ask yourself what language you are speaking currently and where in the world you are. You may have learned that controlling is not control. And also that control is something bad. In reality, however, the world of control is not so simple and this fact is closely related, among other things, to the history of the word control. Control itself in the management has different approaches, including in particular the Western and Eastern one, but also internal control can take on different meanings. The purpose of this paper is to point to various myths in the management function of control and to clarify some terms that are often misused. It is based on our long-term research of the management function of control.
M19|Entrepreneurial Opportunity Recognition: A Review of Literature|Economic theory is the major theoretical perspective in entrepreneurship. Since entrepreneurial opportunity recognition is rooted in the entrepreneurship literature, it is necessary to understand the nature of entrepreneurial opportunity recognition from the economic theoretical perspective. Among the economic theory, entrepreneurship literature falls into two school of thoughts, neoclassical equilibrium theory and Austrian theory. The neoclassical equilibrium theory assumes that everyone can recognize all entrepreneurial opportunities, and it is individual?s risk-propensity that determines who become the entrepreneurs (Khilstrom & Laffont, 1979). However, the traditional neoclassical equilibrium theory fails to explain the framework of entrepreneurship and the existence of entrepreneurial opportunities (Eckhardt & Shane, 2003).Austrian theory assumes that people cannot recognize all opportunities. Austrian theory emphasizes that it is the imperfect market with information asymmetry that generates the information gap. In other words, opportunities do not appear in a well-packaged informational form (Venkataraman, 1997). Kirzner (1997) has indicated that the distribution of information in society influences the discovery of entrepreneurial opportunities, and only a small subset of individuals are able to identify and recognize particular opportunity in the market. In addition, the process of discovering opportunities depends on people?s ability and willingness to discover them. For example, people might not be able or may be unwilling to pay attention to external environment changes, which may lead to loss of the opportunity (Stevenson & Gumpert, 1985). Only those who recognize the existence of opportunities and value them can then earn profits from these new opportunities (Ardichvili, Cardozo, & Ray, 2003; Shane, 2000; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). That is, under the asymmetry of information circumstances, individuals with special insights and knowledge to discover and recognize entrepreneurial opportunities tend to be successful while others not able to recognize the opportunities or only see the risk for failure (Ulhøi, 2005). Since economic theory cannot fully explain the entrepreneurial opportunity recognition, scholars have shifted the focus to two different social science disciplines, psychology and sociology, to create theoretical frameworks to explain the process of opportunity recognition. In other words, the entrepreneurial opportunity recognition process can be investigated from personal cognitive framework and social context. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to review the literature and investigate the antecedents of entrepreneurial opportunity recognition.
M19|Customer-oriented reverse logistics and customer satisfaction on product returns|Most reverse logistics researches have not incorporated marketing concept or customer orientation into their frameworks. This study proposes that it is imperative to take customer point of view in reverse logistics process to improve customer satisfaction. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to conceptualize and operationalize customer- oriented reverse logistics. It also examines the relationship between the developed construct and its impact on customer satisfaction. In this regard, a literature review was carried out to identify customer- oriented reverse logistics. Based on customer orientation, service quality and service recovery literature, the new construct was developed. A pilot study was subsequently conducted using the questionnaire survey with managers and employees of a particular company in the mobile telecommunications industry and its customers who have experience in product returns. The findings showed that the dimensions of the proposed construct comprised tangibility, reliability, assurance, empathy, responsiveness, information availability and employee?s empowerment. Path analysis indicated that customer-oriented reverse logistics perceived by both employees and customers positively related to customer satisfaction of product returns service. The developed construct based upon cross disciplinary in marketing and logistics could facilitate future empirical studies in reverse logistics area. The proposed framework will also be useful for practitioners to implement their product returns strategies accordingly.

M19|Dertimining The Relationship Between Transformational Leadership And Risk Management In The Retail Bank|Risk Management is one of the most challenges facing the banking industry, after 2008 financial crisis the banking industry has become one of the heavily regulated industries. This study is intending to determine the association between transformational leadership and risk management. This was a cross-sectional study conducted among 42 employees who were working at the retail bank. Census sampling method was used to select the samples. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaire. The present study found that most of participants perceive themselves as transformational leaders, however strongly believe in transactional leadership style. Results revealed that there was a significant relationship between transformational leadership and risk management. It is recommended that managers adopt the transformational leadership style to improve followers? performance. The study can assist bank managerial employees to apply the relevant style when dealing with their followers to mitigate risk in the bank. Efficient risk management depends on the effectiveness of the leader.
M19|New trends in control(-ling): qualitative analysis of results|Internal controlling represents all control activities, which are performed within a certain system. In addition to this approach, there is also an approach relates to the motivation of the individual and the popular practical financial approach, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives. Since three meanings of one term may be counterproductive, we will recommend a slight change. Controlling might be influenced by accounting, social control and cybernetics, yet it is still the least researched function of management. During the expansion of the economy, this function of management can hide, but it is very well prepared to intervene if the economic cycle turns into a recession or any kind of crisis appears on the horizon. In Europe, control was associated with investigation, accusation and subsequent punishment and therefore it has negative associations. This paper does not use the term controlling in the German meaning that understands it as a subsystem of management and considers the participation of a controller as a key factor.Based on a questionnaire survey from the turn of 2016 and 2017 we are determining new trends in internal controlling. In addition to quantitative responses, we have analyzed in previous papers, we conclude this research with the analysis of qualitative responses. As these data offer a deeper insight into the issues of individual questions, the aim of this paper is to evaluate them.

M19|Two controlling terms: half a century of quiet coexistence|The word control originates from Latin and is currently a popular expression in all European languages. During its development, it gained different meanings. In some cases, the key aspect was comparison, in other corrective action. The German term ?controlling? was put into use in early seventies in business economy, which marks the date of birth of the parallel use of the two terms of controlling. Due to certain conditions, this problem has been hidden. Currently the translation of the German term into English can cause problems. The aim of this conceptual paper is to highlight the issue of using the term controlling in Europe by analyzing the available literature and to propose a possible solution of the problem.

Mit diesem Beitrag sollen das Canvas Business Model, das Konzept-kreative Gründung und die Methodik Effectuation zur Dokumentation von Geschäftsideen vorgestellt und ein Vergleich zur altbewährten Kausallogik des Businessplan gezogen werden.
M19|Unternehmensnachfolgen in Deutschland 2018 bis 2022|Wegen fehlender amtlicher Statistiken schätzt das IfM Bonn seit Mitte der 1990er Jahre die Anzahl der Unternehmen in Deutschland, die vor der Übergabe stehen. Die vorliegende Schätzung für den Zeitraum 2018 bis 2022 kommt zum Ergebnis, dass etwa 150.000 Unter-nehmen mit rund 2,4 Mio. Beschäftigten zur Übergabe anstehen. Eine zusätzlich durchge-führte Approximation des Nachfolgegeschehens auf Basis der Gewerbeanzeigenstatistik belegt, dass die aktuelle Schätzung des IfM Bonn die Zahl der tatsächlich erfolgten Unter-nehmensübertragungen relativ gut abbildet. Wie letztlich die Nachfolge geregelt werden wird (familienintern, unternehmensintern oder -extern), ist wegen fehlender amtlicher Statistiken ebenfalls schwer vorherzusagen. Unsere Analysen lassen jedoch die Vermutung zu, dass gut die Hälfte der vor der Nachfolgefrage stehenden Familienunternehmen ihr Unternehmen innerhalb der Familie weitergibt. Etwa 18 % der Familienunternehmen werden von Mitarbei-tern übernommen und die restlichen 29 % werden an Externe verkauft.
M19|The Influence of Islamic Governance on Minimizing Non-Compliance with Sharia|Objective - One of the operational objectives of sharia banks is to comply with sharia principles. Therefore, the non-compliance of sharia banks to sharia law may be prevented by implementing Islamic Good Corporate Governance (GCG), which is controlled by the Sharia Supervisory Board (SSB), the board of directors, and the board of management. Methodology/Technique - In this study, sharia non-compliance is defined as all cases of disobedience found in the report of sharia banks, covering things such as non-halal income, criminal law violations, civil law violations, and fraud. The unit of analysis of this research is sharia banks in Indonesia. Seven sharia banks were used as the study sample for the period between 2012 and 2015. The source of data for this study comprised of GCG annual reports. The data analysis method and hypothesis testing was conducted using a factor analysis and multiple regression analysis. Findings - The findings show that higher levels of supervision from the SSB tend to minimize the instanc of sharia non-compliance as a whole, criminal and civil law violations, and fraud, although not to a level that is statistically significant. The influence of the board of management on non-halal income was negative, although statistically insignificant. The influence of the supervision from both the board of directors and the board of management on overall sharia non-compliance is also not statistically significant. Novelty - The influence of the board of management on non-halal income was negative, although statistically insignificant. The influence of the supervision from both the board of directors and the board of management on overall sharia non- compliance is also not statistically significant.
M19|Accrual Basis Landscape: The Absence of Political Will in Preventing Dysfunctional Behaviour in Indonesia|Objective - This research aims to reveal the failure of accrual accounting to create good governance and clean government in local governments in Indonesia. Additionally, the research seeks to examine the increase in accrual based rapid growth in Indonesia and the instance of corruption among government officials. Methodology/Technique - In connection with this objective, the study explains the practical perspective of political intervention during the adoption of accrual accounting and examines the role of the community in the implementation of accrual accounting using a critical phenomenology method. Findings - The findings of this study show that accrual-based accounting encourages deviant behaviour within the public sector and hence, good governance and clean government cannot be achieved. Accrual basis in this regard becomes a means for actors to conceal fraud by exploiting the weaknesses of accrual-based accounting to allow for creative accounting. Novelty - This study uses a qualitative method to describe the implementation of accrual-based accounting in local governments in Indonesia, which is a new approach to this phenomenon.
M19|Restoration of Budget Control: How It Should Be? A Case Study of the Local Government of Indonesia|"Objective - This research aim is to examine the phenomenon of budget control and deviant behavior in order to answer the question: ""how should budget control in the government sector be in order to effectively prevent deviant behavior such as budgetary slack?"" The study focuses on local governments in Indonesia, where such controls have not been able to combat budgetary slack, which has led to widespread corruption. Methodology/Technique - This study uses the Habermas method to criticize budgetary control practices that continue in the present day. Findings - By creating a public space over localized wisdom-based control, known as an informal control system, the weakness of formal control systems in overcoming budgetary slack with be reduced. Novelty - This study takes a critical approach, while most previous studies have adopted a positivistic approach or an interpretative study."

M19|Trust in Leadership and Affective Commitment as a Mediator between Servant Leadership Behavior and Extra-Role Behavior of Teachers|Objective - The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between trust in the leader and affective commitment as a mediator between servant leadership behavior and extra-role behavior. In addition, the study examines, whether person-organization fit has a moderating effect. Methodology/Technique - In total, 250 teachers of the border area responded to the research questionnaires, which were then analyzed using structural equation modeling with a partial least squares approach. Findings - The outputs of this study indicate an indirect influence between the principal servant leadership behaviors and extra-role behaviors among teachers, which was mediated by trust in the principal and the teacher's affective commitment to the principal. Furthermore, the results show a significant and direct relationship between servant leadership behaviors towards trust in the principal, affective commitment, and extra-role behaviors. Trust in the principal and teacher's affective commitment also had a significant and direct effect on extra-role behavior. However, the person-organization fit which moderates the effect of servant leadership behaviors on extra-role behaviors did not have a significant or direct effect on extra-role behaviors, in fact, it actually weakened the influence of servant leadership behaviors on extra-role behaviors. Novelty - The findings of this study suggest that trust in the principal and teacher's affective commitment has an important moderating effect which must be managed to strengthen the relationship between servant leadership behaviors and extra-role behaviors.
M19|The Gender Role in Local Governmental Institution (A Study of Malang Local Governmental Institution, East Java)|"Objective - This research aims to examine the issue of gender equality in nations who adopt a patriarchal value system, such as Indonesia, where the opportunity for woman to participate in government is relatively limited. The governance implemented in Indonesia, both central and local level, tend to adhere to the principles of ""Good Governance"". Inherent in these principles is the principle of gender equality, which aims to provide all citizens with the opportunity to improve and maintain their prosperity. Methodology/Technique - This research focuses on 2 main questions, namely: what is the role and position of woman in local government in Kota Malang? and what is the strategy and obstacles faced in improving the role of women? The method used in this research is descriptive research with a qualitative approach. The data was collected through documentation, interviews and observation. The data was analyzed using Miles and Huberman's interactive model, namely: data reduction, data display and conclusion. Findings - The results show that the role of woman in making public policy is limited to participation as a consulting member only, with no ability to influence the material substance of they policy. Further, it seems that illiteracy of women in the area remains high, and only a marginal number of women currently occupy higher positions in the government. Further, the election of a woman to the position of Mayor had no significant effect on the rate of gender equality. Novelty - This research suggests that there is a need for increased representation of woman in politics, either in legislative, judicative or executive branches of government, a need to develop a local rule (PERDA) to include woman in governmental affairs, the need to amend the current governmental system to a more justice-focused system, in order to support the legal system by supporting small groups and balance values and morality by increasing representation of women across all sectors."

M19|"""It's a Bible!"" Unexpected use, misuse and non-use of CSR standards among ""activist"" workers"|"The purpose of this empirical study is to understand how ""activist"" workers use CSR standards in order to manage tensions stemming from their idealist identity. I use a narrative methodology with findings based on the analysis of narratives from shop-floor workers who combine activism and work in a cooperative network of organic shops framing the activity of independent retailers through a specification note detailing CSR imperatives. I contrast two dynamics. As subjects in the application of standards, workers display a deep trust towards the standards creator, arising from an imaginary about the expertise and ethics of the organization. Hence, they blindly use this management tool as a resource to frame the hyper-awareness and hyper-knowledge which create endless internal conflicts. As objects of those standards, workers tend to adopt a more critical or cynical stance. Hence, dissatisfied workers use standards as a resource in a struggle for their own sake, framing their propensity to sacrifice in order to support a higher purpose. The main contribution of the present paper is to show that CSR standards are used as resource to outsource identity tensions management to the organization. Those standards give ""the right dose of stupidity"" protecting workers from over-questioning and over-commitment that are double-edge swords for this kind of organizations."
M19|Being There: The Role of Mindfulness in the Entrepreneurial Process|The construct of mindfulness has attracted the attention of multiple scientific disciplines. However, research on mindfulness in the field of entrepreneurship remains limited. Research findings suggest that mindfulness through its temporal orientation and wide attentional breadth influences different aspects of cognitions and emotions and is beneficial and cost-effective in a dynamic rather than static environment. Extending these findings to entrepreneurship, I suggest that mindfulness has implications in entrepreneurship because of the environment in which entrepreneurs work and the tasks they usually perform. I propose a theoretical framework for understanding the role of mindfulness in the entrepreneurial process.

M19|The Impact of Enterprise Risk Management, Strategic Agility, and Quality of Internal Audit Function on Firm Performance|This paper examines the relationship of enterprise risk management (ERM) implementation to firm performance, the mediating role of strategic agility and moderating role of quality of internal audit function (QIAF) in this relationship among Malaysian public listed companies (PLCs). ERM implementation was conceptualized with the elements in COSO (2004) ERM integrated framework, and firm performance was measured by financial and non-financial indicators. Atotal of 137 responses were obtained through questionnaire from PLCs in main market of Bursa Malaysia. The empirical findings of the study suggest that ERM implementation has a significant relationship to firm performance and strategic agility significantly mediate the relationship. However, QIAF does not significantly moderate the relationship between ERM implementation and firm performance. Low response rate presents a challenge to generalize the content to all PLCs in Malaysia. Due to time and cost constraints this study did not acquire any secondary data and interviews which may provide further in-depth findings related to the research. In this study ERM framework as an integrative risk management has been recognized as the contributor to the firm performance of sample companies. PLCs, securities commission and institute of internal auditors Malaysia will benefit from the findings of this study
M19|Modern Hypermarket Receiving Yard Utilization: The Implementation of a Simulation Model|"""Objective – This research is a direct observation of initial queuing, using data that is categorised into two clusters: the number of people queuing at busy hours, and processing times in the same circumstances. Methodology/Technique – The raw data was converted for use in the Poisson distribution test, as well as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov exponential distribution options. An arena simulation model was also applied to identify the vendor's waiting time and to analyse receiving yard utilization. The average waiting time according to the Poisson distribution, the average serving time per vendor by an exponential distribution, and the number of receiving yards, are all essential factors effecting the utilization of receiving yards. Findings – The study compares the length of queues, serving times, arrival rate, and time in the system using dual and single receiving yard systems. However, the utilization rate on a two receiving yards system is less than the rate on single receiving yard system. As the aim of this study is to identify the utilization rate of the receiving yard, a single receiving yard operation is more representative of modern hypermarkets, and more efficient in terms of resource efficiency. Novelty – This study depends fully on the homogeneous operating hours of the retailers' receiving yards, the type of vehicle used by vendors to unload merchandises, procedures on moving the products to the inspections phase, a generalization of the products delivered by the vendors and the size of the modern hypermarkets business itself.

Methodology/Technique – The respondents of this study are employees in the finance sector. The data was collected using commitment to change, change self-efficacy and transformational leadership inventories. The data was analyzed using multiple hierarchical regressions. Findings – The result show that both transformational leadership and change self-efficacy have a positive and significant effect on affective commitment to change. Furthermore, change self-efficacy proved to have a more significant effect on affective commitment to change compared to transformational leadership. Based on these results, organisations may wish to further focus on the development of change self-efficacy of individuals. Novelty – This study can be used by HR practitioners when dealing with organizational change, as a guide to improving the success of such change.
M19|Boutique Hotels Users Experience, Experiencia De Usuarios En Hoteles Boutique|The purpose of this research is to analyze the experience of tourists who were lodged in boutique hotels located at Querétaro México. We use a theorical, qualitaitve and transverse research with information retrieved from two specialized lodging online reviews websites: Tripadvisor and Booking, for the period between July 1st 2014 through July 1st 2015. The discussion revolves around Pine and Gilmore´s Theory of economy experience that considers four dimensions: entertainment, education, esthetic and escapism. It is linked with the Barney´s resources theory, where competitive advantage is linked with the resources generated in the enterprise´s interior. Our initial research proposal is that these resources are closely linked to the experience of the tourist. Data treatment and discourse analysis was conducted with the support of Atlas Ti software. We conclude that esthetic experience is the major presence in the tourist´s comments. It is highly linked to physical and equipment resources, of the hotels. Entertainment and education experiences present ample opportunities for development in the boutique lodging.

The study presents a summary of empirical studies for the period 1990–2015. The research results indicate that more strategic tools and techniques are used in developed countries, followed by developing countries and fewest in countries in transition. This study is likely to contribute to the field of strategic management because it summarizes the most used strategic tools and techniques at the global level according to varying stages of countries’ economic development. Also, the findings from this study may be utilized to maximize the full potential of enterprises and reduce the cases of entrepreneurship failures, through creating awareness of the importance of using strategic management tools and techniques.

M19|Logistics Services, Technics and Software in Bulgaria from the Perspective of the Manufacturing and Trading Enterprises and Their Competitive Strategy|Logistics outsourcing is an increasingly common practice among manufacturing and trading enterprises. Being customers of the logistics sector, their perceptions of the supplied logistics technics, software services in Bulgaria, as well as the used logistics services by them, are important for the development of the logistics sector and logistics in our country. On the basis of empirical data this study evaluates the availability, quality and price of the supplied logistics services, technics and software from the point of view of the manufacturing and trading enterprises, the extent of usage of the different logistics services, as well as the existing differences between enterprises concerning their type, size and strategy. The competitive advantages that are achieved through the usage of some services are outlined too. The methods of descriptive statistics and statistical hypothesis testing are applied for data analysis. The existence of differences between the studied enterprises concerning their type and strategy is determined through t-test. The impact of the enterprisesï¿½ size on the used services is estimated trough the nonï¿½parametric equivalent of one-way analysis of variance - the Kruskalï¿½Wallis test, and the relationships between the different dimensions of competitiveness and the used logistics serï¿½vices ï¿½ through Spearmanï¿½s rank correlation coefficients. The study finds out that it is necessary to improve the ratio between quality and price of most services and the capabilities of logistics companies in relation to providing value-added services, management of distribution/procurement for their customers and total logistics packages. Evidences are brought fourth that enterprises using a variety of logistics services, besides the traditional transportation and ware housing, achieve a higher level of competitiveness concerning its different dimensions, especially those ones that have mainly a differentiating character.

Previous studies offered limited insight due to unidimensional while this study takes multivariate approach, considering; variable of interest examined in terms of economies and gender. Cross-sectional research design following semi-structured questionnaire circulated among targeted audience by combining of stratified (probability) and convenience, purposive, and snowball (non-probability) sampling technique at layers of management. The combined sample size is 631 employees. The results showed that females prefer more flexible leadership style in comparison to males. Organisations having high gender diversity and female representation at strategic level are more progressive and innovative. Interestingly, in developing economies, rapid career growth chances are higher for females. Females are more people oriented while male are more task-oriented. Males have high desire for autonomy at workplace.
M19|How 'organizational factors' outclass 'personal factors' in retaining Female Employees in Indian IT SMEs|The article examines organizational and personal factors in relation to the retention of the female workers in the IT SMEs. The organizations operating in the business cities of India were targeted using convenience sampling technique. In addition to that, purposive sampling was used for reaching only female participants. Total 250 females out of 380 completed survey from 30 different software SMEs. The findings of this cross-sectional study reflects that the effectiveness of organizational factors such as work-life balance practices and policies, supervisory support, and technological assistance enable female workers to exhibit higher performance under stress. Interestingly, the myth of personal factor such as personality, well-being, and emotional intelligence previously found to be effective, in actual does not improve retention rate of female workers at operational level. In addition to that, detailed analysis revealed that supervisory support is most closely interlinked with retention, followed by policies and procedures of Work Life Balance, and lastly technological assistance. Moreover, societal norms have significant role to certain extent in the creating retention related perception of female workers.

M19|Changes in management function of control|Controlling is a constantly ongoing managerial process of designing standards, measuring performance, comparing the performance with standards, and implementing corrective actions to ensure effective and efficient running of the organization's activities. Controlling represents one of the basic functions in management in Anglo-American understanding. The original term has been changed from control to controlling, as control is (like a plan in planning) only a small part of long-term activity. The term controlling, however, is also used in German literature, where it represents what Anglo-American literature refers as management (or managerial) accounting. As the Central and Eastern European literature is heavily influenced by German literature, in English-written papers published in Europe confusions often happen. Based on results of our questionnaire survey in 331 companies operating in Slovakia, which collected data at the turn of 2016 and 2017, we analyze the changes in management function of controlling and compare them with the findings in literature. We analyze the research results according to the different characteristics of the research sample, such as the size of the company by number of employees, the economic result, the respondent's position in the organizational structure of the company, or the respondent's attitude if he/she is an object or subject of control. Taking into account the quantitative and qualitative results obtained, we also present specific changes in the control of our businesses.
M19|Changing intensity of control|Every manager must – besides other activities – exercise control over his or her subordinates, no matter if it happens through a direct supervision or through indirect control based on reports or statistics. Performing this managerial function is called controlling in Anglo-American literature. This paper does not understand the concept of managing accounting under the term controlling (German meaning). Controlling is a constantly ongoing managerial process of designing standards, measuring performance, comparing the performance with standards, and implementing corrective actions to ensure effective and efficient running of the organization's activities. However, a manager often becomes also an object of control by himself or herself. Based on results of our questionnaire survey in 331 companies operating in Slovakia, which collected data at the turn of 2016 and 2017, we analyze to what extent managers had to increase their control efforts and to what extent they were exposed to more control from another subject of control in the past year. We analyze the research results according to the different characteristics of our research sample, such as the size of the company by number of employees, the economic result, the respondent's position in the organizational structure of the company, or the respondent's attitude if he/she is an object or subject of control. Due to the quantitative and qualitative results, we also provide reasons for the increase in intensity.
M19|The importance of control in managerial work|Control represents a process through which managers ensure that resources are procured and used efficiently and effectively to meet the goals of the organization. It is a dynamic function interrelated with the other management functions, and it plays a role of critical determinant in achieving organizational success. The individual management functions provide a useful framework for organizing managerial knowledge. Control involves tracking, measuring, and correcting activities to ensure a compliance of actual development with the planned one. Effective controlling requires the existence of plans, since planning provides the necessary performance standards or objectives. Controlling also requires a clear understanding of where responsibility for deviations from standards lies. The paper contains the results of questionnaire survey realized in 331 companies aimed to determine the importance of control process in carrying out daily managerial tasks in different types of organizations active in various sectors. We analyze the attitudes of managers when they are controlling and when they are being controlled with emphasis on main reasons. The paper confirms the importance of control in management work, while one of the most obvious benefits of controlling function is that it provides the accurate information which is wanted for effective decision making process as well as maintaining effective functioning state of a business.
M19|Changing Views on Organizational Control in the Countries of the Eastern Bloc|Control is the terminal sequential function of management and its importance has risen during the last economic crisis. In the Eastern approach of organizational control, a manager can be either the subject of control, when he oversees an object or the object of control, when another subject oversees him. The subject and object do not need to be necessary from the same system, which means that this is a case of external control. There are several differences between the Eastern and Western approach to control. These differences are conditioned more by political development (the Communist regime) than the geographic location, when China has a similar theoretical base and Japan or India not at all. Aim of this paper is to examine the changing views of managers on being controlled by another subject, as the number of executives who did not experienced the era of communism is increasing.
M19|Managing Change and Strategic Thinking: Evidences from Hospitality and Tourism Sector of the UK|This qualitative paper examines the strategic thinking and managing change in complex business environment in the hospitality and tourism sector of the UK through the cases of Hilton London Canary Wharf and Hilton London Tower Bridge. For the purpose of analysis, researchers explored the research phenomenon under different models including TALC model and IBTEE Model. Using convenience sampling, researchers interviewed face-to-face 12 Line Managers and 30 employees through open-ended semi-structured interview questions regarding change management process and obstacles interlinked with it. Findings revealed that although Hilton hotels have adapted changes to some extent but there is still more room for further improvement. The management of the selected hotels highly relies on the training purpose for the effective change adaption whereas coaching and research is lagging behind. The biggest constraint during effective change adaption is the diverse background of the workforce as most are from the multicultural backgrounds. Moreover, the communication, ritual, and cultural barriers are causing issues in the change process. Lastly, the recommendations are given for consolidating effective change management at workplace.
M19|Influence of the Big Five personality traits on academic motivation among higher education students: Evidence from developing nation|This study examines the association between the personality traits and academic motivation among higher education institution students of Pakistan. The data is collected from the survey-questionnaire using the convenience sampling technique. In total, 350 questionnaires are collected, however, the useful sample id 320. The technique through which the analysis was performed is PLS-SEM. The dependent variable of the study is academic motivation which was measured by using the LASSI scale. The independent variables of the study are personality traits i.e., Conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, extraversion, and openness which is measured by using NEO-FFI. The result shows that all the personality traits create a significant positive effect on academic motivation except for agreeableness which has an insignificant effect on academic motivation. This study highlights the importance of personality trait in forming academic motivation of the students and also help the educational institutions and teachers to develop strategies accordingly.
M19|Transformational leadership, organizational commitment and innovative success|Transformational leadership is important for enhancing organizational performance.

M19|Improving the effectiveness of market-oriented organisation: Empirical evidence from an emerging economy|In the context of an emerging market economy, this study examines the mediating role of marketing capabilities on the market orientation (MO)â€“performance relationship. Specifically, the authors investigate the roles of product innovativeness, customer relationship management (CRM) capability, research and development (R&D) integration and brand management capabilities in the institutionalisation of a MO culture and the implementation of MO behaviours. With data collected from 150 organisations, the authors find that MO behaviour fully mediates the effects of MO culture on product innovativeness and CRM capability, which in turn enhance firm performance. In addition, leadership quality facilitates the effect of MO culture on MO behaviour, and the effects of product innovativeness and CRM capability on firm performance are greater in the presence of R&Dâ€“marketing integration and brand management capabilities, respectively.

There is compelling evidence that mainstream Australians are avid social media users. Understanding of social media consumption and its impact is important for a wide range of stakeholders. The objective of this study is to better understand the beliefs that drive social media consumption in the Northern Territory Australia. Primary data for this paper was obtained through an on-line survey. Based on 420 usable responses, this paper explores the underlying beliefs of individual and institutional social media users. Data analysis identified statistically significant differences in the beliefs of the two cohorts.
M19|Workplace Ostracism And Work Engagement: The Moderating Role Of Neuroticism|This study investigates the relationship between workplace ostracism and work engagement of the employees in the local governments and whether neuroticism, one of the personality traits, has a role on this relationship. Convenience sampling was used and data were obtained from a sample of 369 employees from two municipalities. The results show that there is a negative relationship between workplace ostracism and work engagement. Moreover, neuroticism moderates the negative relationship between workplace ostracism and work engagement. Overall, the results show that work engagement decreases as workplace ostracism increases, and highly neurotic employees are more negatively affected by workplace ostracism. Local governments may utilize the results in their efforts to create an environment fostering work engagement. Leaders may apply the study outcomes about the role of employee personality and workplace ostracism to improve their service performance.
M19|Tensions at the intersection of management control and innovation: a literature review|Abstract This paper reviews 47 articles dealing with tensions at the intersection of management control and innovation. One purpose is to present the status of the research in the area in terms of types of articles, research methods, theoretical approaches, and tension-related terms used. A second purpose is to conceptually compare the use and interpretations of tension in the reviewed articles, as well as to systematically map and categorize highlighted competing demands. A third purpose is to suggest a tension-based framework. Among other characteristics and trends, the paper indicates an increased research interest in the issue of tensions during the review period (1991–2015). Although different theoretical approaches are adopted, the contingency approach is the most common. Furthermore, the review shows that several tension-related terms are used either alone or in parallel in the articles, often interchangeably and without clarifying their definitions. The tension-based framework presents four different types of tension: (1) inherent innovation-control tensions, (2) inherent management control tensions, (3) created management control tensions, and (4) decision-making tensions in innovation practices. The framework also suggests interpretations of and responses to tensions related to management control and innovation. Theoretically, the framework can enable a more precise debate that builds on previous research, since it clarifies potential ways to structure future research. From a practical point of view the presented framework can be helpful for managers dealing with tensions, by encouraging creative management control solutions that can enable innovation.
M19|Are the risks of being creative manageable? The case of public research in Hard Science|This study analyses the risk associated to creative research in the field of Hard Science. The theoretical framework in which the research question has been developed affirms that researchers’ creativity and their risk aversion are negatively correlated. In the analysis of two case study, we found that many of the sources of the different risks perceived by researchers are generated by a misfit between scientists’ goals and mission of the organization in which they operate. In this research, we found that scientists show aversion for a great variety of risks, which mainly change according to the research field, to the nature of the research (basic vs applied), to the composition of the research team and to the type of research activities (experimental vs theoretical). This paper develops a categorization of the observed risks and proposes the exploitation of some resources in order to decrease the impacts of the risks on researchers’ creativity.
M19|Hierarchical similarity biases in idea evaluation: A study in enterprise crowdfunding|To be successful innovators, organizations must select the best ideas for implementation. Extant research shows that idea selection is distorted by a number of biases, but has failed to consider hierarchy, a key element of organizations. We examine how hierarchical distance between an idea's creator and its evaluator affects evaluation outcomes and thus advance three competing theoretical predictions based on homophily, competition, and status. To test our predictions, we use a unique dataset from an enterprise crowdfunding initiative at Siemens where 265 employees evaluated 77 ideas by allocating corporate funds, resulting in 20,405 evaluation dyads. We find that idea evaluations are more favorable if the idea creator is hierarchically similar to the evaluator, thus supporting the homophily perspective. Idea novelty amplifies this bias, inducing more social evaluations. Our findings are robust to various specifications and tests, and are absent in a subsample where idea creators remained anonymous. We contribute to the idea evaluation research and inform organizational idea selection process designs.
M19|Is necessity the mother of disruption?|This study investigates the origins of disruptive innovation. According to the canonical model, disruptive innovations do not originate from existing customers - in contrast with what the user innovation literature would predict. We compiled a unique historical and content-analytic dataset based on 62 cases identified from the disruptive innovation literature. We found that 44% of the disruptive innovations in this sample were originally developed by users. Disruptive innovations are more likely to originate from users (producers) if the environment is characterized by high levels of turbulence in customer preferences (technology). Disruptive innovations involving high functional (technological) novelty, tend to be developed by users (producers). Users are also more likely to be the source of disruptive process innovations, and to innovate in weaker appropriability environments. Our paper is among the first to link the disruptive and user innovation literatures. We contribute to both and offer guidance to managers on the likely source of disruptive threats.
M19|Kennzahlenmanagement und -controlling: Prozessorientiertes Performance Management in internationalen Unternehmen|Wenn prozessorientiertes Performance Management in nationalen Unternehmen und in internationalen Unternehmen gleich ausgeprägt ist, können viele Synergieeffekte erreicht werden. Dazu wurde eine explorative Studie auf Basis von 26 Industriepartnern mit Hilfe einer anonymisierten Online-Fragebogenaktion an der Hochschule Pforzheim im 4. Quartal 2014 durchgeführt. Die Ergebnisse der Fragebogenaktion lassen erkennen, dass sich die Kennzahlen der in der Studie untersuchten deutschen Muttergesellschaften häufig nicht von den Performance Measures der internationalen Tochtergesellschaften unterscheiden. Welche Ursachen sich dahinter verbergen, zeigt dieser Forschungsbeitrag. Dieses Ergebnis könnte zukünftig differenzierter ausfallen, wenn auch durch weitere Forschung die internationalen Muttergesellschaften in die Untersuchung miteinbezogen werden würden.

M19|Considerations Regarding the Quality Management of Banking Services|Efforts that Romanian banking institutions must make to increasing the competitiveness of services are becoming increasingly difficult to sustain and lead to a price - quality ratio to be properly appreciated. Quality of services is the most important aspect in banking too. Banks being aware of the quality problems also lead to the appearance and requirement of some area working standards to respond to requests and expectations on increasing internal or external customer satisfaction and ways that they can become competitive in a market increasingly diversified and demanding. This paper aims to present the key aspects of the quality system , the main operational elements and the sequence of steps for implementing the quality assurance system in banking activities.
M19|How Service Industries can Transform themselves into Green Business Industries|Green business in service sector is expected to transform industrial economy to service economy and is complied with the trend of world economy development. Environmental benefits and sustainability are two characteristics of Green business. Under the background of the transformation of the world economic structure, what the companies provide to customers should be no longer the pure physical products, but more and more dematerialization services. For example, the companies provide services (or a function, effectiveness) to the customers as the complementation of physical products, which will prolong and strengthen the relationship between providers and customers, make the companies pay more attention to product life cycle cost management, stimulate the companies reducing the consumption of energy and the emission of greenhouse gases, improve the production efficiency and reduce cost. In the green business model, service is expanded to the main components of business model such as, what kinds of product and service will be provided by companies (the process of service creation), how will the product and service be transferred to customers, how will the benefits be captured by providers around service (value realization). In this paper, we have analysed and discussed how Service Industries can transform themselves into Green Business Industries in terms of their opportunities and challenges by considering 21 service sectors. The consequences of going green and sustainability of service sector by technology adoption is also discussed.
M19|The interface of networking and 'wasta' in an Arabic context|ABSTRACT Purpose - The aim of this study is to uncover particular and significant methods of pursuing business connections, in the small manufacturing businesses of Tangier. Prior Work - The significance of networking and its impact on the performance of SMEs was revealed in a number of studies. There have been significant studies on the structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions of social capital in value creation. It can be noted that there are potentially significant differences in the concept of networking particularly those that are influenced by Arabic culture. Approach - A two-stage design, which incorporated both quantitative and qualitative approaches, was employed in this study. Approaches were employed in succession with the findings from the quantitative phase informing the qualitative phase. Initially, a paper and online survey questionnaire was administered to a population of 365 industrial SMEs to gain some insights on the perceptions of owner-managers of the impact of networking on business performance. Following the quantitative phase, fifteen in-depth face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with selected owner-managers of SMEs, forming a judgmental selection, to explore their experiences, beliefs, and attitudes with respect to networking factor. Results - Both quantitative and qualitative phases of the study found that networking was a significant factor in influencing the success of SMEs. The concept of wasta, the Arabic word for connections, emerged from the qualitative phase. Findings show that using wasta, through politico-business networks is important since it enables access to current information that is crucial for the success of SMEs. The concept of wasta was also mentioned in relation to financial resources and suppliers. Findings revealed that strong relationships with suppliers enable firms to get financial resources in the form of trade credits. Furthermore, the relationship between wasta and human resources was also revealed. Findings showed that owner-managers use their network relations through wasta in order to recruit their staff. Implications - The findings of this study add to the understanding of networking in Arabic countries with the importance of wasta in an economy that functions on relationships. The findings of this study could therefore be useful to international managers to assist their intercultural effectiveness by adjusting to culture-specific networking in Tangier. Value - This study supports previous findings of Hutchings & Weir (2006) and contributes additional evidence that suggests the significance of wasta and its impact on SME success.
M19|Training & Development Barometer for Effective Transformation of Organizational Commitment and Overall Performance in Banking Sectors of KPK, Pakistan: Qualitative study of Workforce of Bank of Khyber|This research paper investigates the impact of T&D program on the level of employees' organizational commitment and overall performances in the Banking sector of KPK by considering Bank of Khyber as a case study. Study aims to critically examine all three attributes of organizational commitment (affective, normative, and continuance commitment respectively) and its impact on the job satisfaction in banking sector of KPK, Pakistan. The notions of Guest et.al, (2003) and Wall & Wood (2005) are taken as a foundation to explore the linkage between organisational commitment and T&D program, however both these studies had not investigated all three attributes in equal manner. The focus of these previous studies were more on affective and continuance commitment and did not investigate the causes and consequences that make these attributes to create an impact on the overall performances. Thus this study is significant because it attempts to explain in exploratory manner the reasons behind impact created by training. Inductive approach in a cross-sectional design following interpretive research philosophy research is carried out. The bank of Khyber, KPK is case study selected with 15 regional and branch managers as participants for interviews and 277 employees participated in the survey questionnaire, selected through stratified, convenience, and random sampling technique. Results of present study indicates that to retain skilled workforce, organization has to work on their continuance commitment by offering them promotion and salary increment because these are two factors that enable firms to retain skilled workers. Training increases employees' affective and normative commitment more in general as compare to continuance commitment. This paper contributes to the field of management and administrative sciences by investigating the relationship between T&D program and employees' performance and organisational commitment by exploring workforce and management's perspective through financial institution. It adds to the managerial literature related to T&D in relation with organisational commitment and overall performance in developing country's context.
M19|Quality Work-Life as predictor to Organisational Commitment under contrasting Leadership Styles: I.T Responses from Pakistan's private software houses|This study investigate the dimensions of organisational commitment under transformational and transactional leadership style while considering the attributes of Quality Work-life prevailing in Pakistan's private software houses. Theoretical framework is developed by considering studies commenced in last three decades on similar topic. This study considers positivist paradigm with objective epistemology, realism ontology, and hyopthetico-deductive quantitative method to explore the relationship between research variables. The sample size for study is 408 participants from 10 mega cities of Pakistan through combining probability and non-probability sampling technique. Self-administered survey questionnaire was circulated through HR department of targeted firms. Results showed that transformational leadership has strong significant relationship with all dimensions of organisational commitment whereas transactional leadership has positive relationship with affective and continuance commitment. Employees prefer transformational leadership style and their level of commitment is driven by existing QWL programme. This paper contributes to expansion of body of knowledge regarding QWL and organisational commitment under considered leadership styles in developed economies. This paper is unique in terms of strategic approach such as deductive quantitative approach under scientific paradigm.
M19|The perceptual effects of location on the performance of small businesses|Purpose - This study aims to develop a clearer understanding of the effects of location on the performance of small and medium enterprises in Tangier, as perceived by local owner-managers. Prior Work - Several studies have attempted to explain the role of location on business performance. Whilst some studies have stressed urban and rural locations, other studies have often paid particular attention to the connection of location and taxation and industry clustering effects. While the findings of these studies are important, they are perhaps insufficient in fully understanding the role of location. Approach - Fifteen in-depth face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with selected owner-managers of SMEs, forming a judgmental selection, to explore their experiences, beliefs, and attitudes with respect to their performance. Results - Findings of the study revealed that location is a salient factor that influences the performance of SMEs in Tangier. Although at the research design stage it was considered a classificatory variable, location was mentioned extensively in the interviews, in relation to the ‘free zones’. Findings showed that firms located within the free zones enjoyed favourable conditions, in particular, those related to taxation and competition, compared to their counterparts located outside the free zones, which were excluded from these benefits. Furthermore, perceived unfair competition damaged the performance of the SMEs. These findings suggest that the placement of the business in relation to the free zones thus became an important financial and emotionally significant perspective on equality in relation to success. Implications - Findings could encourage the government to adopt policies that will assist indigenous firms to benefit from advantages that are comparable to those that are available to those in the free zones. Greater attention to the perceptual effects of location would be advantageous. Value - This research contributes to the theory about SME development in that it highlights the issue of location as a significant factor in the perception of success.Location was a much more acute and multi-faceted issue than in most other studies. In this context of Tangier, ‘location’ may function as a higher-order concept (than say urban versus rural) in relation to, both the placement of business within a country, and choices between countries as jurisdictions in terms of location. There have been few studies on what might be called the psycho-geography of small business, given the predominant view that we are seeing the ‘death of distance’.
M19|The Role of ICT in Czech Industrial Companies in the 21st Century|In the conditions of the new economy, business investment in information and communications technology (ICT) has proven to be critical for company development. The main reason is that performance in other business areas is becoming gradually dependent on ICT. The theoretical part of the paper, based on a literature review, discusses the state of the art in the field related to the impact of ICT on selected non-financial performance areas. The aim of the empirical part is to analyse the relationship between the degree of ICT implementation and production quality, customer, and human capital. We employ a questionnaire among industrial companies in the Czech Republic in order to test these relationships. The analysis finds statistically significant relationships between the examined constructs. Our findings suggest that the quality of ICT has a significant impact on production quality, customer and human capital.
M19|Predicting HR’s involvement and influence in strategic decision-making|While it has become increasingly common to envision the HR function having an expanded role in business, we know little about the determinants of its strategic involvement and influence. Drawing on strategic contingencies theory (SCT) and institutional theory, a model for both constructs was developed and tested. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze web-survey data from 167 firms in the U.S. and Canada. As predicted, HR coping ability, firm size, and human-capital munificence were positively related to strategic involvement. Strategic influence, in turn, was directly related to HR centrality and the level of involvement. Moderated regression analysis failed to support either of the hypothesized country effects. Implications for future research and management practice are discussed at the end of the article.
M19|A long way home: How an intra-organizational innovation network overcomes its political boundaries|This article focuses on the still understudied link among political boundaries and innovation practices and its inherent boundary-crossing mechanisms in intra-organizational innovation networks. Our single case study at the sports company adidas derives two particular combinations of boundaries and boundary-crossing mechanisms to overcome political boundaries in intra-organizational innovation networks. These are the ‘open-closed (minded) boundaries’ and ‘everybody-is-an-innovator boundaries’. They have been addressed with distinct innovation practices that comprise the boundary-crossing mechanisms ‘reframe interests’ and ‘negotiate interests’. We find that these boundary-crossing mechanisms to be crucial in the process of managing the intra-organizational innovation network. Our findings have implications for the organizational anchoring of innovation practices given its importance as enabler or barrier to overcome political boundaries in intra-organizational innovation networks.
M19|Managing A Complex Adaptive Ecosystem: Towards A Smart Management Of Industrial Heritage Tourism|This paper is focused on the concept of business ecosystem, which is a relatively new field in management research. Furthermore, there is a second emerging research approach in social sciences named “complexity theory” that considers ecosystems, and business ecosystems, as complex adaptive systems. The main aim is to connect both by bringing new insights under the basis of a smart vision of tourism. In particular, we propose a theoretical discussion of the aforementioned concepts by applying them to the specific context of Industrial Heritage Management. The Industrial Heritage (i.e.: mining sites, old infrastructures, museums and historic places related to industry…) is chosen because it appears well representative: it is characterized by a complex and dynamic structure which consists of an interconnected population of stakeholders and several tangible and intangible resources to recover, organize and then manage. It follows that the management of this ecosystem should take into account many factors simultaneously. Based also on the emergent initiative of Smart Tourism, a conceptual model is presented, in which each component is explained and the focal complexity aspects appearing in this business ecosystem are highlighted. We conclude with a set of propositions for recommending new paths for future studies.
M19|The Impact Of Medical Tourism On The Quality Of Organizational And Functional Changes In The Polish Healthcare System|The role of Medical Tourism in the process of a complex satisfaction of the prosumers and the impact played in the organizational and functional changes in the Polish healthcare system. The analysis of the literature on the subject as well as an analysis of the documentation were the inspiration to write this work. The main emphasis was put on stating the conditions stimulating the development of this sector of the economy as well as the risk factors determining the quality of process changes in the healthcare system (functioning of public hospitals). To approximate the characteristics of the involved risk within the framework of health tourism functioning in the conditions of a market economy. Selected research methods allowed to present the motives behind undertaken actions of both the regulators as well as participants of the health tourism. Polish accession to the EU was an important impulse changing the way of thinking about health tourism in healthcare as well as, what is important, changes in the institutional and financial policy in Poland. In order to meet health-oriented demands of a prosumer, there should be a coordinated and effective informational system, aimed at improving the quality, reliability, availability of information concerning health tourism.
M19|The Importance of Digital Adoption for Small and Medium Enterprises: Comparative Study of Romanian Service and IT&C SMEs|Service enterprises constitute significant drivers of growth for developed countries as well as countries in development. The global economy in combination with the fast paced development of technology in the digital era create opportunities for companies that realize the importance of the service-technology convergence phenomenon, also known as the service economy 3.0.In the case of the Romanian economy, SMEs and the service sector contribute significantly to the country’s economic growth and our study aims to uncover opportunities for Romanian service SMEs to further their chances of succeeding on the global service market through adoption of digital technologies. We find that it is of utmost importance for Romanian service SMEs to bridge the digital divide through furthering their knowledge of network effects and digital ecosystems that can ultimately result in developing core competencies that help them remain relevant on the global services market.
M19|The Use of Telematics Solutions in Achieving Excellency in Anti Criminal Activity in Romania|Looking at the quality through the results of an activity, in this case an economic activity, our paper aims to identify some causal links between the preventing criminality preventing and control mechanism, based on telematics security systems, and the criminality against property status at country level. The analyzed statistical data series are focused on the evolution of criminality in Romania in the last years, and also on the monitoring marketing based on private dispatches. The big picture reveals that in over 43% of the European countries there is an ascending level of burglaries. In this paper we try to identify if the development of the telematics security market based on private monitoring dispatches a decrease of the criminality against property in Romania. Based on this study we will be able to see if the private companies which provide security services can reach an Excellency level (considered Excellency in business), identified through country level results, based on the use of security telematics solutions.
M19|The Effect of Self Efficacy On Organizational Alienation: A Study on Apart Hotel Employees|Undoubtedly, one of the most important factors of an organization?s success is it?s employees. Since the study of Hawtorne, it is a known fact that employee behavior and performance are related to many organizational variables. One of the variables that effect an organization?s employee performance, productivity and profitability is organizational alienation. When the literature is reviewed, it is seen that organizational alienation has many negative effects on job satisfaction, organizational silence, burn-out, work life quality, organizational commitment, employee turnover and productivity. There are organizational and individual reasons which affecting organizational alienation. The purpose of this study is to reveal the effect of hospitality employees? self efficacy perception on organizational alienation. The research was carried out with employees working in apart hotels in Alanya, one of the most popular tourism destinations in Turkey. The data is collected from a random sample via questionnaire. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to test the validity of hypotheses. After the analysis it was concluded that self-efficacy has a statistically meaningful yet partial effect on organizational alienation.
M19|An Exploratory Study on Social Media Activities of NGOs|Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are aware of the potential that internet provides them to reach out to their stakeholders and they are trying to make use of this potential. Most of the literature concerning NGOs and their social media activities shows that NGOs are having a hard time adapting to social media and they are not making full use of the potential that social media offers them (Waters, Burnett, Lamm and Lucas 2009, p. 105; Bortree and Seltzer, 2009, p. 318; Lovejoy, Waters and Saxton, 2009, p. 313; Waters and Jamal, 2011, p. 323; Muralidharan, Rasmussen, Patterson and Shin, 2011, p. 177; Miller, 2011, p. 46).The purpose of this study is to examine the social media activities of the NGOs located in the City of Çanakkale in Turkey. Data were collected through interviews with people in key positions in the NGOs and also content of social media pages of NGOs were analyzed. Facebook and Twitter are selected as social media websites examined in the study, since they are well-known and widely used sites. The goals of and expectations from NGOs? social media usage are questioned in interviews. The study also tries to determine whether NGOs are using different social media websites for different aims and in which way they are using them. Additionally the study explores with whom they interact on social media, how are they choosing to interact and how efficiently the NGOs are using the feedback they get. The challenges and shortcomings regarding NGOs? social media usage are explored as well. At the end, findings of the study are discussed, and recommendation for practitioners and possible future research implications are presented.
M19|Research On Usage Of New Marketing Tool Social Media In Hotel Firms: Rixos Hotel Chain|The more and more people tend to use the Internet and web tools because of the developing technology and Internet. One of the most important of these tools is social media, a new virtual media that users express themselves and connected with other users. This new media results in the new marketing approach that called as social media marketing and based on interactive participation of consumers. Social media content created by the user or firm has impact on the purchasing decisions of consumers. Therefore, the quantity of spoken and what is spoken about product/service in social media becomes important for firms as well as consumers. Since tourism sector offered the intangible services to consumer, in tourism sector it is important to have social media with quality of visual contents for traveler to have a positive impact before their trip. For that reason, the key objectives of the paper are to examine the application of hotel firms in Instagram that photo-based social media tool and to analyze whether is there any difference or not in photo preferences of a chain hotel operating in different regions. The official Instagram accounts and postings of International Chain Hotels Rixos Group between 20-30 April 2016 was examined by using visual content analysis technique. In this context, chi-square test was performed to reveal the relationship between posting numbers, follower number, followed user number, average number of like and average number of comment of hotels operating under Rixos Hotel Chain and operating in Turkey and abroad. There is a statistically significant difference between F&B and hotel services themed photos according to Mann-Whitney U test that performed to reveal the differences between posted photos? themes that posted by Rixos Hotels operating in Turkey and abroad.
M19|The impact of the competitive strategy on the success of wine companies (The Case of Georgia)|In the global environment, the success of any company largely depends on how swiftly and fast a company can react to the external challenges. Wine industry is one of the priority branches in Georgia. The competition is very tough in this field and the market is almost totally saturated. Therefore, the wine companies have to do their utmost efforts to establish themselves on the local market and think of further growth. Successful are the companies permanently trying to create competitive advantage and develop relevant competitive strategies. The goal of the study is to estimate the importance of the strategy based on the competitive advantage for the companies, to study the degree of using such competitive strategies by wine companies in Georgia and to develop relevant recommendations. The theoretical study is based on the works in management by the world scientists, while the practical study is based on the qualitative study of the business companies of Georgia. The study used questionnaires and interviews, as well as graphical, grouping and comparison methods.The results of the study will reveal the problems of using competitive strategies at wine companies operating in Georgia and will help them to focus on the strategies based on competitive advantage. The novelty of the study lies in the identification of trends of using the competitive strategies in wine industry and development of the recommendations to improve the degree of using them.
M19|A Research Framework for Cross-Cultural Adjustment and Job Performance of Highly Skilled Immigrants|Given the importance of knowledge as a source of economic growth, Canada, like other industrialized countries, increasingly depends on a pool of highly skilled immigrants (HSIs), to remain competitive. However, the poor adaptation of some HSIs to their new cultural environment remains one major factor to their underperformance (Li, 2010). It is crucial for organizations to efficiently manage the cultural issues and to better help HSIs for their cross-cultural adjustment. This paper aims to propose a research framework with two predictors of cross-cultural adjustment from a theoretical perspective: transformational leadership (TL), and learning goal orientation (LGO). In fact, cross-cultural adjustment is a learning process during which an individual learns the norms and appropriate behaviors so as to function in a different culture. Several studies show that the LGO would constitute an important factor to explain how and why certain individuals adapt more than others in the context of cultural transition (Gong & Chang, 2007; Palthe, 2004). Furthermore, since adaptation is first and foremost a process through which incertitude (or stress) is reduced, the TL in diminishing this stress is a crucial factor (Gill and al., 2010; Gundersen and al., 2012). However, the studies that examine their relationships with cultural adaptation are still rather rare. In the light of existing researches in different fields of social sciences, we propose the following research framework for cross-cultural adjustment and job performance of HSIs in Canada:Hypothesis 1. HSIs who have high levels of cross-cultural adjustment will have high levels of job performance.Hypothesis 2a. LGO is positively correlated to the psychological adjustment of HSIs.Hypothesis 2b. LGO is positively correlated to the socio-cultural adjustment of HSIs.Hypothesis 2c. LGO is positively correlated to the work adjustment of HSIs.Hypothesis 3. LGO is positively correlated to the job performance of HSIs.Hypothesis 4a. TL is positively correlated to the psychological adjustment of HSIs.Hypothesis 4b. TL is positively correlated to the socio-cultural adjustment of HSIs.Hypothesis 4c. TL is positively correlated to the work adjustment of HSIs.Hypothesis 5. TL is positively correlated to the job performance of HSIs.Hypothesis 6: HSIs, under the influence of transformational leaders would have higher levels of LGO.Hypothesis 7. Cross-cultural adjustment moderates the relationship between TL and job performance of HSIs.Hypothesis 8. Cross-cultural adjustment moderates the relationship between LGO and job performance of HSIs.
M19|Issues of Improvement of HR Management in Public Sector of Georgia|Work deals with the issues of public sector reformation and development of the effective public administration system. Georgia has implemented numerous reforms in this area, including: internal institutional changes ? reduction of the government administration and public sector staff, for the purpose of improvement of effectiveness and flexibility, formation of the new organizational system and restructuring of the executive departments, reassessment of the public sector functions for improvement of services provided to the citizens, implementation of public-private projects. Certain steps were made for formation of the competitive public service, implying qualification tests for the public servants, adoption of the new organizational policies of promotion and motivation.The work demonstrates that after parliamentary elections of 2012, orientation of reforms in Georgia have changed to certain extent and the issue of necessity of development of the new public service conception was put on agenda and non-governmental sector, academic circles and international organizations took part in this. Currently, the process of reformation has not completed yet and numerous problems still persist in the public sector. They must be analyzed and solved for successful implementation of the reformation process formation of the effective state institutes.Performed researches showed that general qualification level of Georgian public sector employees is mostly incompliant with the qualification requirements, staffing and HR management departments cannot ensure adequate management of public servants and their function is mostly limited to contracts with the staff members. Regarding domestic and foreign experience of work with the personnel, with due regard of socioeconomic factors and Georgian mentality, there were determined such approaches to personnel management that would be suitable to current socioeconomic development in Georgia and help the managers to make their HR management work more effective.
M19|Personal Factors Affecting to the Saving Behavior of People in Bangkok Metropolitan Region, Thailand|The objectives of this study were to investigate the personal factors which affect and have a relationship to the saving behavior of selected people. The study was a research survey that used questionnaires to collect data from 400 samples of people with income. The descriptive statistics relate to the following: frequency, percentage, and inferential statistics ? particularly use of the Chi-Square to analyze the data. In the study, the samples which responded to the questionnaire shared the following characteristics: There were females, age between 18-28 years old, single status, having the master degree of education; most of them are employees in private companies which have a lower or equal amount of 20,000 baht income, and have expenditures of 10,001-15,000 baht. In the matter of savings behavior, it was found that the majority of the samples in question have some type of savings in account with commercial banking (both saving and fixed accounts); they have proportionate savings and income per month, in a setting of available money remaining with a value of more than 5,000 baht. The main reason for saving was precaution, and the time of saving was 1-5 years wherein they have made the decision themselves. From the hypothesis testing, the inferential statistics revealed that demographic factors in the case of career, education and income have significance in a relationship with the saving behavior in every dimension, excepting age, status and expenditure have no relationship with the saving behavior in the proportion of saving and saving decision-maker, also the gender has no relationship in every dimension except the amount of saving at level 0.05.
M19|Management And Marketing Sciences? Reaction To The Networked World|The purpose of the exploratory study is to compare the perspectives of management and marketing sciences on networks and reveal out why and how firms become connected and interdependent, and how the relationships affect their ability to compete according to these perspectives. For this purpose, network theory has been taken as a common ground. The management theories which form the network theory and relationship marketing have been discussed. In this paper, the difference between the perception of management and marketing sciences on networks have been expressed in terms of the components of ARA Model. It is possible to notice that some issues have been reverted under different components. This paper aims to put emphasize on that the two arm in arm sciences are in the opposite edges and explain why by presenting the attitude of two different sciences to networks through a model which explains the network theory. It is hoped that this paper helps decision takers to be enlightened if they act as a manager or marketer.
M19|Effects of Motivating to Sustain Commitment of the Sales Professionals|Motivation is an important tool which can have a signifi cant impact to improve the performance of employees in any organization and in the current competitive world, employees’ commitment is crucial in achieving the organizational goals. The current research is aimed at examining the role played by motivation in sustaining the commitment of sales professionals. Primary data has been collected among 100 sales professionals using the close-ended questionnaire. For the analysis purpose both descriptive and inferential analysis has been conducted. The fi ndings from the analysis show that most factors included in the model to measure the motivation show a signifi cant and positive impact. Similarly the coeffi cient for organizational support, psychological support and fi nancial support shows a positive and signifi cant impact. In examining the impact of increased motivation on employees’ commitment, the results were also statistically signifi cant and positive. On the basis of the fi ndings it can be concluded that the motivation has a signifi cant and positive impact on employees’ commitment so organizations should focus on motivating their employees; however, the method used for motivation can differ from one organization to another.
M19|Postmodernist Identity Construction and Consumption|With the transition from modernism to postmodernism, identity as a concept has started to become redefined in sociology literature. The aim of this study is to show that postmodernism and symbolic interactionism are fused together to delineate both the scene as well as an actor's identity. In that way, the interaction of a social structure with a culture that won't be completely ignored, and, with the opinion that the categorized roles can skillfully be shaped and diversified by actors, it is possible to refrain from a pure determinism. But the transformation to enter different roles lacks meaning. Individuals pay more attention to their appearance more than who they are in order to be accepted by each group. In this manner, a metaphysical shell game begins. In the following study, the 'Social Appearance Anxiety' was used as an indicator of this game. And to determine who is willing to play the game, cultural parameters were utilized. This study was based on the analysis of the data collected through two questionnaires given to 181 students studying at Hitit University. The INDCOL questionnaire [Singelis et al., 1995] measuring cultural values and 'Social Appearance Anxiety' scale developed by [Hart, 2008] were used in the study.
M19|Is the relationship between innovation performance and knowledge management contingent on environmental dynamism and learning capability? Evidence from a turbulent market|Abstract This study aims to explore the separate and combined effects of knowledge management capabilities, environmental dynamism and learning capability on innovation performance. To achieve this aim, a survey was carried out on a sample of 221 firms and a couple of hypotheses were tested. The findings showed that higher levels of environmental dynamism and learning capability made the positive linkage between knowledge management capabilities and innovation performance stronger. Based on the findings, it was suggested that whilst environmental dynamism may compel firms to assimilate and use new information better, create more new product configurations and move readily to new markets through their knowledge management capabilities, learning capability improves the understanding of organizational knowledge and helps the firm embed this knowledge into organizational processes. In this sense, environmental dynamism and learning capability moderate the relationship between knowledge management capabilities and innovation performance.
M19|Opening your product: impact of user innovations and their distribution platform on video game success|Abstract The focus of this paper is the impact of user innovations on the success of video games. Through the use of secondary data sources, a dataset of 204 video games and their expert and user ratings, user innovation and distribution platform support, as well as the number of available user innovations, is constructed and analyzed. The results highlighted in particular the impact of supporting the main distribution platform for modifications, the Steam Workshop. Hypotheses related to the support of user innovations alone were not supported, but platform support did show a significant positive effect on both number of available user innovations as well as user ratings. The number of user innovations itself did not have an impact on the user ratings.
M19|A grouping genetic algorithm for the Order Batching Problem in distribution warehouses|Abstract Order picking is a warehouse function that deals with the retrieval of articles from their storage locations in order to satisfy certain customer demands. Combining several single customer orders into one (more substantial) picking order can increase the efficiency of warehouse operations. The Order Batching Problem considered in this paper deals with the question of how different customer orders should be grouped into picking orders, such that the total length of all tours through the warehouse is minimized, which are necessary to collect all requested articles. For the solution of this problem, the authors introduce a grouping genetic algorithm. It is combined with a local search procedure which results in a highly competitive hybrid algorithm. In a series of extensive numerical experiments, the algorithm is benchmarked against a genetic algorithm with a standard item-oriented encoding scheme. The results show that the new genetic algorithm based on the group-oriented encoding scheme is preferable for the Order Batching Problem, and that the algorithm provides high quality solutions in reasonable computing times.
M19|Path dependence as a barrier to business model change in manufacturing firms: insights from a multiple-case study|Abstract Business model change processes are a still underresearched phenomenon. Especially barriers to business model change and in this context path dependence of business models lack a deeper understanding. We address this issue by examining business model change processes of manufacturing firms that pursue service transition against the background of a multiple-case study. The contribution of our paper is twofold: (1) We show how business model change processes take place in detail. In doing so, we considerably enhance business model literature that employs a processual perspective on business model change. (2) Our findings allow for a new perspective on business model change as we provide empirical evidence that path dependence needs to be considered in this context. We are able to identify determinants and mechanisms that influence to which extent path dependence affects business model change processes. Hence, we enrich business model literature by applying the path dependence concept on a business model level.
M19|Business model innovativeness: designing a formative measure for business model innovation|Abstract Business model innovation is attracting increasing attention in corporate practice and academia. Despite strong interest in the phenomenon, no common understanding of the concept’s meaning has yet been established, hindering dialogue and progress in this research field. This study seeks to build a definition of business model innovation, and to provide a measurement index for the extent of innovativeness of a firm’s changed business model. Based on the business model, business model innovation and product innovation literatures, conceptualise business model innovation as a ‘new-to-the firm’ change that affects at least one out of three business model dimensions: value offering, value creation architecture and revenue model logic. Based on a study among 200 German firms, this study further offers an empirically validated measurement model for business model innovativeness comprising three dimensions and nine indicators. We also emphasise the opportunity-centric potentials of business model innovation as well as the potentials of integrating findings from related research streams into business model innovation research.
M19|Business model innovation and organizational resilience: towards an integrated conceptual framework|Abstract Management scholars have discussed business model innovation as an important response mechanism in turbulent environments. The realization of business model innovations is a highly difficult task and is necessary only in extreme cases of environmental changes. Research on organizational resilience shows that such dramatic adjustments are just one response to environmental changes from the set of appropriate possibilities. Even if previous research has, in general, acknowledged the connection between business model innovation and organizational resilience sporadically, a comprehensive framework is missing. Therefore, this study takes a first step and develops a conceptual framework in which both streams of literature are united under one theoretical roof. The findings of this study show that business model innovation is an integral part of organizational response and corresponds with adaptation as a constitutive element of resilience. This study addresses, furthermore, the question why some organizations choose a more active or passive role. To answer this question, it is necessary to include the individual level in the framework. The regulatory focus theory has proven to be a highly valuable tool, as it explains why decision-makers pursue specific responses according to their own motive structure. The regulatory focus theory is, subsequently, included in the framework and its links to organizational responses are shown.
M19|Strategy implementation through hierarchical couplings in a management control package: an explorative case study|Abstract We examine how couplings of management control (MC) elements help to implement an organization’s strategy. Despite prior research stating that couplings between MC elements form a fruitful soil for further research, empirical studies in this area are still scarce. We draw on coupling theory to explore three hierarchical relations between MC elements, and examine how these couplings help to implement the organization’s strategy. We conducted a single case study in a medium-sized Dutch municipality, using interviews, observations and desk research. We identified three different types of couplings which yielded different effects, but were all distinctively helpful in implementing particular parts of the organization’s strategy. This study contributes to the MC literature by demonstrating how coupling theory can be operationalized to examine relations between MC elements in an MC package, and by showing how various hierarchical couplings can help to implement an organization’s strategy.
M19|Innovative management control systems in knowledge work: a middle manager perspective|Abstract Integrating theorizing in sensemaking and conceptual or contextualized metaphor theory, this study investigates how middle managers in knowledge work settings support or contest the implementation of changes in management control systems (MCS) by examining how they make sense of the new control roles allocated to them. It draws on case study evidence from an organizational unit of a US multinational technology company. Results from qualitative analysis show that managers employed contextualized metaphors as collective symbols to make sense of and deal with differing views of changes in MCS and the impact on their roles, responsibilities and identity at work. Specifically, the results indicate that individuals’ acceptance of innovative control practices varied and that by remaining unaware of managers’ dilemmas, the organization ran the risk of failing to properly implement the changes, even though the system had been deemed appropriate for knowledge work. Because of their fundamental role in the success of implementing MCS-related changes in knowledge work settings, realizing how middle manager develop an understanding and react to changes in MCS is a critical endeavor for both researchers and practitioners alike.
M19|What’s happening to our universities?| In recent decades, many universities have been moving in the direction of a more hierarchical and centralised structure, with top-down planning and reduced local autonomy for departments. Yet, the management literature over this period has stressed the numerous benefits of flatter organisational structures, decentralisation and local autonomy for sections or departments. What might explain this paradox? And why have academics remained strangely quiet about this, meekly accepting their fate? This proposition paper critically examines the dangers of centralised top-down management, increasingly bureaucratic procedures, teaching to a prescribed formula, and research driven by assessment and performance targets, illustrating these with a number of specific examples. It discusses a number of possible forces driving these worrying developments, and concludes by asking whether academics may be in danger of suffering the fate of the boiled frog.
M19|El modelo del sistema viable: una referencia estratégica para el estudio organizacional del sector cooperativo chileno<BR>[The viable system model: a strategic reference for the organizational study of the Chilean cooperative sector]|El Sector Cooperativo Chileno (SCCh) puede ser explicado como un sistema de actividad humana de alta complejidad, el cual persigue mantener una existencia autónoma, es decir, ser viable. Desde esta perspectiva, el Modelo del Sistema Viable (MSV), como referencia conceptual, presenta una oportunidad real para estudiar la organización sectorial del cooperativismo en Chile. El objetivo central del trabajo, se refiere a estudiar la viabilidad del SCCh en un contexto de organización sectorial, considerando el entramado social, legal y económico del país en la actualidad. Para ello, soportado por una metodología sistémica, se realizaron: una caracterización de la situación problema del sector -identificando algunos factores relevantes en los ámbitos de estructura de mercado, regulaciones legales, e inter cooperación-, un diagnóstico organizacional y la propuesta de un conjunto de orientaciones para su desarrollo. De lo anterior se concluye que existe una pertinencia entre las características del caso de estudio y el enfoque teórico metodológico. La metodología, toma herramientas probadas en otras prácticas organizacionales, tal como VIPLAN, y las aplica al SCCh. Su aporte en el campo de estudio se orienta en torno a una mirada holística de la organización y la promoción de su viabilidad, generando de este modo un enfoque que entrega estrategias concretas de desarrollo sectorial, superando la aproximación de caracterización descriptiva. Así, entregamos un modelo diagnóstico del Sector Cooperativo Chileno y proponemos lineamientos que apoyen su desarrollo organizacional.
M19|La transparencia organizativa y económica en la Web de las fundaciones: un estudio empírico para España<BR>[Organizational and financial transparency in the website of the foundations: an empirical study for Spain]|A través de los estudios realizados durante las últimas décadas ha quedado demostrado que la transparencia en el sector no lucrativo en general y en las fundaciones en particular, es un elemento clave para la mejora de la confianza de los agentes interesados en la organización. Dicha transparencia puede ser considerada desde diferentes ámbitos y conseguida a través de distintos canales o medios. Este trabajo se centra en el análisis de la transparencia organizativa y económica de las fundaciones, que es mostrada a través de la información que voluntariamente ofrecen estas entidades en sus páginas Web. Antes de pasar a exponer el trabajo empírico, se realiza una revisión teórica de algunos de los estudios publicados sobre el concepto de transparencia y la importancia en el ámbito no lucrativo. Este marco teórico se ha centrado en la rendición de cuentas que realizan, relacionada con su función social y su gestión, desde la perspectiva de la transparencia informativa a través de la Web. Bajo este enfoque se ha diseñado un índice de transparencia que se refiere a la información que las fundaciones ofrecen en sus Webs de forma voluntaria. El índice ha sido elaborado ad hoc y se ha aplicado a un grupo de grandes fundaciones empresariales, obteniéndose datos de carácter descriptivo e inferencial, por cuanto se determina, mediante un análisis de regresión lineal múltiple, si hay correlación estadística entre la transparencia económica y la transparencia organizativa obtenida a través de la información publicada on line y cuantificada en las variables resultantes del índice. A la luz del análisis se obtienen conclusiones acerca del nivel de transparencia que tienen las fundaciones en lo que se refiere a su información organizativa y económica y la relación explicativa entre ambos tipos.
M19|Los factores determinantes del comportamiento innovador de las cooperativas: un análisis para el caso de Castilla y León<BR>[Determining factors of the innovative behavior of cooperatives: an analysis of the case of Castilla y León]|Las cooperativas tienen una larga trayectoria histórica en la economía española y han demostrado su capacidad para competir frente a las empresas tradicionales en el mercado. Para mantener esa capacidad, además de aprovechar las ventajas competitivas vinculadas con su idiosincrasia como empresas de la economía social, deben tener en consideración que la economía está crecientemente globalizada y, cada vez más, basada en el conocimiento, en especial, el de contenido tecnológico. Consecuencia de lo anterior, la capacidad innovadora aparece con un aspecto clave para hacer frente a sus competidores. En este artículo se caracteriza el comportamiento innovador de las cooperativas en Castilla y León y se analizan los factores internos y externos que afectan a su desempeño innovador, tomando como base los datos de una encuesta realizada a 581 cooperativas de la citada comunidad autónoma. Los resultados del análisis empírico realizado, que se lleva a cabo mediante regresión logística binaria multivariante sobre distintos tipos de innovación, permiten identificar la dimensión de las organizaciones, la existencia de planificación, las actividades de I+D y el capital humano como los principales factores determinantes.
M19|La utilidad del excedente para el análisis de la información financiera en las sociedades cooperativas<BR>[Net-surplus as a useful tool to analyse financial information in co-op societies]|Este trabajo analiza una muestra de sociedades cooperativas gallegas para verificar si es posible inferir diferencias en las conductas financieras de los socios a partir de la cuantía del excedente contable. Con esta finalidad se añade al valor del excedente, el resultado de las variaciones registradas en determinadas partidas contables que incluyen otras rentas residuales. El reparto de dichas rentas revela que los socios no optan generalizadamente por la anticipación completa de las rentas residuales. Se deduce, por tanto, la existencia de empresas que escogen una estrategia de excedente positivo, diferente de la estrategia de excedente nulo planteada por la teoría financiera clásica. En la muestra seleccionada, las diferencias entre ambas estrategias son estadísticamente significativas, lo que abre la puerta, en futuros trabajos, a investigar qué factores pueden explicar la renuncia voluntaria de los socios a la percepción anticipada de todas estas rentas residuales. Tal conducta sólo se evidencia cuando se declara un resultado positivo, de ahí la utilidad del excedente contable en el análisis de la información financiera de la sociedad cooperativa.
M19|Entrepreneurship and Social Innovation in Training and Human Capital Development: the Case of the Bank Palmas|This study aimed to analyze an entrepreneurial experience, social innovation and human capital; the object of the study is the Bank Palmas, located in Fortaleza, in Ceará, Brazil. This bank was created to address the need to promote the income generation and job, making use of a corporate economic system, which allows to overcome the poverty axis located in a suburb called Conjunto Palmeiras, with a population of 30 thousand inhabitants. For this, we used the descriptive and exploratory research with fieldwork conducted in the locality of Bank Palmas. These actions serve as a benchmark for innovative practices and have meaningful participation and involvement of local inhabitants. A population sample consisted of 207 individuals, associates and employees of the Bank Palmas and was used to analyze the descriptive and inferential statistics. The data suggest that the entrepreneurship development concepts and social innovation and human capital are implemented by the Bank Palmas with relevant results in the local community. Members and employees of the Bank Palmas through these various actions felt themselves as active players in transforming their reality. Investment in human development is considered as a major source of innovation, the organizations of various sectors of the economy need to incorporate the strategic management of human capital, as recommended in the literature on this topic, which considers the human capital as the set of all the skills, knowledge and experience of employees or managers, involving also the creativity and innovation.
M19|Can a change in attitudes improve effective access to administrative data for research?|The re-use of administrative data for social research holds great potential. From a privacy perspective, administrative data present some additional challenges, including lack of consent, existence of matching databases, and the association with data breaches by administrative staff. Access to government data for research is currently undergoing a slow, small but significant transformation from the defensive strategies of the past. A key driver of this is attitudinal change; the new approach is characterised as evidence-based default-open, risk-managed, user-centred decision-making, and offers more security at lower cost with greater researcher value. Despite its apparent superiority, this approach is still a minority position. It fundamentally challenges the way decisions are made in the public sector, at an individual and institutional level, as well as making risks more explicit. The effective re-use of administrative data may then depend upon the degree to which attitudes to decision-making in the public sector can be changed.
M19|Exploration of Key Success Factors that Influence Business Performance: The Experiences of Women Micro-entrepreneurs from Mazovia Voivodeship of Poland|Women-owned businesses are one of the fastest growing categories of firms in the world, but they are greatly understudied in countries from the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) [Zapalska et al., 2005]. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between business success predictors and the performance of female-owned micro-enterprises from the Mazovia Voivodeship in Poland during the period 2011–2013, using an Internet-based survey questionnaire. The data were collected by the CAWI (computer assisted web interview) and CATI (computer assisted telephone interview) methods. Exploratory factor analysis, correlation coefficients analysis and multivariate regression models were deployed to investigate the empirical data.
M19|Considerations on Gastronomic Tourism as a Component of Sustainable Local Development|Tourism is a multi-faced activity that links the economic, social and environmental components of sustainability. Firstly, this research analyses residents’ perceptions of the impact of tourism development and examines the factors that influence the support for sustainable tourism development. Secondly, the research discusses Community Based Tourism (CBT) and its positive impact of tourism development; CBT is connected to community’s capacity to protect itself from outside threats by negotiating the quality of tourism development. Thirdly, Gastronomic Tourism development is depicted as an interaction between outside developers and local residents that ultimately builds a sustainable dialogue for growth of tourism. Usually, the partnerships established between local community residents and outside tourism developers began with initial resistance from residents and led to the following sequence of behaviour: town meetings, formal organization of residents, petitioning, public demonstration, and legal action. By examining collective action narratives in the study communities, a framework for sustainable rural tourism development is built to understand relationships between tourism impacts, sustainable development and community identity. Findings indicate that residents see tourism as a development factor. The natural, economic, and social-cultural environment as well as infrastructure, age, gender and education are factors that influence the sustainable development of tourism and gastronomic tourism.
M19|Journal Lists: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis| This study examines the use of formal rankings of journals for personnel decision purposes by agricultural economics departments with agribusiness programs. It was hypothesized that the probability of using a list of formal rankings is related to a set of characteristics of the department. This suggests lists may reduce the level of uncertainty regarding the assessment of research quality by providing explicit targets in the department but may also induce faculty members to develop institution-specific human capital, thereby reducing faculty mobility and impeding career development. Whether lists are used, how they are compiled, and the extent to which they are relied upon when making personnel decisions should be viewed in the context of developments and trends in higher education; e.g., the presence of multi-disciplinary departments and the use of clinical and other non-tenure track faculty. Further, the difficulty of revising lists once they have been agreed upon should also be considered, especially when journal quality declines or where changes in personnel evaluations and in bylaws and similar documents are lengthy and arduous processes.
M19|The Impact of Project Manager on Project Success – The Case of ICT Sector|The project management literature on project success is rich. Numerous papers focus on the evolution of the understanding of project success, identification of success criteria and critical success factors. Critical success factors increase the potential for achieving project success, while project success can be evaluated with the help of success criteria. Although the interrelationships between critical success factors and success criteria are rarely analyzed, yet there is a strong demand for it. The aim of this paper is twofold. One of the aims is to identify the impact of one of the critical success factors, the project manager’s project management attitude on project success. The other aim is to highlight the interrelationship between the project manager’s personal characteristics and project management attitude and leadership style, which are three critical success factors. These aim to address the shortcoming mentioned above, which is considering the lack of the interrelationships between critical success factors and success criteria. The research outcomes are drawn from qualitative field research at the Hungarian subsidiaries of multinational companies operating in the ICT sector.

M19|European Integration and Australian Manufacturing Industry: The Case of Philips Electronics, 1960s–1970s|The creation of the Common Market in the European Community required electronics multinational Philips to integrate production operations across European countries. This effort had consequences for its Australian subsidiary. Rather than become a regional Philips hub with the support of its parent, as intended in the 1960s, it was absorbed by addressing changes in Australian trade policy and increased Japanese imports. The parent company’s establishment of regional supply centres in Europe and Asia left no role for the small Australian production facilities in the company’s global structure. Production and employment at Philips Australia were scaled back drastically during the 1970s.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
M19|Managing Political Imperatives: Strategic Responses of Philips in Australia, 1939-1945|The Australian subsidiary of Dutch MNE Philips came under secret service surveillance and faced risk of government takeover as enemy property during World War II. It was also excluded from government contracts for communications equipment, while forced to reduce civilian production. These threats to its assets and operations required the firm to develop an adaptive corporate strategy in order to minimise political risk and also take advantage of opportunities that war production offered. This case study offers a rich insight into the processes an MNE employs to pursue dynamic strategic responses to host country political imperatives, confirming hypotheses of Ring et al. (1990). It demonstrates the relevance of historical cases to substantiating theory in strategic management.
M19|Procurement and Operations Management in the Logistics Systems of Manufacturing Companies in Bulgaria|The management of inbound and internal material flows has an effect on the performance of manufacturing companies‘ logistics systems and consequently on customer satisfaction and competitiveness. The study reveals the characteristics and weaknesses of procurement and operations management in manufacturing companies in Bulgaria and outlines the prospects for their improvement. An analysis is carried out of different dimensions of these areas using indicators calculated on the basis of empirical data. The impact of company size on procurement and operations practices is examined and those practices that are positively related to competitiveness are brought out. The study finds out that manufacturing companies in Bulgaria generally follow the world trends in the management of inbound and internal material flows but there are some problem areas that need to be improved. More competitive are those companies that reflect the real demand in procurement and operations strategies and policies and realize the strategic role of suppliers. Small companies, and to a lesser extent middle ones, lag behind in the application of contemporary strategies, policies and methods in the areas of procurement and operations. It is necessary for them to make improvements, for which they need a high degree of knowledge about the existing and applied by leading companies methods and achievements in the area of logistics, and to increase the competence of employees in procurement and operations.
M19|Evaluation of distribution and customer service in the logistics systems of manufacturing companies in Bulgaria|The article reveals the characteristics and problems of distribution and customer service in manufacturing companies in Bulgaria and outlines the prospects for their improvement. An analysis is carried out of different dimensions of these areas using indicators calculated on the basis of empirical data. The impact of company size on distribution and customer service is examined and those practices that are positively related to competitiveness are brought out. The study finds out that manufacturing companies in Bulgaria generally apply the world practices in distribution and customer service but there is some lag in definite areas. It is necessary for small and medium companies to make improvements directed towards the development of a logistics strategy consistent with products and markets, the formulation and implementation of a distribution policy offering differentiated service for different groups of customers with the aim to optimize costs.

M19|L’émergence d’une stratégie d’innovation pérenne en très petite entreprise (TPE) : retour sur expérience d’une petite cave coopérative vinicole|Meticulous examination of how strategies are developed in Very Small Businesses makes it possible to understand the principle of ?innovation?. Its centralized manner of operating effectively obliges us to take into account the thoughts, visions and role of the entrepreneur in each phase of its construction. In the last three decades the business environment has been unstable, requiring considerable managerial flexibility just to survive. Although the strategic path seems to follow a predefined plan, how it is achieved is surprising because of the importance given to initiatives and acts of learning. In these circumstances, is it possible for innovation to be sustainable? The answer depends on the project envisaged by the director and his motivation to bring dynamism to the virtuous framework in which it is achieved. JEL Codes: M190
M19|The Financial Impact of a Withdrawn ISO 9001 Certificate|Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to assess to what extent the loss of the ISO 9001 certification affects the decertified firms’ financial performance. Design/methodology/approach – Using standard event-study methods, this paper matches a sample of 143 Portuguese companies that lost their ISO 9001 certification with similar non-event counterpart firms (according to return-on-assets and size) and compares the performance of these two groups of firms using financial data collected from the AMADEUS database. Findings – Results show no statistical significant differences in the financial performance (as measured by return-on-assets, return-on-sales, and sales growth) between companies that lost their ISO 9001 certification and their matched firms. Although the literature suggests that certification improves firms’ performance and that the benefits of certification may last over long periods of time, this paper’s results suggest that, after decertification, companies do not exhibit over or underperformance in their operations vis-à-vis comparable firms that do not undergo the same event. Originality/value – As far as the authors are aware, this is the first study assessing the impact of ISO 9001 certificate withdrawal on the decertified firms’ financial performance.

M19|"The changing composition of the supervisory boards of the eight largest banks and insurers during 2008-2014 and the impact of the ""4+4 suitability screenings"""|"In this article we describe the changes in the composition of management boards and supervisory boards that have taken place in the Dutch financial sector since 2008. In particular, we consider the effects of the introduction of suitability screening for executive directors and supervisory directors at the four largest banks and the four largest insurers in the Netherlands (the ""4+4 screenings""). In the summer of 2012, the supervisory directors of these eight institutions were the first group to undergo suitability screening, enabling the impact of screening on the composition of the board to be examined in isolation. This article demonstrates that the composition of the management boards and supervisory boards of these Dutch financial institutions has changed substantially since 2008. Notable findings are the fall in the average size of the supervisory boards from 9.3 to 7.3 supervisory directors, the increase in the percentage of female supervisory directors to 27.6%, and the recovery in the number of foreign supervisory directors, which showed a constant decline after 2008, started to rise again in 2012 and reached 19% in 2014. There has been hardly any change in the average age of executive directors and supervisory directors, the average term of office or the size of the management board."
M19|Delimitation, Description And Success Factors Of Family Businesses In Spain. A European Comparison|The aim of this paper is to delimit the concept of family business and based on it to provide a profile of large and medium-sized family businesses in Spain. We will analyze their distinctive characteristics by comparing them to non-family businesses and focus on the study of a series of economic-financial variables in order to identify their key success factors as compared to non-family businesses of the same sizes and in the same geographical areas. The paper also includes a comparative study of Spanish and European family businesses.
M19|Differences between Bulgarian Family and Non-family Businesses: A Multivariate Logit Approach|There is a lack of understanding about differences between family and non-family businesses operating in the transition economies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) because the available research has focused mainly on other contexts. The present research explores differences between family and non-family firms in a sample from a CEE country. The proposed hypotheses are guided by previous theoretical and comparative empirical research on family business. In response to the methodological concerns expressed in the literature about the methodological appropriateness of some comparative studies of family and non-family businesses, this study utilizes multivariate logit regression that controls for the effects of a number of contextual variables. This approach allows for detecting real rather than sample differences between the studied family and non-family businesses. The empirical findings demonstrate the presence of both similarities and differences between the studied family and non-family businesses. The paper provides recommendations for future research.
M19|Impact of Human Resource Management Practices on Organizational Citizenship Behavior: An Empirical Investigation from Banking Sector of Sudan|The study is specifically aimed to explore individual and joint effect of human resource management (HRM) practices on organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) among Sudanese banking staff questionnaires were distributed to 298 respondents to three banks called Sudanese French Bank, Saudi Sudanese Bank and National Bank of Abu Dhabi. Pearson correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationship between various HRM practices and OCB while multiple regression analysis was used to find out the joint effect of various HRM practices against OCB. It was found that all HRM practices used in this study have positive effects on OCB. Some practices have a weaker effect in comparison to other practices against OCB whereas some practices show a strong correlation with OCB. Overall, the results of this research have been discussed and the recommendations for organizations have been suggested at the end of the study.

Bununla birlikte, üst kademe teorisinin dayandýðý bu iki özellik grubunun birlikte incelenmesi ve aralarýndaki kuramsal iliþkinin kapsamlý olarak düþünülmesi teorinin daha iyi anlaþýlmasý açýsýndan kaçýnýlmaz görünmektedir.
M19|Ethnicity, politics and firm performance: Evidence from Malaysia|Motivated by the inconclusive evidence on the role of ethnic diversity of directors and the limited research, this study examines whether there is an association between board ethnic diversity in Malaysian firms and firm performance. We find that the association between ethnic diversity of boards and firm performance is non-linear; at low levels of ethnic diversity there is a positive association but at higher levels of ethnic diversity, the association is negative. However, when we split the sample into politically and non-politically connected firms, we find that this association only holds for non-politically firms. Further, when we split our politically connected sample into Malay and non-Malay dominant boards, we find generally, that in both groups of firms, board ethnic diversity does not influence firm performance. Overall, these results suggest that the presence of political connection could undermine the role of ethnic diversity in influencing firm performance.
M19|Family Business in the Czech Republic|The modern history of private entrepreneurship as well as family businesses in the Czech Republic began a quarter of a century ago, which, compared to traditional democracies, is a relatively short period of time. During this period, companies underwent turbulent changes, and although the perception of entrepreneurship has not changed much since the 1990s, and entrepreneurship is still not held in much esteem by society, the image of family firms and their actual sophistication is much more positive. The purpose of the research was to map out the current situation of small and medium-sized family businesses in the Czech Republic, the perception of barriers for the business and the perception of positives associated with the typical features of a family business. This paper also offers a structured basic identification of the pros and cons of family business in the environment of young democracy perceived especially by the family businesses themselves. It is based on the quantitative survey conducted among 505 respondents â€“ family businesses in the segment of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). This research has filled the gap in knowledge about the topical priorities of SME family business; it is these top priorities, which provide the most valid signals about the current condition of this part of the national economy.
M19|Importance of Strategic Management in Business|Today, we see a busy and fast period of change in all area of our life. This process consistently changes especially the management domain and forces business managers to be ready to change at any moment. Change has become so fast all around the world and it has turned into a multidimensional concept. The period of change in which we live in an interactive and fast way in political, social, cultural and economic areas brings up different processes such as quick start, quick decision making, bringing more dynamics and flexibility structure to management. In this context, the main idea of our study is based on that businesses should manage the process of change by using strategies. Businesses which understand clearly what strategy is and design their future plans based on those strategies are going to be more successful than their competitors in the environments seen fierce competition and fast change. In our study formed around this basic thesis, first we will make a conceptual analysis related to strategies, then refer to the importance of strategic management and we will examine strategic management contributions to businesses and finally, we will mention the importance of connection between strategy and culture of an organization to be enable more success in the strategic management process.
M19|The Future of Service Learning in International Education|Objective – This paper explores the complex dynamics of teaching service learning to EFL learners at a Chinese university through the eyes of two international instructors from an American partner school. By reflecting on different cultures’ views on charity and assistance through tools like the World Giving Index, educators can gain a deeper understanding of the implications of international perspectives on service work. Tailoring pedagogical approaches to local conditions can better fulfill service education’s function of producing future leaders who make cooperation and altruism a larger priority. Methodology/Technique – The paper examines previous studies and reports. Findings – The finding shows that perception of Western-style educational charities remains low as insisting on this can be met with a lack of enthusiasm and even hostility. But from international perspective, increasing number of students are likely to spend some of their educational experience abroad. Novelty – Providing previous context and world statistics, it gives reason on initiating service learning and its contribution on solving global, humanitarian and environmental issues.

M19|High-Impact Practices: An Analysis Of Select University And Business School Programs|Colleges and universities are finding new ways to enhance the academic environment with high-impact programs such as student-based research, internships and international study abroad programs. Research has shown that students learn most when they are more engaged in the experience rather than passive participants. This exploratory study examines high-impact opportunities for undergraduate university students in the U.S. Web sites and other materials from 90 randomly selected AACSB and ACBSP member schools were reviewed to determine how each incorporates high-impact educational practices into their overall university programs and in their business school programs. Three high-impact programs were examined: undergraduate research, internships and global learning opportunities. Recommendations for future high-impact educational practices are discussed. High Impact (HI) programs are prevalent in U.S. colleges and universities. There is a significant positive relationship between high-impact activities and graduation rates. Institutions that have healthier high impact practices have better graduation rates. Larger schools and schools with AACSB accreditation also have stronger high impact practices devoted specifically to business schools. Doctoral granting institutions scored higher in all three practices analyzed in this study. Undergraduate research is the area in which high-impact ratings were the lowest

The aim is to analyze the effect of the strategic orientation innovativeness, competitive aggressiveness and proactiveness on performance and the influence of human capital on such effect. To accomplish that objective, data from 80 craft businesses are analyzed firstly with Pearson bivariate correlation and then, in order to test the influence of human capital on the strategic orientation-performance relationship, partial correlation analysis is performed. The results indicate the positive effect of innovativeness and proactiveness on performance, competitive aggressiveness has no effect. Human capital measured as abilities positively modifies the effect of innovativeness on performance by increasing the perception of satisfaction with business results.
M19|The Smes And Their Digital Preparation: Guanajuato (Mexico) Study Case, Las Pymes Y La Preparacion Digital: El Caso De Guanajuato, Mexico|Guanajuato state is encountering the challenge of having among the best economic growth among the Mexican Republic States in the past three years. The state government predicts sustainable growth within the next years and that during this administration period 2012-2018, MSMEs will be consolidated. It is for this reason that MSMEs will require a set of tools such as the ICTs to accomplish their target growth and brand positioning. We establish wo goals for this paper. The first is to determine if the level of Digital Preparation DP at the SMEs is influenced by internal indicators POER and external indicators PEER. The second is to determine if SMEs from Guanajuato State are digitally prepared to encounter changes imposed by a globalized economy. All of this is done using a methodology of descriptive, correlational and linear regression type over a random and stratified sample of 677 economic units of the most representative cities in the state. The results indicate that both POER and PEER influence the Digital Preparation of companies. Unfortunately, SMEs are still on a initialization phase. This means that for the Stateâ€™s Government to fulfill their expectations, they must meet challenges. They face the challenge that SMEs achieve sufficient grade of consolidation on their DP so they can meet any changes imposed by the worldâ€™s globalized economy.
M19|Generational Transition Under The Perception Of The Leader And Successors Of Family Businesses, Transicion Generacional Bajo La Percepcion Del Lider Y Los Sucesores De Empresas Familiares|To achieve generational transition, studies suggest the necessity of adequate long term planning. However, few businesses decide to design, implement and evaluate strategies that improve their development and business permanence. Several factors, such as the leaderÂ´s personality, power structure, business experience and the construction of their own business culture converge to determine the way that family businesses manage and project their future. This investigation is non experimental descriptive, transectional and the instrument used in the work field to obtain data was an interview. The studyÂ´s main objective is to identify strategic plans formulated by the businesses and the perception of likely successors regarding generational transition, the factors that affect it and the strategies implemented by family businesses to achieve it. The results indicate that the variables under study respond to the founding associateÂ´s perception regarding to the use of administrative tools and that successors know that an adequate generational transition is part of the continuity and evolution of business life
M19|Sistemas De Gestión De La Calidad: Un Estudio En Empresas Del Sur De España Y Norte De Marruecos / Quality Management Systems: A Study In Companies Of Southern Spain And Northern Morocco|En el trabajo se analizan los niveles de implantación de sistemas de gestión de la calidad (SGC) en empresas del sur de Espa˜na y norte de Marruecos, y las motivaciones, beneficios o barreras detectadas. Se ha tomado para ello una muestra de 322 empresas. A diferencia de otros estudios, principalmente orientados a conocer la percepción de las empresas ya certificadas, se ha pretendido además conocer la percepción de las empresas que no disponen de SGC frente al reto de su implantación. Los resultados de este trabajo ponen de relieve la existencia de diferencias entre ambas regiones, como en los niveles de certificación de la calidad, pero también las similitudes, como la consideración de los costes y la falta de tiempo como principales barreras para la implantación, o la mejor estandarización de los procedimientos de trabajo y la calidad de los productos y servicios como principales beneficios. / This paper analyze the levels of quality management systems (QMS) implementation in companies from southern Spain and northern Morocco, as well as motivations, benefits or barriers identified. It has been taken for a sample of 202 companies in southern Spain and 120 in northern Morocco. Unlike other studies mainly oriented to know the perception of companies with QMS certified, this one has also oriented to the perception of companies without QMS and the challenge of the implementation. The results of this study highlight the differences between the two regions, such as levels of QMS certification, but also the similarities, such as the consideration of the costs and the lack of time as major barriers to implementation, or a better processes standardization and quality of products and services as primary benefits.
M19|Información De Los Recursos Intangibles Ocultos: ¿Memorias De Sostenibilidad O Informe Anual? / Information Hidden Intangible Resources: Sustainability Or Annual Reports?|Los recursos de naturaleza intangible se han convertido en los principales generadores de valor de manera sostenible en las empresas. En concreto, aquellos que permanecen ocultos en los balances debido a las dificultades que plantea su reconocimiento y medición (es decir, lo que se denomina capital intelectual). Si bien, el suministro por parte de las empresas de información voluntaria sobre estos recursos puede ayudar a reducir las posibles asimetrías de información y mejorar la transparencia informativa entre sus grupos de interés (stakeholders). En este sentido, los informes anuales son los principales medios de divulgación que tienen las empresas para suministrar información voluntaria. Sin embargo, en los últimos años, las memorias de sostenibilidad se han convertido en la principal vía de comunicación como mecanismo para legitimar las actuaciones de las empresas ante sus stakeholders. Así, nuestro objetivo es explorar y analizar el medio de comunicación que están empleando las empresas para suministrar información voluntaria sobre sus recursos intangibles ocultos. Los resultados obtenidos permiten concluir que se ha producido un cambio en la política de información empresarial y las memorias de sostenibilidad se han convertido en el principal soporte para suministrar información voluntaria a los stakeholders, además de ser un buen medio para suministrar información de los recursos intangibles. / Intangible assets have become the main sustainable value creation of companies. Specifically,those assets which remain hidden in the accounting statement due to the difficulties in identification and measuring (ie what is called intellectual capital). Voluntary information disclosed by companies on these assets can help to reduce symmetries of information and improve information transparency among stakeholders. In this sense, annual reports are the primary tool of information disclosure that companies have for provide voluntary information. In recent years, sustainability reports have become in the main means of communication as a way to legitimize the actions of companies to their stakeholders. Thus, our aim is to explore and analyze the means of communication used by companies to provide voluntary information about their hidden intangible assets. Results obtained indicate that there has been a change in corporate information policy and sustainability reports have become the mainstay to provide information voluntarily to stakeholders as well as being a good way to provide information of intangible resources
M19|Does Online Group Buying Benefit or Destroy Retail Businesses?|There is Before adopting a group buying strategy, retailers need to recognize the role of group buying and whether this strategy is beneficial or detrimental. Our data are a product of surveys from over 200 customers. The results revealed that group buying agent is beneficial to retailers. They supported our hypotheses that group buying is an effective promotion tool for retailers in expanding their customer base. Our research also showed that customer satisfaction positively influences repeated purchases through group buying agents and future purchases with retailers at regular price.
M19|Continuous Quality Improvement Programs – Part I: Survey, Critical Analysis And Future Research Directions|In practice, the diversity of management philosophies, quality programs, and quality tools has resulted in many quality consulting firms to be established most often offering the same product under a different packaging. This continual repackaging of quality programs for marketing purposes has led to confusion and resulted in organizations often abandoning a specific quality program in favor of another, although programs could be complementary in nature. In an attempt to assist organizations in making informed decisions with respect to the choice of continuous quality improvement programs (CQIPs), we survey and critically analyze the landscape of research on CQIPs, highlight similarities and differences between the underlying quality philosophies, and discuss the limitations of the current generic designs of CQIPs; namely, Just-in-Time (JIT), Benchmarking, Kaizen, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Business Process Reengineering (BPR), and Six Sigma. Our analysis of the literature revealed that, with the exception of Six Sigma, most published design and implementation procedures of CQIPs ignore a problem definition phase, most programs ignore performance measurement and evaluation as a formal phase along with the specification of the relevant criteria according to which performance is to be assessed, most programs lack the explicit integration of auditing, monitoring, control and feedback mechanisms, most published research on quality programs tend either to ignore the explicit integration of quality tools or to refer to a very limited number of potential tools without any guidelines as to which phases they could be used at, most continuous quality improvement programs lack a theoretical grounding in management theories as well as conceptual models, and no published research formally integrates critical success factors into the design methodology of a quality program. In this paper, we attempt to address this last methodological problem by proposing a classification of critical factors of CQIPs that could be used to assist managers in designing and customizing specific programs to their specific environments. In addition, we discuss the potential benefits of hybridization of quality philosophies and programs whereby several quality philosophies, concepts, programs, and tools are coherently integrated into a hybrid CQIP for the purpose of improving quality and reducing waste. Finally, we outline some future research directions.
M19|Transformational leadership and employee engagement in the banking sector in Bangladesh|Transformational leadership is needed today to facilitate employee engagement and increase productivity. This quantitative study aimed to determine the connection concerning transformational leadership and engagement among personnel in the banking sector in Bangladesh. The study involved the financial sector of Bangladesh. The financial sector of Bangladesh is small and underdeveloped. The banking sector, which is included in the financial sector, is emergent but still underdeveloped compared to international standards. The banking sector of Bangladesh has improved compared to the 1990s. Bangladesh banks’ leadership or supervisory system is one of the reasons for its ineffectiveness, because employee well-being is not considered a priority in Bangladesh. However, effective leadership and engaged employees are important in any organization. Since the banking sector of Bangladesh is still underdeveloped and inefficient, the study investigated whether employee engagement would help develop the banking sector. Because transformational leadership facilitates employee engagement the specific problem this study examined was the connection between a transformational leadership style and employee engagement in the branch-banking sector in Bangladesh. This quantitative study examined the connection between transformational leadership and engagement among personnel in the branch-banking sector in Bangladesh. The independent variable was transformational leadership, which relates to the capability of the leader to provide an environment that engages their employees. The dependent variable was work engagement, which pertains to the level of commitment among employees in the organization. The main research question examined the correlation between the study variables among employees in the branch-banking sector in Bangladesh. The outcomes of this study revealed that in a work environment, applying transformational leadership style does not assure that the employees will be fully engaged. However, the results of the current study are not aligned with the existing body of literature on transformational leadership and employee engagement that state there is alignment between these variables.

M19|Survival probabilities of low value added microenterprises|This paper analyzes the possibility of survival of low value added microenterprises of Baja California. Using a logit probability model, it was explored various scenarios associated with the possibility that microenterprises exceed the first three years of activity in the market. This is because the theory of entrepreneurship highlight that during those early years, firms are more likely to disappear. The results indicate that microenterprises are more likely to persist in activity when microentrepreneurs have levels of basic education, are married and the microenterprise generates 50% or more of household income. Highlight the effect of schooling level of microentrepreneurs in the possibility of survival of the enterprises, microentrepreneurs who have the highest education level are those with the least probability of lasting in the business. The low value added microenterprises also are related to entrepreneurship by necessity. So, the findings highlight the importance of strengthening microenter rises originated in adverse contexts.
M19|Culture and affective commitment: do they influence the internal knowledege transfer?|In the new economy knowledge is recognized as a strategic asset and its transfer stands out as a relevant activity. Therefore, in this research effort we examine the influence of organizational culture and affective commitment on the internal transfer of knowledge; also, we analyze if organizational culture affects the affective commitment. For that, we conducted a cross-sectional survey in a nonrandom sample of 342 subjects working in the industrial sector located in the northern border of Mexico. A statistical analysis was performed using a structural equation model. The results confirm that organizational culture impacts positively and significantly over the internal transfer of knowledge and over the affective commitment. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that affective commitment has no effect on the internal transfer of knowledge.
M19|Collaboration between Logistics Service Providers and the Bulgarian Manufacturing and Trade Enterprises|In strategy realisation manufacturing and trade enterprises perform a complex mix of activities, including logistics. They can de­cide whether to do them independently or to outsource to specialised organisations. This practice is common for the logistics and these organisations are called logistics service provid­ers. They perform different solutions for man­agement of the material flows across the supply chain – usually transport and warehousing ser­vices. This partnership is extremely important because the negative impact of the inadequate realisation is on the company that outsource and for the whole supply chain. That is why the abilities of the logistics service providers determinate overall performance of the supply chain. In the article are encompassed the main aspects of the interaction between logistics ser­vice providers and Bulgarian manufacturing and trade enterprises. By conducting a survey the main characteristics of this collaboration are re­vealed. The results show that the logistics ser­vice providers have high level of orientation and they are flexible to the needs of their customers and variety of technological facilities exist for achieving active partnership, unfortunately all of this in not fully used
M19|Competitive pressure and technological degree of the product portfolio: Implications for firm performance|This paper seeks to illuminate empirically a class of drivers of firm performance hitherto neglected in the economic literature. To accomplish this objective, we distinguished three elements: sales volume, participation in technology alliancing, and successful patent issuing. Our findings suggest that competitive pressure posed by larger rivals in an industry affects sales performance negatively, but the possession of absorptive capacity can counter this deleterious effect. Findings regarding the effects caused by a product portfolio with high technological content are mixed. Depending on the performance measure applied, the results show evidence of adverse outcomes for sales, U-shaped effects for participation in technology alliancing and inverted U-shaped results for patenting. We obtained our raw data from the 2006 and 2008 PITEC database, which is the Spanish equivalent of the EU Community Innovation Survey. Our sample embraces more than 3000 firms.
M19|Taxes And Entrepreneurship In Oecd Countries|" type=""main"" xml:id=""coep12079-abs-0001""> I examine how taxes and tax progressivity affect two different types of entrepreneurship—established business ownership and nascent entrepreneurship—in a large group of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, using 2000–2009 macro-level Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data. Empirical evidence from Arellano-Bond generalized method of moments estimation suggests that higher tax progressivity exerts a negative influence on nascent enterprises but appears to have no impact on established business ownership. Changes in marginal and average tax rates are found to have no significant influence on either type of entrepreneurship. The most important contribution of the article is the comparison of tax impacts on actual and nascent entrepreneurship rates. (JEL H24, H29, M13, M19)"
M19|Perspectives Of The Romanian Market In Retail Context Of Europe 2020|"The Romanian market retail has registered the biggest increases in the region in the last 15 years, being provided that this trend will continue until an 2020. Trade structure in Romania has changed considerably overtime, passing from a trade mainly traditional at modern forms of trade, the proportion of which being approximately equal at the end of the year2010. Romanian retail is characterized in present by an accelerated development, a fact that leads to an increase of the competitive quality level, the crystallization of modern forms of trade, network consolidation of modern retail and last but not least, achieving an attractive rate of profitability. Starting from the prerequisite that the Romanian market retail is influenced by factors such as increasing geographical extent of retail trade in its modern forms, developing their own brands, improvement of the strategies and operational models, but also a ceaseless strengthening of the market, we have analyzed the main directions of the retail market development in Romania according the request of the European Union project “EUROPE 2020 A European strategy for smart growth, sustainable and favorable to inclusion""."
M19|Interactions Of Intercultural Competence And Internationalization On The Example Of Small And Medium Enterprises: An Expert Evaluation (Vzťah Interkultúrnej Kompetencie A Internacionalizácie Na Príklade Malých A Stredných Firiem: Expertné Hodnotenie)|Until now very little has been spoken in Central and Eastern European countries about the importance of intercultural competence in conjunction with the process of internationalization. The present article deals with the interaction of intercultural competence and internationalization on the grounds of the answers given by the experts from small and medium Lithuanian enterprises. As the research results show, there is a lack of theoretical as well as practical training in the level of intercultural communication for employees of various organizations. Human intercultural competence strongly depends on an individual who is perceived as personality. Developed intercultural competence would assist in successful processes of internationalization and save both time and finance. (Vzťahu medzi interkultúrnou kompetenciou a internacionalizáciou hospodárskych vzťahov sa v štátoch strednej a východnej Európy doposiaľ nevenovala dostatočná pozornosť. Predkladaný článok si kladie za cieľ vyplniť túto medzeru v literatúre a preskúmať uvedený vzťah na základe odpovedí expertov z litovských malých a stredných podnikov. Výsledky výskumu ukazujú, že v podnikoch vo všeobecnosti existuje nedostatok teoretických aj praktických tréningov interkultúrnych zručností. Interkultúrna kompetencia v ľudskej komunikácii pritom silno závisí od osobnosti jednotlivca. Jej rozvoj má potenciál zvýšiť úspech procesov internacionalizácie a ušetriť firmám tak čas ako aj finančné prostriedky.)
M19|Le rôle immatériel de la certification ISO dans le processus d’innovation|The introduction of managerial standards (or management system standards of management – MSS) within organizations represents a change which questions in regards to innovation : do MSS represent an innovation and which innovations may arise from them ? Few works studied the link between standards and innovation. Although there is a consensus on the organizational effects of the introduction of MSS, there are various approaches on the impacts in terms of innovation on product, market or processes of production. The incremental dimension of the principle of continuous improvement linked with MSS, as well as the focus on the analysis of the processes would not favor breakthrough innovations but simply the improvements of routines. Besides, the effects of MSS cannot be isolated from the technic and scientific context and from the practice of the other quality tools in organizations. It makes difficult the exact assessment of the weight of MSS in the phenomena of innovation. JEL Codes : O13, M19
M19|Participative creativity serving product design in SMEs: a case study|By means of a case study, we analyze the implementation of collective creativity in an industrial SME. Employees are invited to participate in creativity seminars in order to develop new product concepts. The case is analyzed in terms of the C-K theory. The creativity seminar allows moving away from the dominant design through the permanent creation of new concepts. Although the company seeks to innovate through the creation of new concepts, it does not try to introduce a radical change. Its aim is to ?be creative while keeping one foot in the box?. This regime allows the company to maintain a competitive advantage, whilst at the same time limiting costs, risks and delays related to the development of innovative products. JEL Codes: M11, M19
M19|Big Data In Supply Chain Management: An Exploratory Study|The objective of this paper is to set a framework for examining the conditions under which the big data can create long-term profitability through developing dynamic operations and digital supply networks in supply chain. We investigate the extent to which big data analytics has the power to change the competitive landscape of industries that could offer operational, strategic and competitive advantages. This paper is based upon a qualitative study of the convergence of predictive analytics and big data in the field of supply chain management. Our findings indicate a need for manufacturers to introduce analytics tools, real-time data, and more flexible production techniques to improve their productivity in line with the new business model. By gathering and analysing vast volumes of data, analytics tools help companies to resource allocation and capital spends more effectively based on risk assessment. Finally, implications and directions for future research are discussed.

M19|Determining Factors Of Economic, Social And Environmental Performance|Analyzing the current state of knowledge with respect to the three directions, this paper aims to identify the determining factors of economic, social and environmental performance and the manner in which the indicators reflected by these factors influence the overall performance of the organization, in order to identify the most important factors and indicators that provide a durable and sustainable growth of global performance. The emergence of the sustainable development and sustainability concepts has forced companies to reassess their approach of measuring organizational performance. If sustainable development consists of three components: economic prosperity, social equity and environmental integrity, all of which being closely correlated, the performance of a component is influencing the performances of the other two. A business can be defined as sustainable, if it manages to meet stakeholders’ needs without compromising its future ability to meet its own needs.

Para tal fin, se utiliza la metodología de estudios de eventos (o acontecimientos)a través de varios días antes y después del anuncio de una muestra de 460 adquisiciones hechas por empresas estadounidenses durante los años 2000 a 2003. Los resultados soportan parcialmente la conjetura de que el valor de la empresa aumenta en forma más pronunciada cuando los anuncios de adquisición involucran a entidades medianamente relacionadas. No obstante, solo cuando el nivel medio de relación empresarial es bajo (sin llegar a cero) la reacción del mercado de valores es más favorable.

M19|La dinámica del empresario en la sociedad. De la Escuela Austriaca a la economía social de mercado|Una de las grandes aportaciones al pensamiento económico la constituye la aportación centroeuropea, desde la Escuela Austriaca a la Escuela de Freiburgo, sobre cuyas bases se desarrolla el ordenamiento económico de una economía social de mercado. Toda esta línea de conocimiento se caracteriza, en primer lugar, por la integración de la economía en la sociedad. Esto es, se desarrolla la dimensión societaria de la economía orientada a la persona y en base al principio de competencia. Es su gran comprensión de la realidad económica y del papel de la persona a la que caracteriza en búsqueda de libertad y responsabilidad para la «acción» de la persona. Es la gran contribución a un orden de libertad en el que la figura del empresario, de la «empresalidad», es el eje del desarrollo económico, el desarrollo schumpeteriano. A lo que la Escuela de Freiburgo contribuye con el diseño del ordenamiento económico-societario que enmarca en el «sistema de valores» la acción de la persona. Este ordenamiento económico define en base a principios y reglas el desarrollo de la organización económica en la sociedad. Walter Eucken impulsa esta conceptualización del orden económico como la referencia común para la actuación de la persona. El empresario juega un papel decisivo, en su dimensión societaria, para garantizar la dinámica de una economía de mercado que «funcione bien», que haga factible su existencia y garantice la eficiencia económica, por un lado, y el equilibrio social, por el otro. Una economía social de mercado es un «sistema de valores» societarios que integra los «fines» de la economía en la sociedad: el desarrollo integral de la persona mediante el uso eficiente de los recursos escasos. Eficiencia económica y equilibrio social garantizan un orden de libertades en el que puede desarrollarse el empresario si contribuye con su competencia y con el principio de subsidiaridad a su desarrollo.
M19|The Examination Of The Relations Of Personal Resources, Task Significance, Trust In Supervisor And Person-Job Fit With Perceived Work Engagement: A Research Study In A Sample Of Employees Working In Local And Multinational Organizations|This study aims to examine the role of self-efficacy, resilience, task significance, person-job fit and trust in supervisor on work engagement. The research question is what variables have positive relationship with work engagement. In order to reach accurate results for this research, the data is collected by applying questionnaires to employees about their personal and occupational perception as well as supervisor’s attitude and trustworthiness in addition to the employees’ work engagement. In addition to these; demographic variables like gender, tenure, age, company experience, total work experience, working in a local or multinational company and education levels are also taken into consideration. The sample of the research consists of 265 employees who work in multinational companies and local firms from different sectors and continuing their master education in Marmara and Istanbul Universities. The analyses are conducted by using SPSS 20.0 program (The Statistical Package for Social Sciences). In this relationship, each of the independent variable mentioned above has positive significant relationship with each of the sub-dimensions of work engagement. The findings also suggest that all the independent variables except resilience when included in analysis together to conduct multiple regression appeared to have positive relationship with work engagement.

The study confirms the existence of a stock of knowledge among the companies in the pharmaceutical market of erectile dysfunction as well as a large absorptive capacity among all of them.
M19|Risk Assessment In Tourism Enterprises|Until now, in our research we have found and we have worked with clearer significance of specific terminology, we would like to clarify our opinion about what risk is, what risk management is, what risk administration is, what is risk pilotage, what are the differences between risks and risk management in industry and risks and risk management in tourism enterprises, what are the specific risks for tourism enterprises and what are the differences between risk management and crises management. In this paper we want to present our methodology of risk assessment in tourism enterprises because we have found many methods for risk assessment but, in our opinion, these are not fit for tourism enterprises, and also they are based on results, not on perception. We want to ground this method on specific risk for tourism enterprises and on perception of these risks at top management level, before that risk are materialized. The first part of this methodology is based on a research from some centerpieces from Romania but we made it specific for tourism, and the second part is based on perception of risk variable. This methodology helps us to identify and hierarchy the main specific risks in tourism enterprises from Romania and to quantify these risks. In order to realize that, we want to disseminate the questionnaire at top management. With this questionnaire we want to identify the respondents by some characteristics, to identify the level of risk management in this enterprises, to assess risk at the level of sample and measure the perception of risks. By the results gathered - questioning top management from Romanian tourism enterprises - we hope to validate our methodology for risk assessment because we would like to help the increase of our tourism, being an important field for our country.
M19|Defining the links between retail price strategies and price tactics|Retailers’ tend to become trapped in a price-promotion war where price issues are dealt with on a short-term basis, indicating almost solely tactical choices. Since price is the only part of the marketing mix providing direct revenues to the organisation, it should also be of strategic importance for the retailer. Not only in practice are price tactics often separated from pricing strategies, it is also the case in research where these are often studied in isolation from each other probably due to their individual complexity. This paper contributes to both the research area and practice by discussing these two complex areas together, and the essence of both strategy and tactics are defined. By considering the planning horizon for the retailer this paper further contributes by defining the links between price strategy and price tactic. The conclusion shows the importance of clearly establishing which analytical level is being analysed.

M19|Reverse Logistics Practies in Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Industry: Experiences from Ghana|This paper examines reverse logistics practices in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in Ghana. The sample were selected on hierarchical levels using stratified sampling methods. With a 100% response rate, data gathered from both primary and secondary sources were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative techniques. The research revealed a gap in the flow of reverse logistic activities; from drug returns to its disposal. Most returns were from wholesalers with the end consumer playing little or no role. Drugs were frequently disposed of by burning in open containers or through open uncontrolled nonengineering dumps. However such practices are recommended as a last resort in the extant literature. We recommend adoption of an enterprise system such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) for drugs reverse logistics activities and implementation of an efficient method for drug disposal by pharmaceutical manufacturing companies in Ghana.
M19|How To Identify Disruptive New Businesses|In almost any industry, the most dramatic stories of growth and success were launched from a platform of disruptive innovation (Christensen et al., 2002). The probability of creating a successful, new growth business is 10 times greater if the innovators pursue a disruptive strategy rather than a sustaining one. Genuinely disruptive innovations are the ones that result in the creation of entirely new markets and business models. Few companies have introduced these innovations. Disruptive innovations appeal to customers who are unattractive to the incumbent companies. According to Christensen (2012) companies that want to create new growth businesses should seek disruptive opportunities because industry leaders will not be motivated to pursue them. The successful disruptive innovators always target customers who welcome simple products and affordable. The disruptive business model strategy needs to be sure that it is unattractive to every powerful incumbent. The purpose of this article is to present the concept of disruption from the perspective of a Social E- Commerce company that is the leader in group buying daily deals in Puerto Rico. In four years, Social Media Group obtained 80% of the market share of the group daily deal companies in the island. It achieved sales of $12.5 million in 2011 and $25 million in 2012. The owners are three brothers of less than 30 years old! The chief of operations is only 26 years old. This is an example of young genius entrepreneurs.
