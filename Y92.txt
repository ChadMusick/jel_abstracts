Y92|Gordon Tullock’s ill-fated appendix: “Flatland Revisited”|Abstract In an unpublished appendix to his Organization of Inquiry (“Flatland Revisited”) Gordon Tullock develops and extends ideas from both Ludwig von Mises and Karl Popper. We first discuss these commonalities and extensions, which center on the notions of necessary truth and reciprocity. Then we recover the manuscript history as well as comments from James Buchanan and provide an answer to the question of why the manuscript was never published.
