P46|Council of Economic Advisers: Biased Per Capita Consumption Comparison of the US with Europe|In October 2018, the US Council of Economic Advisers has published a study entitled the Opportunity Costs of Socialism. That study, with an obvious focus on which reform options should not be considered for the US, looks at per capita consumption levels in 2016 and compares the US with Nordic European countries. The CEA’s conjecture that the US has a 30% lead vis-à-vis most of the Nordic Countries is as misleading as the alleged 18% lead vis-à-vis Norway: If one considers not just the year 2016 in isolation but the concept of an effective lifetime per capita consumption which takes into account the value of leisure time and expected life expectancy plus the transatlantic gap in out-of-pocket health care expenditures relative to income – about 1 point higher in the US than in Western and Northern European countries – the key finding is: Nordic countries (except Norway) face an effective lifetime consumption gap of 12%, not of 30% as claimed by the CEA. Meanwhile, Norway’s effective lifetime consumption actually exceeds that of the US by 2%. While the CEA publication apparently argues that the US should not consider Europe as a point of reference for systemic reforms, the effective lifetime figures for consumption per capita and income per capita suggest just this. The EU should export its Social Market Economy, whereby Asian countries in particular would be wise to study some of the leading EU countries.
P46|Schooling Forsaken: Education and Migration|We examine the phenomenon of forsaken schooling resulting from opportunities abroad. The brain-drain/gain literature takes as its starting point the migration of educated/professional labor from poor origin countries to richer host countries. While high-skilled migration is worrisome, many international migrants accept low-skilled positions in host countries. Their willingness to do so arises from very large host-home earnings differentials. At home this can lead to reduced educational investment as people forgo schooling because of opportunities to migrate to high paying low-skilled jobs. This suggests possible time-inconsistencies between short-run economic gains from migration and negative long-term effects from missing human-capital investment. We analyze data from Tajikistan, where approximately one-third of the labor force works outside of the country. We offer an explanation of our empirical results with a theoretical model, allowing us to establish the circumstances under which this type of forsaken schooling can occur and the trade-offs that policymakers' need consider.
P46|Does Decomposition of GDP Growth Matter for the Poor? Empirical Evidence from Pakistan|This paper examines how the economic growth of different sectors affects poverty in Pakistan uses the time series data over the period 1973-2010. The ARDL co-integration approach has been applied to investigate the impact of sectoral growth on aggregate as well as disaggregated poverty in the long run and short run. The results indicate that industrial growth reduces total, rural and urban poverty significantly while the performance of services sector affects the composition of poverty insignificantly. The agricultural sector growth has a negative impact on aggregate poverty while it has an insignificant impact on disaggregated poverty.
P46|The Arab Inequality Puzzle: The Role of Income Sources in Egypt and Tunisia|Egypt and Tunisia are perceived to have high levels of inequality, yet based on standard measures, inequality in these two countries is not unusually high. In this study we explore a new dimension of inequality in Egypt and Tunisia by using a more complete measure of income and decomposing inequality by income sources (factor components). We find that higher-income households have more income sources than lower-income ones. Informal wage work and earnings from household enterprises are more common in Egypt than Tunisia, while formal wage work, pensions, and social assistance are more common in Tunisia. Social assistance does little to offset income inequality in either country. Enterprise earnings (in Egypt) and agricultural earnings (in Tunisia) as well as rent and other capital income in both countries play a large role in inequality. High inequality in these non-wage income sources may help explain why inequality is perceived to be high.
P46|The Economic Determinants of Crime: an Approach through Responsiveness Scores|Criminality has always been part of human social interactions, shaping the way peoples have constructed states and legislation. As social order became a greater concern for the public authorities, interest in investigating incentives pushing individuals towards engaging in illegal activities has become a central issue of the political agenda. Building on the existing literature, this paper proposes to focus on a few primary determinants of crime, whose e ect is in- vestigated using a Responsiveness Scores (RS) approach performed over 50 US states during the period 2000-2012. The RS approach allows us to account for unit heterogeneous response to each single determinant, thus paving the way to a more in-depth analysis of the relation between crime and its drivers. We attempt to overcome the limitations posed by standard regression methods, which assume a single coecient for all determinants, thus contributing to the literature in the field with stronger evidence on determinants' e ects and the geographical patterns of responsiveness scores.
P46|The Temporal Dynamics of Neighborhood Disadvantage in Childhood and Subsequent Problem Behavior in Adolescence|Research on neighborhood effects has increasingly focused on how long children have lived in a deprived neighborhood during childhood (duration), but has typically ignored when in childhood the exposure occurred (timing) and whether circumstances were improving or deteriorating (sequencing). Using Dutch register data, we applied sequence analysis to simultaneously capture duration, timing, and sequencing of exposure to neighborhood (dis)advantage in childhood. Compared to children who lived in a deprived neighborhood throughout childhood, we found that children who were exposed to neighborhood deprivation only during adolescence were equally likely to become a teenage parent and were more likely to drop out of school. Unexpectedly, children who lived in an affluent neighbor-hood throughout childhood were most likely to engage in delinquent behavior.
P46|Freedom from the Tyranny of Neighbourhood: Rethinking Socio-Spatial Context Effects|Theory behind neighbourhood effects suggests that different geographies and scales affect individual outcomes. We argue that neighbourhood effects research needs to break away from the tyranny of neighbourhood and consider alternative ways to measure the wider socio-spatial context of people, placing individuals at the centre of the approach. We review theoretical and empirical approaches to place and space from a multitude of disciplines and the geographical scopes of neighbourhood effects mechanisms. Ultimately, we suggest ways in which micro-geographic data can be used to operationalise socio-spatial context for neighbourhood effects, where data pragmatism should be supplanted by a theory-driven data exploration.
P46|Formulation And Evaluation Of Chronotherapeutic Pulsatle Drug Delivery System|The aim of present investigation was to develop press coated tablet for pulsatile drug delivery of Salbutamol sulphate using hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymers. The drug delivery system was designed to deliver the drug at such a time when it could be most needful to patient of rheumatoid arthritis. The press coated tablets containing Salbutamol sulphate in the inner core was formulated with an outer shell by different weight ratio of hydrophobic polymer (micronized ethyl cellulose powder) and hydrophilic polymers (Glycinemax Husk or sodium alginate). The release profile of press coated tablet exhibited a lag time followed by burst release, in which outer shell ruptured into two halves. Authors also investigated factors influencing on lag time such as particle size and viscosity of ethyl cellulose, outer coating weight and paddle rpm. The surface morphology of the tablet was examined by a scanning electron microscopy. Differential scanning calorimeter and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy study showed compatibility between Salbutamol sulphate and coating material.
P46|Decomposition of changes in the consumption of macronutrients in Vietnam between 2004 and 2014|Vietnam is undergoing a nutritional transition like many middle-income countries. This transition is characterized by an increase in per capita total calorie intake resulting from an increase in the consumption of fat and protein while the carbohydrate consumption decreases. This paper proposes to highlight the sociodemographic drivers of this transition over the period 2004–2014, using Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey data. We implement a method of decomposition of between-year differences in economic outcomes recently proposed in the literature. This method decomposes the between-year change in various indicators related to the outcome distribution (mean, median, quantiles, etc.) into (1) the effect due to between-year change in the conditional distribution of the outcome given sociodemographic characteristics, or “structure effect”, and (2) the effect due to the differences in sociodemographic characteristics across years, or “composition effect”. In turn, this last effect is decomposed into direct contributions of each sociodemographic characteristics and effects of their interactions. The composition effect, always positive, generally outweighs the structure effect when considering the between-year changes in distributions of per capita calorie intake or calorie intake coming from protein or fat. The effects of changes in the composition of the Vietnamese population thus overcome the effects of changes in preferences of the same population. This finding is reversed in the case of carbohydrates. Food expenditure and household size appear to be the main contributors to the composition effect. The positive effects of these two variables explain well most of the between-year shifts observed in the calorie intake distributions. Urbanization and level of education contribute negatively to the composition effect, with the noticeable exception of fat where the effect of urbanization is positive. But these two variables effects are negligible compared to those of food expenditure and household size.
P46|Measuring the progress of the timeliness childhood immunization compliance in Vietnam between 2006-2014: A decomposition analysis|Vietnam launched the national Expanded Program on Immunization in 1981. Since then, this program has contributed signi cantly to the improvement of child health and to the reduction of child mortality rate. Despite of the fact that the coverage of the national EPI keeps expanding, the number of children who complied with the recommended immunization schedule remains low. This article studies the progress of the timeliness childhood immunization compliance among children between 0-5 years of age in Vietnam from 2006 to 2014 and analyzes the socio-economic factors that account for the changes of the compliance rate during this period. The dataset is extracted from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey in 2006 and 2014. We rst identify the socio-economic factors that impact on the vaccination compliance rate using a logistic regression model. Next, we apply the decomposition method to determine the contribution of each factor on the evolution of the timeliness childhood immunization compliance. The progress of the timeliness childhood immunization has been positive and the major contribution comes from the structure e ect (unmeasured e ect). Rural areas show a stronger improvement as of 2014. Among the socio-economic factors, mother education and birth order are the ones that have the larger in uence on the childhood immunization compliance rate. However, these factors have di erent implications in urban and rural areas. These ndings are critical to the current context of Vietnam where the government is designing a strategy focusing on the e ectiveness rather than the traditional coverage indicator.
P46|Consumer Spending on Entertainment and the Great Recession|This paper empirically investigates the effects of economic recessions on consumers’ decision-making process for entertainment activities using the Consumer Expenditure Survey data during the Great Recession that began in December 2007. We employ the Probit model to study how changes in income influence the likelihood of making non-zero expenditures on entertainment activities. Recognizing the presence of a high degree of censoring, we also employ the Tobit model to assess the income effect on recreational activities. Income coefficient estimates are significantly positive in all years, confirming that entertainment is a normal good. However, we observe statistically significant decreases in the income coefficient during recession years in all three categories of entertainment activities from the Tobit model, while in two out of the three from the Probit model. The responsiveness of consumption to income changes decreases during recession years, which implies a sluggish adjustment in entertainment expenditures when economic distress is elevated.
P46|The Socio-Economic Determinants of Crime in South Africa: An Empirical Assessment|South Africa possess some of the highest reported crime statistics in the world, making the study of crime and its determinants of particular interest in this context. Three socio-economic factors can initially be identified as playing an important role in our understanding of the incidence of crime: Unemployment, income levels, and the prevalent level of income inequality. This research uses small area level data from the South African census to derive socio-economic variables and link this to crimes reported by the South African Police Service (SAPS). We briefly discuss the literature surrounding crime and socio-economic indicators, both internationally and in South Africa. We then turn to an overview of the other factors that can influence crime rates, before presenting the classic economic theory of crime in more detail. Finally, we discuss our conceptual approach, which draws on the literature and the economic model to determine what we can expect from the results to follow.
P46|Socio-economic Determinants of Crime: An Empirical Study of Pakistan|The objective of present study is to empirically examine the socio-economic determinants of crime in Pakistan. The analysis is carried out by using the annual time series data for the period 1973-2014. The dependent variable is total crime rate (per one million population), While the explanatory variables are unemployment, education, income inequality, per capita income, and deterrence variable. The study estimates, the long-run and short-run elasticities of supply of offense function by using autoregressive distributed lag model approach.
P46|Can Community Development Improve Health? Emerging Opportunities for Collaboration between the Health and Community Development Sectors|The two sectors of community development and health have long worked in the same neighborhoods, but they have not always worked together. This is starting to change, due in part to a growing recognition among health experts of the social, economic, and environmental factors that drive health outcomes. These social determinants of health have become the basis for new collaborations between community development and health professionals. This paper introduces professionals in both sectors to this emerging area of practice through a series of case studies of innovators in the southeastern United States. Case studies look at ways to bring housing and health professionals together, opportunities to leverage community development finance tools, and efforts to use Pay for Success to improve Medicaid spending. This discussion paper reviews early lessons on how to build a successful health and community development partnership, including an examination of the incentives for community developers, health professionals, state and local governments, and philanthropy to participate in these collaborations.
P46|The Impact of Joint Commission International Healthcare Accreditation on Infection Control Performance: A Study in Dubai Hospital|"""Objective – The United Arab Emirates (UAE) Vision 2021 aims to achieve a world-class healthcare system and the national agenda has set multiple Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to accomplish accreditation by all healthcare facilities in the country by 2021. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of Joint Commission International (JCI) accreditation on Infection Control (IC) KPIs in Dubai Hospital (DH). Methodology/Technique – A longitudinal case study covering 2007 to 2013 was conducted to examine this impact based on secondary data of the KPIs during this period and semi-structured interviews with senior health officials. Findings – The study reveals that the healthcare accreditation acts as a catalyst for implementing and monitoring changes but it also underscores some challenges. It proposes recommendations such as improving surveillance systems, ensuring proper resources allocation, and undertaking further research. Novelty – The study recommends improving the surveillance and reporting systems at the national level through frequent internal surveys."""
P46|A Policy Framework to Support Household-Based Snack Food Industry in East Sumba Regency for Poverty Alleviation|"""Objective – This research aims to develop a policy framework to support household-based snack food industry in the East Sumba regency for poverty alleviation. Methodology/Technique – A qualitative method is applied to enable exploration. A benchmarking analysis with the snack food industry in Garut, West Java, also is conducted to gain insights of the success factors and challenges faced by the industry there. Findings – Most informants say that the East Sumba regency has a high production of food crops and fruit; thus, it has potential to develop a household-based food industry to improve the local economy, i.e., a food and snacks industry based on raw materials such as maize, cassava, sweet potatoes, peanuts, and bananas. The regency also has a long coastline; therefore, coconut, fish, and seaweed-based food industries also are a potential for development in the area. Novelty – This study findings propose a policy framework for poverty alleviation through the creation of new entrepreneurs producing local snack foods. The creation of new entrepreneurs will increase employment and it should be done by the local government by implementing policies that develop the management skills of people in four functional management aspects, which must be supported by specific policies in community leadership, community culture and mindset, public–private partnerships, government support, and infrastructures."""
P46|Concept Formation Teaching Model: An Innovation in Teaching|"""Objective – In the study, a teaching model was devised named as “concept formation teaching model” and its effect on grade IX students’ academic achievement was investigated over lecture method. Methodology/Technique – Experimental group (143 students) and control group (147 students) were chosen for experiment from three Government Girls and Boys High Schools of Rawalpindi. Pretest, posttest Non-equivalent-Groups Design was selected for the study. Pre and post-test were given to experimental and control groups at the start and end of the study. Lessons plans were based on the format of direct instruction. Experimental and control groups were compared by applying t-test and analysis of covariance. Findings – The results showed that concept formation teaching model was more effective for clarification and strengthening of concepts than lecture method. Novelty – The study proves that this model is better than lecture method for strengthening Chemistry concepts. """
P46|Absolute vs Relative Income and Life Satisfaction|This paper examines whether subjective life-satisfaction is most strongly related to absolute or relative income in terms of either proximal neighbors or a wider aggregated region. The analysis utilizes two unique datasets - survey data on happiness in combination with fine-level income data for postal codes and municipalities. We find a significant relationship between happiness and both personal income and relative income position among nearby neighbors and more remote neighbors. Hence, being rich as well as being richer than others in the area increases the likelihood of being more satisfied with life. Above all, we find individuals’ level of life-satisfaction to be more strongly related to the income of people in the larger municipality than to the income of nearby neighbors.
P46|Who Benefits from Fairtrade? Evidence from the Swedish Coffee Market|This paper analyses how the premium customers pay for Fairtrade-labelled coffee is distributed in the Swedish market, using information on costs of production and scanner data on almost all roasted and ground coffee products sold by retailers. A key finding is that roasters and retailers get 43–70%, while producer countries, in this paper comprising coffee farmers, cooperatives, middlemen, exporters and Fairtrade International, get 24–51%. Fairtrade Sweden gets 5–8%. These values are upper and lower bounds that reflect assumptions made about the additional costs of producing roasted and ground Fairtrade coffee, given the cost of beans and the Fairtrade license, and whether conventional coffee is compared with organic or non-organic Fairtrade coffees. Since roasters’ and retailers’ margins are higher for Fairtrade than conventional coffee, there is evidence that Fairtrade retail prices are higher than the level attributable to costs. However, producer countries receive a significantly larger share of the premium paid than reported in earlier studies, which are either dated or analyse very small samples of coffees.
P46|Becoming an Adult in France, Estonia and Russia|The aim of this study is to compare the sociodemographic events marking the transition to adulthood in France, Estonia and Russia: first leaving parents, completion of education, first partnership, first marriage and first childbirth. We used the first waves of the Generations and Gender Survey for these three countries and an advanced method – Sequence Analysis. According to the Second Demographic Transition Theory, we expected a convergence in the sequencing, timing and tempo of the occurrence of target events. The results showed the slow convergence of sequences, but not of timing and tempo. Estonia and Russia are still close in the timing of the occurrence of events, but in tempo Estonia and France are more alike. The ages at which people start families in Estonia and Russia have decreased in younger generations in comparison with older ones, despite our expectation that they would increase. For the youngest generation (1970s), the time between leaving parents and becoming a parent is 5-7 years in France, 4-6 years in Estonia and 2-3 years in Russia. The sociodemographic behaviour of Estonians clearly positions them between Europe and Russia. Thus, the comparison of France, Estonia and Russia only partially confirms the Second Demographic Transition Theory
P46|Parents and Peers: Parental Neighbourhood- and School-Level Variation in Individual Neighbourhood Outcomes over Time|There is a link between the socio-economic outcomes of parents and their children over the life course. Intergenerational transmissions were repeatedly shown for socioeconomic characteristics and (dis)advantage, but recently also for residential neighbourhood status. Previous research from the Netherlands, Sweden, and the US shows that children from disadvantaged parental neighbourhoods experience long-term exposure to similar neighbourhoods as adults. However, there are multiple parallel socio-spatial contexts besides the residential space to which individuals are exposed on a daily basis, such as households, schools, and places of work and leisure, which may also influence their outcomes. For children and adolescents, the school environment may be especially important. This study contributes to the literature by examining the joint influence of the parental background, the parental neighbourhood, and a compositional measure of the school environment, on the neighbourhood trajectories of Dutch adolescents after leaving the parental home. We use longitudinal register data from the Netherlands to study a complete cohort of school-going home-leavers, who were followed from 1999 to 2012. We fit cross-classified multilevel models, in order to split up the variance components of schools and parental residential neighbourhoods over time. We find that poverty concentration in the parental neighbourhood plays an important role in determining their children's residential outcomes later in life. Some variation in individual neighbourhood outcomes at the level of the secondary school remains unexplained.
P46|Ethnic Differences in Duration and Timing of Exposure to Neighbourhood Disadvantage during Childhood|This paper examines ethnic differences in childhood neighborhood disadvantage among children living in the Netherlands. In contrast to more conventional approaches for assessing children's exposure to neighborhood poverty and affluence (e.g., point-in-time and cumulative measures of exposure), we apply sequence analysis to simultaneously capture the timing and duration of exposure to poor and nonpoor neighborhoods during childhood. Rich administrative microdata offered a unique opportunity to follow the entire 1999 birth cohort of the Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese, and Antillean second generation and a native Dutch comparison group from birth up until age 15 (N=24,212). Results indicate that especially Turkish and Moroccan children were more likely than native Dutch children to live in a poor neighborhood at any specific stage within childhood, but particularly throughout childhood. Although differences became substantially smaller after adjusting for parental and household characteristics, ethnic differences remained large and statistically significant. In addition, the impact of household income on children's neighborhood income trajectories was found to be weaker for ethnic minority children than for native Dutch children. Our findings are discussed in relation to theories on spatial assimilation, place stratification, and residential preferences.
P46|Educational Attainment and Neighbourhood Outcomes: Differences between Highly-Educated Natives and Non-Western Ethnic Minorities in the Netherlands|In the Netherlands, obtaining a higher education increases the chance to move to a better neighbourhood for native Dutch adults who grew up in a deprived parental neighbourhood. For non-Western minorities, education does not have this positive effect on socio-spatial mobility. In this study we investigate potential explanations for these ethnic differences in the relationship between educational attainment and neighbourhood outcomes over time. We use longitudinal register data from the Netherlands to study a complete cohort of parental home leavers who attained a higher education by the end of the measurement period (1999 to 2012). We supplemented this data with information gathered in the WoON-survey. We examined differences in income trajectories for highly-educated native Dutch and non-Western ethnic minorities; investigated the strength of intergenerational transmission of income for both groups; and assessed individual neighbourhood experiences and contentment. We find that the highly-educated native Dutch in our subpopulation have a substantially higher average income over time, and a weaker association to the income of their parents compared to the non-Western ethnic minorities. Additionally, for ethnic minorities, our results show that the level of contentment with their neighbourhood is highest in deprived neighbourhoods compared to more affluent residential environments, and they more often reside in close proximity to their parents compared to the native Dutch, both suggesting an element of choice in neighbourhood selection.
P46|Private schools and student learning achievements in Kenya|We examine the effect of private school attendance on literacy and numeracy skill acquisition among children mainly drawn from lower primary grades in Kenya. The empirical analysis is based on novel household data that involved a large-scale assessment of children in numeracy and literacy skills. We use the household fixed effects model to control for unobservables at the household level. We find substantial gains from private school attendance on both language (literacy) and math (numeracy) scores. Our results show that private school attendance is associated, on average, with an increase in maths and language scores of 0.12 and 0.13 score standard deviations, respectively.
P46|Edukacja jako dobro publiczne - próba kwantyfikacji<BR>[Education as a public good – an attempt at quantification]|The analysis involved the construction of synthetic measures of quantity and quality of public goods in education and synthetic measures of economic and social development. The synthetic measures were built using the Hellwig method. Taxonomic analyses were performed with respect to the quantity, quality and effectiveness of public goods at the local level in Poland. An attempt was made to determine the education production function in the Polish context. Analysis techniques also included multivariate analysis of variance, regression models for quality and effectiveness of education and multilevel analysis of regression.Drawing conclusions based on the methodology adopted in this study is certainly burdened with error due to the considerable level of aggregation of measures used for illustrating the existing dependencies. However, it should be noted that the analysis covered all local government units (poviats) responsible for upper-secondary school education in Poland. In the Polish political system, the units fulfil the state’s function related to the provision of public goods in education. The efforts undertaken by researchers worldwide to find the ways to improve the quality and effectiveness of educational processes have focused on modelling the education production function. The attempts made in this study to implement the education production function in the Polish context have confirmed the results of global research in this field. However, models constructed on the basis of literature data were characterised by low explanatory power, which prompted the author to search for new methods that use the findings of research on education production function in order to identify the factors shaping the quality of public goods in education and effectiveness of education. Econometric analyses have pointed to the inefficiency of the teacher remuneration system. The expenditure on teacher remuneration was negatively correlated with the measure of quality. The negative impact of teacher remuneration on the synthetic measure of quality may be indicative of the incorrect explanatory properties of the analysed econometric models.
P46|Is growth pro-poor in Benin? evidence using a multidimensional measure of poverty|In recent years, economic development discourse has moved beyond increasing economic growth to ensuring that growth also leads to reduction in poverty and inequality. This motivates the current study to examine the relationship between economic growth and poverty in Benin. We used data from the 2006 and 2011 Benin Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and computed a multidimensional poverty index using the Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA). Growth pro-poorness was then estimated using the Pro-Poor Growth Rate (PPGR) and Poverty Equivalent Growth Rate (PEGR). The distribution of growth pro-poorness was also analysed using the Growth Incidence Curves (GIC) and Non-Income Growth Incidence Curve (NIGIC). Average multidimensional poverty rate was estimated to be about 55.3%. The findings show that while growth has generally been pro-poor in Benin, there exists disparities across rural and urban households, women as well as the elderly. The findings reinforce the need for broader poverty measures and refocusing poverty reduction strategies to marginalised groups in Benin.
P46|What is the effect of inflation on consumer spending behaviour in Ghana?|The paper examines the effect of inflation on consumer spending behaviour in Ghana during the period 1964 to 2013 using annual data. The analysis of the results was done using Ordinary least square test (OLS), the Johansen test (JH), and Vector Error Correction (VECM) test. The findings of the studies based on the JH tests showed stable significant long run relationship between inflation and consumer spending behaviour. The findings of the study shows significant short run relationship between inflation and consumer spending using the VECM. The results of the OLS test show there is positive relationship between inflation and consumer spending behaviour. Policy makers should take into account the findings of the study in managing the economy. Future studies on causality and structural break are worth undertaking.
P46|Transition gap in self-rated health|Previous literature has shown substantially lower levels of self-reported health in transition countries compared to developed and developing countries. The current paper provides the most recent estimates of the size of the transition gap in self-rated health by using up to 241,698 observations from the World Values Survey (WVS) and the European Values Study (EVS) collected between 1989 and 2014. During the earlier transition period of 1989–2007 transition countries were 0.088 to 0.127 lower on a 0 to 1 scale (from ‘Very poor’ to ‘Very good’ self-rated health). The transition gap remains in place in the second period after the Asian crisis (0.069 to 0.094 lower self-rated health) and even after the Global financial crisis of 2008 (0.062 to 0.105 lower self-rated health). Judging from these estimates the process of transition is far from completion at least based on a subjective evaluation of health, which is one of the key determinants of human development. It is also plausible that poor self-perceived health may ‘justify’ abnormally high health-care utilization and an excessive (and expensive) network of physicians and hospital beds per capita still characterizing transition countries.
P46|Continuous education and training of adults – purpose of an active life on the labour market|An active life on the labour market implies, besides the existence of jobs, continuous education and training of adults. Regardless of age, every person needs new knowledge, which one can obtain either by self-teaching or by attending training courses. The development of technology and information influences lifelong learning, which is why, in recent years, greater emphasis has been put on the education and training of adults. In this respect numerous Centers of Professional Training of Adults have been established, some of them attracting their learners through the implementation of projects financed from European funds, which meant free participation of adults to various courses of specialization, training or (re)qualification. The article highlights the importance of continuous education and training of adults related to the economic and social benefits deriving from it. The article analyzes some of the aspects of continuous education and training of adults that fosters active participation of adults in the labour market, concluding that, for an active professional life, the establishment of relationships between employers, employees, trainers and learners is required.
P46|Social capital as a coping mechanism for seasonal deprivation: the case of the Monga in Bangladesh|Abstract The extreme hunger and deprivation that recurs every year in the lean season in northern Bangladesh, locally known as the Monga, is mainly due to the malfunctioning local labor and credit markets. Using data covering 5600 extreme poor households in the Monga-prone region, we investigate in detail the role of social capital in securing employment and obtaining informal loans. Correcting for the endogeneity of social capital by the heteroscedasticity-based method proposed by Klein and Vella (J Econom 154:154–164, 2010) and also by the standard IV method for a robustness check, we document that social capital plays an important role in obtaining both wage- and self-employment. We also document a weak negative effect of social capital on obtaining informal loans. We explain our results in terms of the role of horizontal and vertical components of our measures of social capital in influencing different outcomes.
P46|Using YouTube video to promote university: a content analysis|In today’s global higher education environment, international students represent not only an important source of external income for universities: the degree of cross-border student mobility also reflects the internationalization of higher education sector. Universities have engaged in efforts to sell themselves to prospective students and promotional videos are among the most widely used marketing tools for this purpose. This article reports the results of a study analyzing the content of 140 higher education promotional videos from 14 countries available on YouTube. The results reveal that while the pattern of use of YouTube for two-way communication with viewers, information contents and appeal messages among sampled universities is fairly homogenous, some marked differences emerge when cultural background and global position ranking of the university are taken into account. The implications of these findings are that, although transnational higher education has been profoundly globalized, culture still plays a significant role in marketing practice for the recruitment of mobile students. In addition, different universities have various student-targeted segments. These findings provide the basis of a series of recommendations for universities looking to optimize their use of YouTube and promotional video design to market to international students.

In altre parole: i mercati tradizionali stanno effettivamente rimodellando i loro processi produttivi e assetti di governance per rispondere a esigenze, in senso lato �sociali�, dei propri pubblici di riferimento? E quale ruolo giocano in questo quadro evolutivo le organizzazioni dell�economia sociale e solidale che tradizionalmente sono riconosciute come pioniere a livello di advocacy e di innovazione di prodotto e processo?
P46|Impact of socioeconomic factors on nutritional diet in Vietnam from 2004 to 2014: new insights using compositional data analysis|This paper contributes to the analysis of the impact of socioeconomic factors, like food expenditure level and urbanization, on diet patterns in Vietnam, from 2004 to 2014. Contrary to the existing literature, we focus on the diet balance in terms of macronutrients consumption (protein, fat and carbohydrate) and we take into account the fact that the volumes of each macronutrient are not independent. In other words, we are interested in the shares of each macronutrient in the total calorie intake. We use the compositional data analysis (CODA) to describe the evolution of diet patterns over time, and to model the impact of household characteristics on the macronutrient shares vector. We compute food expenditure elasticities of macronutrient shares, and we compare them to classical elasticities for macronutrient volumes and total calorie intake. The compositional model highlights the important role of food expenditure, size of the household and dwelling region in the determination of diet choices. Our results are consistent with the rest of the literature, but they have the advantage to highlight the substitution effects between macronutrients in the context of nutrition transition.
P46|Some “unexpected proximities” between Schultz and Galbraith on human capital|This contribution highlights some unexpected proximities between Galbraith and Schultz’s thoughts on human capital. Despite apparently strong methodological divergences, both authors analyze the issue of human capital investment in the light of the dynamics of the economic development process. This issue is formulated in Galbraith’s vocabulary in terms of the requirements of the planning system, and in terms of the needs of production activities deriving from the dynamics of growth in Schultz’s. But the logic underlying their analysis is of the same order. The emphasis on the needs of production leads the two authors to address the issue of student sovereignty in making allocative decisions regarding education. By highlighting these proximities, our study shows that Schultz’s thought on human capital must not be conflated, from a methodological point of view, with Becker’s and Mincer’s. We thus question the idea that the human capital research program is characterized by strong methodological unity, in particular that it is characterized by methodological individualism. That Becker and Mincer’s works rely on methodological individualism is not called into question; the idea that Schultz’s thought is grounded on it deserves more careful examination.
P46|Back to Buchanan? Explorations of welfare and subjectivism in behavioral economics| In light of behavioral findings regarding inconsistent individual decision-making, economists have begun to re-conceptualize the notion of welfare. One prominent account is the preference purification approach (PP), which attempts to reconstruct preferences from choice data based on a normative understanding of neoclassical rationality. Using Buchanan’s notion of creative choice, this paper criticizes PP’s epistemic, ontological, and psychological assumptions. It identifies PP as a static position that assumes the satisfaction of given ‘true preferences’ as the normative standard for welfare. However, following Buchanan, choice should be understood dynamically as a process whereby preferences constantly regenerate. Accordingly, the meaning of welfare emerges from an ongoing quest for individual self-constitution. If this holds true, then rationality axioms cannot serve as a priori normative standards. Instead, creative imagination and learning processes must remain central to any understanding of welfare in economics.
P46|Understanding the Drivers of Overweight and Obesity in Developing Countries: The Case of South Africa| The beginning rise in obesity prevalence rates in South Africa was first noticed already in the early 1990s. Since then, several articles have discussed how the nutrition transition has affected people’s body weights in the country. This article is the first one that uses longitudinal data from South Africa to reveal the short- and long-term effects that socio-economic and cultural factors have on the probability of becoming obese. The concept of “benign” obesity seems to influence people’s perceptions of an ideal body shape and thus model the preference for a higher body weight. Women are more affected by increasing body weights than men. We find that time invariant characteristics and long-term effects have the largest influence on the probability of becoming obese. To address the problems of obesity, we suggest implementing programs that Change people’s attitudes and behavior regarding food intake and physical activity. If people change their perception of what kind of body weight can be considered as being healthy, then a combination of different health programs can be successful.
P46|Impact of Increasing Demand for Dairy Alternative Beverages on Dairy Farmer Welfare in the United States| Production and consumption of dairy alternative beverages in the United States has been on the rise as per capita consumption of fluid milk continues to fall. Almond milk and soymilk are the fastest growing categories in the U.S. dairy alternative marketplace. Using household-level purchase data from 2011 Nielsen Homescan panel and tobit econometric procedure, the conditional and unconditional own-price, cross-price and income elasticities for soymilk and almond milk were estimated. Income, age, employment status, education level, race, ethnicity, region and presence of children are significant drivers affecting the demand for dairy alternative beverages, such as almond milk and soy milk. We use the estimates from the tobit econometric procedure to predict how changes in demographic profiles, prices and income will likely affect demand for the aforementioned dairy and dairy alternative products, and how these changes in retail demand will affect the blend price, production and producer surplus of U.S. dairy farmers subject to the federal milk marketing order system. To model the farm-side effects we follow Balagtas and Sumner (2001) and use estimates of elasticities of supply for milk from the literature.
P46|The impacts of piped water on water quality, sanitation, hygiene and health in rural households of north-western Bangladesh - a quasi-experimental analysis| We investigated the impacts of piped water on water quality, sanitation, hygiene and health outcomes in marginalized rural households of north-western Bangladesh using a quasi-experimental analysis. A government organization – the Barindra Multipurpose Development Authority (BMDA) – established a piped water network to provide these rural households with improved water as they have poor access to potable water. Using propensity score matching, the study compares a treatment and a control group of households to identify gains in water-sanitation, hygiene and health outcomes. We found that the BMDA piped water infrastructure had a positive impact on access to improved water and significantly reduced the distance traveled for and time spent on collecting drinking water. However, we found no improvement in the drinking water quality, which was measured by the extent of fecal contamination (E. coli count per 100 ml of water) at the point of use. The hygiene status of food utensils also did not show any improvement; food utensils were tested positive for E. coli in both the control and treatment group. Although access to BMDA piped water in the premises involves cost, it didn’t improve hygiene behavior: handwashing with soap after defecation and before feeding children. The treated households own larger water containers which implies that the intervention has had a clear impact on the quantity of water used for household purposes. However, we did not find evidence of health benefits, such as decreased diarrhea incidence of in under-five children, improved child anthropometrics stunting, underweight and wasting of children due to piped water use.
P46|Etyczne i ekonomiczne aspekty państwa dobrobytu / Ethical and Economic Aspects of the Welfare State|A concept of the welfare state is based on the principles of equitable distribution of wealth and equality of opportunity. The state is responsible for the protection and promotion of the economic and social well-being of its citizens. Progressive taxation reduces the income gap between the rich and poor. However, the efforts to put principles of the welfare state into practice produced still unsatisfactory results. It was closely connected with violating the subsidiary principle and eroding the work ethics. That is just why the welfare state failed from the ethical and economic point of view.
P46|Economic shocks and crime: Evidence from the crash of Ponzi schemes|In November 2008, Colombian authorities dismantled a network of Ponzi schemes, making hundreds of thousands of investors lose tens of millions of dollars throughout the country. Using original data on the geographical incidence of the Ponzi schemes, this paper estimates the impact of their breakdown on crime. We find that the crash of Ponzi schemes differentially exacerbated crime in affected districts. Confirming the intuition of the standard economic model of crime, this effect is only present in places with relatively weak judicial and law enforcement institutions, and with little access to consumption smoothing mechanisms such as microcredit. In addition, we show that, with the exception of economically-motivated felonies such as robbery, violent crime is not affected by the negative shock.
P46|Life Satisfaction in Germany After Reunification: Additional Insights on the Pattern of Convergence|The authors update previous findings on the total East-West gap in overall life satisfaction and its trend by using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for the years 1992 to 2013. Additionally, the East-West gap and its trend are separately analyzed for men and women as well as for four birth cohorts. The results indicate that reported life satisfaction is on average significantly lower in East than in West German federal states and that part of the raw East-West gap is due to differences in household income and unemployment status. The conditional East-West gap decreased in the first years after the German reunification and remained quite stable and sizeable since the mid-nineties. The results further indicate that gender differences are small. But the East-West gap is significantly smaller and shows a trend towards convergence for younger birth cohorts.
P46|Impacts of Rural Electrification Revisited: The African Context|The investment requirements to achieve the United Nations? universal electricity access goal by 2030 are estimated at 640?billion US Dollars. The assumption underlying this goal is that electrification contributes to poverty alleviation in many regards. In recent years, a body of literature has emerged that widely confirms this positive poverty impact assumption. Most of these studies, however, are based on data from Asia and Latin America. This paper challenges the transferability of impact findings in the literature to the African context. Using a unique data set that we collected in various African countries we suggest that impact expectations on income, education, and health should be discounted considerably for Africa. In many cases, the low levels of electricity consumption can also be served by low-cost solar alternatives. To ensure cost-effective usage of public investments into rural electrification, we call for careful cost-benefit comparisons of on-grid and off-grid solutions. JEL Classification: O33, P46, Q41.

P46|Improving Public Health and Environment through Plastic Waste Management in Mumbai Metropolitan Region|The Mumbai Metropolitan Region is growing in terms of population, industry, educational and commercial units. The daily requirements of commodities and services by all units have increased fast. Plastic is used extensively for packing, protection and service of various commodities. The use of plastic is much higher by industry and households in region. In Brihan Mumbai Municipal Corporation, the density of population is higher. The concentration of small and large industries is more. Therefore the plastic use is much higher for different purposes. It leads to more waste of plastic. In Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation, the population and industrial units are less. Therefore plastic waste is less generated. Theaters are generating less plastic waste in metropolitan region. The Brihan Mumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and municipal corporations in Thane district will continuously generate more plastic waste in future. The Tobit regression model shows that plastic waste is positively co-related and statistically significant with pollution and industry in region. Therefore the comprehensive policies are required to reduce plastic waste. This is because plastic waste is affecting on the health of human being. It also affects negatively on soil, air and water. The entire food supply chain gets affected due to plastic waste. The water logging is common due to plastic waste in region. It chock ups the drainage system and it becomes the ground for mosquitoes. It further leads to dengue, malaria and other diseases in region. Municipal corporations must collect plastic in separate bins and process it. The plastic and e-waste can be utilized for road construction in region. All the policies will certainly help to reduce the plastic waste and maintain the clean environment in region.
P46|Macro-econometric modelling for the Nigerian economy: A growth-poverty gap analysis|This study develops comprehensive full-sector macro-econometric models for the Nigerian economy with the aim of explaining and providing a long-term solution for the persistent growth-poverty divergence experienced by the country. The models are applied to test the hypothesis of existing structural supply-side constraints versus demand-side constraints impeding the economic growth and development of the country. A review of the historical performance of the Nigerian economy reveals significant socio-economic constraints as the predominant impediments to high and sticky levels of poverty in the economy. Thus, a model which is suitable for policy analyses of the Nigerian economy needs to capture the long-run supply-side characteristics of the economy. A price block is incorporated to specify the price adjustment between the production or supply-side sector and real aggregate demand sector. The institutional characteristics with associated policy behaviour are incorporated through a public and monetary sector, whereas the interaction with the rest of the world is represented by a foreign sector, with specific attention being given to the oil sector. The models are estimated with time-series data from 1970 to 2006 using the Engle-Granger two-step co-integration technique, capturing both the long-run and short-run dynamic properties of the economy. The full-sector models are subjected to a series of policy scenarios to evaluate various options for government to improve the productive capacity of the economy, thereby achieving sustained accelerated growth and a reduction in poverty in the Nigerian economy.

P46|Fresh-Cut Melon - The Money Is in the Juice| Fruit is an important component of the food industry in the United States, and “fresh-cut” products are an increasing portion of that consumption. We found that packaging and juice content played a significant role in the choices Indiana consumers made when purchasing fresh-cut melon products. Brand was not as important as the other fresh-cut melon attributes. Indiana consumers had a clear dislike for cup-shaped transparent packages compared with tamper-proof, bowl, and squared packages. However, they were willing to pay a premium for packages that have no fruit juices on the bottom.
