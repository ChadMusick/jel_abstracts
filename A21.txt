A21|Measuring Economic Competence of Secondary School Students in Germany|We introduce a test of economic competence for German-speaking secondary school students and provide evidence from a large-scale assessment with 6,230 students from grades seven to ten. The article presents the development and psychometric properties of the scale, as well as an investigation of predictors of economic competence. We find evidence of a gender gap favoring male students, lower scores for students with a migration background, and parents’ socioeconomic background being a predictor of test performance. Additionally, we document sizeable differences between tracks, as well as gains in economic competence across grades in the order of magnitude of 0.06 to 0.2 standard deviations per year. The article concludes with perspectives on an impact evaluation of a curriculum reform introducing mandatory economic education in secondary school.
A21|Financial Education in Schools: A Meta-Analysis of Experimental Studies|We study the literature on school financial education programs for children and youth via a quantitative meta-analysis of 37 (quasi-) experiments. We find that financial education treatment has, on average, a significant and sizeable impact on financial knowledge (+0.25 SD), similar to educational interventions in other domains. Additionally, we document small but still significant effects on financial behaviors (+0.05 SD). These results are robust to restricting the sample to 18 randomized experiments and they hold irrespective of the meta-analytic method used. Metaregressions show the beneficial effect of more intensive treatments and smaller class size, albeit with decreasing marginal returns.
A21|Minimum Age Requirements and the Impact of School Choice|Using several data sources from Chile, we study the impact of school choice at the time of starting primary school. To study the contribution of school choice, we exploit the combination of multiple cutoffs defining the minimum age at entry, and the difference across municipalities in the composition of the schools according to these cutoffs. Children living in the same municipality, and whose birthday differs by a few days not only have their incentives to delay school entry affected, but also face, in case of not delaying, a different set of schools. We show that a larger set of schools increases the probability of starting in a better school, measured by non high-stakes examination. Moreover, this quasi-experimental variation reveals an important reduction in the likelihood of dropping out, and a reduction in the probability that a child would switch schools during her/his school life. Secondly, for a subsample of students who have completed high school, we observe that a larger school choice at the start of primary school increases students' chance of taking the national examination required for higher education and the likelihood of being enrolled in a selective college.
A21|Investigation of Business Strategies in Higher Education Service Model of Selected Private Universities in India|Many Countries in the globe have adopted private University system as a part of their higher education offering strategy. India, being second in the number of private universities in the World, has given exactly 50 % shares to privately governed Universities (Private & Deemed to be universities together) and remaining 50% are Govt. Funded universities (Central & State Govt. together). Presently in India, there are 264 private universities spread over 22 states. Due to non-availability of any financial support from the state and central governments, private universities are trying to sustain through their only strategy of service differentiation through 21st century curriculum and industry integrated programme design. In this paper, we have studied the business strategies of some of the private universities in India which include Admission Strategies, Growth strategies, Innovative strategies, Research Strategies, Collaboration Strategies, Placement Strategies, and Technology adoption strategies to add competitive values to services provided to the stakeholders The paper also suggests some recommendations based on the observations and intuition to contribute to the business strategies to improve the performance and brand image of private universities.
A21|"""The market deals out profit and losses"": Wie ökonomische Standardlehrbücher das unreflektierte Denken in Metaphern fördern"|"Das Paper analysiert den bisher kaum beachteten Gebrauch von Metaphern in ökonomischen Standardlehrbüchern am Beispiel der Lehrtexte von Paul A. Samuelson und N. Gregory Mankiw. Dabei steht die metaphorische Semantik des abstrakten Konzeptes ""des Marktes"" im Zentrum der Untersuchungen. Mittels textanalytischer Methoden und mit Rückgriff auf die Conceptual Metaphor Theory verfolgen die Autorinnen die Einführung des Konzeptes ""der Markt"" als abstraktes und weitestgehend inhaltsleeres Konzept, die (Um-)Deutungen des Konzepts mithilfe von Entitätsmetaphern, Personifizierungen und Orientierungsmetaphern und die Verbindung des Begriffes mit politisch-ideologischen Wertungen. Hauptergebnisse sind: (1) Ökonomische Standardlehrbücher weisen einen massiven und stillschweigenden Gebrauch von Metaphern auf. (2) Dieser Gebrauch kann das kognitive Unbewusste der Leser_innen beeinflussen, und (3) Reflexive ökonomische Bildung kann zu einem verantwortungsvollen Umgang mit Metaphern befähigen."
A21|Der vergessene Lippmann: Politik, Propaganda und Markt|"Das Paper gibt einen Überblick über das Leben und die Bedeutung von Walter Lippmann, der in der ersten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts einer der bedeutendsten Journalisten der USA war. Lippmann hat sich auch an Propagandaaktivitäten im Ersten Weltkrieg beteiligt und aufgrund dieser Erfahrung u.a. 1922 das Buch Public Opinion publiziert. Dieses Buch wird hier zusammenfassend beschrieben und in seiner Bedeutung eingeschätzt. Dies wird dann einem weiteren Buch von Lippmann Buch, nämlich The Good Society aus dem Jahre 1937, gegenübergestellt - das letztere Buch gab Anlass zum so genannten Walter Lippmann Colloque 1938 in Paris, das als die erste internationale Veranstaltung des Neoliberalismus gilt. Lippmanns Manipulationsideen werden verglichen mit denen, die Friedrich August von Hayek aus Anlass der Gründung der Mont Pèlerin Society , die als Nachfolgeorganisation des Walter Lippmann Colloque gilt: Lippmann hat vor Manipulation gewarnt, die Demokratie sei damit gefährdet. Demgegenüber wollte sich Hayek der Manipulation ""der Massen"" bedienen, nur so könne ""die Zivilisation"" gerettet werden."
A21|Economic competence in early secondary school: Evidence from a large-scale assessment in Germany|We employ a psychometrically validated performance test to study economic competence among a large and representative sample of early secondary school students in Southwest Germany. The rich dataset allows us to study variation in economic competence across school types and observable student characteristics. Our results show that economic competence is significantly lower among female students, migrants, students with parents of low socioeconomic status and those who do not attend the highest track school type. Additionally, quantile regression analyses suggest that the gender gap increases along the distribution of economic competence and that effects of parents with high socio-economic status are more pronounced above the median of the competence distribution. Our analysis sets the stage for a long-term study of economic competence among secondary school students and the impact of a recent curriculum reform introducing mandatory economic education.
A21|An attempt to optimise the number of pupils in comprehensive secondary schools based on their learning outcomes|There may be a significant correlation between the number of pupils in a school and their learning performance. Some studies point to the negative impact of schools with a large number of pupils on the educational results achieved. At the same time, the demographic crisis that has been deepening steadily for several years now represents an important motivation forrationalising the existing network of schools. The aim of the study was to determine the optimum size of schools based on the criterion of examination results expressed through educational value added. The analysis covered all comprehensive secondary schools in Poland over the2013 to 2015 period (a total of 1,943 schools). It determined the correlation between the size of a school expressed through the average number of graduates, and the results of thematura examination (the secondary schoolleaving exam in Poland) expressed through educational value added. Data for the analysis was obtained from the Section of Educational Value Added of the Educational Research Institute in Warsaw. The comprehensive secondary schools under study were divided into 5 classes, according to the criterion of the average annual number of graduates. The following analytical classes were distinguished: class A - up to 50 graduates, class B - 51-100 graduates, class C - 101-150 graduates, class D - 151 -200 graduates, class E - above 201 graduates. The analyses conducted in this study showed that the comprehensive secondary schools with over 600 pupils had the highest learning outcomes as expressed through educational value added. The lowest educational effectiveness was found in schools with less than 150 pupils. A dependency was discovered whereby the effectiveness of education increases as the number of pupils grows. Due to the lack of data concerning examination results in schools with more than 1,000 pupils (value indicated in American studies as the threshold value for positive learning outcomes), it was not possible to determine the maximum number of pupils that guarantees satisfactory learning outcomes.
A21|Economics case study: Harvard Business School pedagogy techniques: From teaching entrepreneurship to influencing business policy through research|The case study explains the need for social entrepreneurship while remaining in the premise of mainstream economics. A detailed discussion is carried out on the vulnerabilities of economic policy making that has led to some of the new initiatives at Harvard Business School to promote such pedagogy practices at Business Schools that may eventually influence national and international policy making to the benefit of the society and not only the economies of developed and developing countries. Two brief cases are presented. First one takes evolution of HBS course at a Pakistani university to develop superior pedagogy for student learning towards social entrepreneurship. The other case maps the journey of bilateral relationships between China and Pakistan from Free trade agreement to CPEC as a matter of national policy to evaluate local business risks and potentials.
A21|Economic Education Retrospective|The American Economist has a long and significant history of publishing research in the field of economic education. This article provides a review and synthesis of the 70 economic education articles published by the journal between spring 1990 and spring 2015. The authors discuss The American Economist â€™s contribution to the field of economic education according to four primary themes: program design, instructional and assessment methodology, instructional materials, and student outcomes.
A21|Preschool teachers' problems in the school administration|Pre-school education is an education program provided for children in the period of their best learning time. The most supportive people during this period are teachers for children. Identified and overcome the problems faced by teachers will improve the quality of the preschool education. The aim of this study is to determine the problems of the teachers working in pre-school education institution in the context of the management functions. The study samples include 20 teachers working in kindergartens as independent in the city center of I?d?r. The research design is based on qualitative research methods. Content analysis and data were analyzed with descriptive analysis technique. As a result, some problems in all of the sub-title of the management functions has been observed. The most common problems have been identified as supervision, helpful staff, office hours, school fees, school garden area and the number of students.
A21|Putting yourself in the picture with an ‘ECONSelfie’: Using student-generated photos to enhance introductory economics courses|Students in economics classrooms are increasingly digital natives, raised in a culture of engagement, expression and learning through online interactions using technological devices. We have turned the concept of a ‘selfie’ into an instructional tool for students to demonstrate their understanding of economic concepts, as well as to engage personally with those concepts. A student self-assessment survey supports the expectations of the literature that our ECONSelfie assignment leverages the power of visuals and narratives to help students link themselves with introductory economics material for improved learning outcomes.

A21|Improving the Service Quality of Islamic Boarding School based on Importance Performance Analysis Results|Service quality is very importance aspect in a boarding school. In this research, an importance-performance analysis enables to evaluate the weaknesses of an Islamic boarding school according to service quality factors. This study attempts to understand stakeholders’ expectations and perceptions toward boarding school and shows the usefulness of the Importance-performance analysis grid in evaluating the service quality of school. This research identifies 35 items and each item is rated using the 5-point of Likert scale. The results are obtained from 350 respondents from students, teachers, and parents. The final results of importance-performance grid show that 12 items fall into quadrant of “Keep up the good work”, and 18 items fall into the “Concentrate here” quadrant, 3 items fall into quadrant of “Low priority”, and 2 items fall into “Possible overkill” quadrant. The findings of the research show that a school management and facilities aspect are necessary to better organizational characteristics and enhance the service quality of school. The results are useful in identifying marketing strategic and help the boarding school develop better service quality. Classification JEL : A21; C38; I23; M12.
A21|Laissez-Colbert|The Colbert Report combines comedic entertainment and current events, two pedagogical sources that have the potential to increase student interest in classes and improve student learning. This article offers suggestions on the use of segments from The Colbert Report to teach introductory macroeconomics. Segments are included that relate to comparative advantage, supply and demand, externalities, GDP, unemployment, classical versus Keynesian theory and the Great Depression, fiscal policy and economic stimulus packages, monetary policy and the Federal Reserve, money, taxes, and foreign aid. Guidance is provided regarding the use of the clips in an introductory macroeconomics class.
A21|Practice Enterprise as a Way of Acquiring Foreign Languages ? an International Survey|The article summarizes the main findings of the international survey in which we focussed on the usage of the practice enterprise as a way to improve one's knowledge of a foreign language and communication skills. The aim of the survey was to compare the experience in different countries concerning the language training, study materials etc. Interviewing several coordinators of the network of practice enterprises was our method of best practice sharing. Our survey has shown that in the Czech Republic, like in other countries, there are, however, some areas where more effort should be made. In order to reach the full potential of the practice enterprise as a means to improve pupils' level of foreign languages, we especially recommend creation of uniform materials and investments in the language instruction in general.
A21|Efectos del Conflicto Armado y el Conflicto Socioeconómico en el aprendizaje civilidad: La función de producción educativa en el caso del conflicto interno en Colombia|El presente artículo de investigación, que fue financiado instituto para el Fomento de la Ciencia y la Tecnología de Colombia (COLCIENCIAS) tuvo como propósito exponer los efectos del contexto socioeconómico y del conflicto armado sobre los aprendizajes ciudadanos evidenciados a partir de los resultados de las pruebas SABER en Competencias Ciudadanas y de los datos sobre la intensidad del Conflicto Armado del Observatorio del Conflicto Armado en Colombia. Este análisis, se desarrolla a partir de una aproximación fundamentalmente cuantitativa que da lugar a un análisis explicativo de los factores, que desde el contexto socioeconómico y del conflicto armado, determinan el desarrollo de las competencias ciudadanas Acciones, Emociones y Ambientes Democráticos. En el trasegar para cumplir dicho propósito, se realiza primeramente un análisis de la estadística descriptiva de los resultados de las pruebas; luego se procede con un análisis factorial que sienta bases para establecer los factores asociados de las variables del contexto con los componentes de la prueba; y finalmente mediante un análisis econométrico establecemos el sentido y la magnitud de la relación de las competencias ciudadanas con las variables de contexto. Los hallazgos de esta investigación muestran que existe evidencia científica de la relación que tiene el contexto socio-económico y el conflicto armado en la configuración de las competencias ciudadanas, y resulta confirmatorio de los resultados de otras investigaciones realizadas a nivel nacional e internacional.
A21|Gender and Student Achievement in Personal Finance: Evidence from Keys to Financial Success|In this paper, we examine the performance of male and female students participating in a unique and successful high school program called Keys to Financial Success. Using the Financial Fitness for Life High School Test (FFFL-HS) results from 965 students enrolled in a one-semester Keys course, we discover no gender gap at the overall pretest level. We find, however, a significant gender gap favoring female students at the overall posttest level, a result that is also consistent with the overall performance of students participating in the norming of the FFFL-HS Test. We conclude by suggesting that the use of a carefully designed personal finance course, taught by instructors trained on the specific curriculum covered in that course, is essential for providing equal learning opportunities to both male and female high school students.
A21|Teaching teenagers in finance: Does it work?|Many initiatives worldwide aim at improving financial literacy through targeted education programs, yet there is little evidence regarding their effectiveness. We examine the impact of a short financial education program on teenagers in German high schools. Our findings reveal that the training program significantly increases teenagers’ interest in financial matters and their financial knowledge, especially their ability to properly assess the riskiness of assets. Behaviorally, we observe a decrease in the prevalence of self-reported impulse purchases, but at the same time find no evidence of a significant increase in savings.
A21|Lost In Translation? Teacher Training And Outcomes In High School Economics Classes|" type=""main"" xml:lang=""en""> Using data from a 2006 survey of California high school economics classes, we assess the effects of teacher characteristics on student achievement. We estimate value-added models of outcomes on multiple choice and essay exams, with matched classroom pairs for each teacher enabling random-effects and fixed-effects estimation. The results show a substantial impact of specialized teacher experience and college-level coursework in economics. However, the latter is associated with higher scores on the multiple-choice test and lower scores on the essay test, suggesting that a portion of teachers' content knowledge may be “lost in translation” when conveyed to their students.

A21|The distributional impacts of a universal school reform on mathematical achievements: A natural experiment from Canada|We investigate the impact of an ambitious provincial school reform in Canada on students’ mathematical achievements. It is the first paper to exploit a universal school reform of this magnitude to identify the causal effect of a widely supported teaching approach on students’ math scores. Our data set allows us to differentiate impacts according to the number of years of treatment and the timing of treatment. Using the changes-in-changes model, we find that the reform had negative effects on students’ scores at all points on the skills distribution and that the effects were larger the longer the exposure to the reform.
A21|Construct validity of financial literacy|Various studies deal with the assessment of financial literacy. However, it is not always obvious whether actual competencies are assessed or if it is rather a measurement of knowledge or attitudes. Furthermore, it is questionable if the construct that is supposed to be assessed is valid. Using the Financial Literacy Study as an example, the following article describes how the underlying theoretical construct can be validated. The validation is based on the measurement of financial literacy through Rasch-modelled values, which are verified by means of structural equation models.
A21|Factors associated with financial literacy among high school students in New Zealand|Understanding financial literacy among young people is essential for developing effective financial education programmes. We present results from a sample of New Zealand high school students. Holding all else constant, we find that financial literacy is lowest among financially poorer students, those with less English ability, and those with less mathematical ability. However, relative poverty and lower English ability were not related to financial literacy at the highest cognitive level, i.e. the ability to apply financial knowledge. Thus, financial literacy education beginning at the high school level may be the key to improving financial decision-making in the population.
A21|Comparison of financial literacy between Korean and U.S. high school students|This study looks into the financial literacy between Korean and U.S. high school students. The mean scores for Korean students fell between those for U.S. students with and without FFFL, but much closer to those with FFFL. Korean students tended to be stronger in such contents as “earning income.” A comparison of financial literacy based on the Bloom's cognitive level indicates that Korean students showed relatively strong financial literacy at the cognitive level of knowledge, but weak financial literacy at higher cognitive levels of comprehension and application.
A21|The features and effectiveness of the Keys to Financial Success curriculum|The global financial crisis of 2007–2009 generated a renewed interest in including personal finance in the secondary curriculum in the United States and in many countries around the world. This paper explains the features of a successful and unique high school personal finance curriculum, Keys to Financial Success, which is offered by a consortium of partners in Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, and is available to teachers from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Using the Financial Fitness for Life High School Test (FFFL-HS Test), pre- and posttest results are reported for 967 students who participated in a one-semester Keys course during the 2011–2012 and 2012–2013 academic years. The survey results indicate that the training of teachers in the Keys curriculum, and the implementation of a one-semester Keys course, significantly improve the average personal finance knowledge of students in each of the standards and concept areas of the FFFL-HS Test. These results contribute to the growing literature showing the positive effects of a well-designed personal finance course, taught by properly trained teachers, on the financial knowledge of high school students, and should be of interest to an international audience.
A21|Teaching economics with a bag of chocolate: A classroom experiment for elementary school students|This paper describes a classroom experiment suitable for elementary school students in which participants are actively engaged in making trading decisions. Students are provided an endowment of gum and are asked to make trading decisions to acquire chocolate. As the opportunity cost of acquiring a piece of chocolate rises, fewer students are willing to make trades. This interactive classroom exercise illustrates three fundamental economic concepts: the law of demand, opportunity costs, and gains from trade. Assessment test results reveal that two days after this classroom exercise, fifth grade students register significant improvements in their understanding of three fundamental economic concepts.
A21|The Impact of Age of Entry on Academic Progression|Using an RD-design and public educational administrative data for Chile, we study the impact of age of entry on children outcomes. Different from previous studies, we are able to track this impact on school achievements over eleven years of the school life of a cohort of students. Our results confirm previous findings that a higher age of entry not only has a positive effect on GPA and the likelihood of passing a grade but also that this impact tends to wear off over time. However, we also find that this impact on school achievement is still present eleven years after a child has started school. Moreover, we show that this decrease in the impact on GPA masks a return associated to a higher age of entry in other dimensions. First, we show that age of entry reduces the probability of being enrolled in a public school. Secondly, during secondary school, children delaying school entry are more likely to follow an academic track and we present evidence that these children are more likely to be enrolled in schools where children coming from other schools had a higher than the mean GPA in the school of origin. Finally, also explaining the decline in the impact of age of entry on school's achievements, we find evidence that age of entry is associated to an increase in the probability that a child is enrolled in a school actively engaged in cream skimming.

A21|El impacto de la educación temprana en el mediano plazo<BR>[Medium term effect of early Child-care]|To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to evaluate the medium term impact of early childcare (0-2 years old child). This is carried out by the estimation of efective (actual) marginal returns of early childcare in a non observable heterogeneity context. We estimate the impact on cognitive tests (SIMCE) (Math and Lenguage) taken in the 4th grade of elementary school. Results suggest that early childcare attendance has a nearly zero effect on average population but a negative e¤ect on those who were treated (those who attended all levels of childcare (early, midium, Pre Kinder and Kinder) relative to those non treated (those who attended the latter three levels but not the former). The distribution of the Marginal Treatmente Effect and the estimated parameters of interest suggest that the zero-negative effect would be related to the quality of early childcare.
A21|A Review and Analysis of the Effectiveness of Alternative Teaching Methods on Student Learning in Economics|Drawing largely on educational literature outside of economics, we provide a survey of perspectives on alternative teaching methods. We then report results regarding the effectiveness of various alternative methods such as cooperative learning, class discussions, and the use of multimedia sources compared to lecture-only instruction. A difference-in-means test is utilized to compare gains in learning between control classes and treatment classes. Alternative teaching methods were not shown to increase student performance in a statistically significant manner.
A21|Economic Understanding in US High School Courses|The effects of courses on student achievement are studied using 2006 data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in economics. A regression analysis showed expected and significant achievement differences by course, with the highest scores in advanced economics, followed by general economics. Courses in business and personal finance were not substitutes for advanced or general economics courses. A probit analysis showed that students taking economics courses relative to personal finance courses are significantly more likely to think their courses helped them understand the US economy, the international economy, and current events--but not how to manage personal finances.
A21|Does the Classic Microfinance Model Discourage Entrepreneurship among the Poor? Experimental Evidence from India|Do the repayment requirements of the classic microfinance contract inhibit investment in high-return but illiquid business opportunities among the poor? Using a field experiment, we compare the classic contract which requires that repayment begin immediately after loan disbursement to a contract that includes a two-month grace period. The provision of a grace period increased short-run business investment and long-run profits but also default rates. The results, thus, indicate that debt contracts that require early repayment discourage illiquid risky investment and thereby limit the potential impact of microfinance on microenterprise growth and household poverty.
A21|The Production of Economic Knowledge in Urban and Rural Areas: The Role of Student, Teacher, and School Characteristics| Many states are adopting economic education standards for the K–12 curriculum, mandating economic education courses in rural and urban schools. We examine economic education outcomes for rural and urban students using test scores gathered during a national high school academic competition and by estimating a production function for economic education. We find only limited differences between the education production function in urban and rural settings and lower average scores for rural students. To close this gap, results suggest that rural schools should place economic content in the senior-year curriculum and provide teachers with increased postgraduate training in economics.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

A21|Psycho-Pedagogical Intervention In The Case Of The Attention Deficit And Hyperactivity Disorder|The attention deficits, the hyperactivity / impulsiveness as well as the deficits in the executive functioning expose students to the risk of poor school performance, social isolation and antisocial behaviors. For them, it is more difficult to assimilate organizational, planning and time management skills, in comparison with their peers enrolled in the mainstream education. School environment requires planning, control, coordination and evaluation of the interactions and ways of active participation in the educational process. Therefore, the case study concerning a student diagnosed with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder associated with reading and writing difficulties demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of the psycho-pedagogical intervention in school, an environment that represents a propitious context to exercise self-control.
A21|THE PEDAGOGICAL AND SCHOLAR MURES PRESS IN THE XXth CENTURY|The pedagogical and scholar press appeared in the Mureş county during the XXth century represented a true cultural laboratory for the Romanian local press. The year 1918 (marking the creation of the modern Romanian state) represented a starting point in this evolution, determining the birth of the Romanian school system and press in Târgu Mureş. Thus, an entire generation of teachers, some of them with relevant journalistic experience, were brought to Târgu Mureş in the 20s to contribute to the development of the young local school system. With a function and a structure placing it between the cultural press (by its content) and the specialized press (by its connection to the school environment and public), the pedagogical and scholar press of the Mureş county totalizes during the last century 63 publications of great relevance, due to the roles it assumed in different periods, as an informative and cultural shelter for the Romanian general local press.
A21|La educación primaria en la Nueva Granada|Este trabajo es un análisis descriptivo de la educación primaria en la Nueva Granada entre 1835 y 1850, con base en información primaria sobre aspectos de la escuela elemental de la época, tales como el número de estudiantes por establecimiento, la disponibilidad de maestros y recursos, y las asignaturas que se impartían, entre otros. Se presentan estadísticas por provincia y por tipo de escuela, y se estiman algunos indicadores de cobertura con el fin de mostrar las diferencias entre las diversas regiones. Se concluye que la educación primaria de la época atravesó por muchos inconvenientes, como la poca disponibilidad de recursos, la falta de maestros calificados y el poco interés de los padres en la educación de sus hijos, pese a las ideas reformistas que impulsaron la educación de niños y niñas, sin distinción de raza.
A21|The Gender Question in Economic Education: Is it the Teacher or the Test?|One of the most persistent, and controversial, empirical regularities in economic education research is the significant difference between the test scores of male and female students. Several possible explanations for this “Gender Gap” are well documented in the literature. Using a large sample of test scores from the Test of Economic Literacy (TEL), we seek to determine whether gender role-model effects influence these differentials or whether it is the result of biased testing materials. A model employing an educational production function exhibits no evidence of role-model effects for our two student cohorts, although some students perform better when taught by female teachers. We find no evidence to support the claim that the testing instrument is biased, and conclude that the gender gap observed in our data is not attributable to the teacher or the test.
A21|Kompetenzdiagnostik in der Berufsorientierung. Eine Bestandsaufnahme der Potenzialanalyse als Diagnose-und Foerderinstrument in der Sekundarstufe I|Potenzialanalysen werden als Instrument der Diagnose und Foerderung derzeit stark propagiert. Nicht zuletzt sollen sie im Berufsorientierungsunterricht eingesetzt werden, um berufliche Interessen und Faehigkeiten der Schuelerinnen und Schueler zu diagnostizieren und zu foerdern. In Baden-Wuerttemberg geschieht dies seit dem Schuljahr 2010 flaechendeckend in allen Haupt-, Werkreal- und Foerderschulen in Klasse 7, ab dem Schuljahr 2013/2014 werden die Schueler der 8. Klassen der Realschulen einbezogen. In Nordrhein-Westfalen wird deren Einsatz derzeit im Rahmen eines systematischen Prozesses der Berufs- und Studienorientierung ab der Jahrgangsstufe 8 forciert. Angesicht dieser stark steigenden Praxisrelevanz wird im vorliegenden Beitrag eine Auswahl der am Markt verfuegbaren Potenzialanalysen fuer Schuelerinnen und Schueler der Sekundarstufe I analysiert. Ziel ist eine Bestandsaufnahme der Potenzialanalyse als Diagnose- und Foerderinstrument in der Sekundarstufe I. Angesichts der erheblichen finanziellen und personellen Ressourcen, die Potenzialanalysen in Anspruch nehmen, ist die wissenschaftliche Bewertung ihrer Moeglichkeiten und Grenzen ein dringendes Desiderat wirtschaftsdidaktischer Forschung.
A21|A Randomized Controlled Trial of Teaching Methods: Do Classroom Experiments improve Economic Education in High Schools?|We present results from a field experiment at Swiss high schools in which we compare the effectiveness of a classroom experiment against conventional economics teaching. We randomly assigned classes into different teaching environments or a control group. Our results suggest that both teaching methods improve economic understanding considerably in contrast to classes without prior training. We do not observe a significant overall effect of the classroom experiment, but more able students benefit from the experiment while others lose out. Furthermore there is no robust impact of economic training on social preferences, measured as both individual behavior in incentivized decisions or political opinions.
A21|A New Challenge In Eu: Effective Financial Education|Financial literacy is a need for people responsible for their money. The decisions people made in respect with the money have impact on their future. Their responsibility and the risks assumed increase as long as employers and government responsibility and assumed risks in this respect decrease. Financial education is based on principles such as: active long life learning, individuals needs oriented, part of the early education provided by schools, basic concepts on financial issues and risks oriented. In Romania, financial education is part of school based curriculum. The Ministry of Education recommends all schools interested in delivering financial education programs schools a syllabus for an optional subject focused on financial issues. Banks are also interested to contribute to financial education. They help schools in conducting financial education programs and, additionally, they developed their own financial education programs.

Im Fokus steht die Frage, ob die unternehmerische Persoenlichkeit im Rahmen einer Entrepreneurship Education zur ganzheitlichen Foerderung unternehmerischer Handlungskompetenzen entwickelt werden kann. Dieser Frage wird auf theoretischer, konzeptioneller und empirischer Ebene nachgegangen. Neben der Legitimation des Bedarfs der Entrepreneurship-Foerderung erfolgen eine Diskussion der referenztheoretischen Basis unternehmerischer Persoenlichkeit und ihrer Entwickelbarkeit sowie eine kritische Wuerdigung der persoenlichkeitsorientierten Entrepreneurship-Forschung, der in der vorliegenden Arbeit inhaltlich und methodisch begegnet wird. Bezug nehmend auf die Interaktion der Persoenlichkeits- und Kompetenzentwicklung werden Anforderungen an die konzeptionelle Ausgestaltung subjektorientierter Entrepreneurship Education-Massnahmen zur ganzheitlichen Foerderung unternehmerischer Handlungskompetenzen aufgezeigt. Auf dieser Basis wird ein didaktisch begruendeter, konzeptioneller Vorschlag fuer eine Entrepreneurship Education, die diesen Anforderungen entspricht, skizziert. Im Zuge der Implementierung dieses Entrepreneurship Education-Konzepts in der Sekundarstufe II einer allgemein- und einer berufsbildenden Schule wird zur UEberpruefung der Entwicklung unternehmerischer Persoenlichkeit eine Laengsschnittuntersuchung im Paneldesign mit zwei Erhebungswellen durchgefuehrt. Aus den Ergebnissen der Interventionsstudie ergeben sich Erkenntnisse zur Entwicklung unternehmerischer Persoenlichkeit sowie Implikationen fuer kuenftige Forschung. Fuer die Entrepreneurship Education-Praxis bietet die Arbeit eine didaktische Grundlegung einer handlungsorientierten Unterrichtsreihe zur ganzheitlichen Entwicklung unternehmerischer Handlungskompetenzen sowie konzeptionelle Desiderata fuer Entrepreneurship Education-Massnahmen zur Foerderung unternehmerischen Denkens und Handelns.
A21|A challenging contest in a time when the United States of America celebrated its significant legacy|The Flag Day and the National Flag Week are significant events of the United States history and culture. On these special occasions America is celebrating this heritage in public gatherings and activities. In todays global economy a high-quality education is a prerequisite to success, because economic progress and educational achievement are inextricably linked. Participating in a very interesting contest which celebrated the U.S. Flag Day is a real challenge. A space for conversations, information and engagement, to learn new skills or improve existing ones, this represents a veritable opportunity.
A21|New Directions For The Costs Of Evaluation|The present paper presents at first ideas about how evaluation can play a key role in the educational reform. Thus, a great variety of data sources, new social power relations and changed ways of thinking about evaluation are required. The new directions for the teachers’ evaluation utter that a good evaluation has to assure the audience and also offer a main source of reward and recognition for teachers. It also pretends both the teachers’ participation and control. An important issue the pedagogues consider at present is the cost of evaluation: there are different evaluation costs: evaluation costs in terms of money, in terms of time, in terms of materials and morale costs. In its second part, the paper presents several types of data source for teacher evaluation: the pupil reports, teacher tests, documentation of professional activity, systematic observation, dossier assembly and the specific cost for each and every presented approach in the American society and for comparison the costs – as they are seen – in the Romanian system of learning.
A21|Managing the Transition Process of Students from Junior High-School to High-School|Transitions from primary school to high school is also considered to be a key milestone, while experiencing adolescence, children undergo more developmental changes include physical, cognitive, emotional and psychological changes. During the course of their studies all students experience transitions between schools. The focus of my paper is the transition process and the management of this period by involving all the relevant stakeholders in the process of students’ transition from Junior High School to High School. I have focused my research on different factors involving this transition and the challenges that students and professors have to cope with.
A21|Managing Formal, Non-Formal and Informal Economic Education|If we consider how to effectively deal with economic education, we should start with the questions that entrepreneurs ask themselves when they start a business. Their goal is to make it profitable. It is therefore necessary to answer the following questions: What do we produce? How to produce it? Where and by what means? In other words: How to teach students? How much should we teach them? Where and by what means we should teach? In this article we attempt an analysis of economic education in Romania. Economic education can be developed in formal, non-formal and informal contexts; the extent of each one is prevalent on students’ development, depending on the structure of educational system, its resources, the principles that govern it, and the strategies chosen by the educators.
A21|A Randomized Controlled Trial of Teaching Methods: Do Classroom Experiments Improve Economic Education in High Schools?|We present results from a field experiments at Swiss high schools in which we compare the effectiveness of teaching methods in economics. We randomly assigned classes into an experimental and a conventional teaching group, or a control group that received no specific instruction. Both of our teaching treatments improve economic understanding considerably while effect sizes are almost identical. However, student ability crucially affects learning outcomes as more able students seem to benefit disproportionately from classroom experiments while weaker students lose out. Supplemental data indicates that our experimental treatment crowded out time for adequately discussing the subject, which may have limited less able students to generate a profound understanding. Furthermore there is no robust impact of economic training on social preferences, measured as both individual behavior in incentivized decisions or political opinions.
A21|The Alpha of a Survey of the Literature in Economic and Financial Literacy|There is a century long history of economic and financial education laced with implications for both political civic education. It has been argued by some economists that since economics is based on rational self-interested “agents” we don’t need to teach economics at the undergraduate level all. This paper offers a brief review of the literature from the K- college results of economic and financial education extending the survey to the more recent attempts at public financial and economic education. In the review we try to highlight both the results and types of approaches. We then identify some of the areas in which the relatively new areas of behavioral and experimental economics are relevant to economic and financial literacy efforts. We speculate on how these findings may effect economic and financial literacy efforts in the future. JEL Classification: A20, A21, A22, A29
A21|Personal Financial Literacy Among High School Students in New Zealand, Japan and the United States|Personal financial literacy is becoming increasingly important in the modern world, especially for young people. In this paper we compare financial literacy of high school students in Hamilton, New Zealand, with samples from Japan and the United States. We compare not only overall financial literacy, but also literacy across five dimensions (or ‘themes’) of financial literacy, and across three cognitive levels. We find that financial literacy is poor overall in all three countries, but is substantially worse in New Zealand and the United States than in Japan. The performance is similar across themes and cognitive levels for U.S. and New Zealand students, but Japanese students perform better mostly in terms of their greater knowledge of terminology and definitions, rather than better comprehension and ability to apply their knowledge. This suggests that all three countries should work harder to develop the financial literacy of their high school students.
A21|Factors Associated with Financial Literacy among High School Students|Understanding the financial literacy of young people is an essential prerequisite for developing effective education programmes designed to improve young people’s understanding of personal finance. In this paper, we present results from a survey of high school students which included a financial literacy component, a financial risk tolerance assessment, and basic demographic details. Overall, we find that financial literacy is lowest among financially poorer students, those with less English ability, and those with less academic ability. However, relative poverty and lower English ability were not related to the ability to apply financial knowledge. Thus, while financial education targeted to immigrant groups and the poor may improve overall financial literacy, a broader approach remains necessary. A general form of financial literacy education, beginning at the high school level, may be the key to improving financial literacy in the population in the long term.
A21|Evidence of Student Achievement in a High School Personal Finance Course|This study investigates the effect of the “Keys to Financial Success” high school personal finance curriculum on student achievement. It relies on multiple years of pre- and posttest data from 1,701 students who took a “Keys” course and from a comparison group of 261 students from the same schools. The results from the pre- and posttests show that students who take the “Keys” course exhibit a statistically significant increase in their personal finance achievement. These results contribute to the growing literature showing the positive effects on the financial knowledge of high school students when they take a well-designed course taught by properly trained teachers.
A21|"Terra incognita: Das Fach ""Volkswirtschaftslehre"" am Weiterbildungskolleg in Nordrhein-Westfalen"|Das Fach -Volkswirtschaftslehre- existiert am Weiterbildungskolleg in Nordrhein-Westfalen seit nahezu 60 Jahren, ohne dass es in der Wirtschaftsdidaktik Beachtung gefunden haette. Die oekonomische Bildung im so genannten Zweiten Bildungsweg ist infolge dessen ein vollstaendig unerforschtes Gebiet. Am Lehrstuhl fuer Wirtschaftsdidaktik der Universitaet Duisburg-Essen wurde daher zwischen September 2011 und Januar 2012 eine empirische Studie dieses Faches durchgefuehrt. In diesem Beitrag wird deren Referenzrahmen ebenso dargelegt wie die erkenntnisleitenden Fragestellungen. Insbesondere werden ausgewaehlte und sehr bemerkenswerte Ergebnisse zur Situation dieses eigenstaendigen Faches fuer die oekonomische Bildung praesentiert.
A21|Students’ understanding of socio-economic phenomena: Conceptions about the free provision of goods and services|Research on conceptual change has paid relatively less attention to the social than to the physical science domain. In particular, research on conceptual change in economic understanding has been fairly sparse and loosely connected. Given the potential significance of citizen’s economic understanding in delimiting government responses to globalisation (Davies, 2006) this topic is worthy of further study. This study paper investigates conceptions about the provision of free goods and services, drawing on evidence from students in different age groups. In contrast to previous work we focus on the question ‘Should this product or service be made available for free?’ We compare the reasoning of students at different ages across a range of products and services and we explore the ways that they attempt to resolve conflicts within their reasoning.
A21|Nominal and Real Income in a Real Dollar Store|In this paper, the distinction between nominal and real income is highlighted by positing the existence of an imaginary “real dollar store.” In this store, all items are sold at a price of one dollar in the base year and the price of each is indexed to the cost of living. Hence, such concepts as “real income” and “real rate of interest” can be illustrated in physical terms in a way that lacks the ambiguity that comes with the term “dollar of the base year.”
A21|The Current State Of Staff Developmentand Training At A Higher Educational Institution In Namibia|The paper intends to evaluate the current state of staff development and training at tertiary educational institutions, with special emphasis on Namibia. The research adopted a meta-analytical study, which relied on secondary data. A qualitative research approach was utilised and the emic perspective (author’s view point) was employed. An empirical analysis was utilised in the paper. The authors are of the view that all staff development and training activities should be linked to the strategic goals of organisations. This paper is original since it examines staff development and training activities and various factors affecting it in higher educational institutions, which creates an opportunity for further investigation into strategic issues confronting staff development and training activities in higher education in general.
A21|What Does Financial Literacy Training Teach Us?| The authors use data from a finance-related theme park to explore how financial education changes investment, financing, and consumer behavior. Students were assigned fictitious life situations and asked to create household budgets. Some students received a 19-hour financial literacy curriculum before going to the park, and some did not. After controlling for demographic variables, the authors show that the treatment effects of the financial literacy program are strong. Students were more frugal, delayed gratification, paid off debt faster, and relied less on credit financing after training. Students who attended training showed greater uptake of decision support that was offered in the park, which indicates that decision support and financial literacy training are complements, not substitutes.
A21|NCEA Level 3 Economics and Economic Literacy in Introductory Economics at University|In 2003, New Zealand significantly reorganised high school education by moving to a standards-based assessment approach. This paper investigates whether the economics standards are associated with economic understanding using 2008-2011 data from students at the University of Waikato. We find that there is significant association between NCEA economics and economic literacy. However, some standards have a much closer association with economic literacy, in particular AS90631 and AS90632. These standards are the only standards associated with economic literacy for both high aptitude and low aptitude students. An optimal high school course in economics should include these standards as a minimum.
A21|"Kompetenzziele fuer das allgemein bildende Fach ""Wirtschaft/Oekonomie"" in der Sekundarstufe I"|Seit 2010 liegt fuer die Oekonomische Bildung ein Modell domaenenspezifischer Kompetenzen nebst abschlussbezogener Bildungsstandards und exemplarischer Aufgabenbeispiele vor. Darauf koennen nun Kerncurricula aufbauen, die den Prozess der Foerderung der Kompetenzentwicklung nach Jahrgangsstufen gliedern. Vor dieser Aufgabe stehen nunmehr die Lehrplanentwickler in den Bundeslaendern. Um sie bei ihrer Arbeit zu unterstuetzen, haben sich die nordrhein-westfaelischen Hochschullehrer fuer Oekonomische Bildung zu einer ARBEITSGRUPPE OEKONOMISCHE BILDUNG (AGOEB) zusammengefunden. Sie legen einen auf diesem Kompetenzmodell aufbauenden, systematischen Katalog von Kompetenzzielen fÃ¼r das allgemein bildende Fach Wirtschaft / Oekonomie in der Sekundarstufe I vor. Konkreter Anlass fuer diese Ausarbeitung ist der Modellversuch Wirtschaft in der Realschule in Nordrhein-Westfalen (2010-2013), der das Kernfach Wirtschaft bzw. das Wahlpflichtfach Oekonomie einfuehrt. Der Vorschlag ist jedoch nicht auf Nordrhein-Westfalen und auf die Realschule begrenzt. Die Autorinnen und Autoren hoffen vielmehr, dass er auch ueber die Landesgrenzen hinweg wahrgenommen und fuer andere Schulformen genutzt wird, die zum mittleren Bildungsabschluss fuehren.
A21|Bildungsstandards = Lernzielorientierung reloaded?|Seit dem PISA-Schock und dem Erscheinen der Expertise Zur Entwicklung nationaler Bildungsstandards wird die Standardisierungsdiskussion in allen Fachdidaktiken gefuehrt. Schulische Bildung soll demzufolge nicht mehr allein ueber den Input, sondern vor allem ueber den Output gesteuert werden. Die aktuelle Debatte um die Kompetenzorientierung und Standardisierung der Bildung erinnert an vielen Stellen an die Debatte um die Lernzielorientierung des Unterrichts, die in den siebziger Jahren, spaetestens jedoch Anfang der achtziger Jahre, ihren Scheitelpunkt hatte. Daher stellt sich die Frage nach den Unterschieden und Gemeinsamkeiten beider Programme. In diesem Beitrag wird untersucht, ob und inwieweit das Setzen von Bildungsstandards etwas anderes ist als die Bestimmung von Lernzielen oder ob es sich um alten Wein in neuen Schlaeuchen handelt. Anders formuliert: Sind die Bildungsstandards etwas anderes als die Lernzielorientierung reloaded?
A21|Revisiting the empirical existence of the Phillips curve for India|This paper revisits the empirical existence of the Phillips curve in the Indian context. To estimate the Phillips curve we need two variables: inflation and the output gap. In the case of India, incorrect measurement of both variables causes much difficulty in estimating the Phillips curve. We use a non-linear Kalman filter approach to estimate the output gap and find that the Kalman filter estimate captures all the dynamics of the economy. Our results show that after taking supply shocks into consideration, there is clear evidence as to the existence of the Phillips curve in India for recent years.
A21|The role of social trust in reducing long-term truancy and forming human capital in Japan|This paper attempts to examine how social trust influences human capital formation using prefectural level data in Japan. To this end, I constructed a proxy for social trust, based on the Japanese General Social Surveys. After controlling for socioeconomic factors, I found that social trust plays an important role in reducing the rate of long-term truancy in primary and junior high school. Results suggest that social trust improves educational quality.
A21|Advanced Placement Economics: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly|In 2010 the College Board and Educational Testing Service (ETS®) administered 134,747 Advanced Placement (AP®) microeconomics and macroeconomics exams to high school students. The exams are designed to represent the introductory-level micro and macro courses taught in college, and students can earn college credit if they “pass” the exams. The present article discusses the beneficial effects of AP economics and suggests modifications that would improve the program as a tool of economic education. The modifications include more emphasis on economic reasoning relative to mechanics; the integration of property rights, entrepreneurship, and dynamic competition into the content; and correction of the imbalanced presentation of topics involving markets and government. With regard to the last point, “market failure” is a component of the courses, but there is no parallel treatment of “government failure.” AP economics courses attract many of our brightest high school students, and it is important that they be equipped with the tools of economic reasoning and an accurate view of the current state of scholarship in the field.
A21|Hacia una educación de calidad en el Perú : el heterogéneo impacto de la educación inicial sobre el rendimiento escolar|La educación es considerada un factor fundamental para impulsar el desarrollo de una sociedad, especialmente por sus efectos positivos sobre el posterior desenvolvimiento del individuo en el mercado laboral y su mayor capacidad de generación de ingresos. En el caso específico de la educación inicial, este nivel educativo ha sido relegado dentro de las políticas públicas del sector y su importancia es subestimada por los propios padres de familia. En el presente trabajo se muestra que uno de los principales problemas en relación a la educación preescolar es el limitado acceso a una oferta educativa inicial de calidad. Si bien el nivel de cobertura es más bajo que lo deseado, lo más preocupante en realidad es que en las zonas más excluidas y dispersas del territorio nacional, esta cobertura la logran instituciones públicas de baja calidad y con modelos educativos no necesariamente adecuados a las realidades de cada comunidad, además de ser, en casi un 50%, cubierto por los programas no escolarizados, menos efectivos en lo que se refiere a resultados cognitivos. En el documento, se estima una función de producción del rendimiento escolar que tiene como factores explicativos tanto variables de demanda como de oferta. La función de rendimiento académico se aproxima a través de una estimación en dos etapas: en la primera, se corrigen los potenciales problemas de endogeneidad generados por la variable asistencia a educación inicial, y en la segunda se estima el rendimiento escolar en el área de Comprensión Lectora. Los resultados indican que la asistencia a educación inicial es una variable altamente explicativa del rendimiento escolar a nivel nacional. Asistir a educación inicial supone un incremento de 34% en el puntaje esperado en la prueba de Comprensión de Textos. Sin embargo, si estimamos este impacto de acuerdo con las variables de diferenciación utilizadas ?dominio geográfico, lengua materna y nivel de pobreza- se observa una fuerte reducción del mencionado impacto en aquellos grupos marginados.
A21|Towards a benchmark on the contribution of education and training to employability: methodological note|The present report presents the methodological framework applied to define the benchmark on education for employability to be proposed to European Council in 2012. While the three first sections present the proposed indicator, the fourth section discusses the sensitivity of that indicator to a change in data source and its correlation with counterfactuals. Moreover, section 5 presents the forecasting approach applied to define the target level at the horizon 2020. Section 6 presents the results of the deterministic and stochastic forecasting models and section 7 concludes.
A21|The System Of The Didactic Principles With Applicability In Teaching Economics|The present paper aims to present the system of didactic principles and offer several models of didactic tasks used in teaching Economic objects, but they can be broaden to any other school objects, in accordance with the presented approaches and their specific features. Thus, we presented the following principles: the principle of the active and conscious appropriation of the knowledge and skills; the intuition principle or of the unity between real and abstract, between rational and sensorial; the principle of accessibility and of respecting the students’ age and individual particularities; the principle of connecting theory with practice; the principle of knowledge systematization and continuity; the principle of the rigorous and durable appropriation of the knowledge, abilities and skills; the principle of assuring the feed-back within the system of learning.
A21|Professional Responsibilities Of The Economics Teachers|The present paper’s aim is to present the professional responsibilities belonging to teachers of economics. Firstly, we mentioned the mixed investigations addressed to the teachers activities: pedagogical, psychological, social and axiological. Secondly we define the expectancies concerning the teachers’ knowledge, abilities and attitudes in the present day’s environment learning. In order to establish these issues, we identified the needs of the education system. Here we present the actual points of view, advised pedagogical opinions, stages of the research in this field. Within the last part of the paper, we established the responsibilities for the teachers; expectancies under the form of enunciations for the following five activity domains: instruction, evaluation, learning environment, human relations and professional engagement, at the same time taking into account the three dimensions: knowledge, abilities and attitudes.

A21|John Rogers Commons: Are His Insights Important in Teaching Modern Labor Economics?|John Commons' influence in American labor economics was eclipsed after World War II by a resurgent neoclassical labor economics that gradually relegated Commons' institutional orientation to the periphery of economic discourse. A common opinion is that the work of institutional economists in the Commons tradition was largely descriptive and lacked theoretical content. Commons, however, regarded his Institutional Economics as a work of economic theory. This paper contains a description of the theoretical core of Institutional Economics and an evaluation of it from the perspective of its potential usefulness in the teaching of modern labor economics. Part I describes the theoretical perspective of neoclassical economic theory in order to clarify the institutional perspective by contrast. Part II describes Commons’ alternative perspective. Part III presents the conclusions derived from this comparison of the two alternative perspectives.

A21|Determinants of Student Achievements in the Primary Education of Paraguay|The idea that schooling scores depend on a combination of family background characteristics, ability and school (institutional) variables is quite clear. Regarding the issue of intergenerational transmission of inequality in the educational system, the most important question would be if and to what extent could a better institutional performance of the school service compensate for problems related to family background. By means of the estimation of a reduced form equation for selected scores, we investigate the impact of institutional performance on scores after controlling for family background and individual characteristics. We do this by using a novel data set and an OLS and quantile regression approach to analyze how heterogeneous the process of score generation can be. By providing integral health solutions, minimizing under-nutrition and providing ideal conditions in the classroom, training teachers can impact positively on low and mean learning outcomes, thus contributing to an improved educational quality and breaking cycles of intergenerational transmission of inequality. Increasing learning outcomes for levels above the median, only strengthens the transmission of inequality. Consequently, the equality approach should focus on trying to improve the worst scores and our results show that this can be reached at a significant level closing teacher training gaps, improving classroom conditions and improving health and nutrition.
A21|The Dog ATE my Economics Homework! Estimates of the Average Effect of Treating Hawaiiâ€™s Public High School Students with Economics|Hawaii is one of 27 states that do not require testing of public high school students regarding their understanding of economics. We report results for the first economics test administered to a large sample of students in Hawaii public high schools during the Spring 2004 semester. Our analysis focuses on evaluating the impact of a semester-long course in economics on student scores on a 20-question, multiple-choice economics test. We specify and estimate a regression analysis of exam scores that controls for other factors that could influence student performance on the exam. While student scores on the economics exam are relatively low, completion of an economics course and participation in a stock market simulation game each add about one point to student scores.

As can be induced from the analysis of textbooks, the way economics are taught in the French secondary school is featured both by a very wide scope and by a general tendency to use macroeconomic explanations. Therefore, its main goals -knowing and thinking the world -cannot be achieved. Selecting just a few subjects of analysis and a few analytical concepts would be a far better way to reach them. .

A21|Is Financial Literacy Improved by Participating in a Stock Market Game?|This study investigates the effectiveness of the Stock Market Game (SMG) in improving student scores on a general multiple-choice test covering basic financial concepts. Teachers in the test group used the Stock Market Game and a complementary curriculum in class while teachers in the control group did not. Students in both groups completed the same online pre- and post-tests, demographic surveys, and math aptitude tests. The results of ordinary least squares regression show that playing SMG along with teaching seven general lessons from the Learning from the Market curriculum improves student performance on the financial literacy assessment.
A21|Quality education through Child-Friendly Schools: resource allocation for the protection of children’s rights|The paper discusses the idea and purpose of Child-Friendly Schools (CFSs) initiated by the UNICEF. It analyses the implications of CFSs in terms of improving children’s health and nutrition, promoting gender equality, protecting children’s rights, re-defining education quality and creating positive psycho-emotional environment at schools. Experience is now showing that a framework of rights-based, child-friendly schools can be a powerful tool for both helping to fulfill the rights of children and providing them an education of good quality. At the national level, for ministries, development agencies, and civil society organizations, the framework can be used as a normative goal for policies and programmes leading to child-friendly systems and environments, as a focus for collaborative programming leading to greater resource allocations for education, and as a component of staff training. At the community level, for school staff, parents, and other community members, the framework can serve as both a goal and a tool of quality improvement through localized self-assessment, planning, and management and as a means for mobilizing the community around education and child rights.
A21|From Training to Labour Market. Holocletic Model|The desired professional insertion (placement) after training is under the influence of personal and exogenous variables. In the present paper we identify the constraints and devices that, in an interactive way, can shape and affect the professional insertion. This paper is a result of a subchapter of the author’s PhD dissertation. The helpfulness of the meanings and definitions is clearly reliant on the study framework. We aim to provide to the reader a set of elements that help to distinguish, to compare and turn out accessible the eclectic dominant mainstream, in order to standardized, to clarify and to apply concepts in future research works and studies. We also suggest a study model with a different point of view.

A21|Mirrlees meets Laibson: Optimal Income Taxation with Bounded Rationality|This paper studies an optimal taxation problem in a dynamic economy inhabited by individuals who differ in productivity (as in Kocherlakota, 2006) and in the short-term discount factor. We determine incentive compatible Pareto optimal allocations in a multidimensional screening model where individuals have to report truthfully their types. Moreover, we characterize the optimal non linear tax on capital and labor income that implements such allocations in a competitive equilibrium. Two forms of bounded rationality are considered: in the first one, some individuals discount future payoffs at a higher rate than others (myopia). In this application, the planner respects consumers' sovereignty, and maximizes a Paretian social welfare function. In the second application, some individuals are time inconsistent: they systematically change future plans and regret ex-post for the lack of commitment power. We show that the marginal tax on capital income implementing the optimal allocation consists of several elements, which combine incentive compatibility and bounded rationality considerations. The resulting optimal tax is a decreasing function of both the fraction of short-sighted individuals and the intensity of myopia/hyperbolic discounting. Our results are not driven by the paternalistic behavior of the planner, but by the incentive/self control problem and the necessity of providing the right incentive to high productive, far-sighted individuals. However, when the planner would like to push hyperbolic individuals toward the right consumption/saving path, we show that the optimal marginal tax includes also a paternalistic component that further decrease the optimal tax compared to the case with only exponential agents.
A21|Für eine bessere ökonomische Bildung!|Die Kurzexpertise kritisiert das Gutachten der Wirtschaftsverbände „Ökonomische Bildung an allgemein bildenden Schulen“ (2010) als unter fachwissenschaftlichen, fachdidaktischen, pädagogischen und pragmatischen Aspekten unzureichend. Sie verlangt, ökonomische Fragen in gesellschaftliche, politische und kulturelle Zusammenhänge einzubetten. Sie fordert, dass sich ökonomische Bildung auf die Lebenswirklichkeit der Lernenden bezieht. Ökonomische Bildung verlangt für wissenschaftlichen, politischen und weltanschaulichen Pluralismus und Multiperspektivität; sie darf den Lernenden kein einseitiges Weltbild aufzwingen.
A21|Economic Education’s Roller Coaster Ride In Hawaii, 1956-2006|During the early 1960s a few of Hawaii’s public high schools began to offer economics courses, and they gradually became popular social studies electives. By 1999, over 46% of public high school seniors completed a one-semester course in economics. From this peak, enrollment rates would plummet to just 11% in 2003, before rebounding to 27% in 2005 and 2007. Our analysis searches for an explanation by identifying large changes in key variables and public policies that determine demand for and supply of economic education in Hawaii’s schools. We conclude that changes in the incentives facing large Hawaii businesses, University of Hawaii faculty and administrators, and bureaucrats in the State of Hawaii Department of Education have reduced the supply of qualified teachers and student enrollment rates.
A21|Determinants of the performance of the schools in Medellín in the high-school graduation-year test (ICFES)|This paper analyses how the institutional processes, the school management as well as the contexts in which the school and the students are circumscribed, could impact the performance in the high-school graduation-year test (ICFES). A survey was applied with the purpose of know the actions and interactions among educative process actors. Factor Analysis and Hierarchical econometric models were used with the purpose of construct indexes and measure the impact of the considered variables. We found that school level variables, including management, explain a high percentage of the performance variability, while those constructed variables associated to student’s characteristics have a low impact. And parent human capital and the initial student conditions are much more important than the teacher human capital. Contrary to the expected, it’s not clear what kind of use and if to increase infrastructure resources favors the achievement.
A21|Correcta selección de docentes|We analyze the new selection of teachers in basic and media education in Antioquia as an adverse selection problem. We have known the non-teaching professionals are going relatively well in the written tests, but lose that advantage in the analysis of their curriculum vitae (they usually do not have teacher experience). We conclude that a change in management and valuation, as in the administration of both activities, delegating in independent institutions could increase the efficiency

A21|The transition to market-based economic education: evaluating program effectiveness in Kazakhstan|This article presents an analysis of a program designed to enhance economic literacy through teacher training in the former Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan. The cognitive and affective outcomes for high school students who were taught by teachers trained through the National Council on Economic Education's (NCEE) International Economic Education Exchange Program (IEEEP) are examined and compared to those of students in courses taught by a sample of teachers who had not received training. like most publicly supported programs, beneficiaries were not randomly chosen and assigned to treatment and control groups. To overcome the inherent sample selection which allowed for the interdependency of economic understanding and attitudes. The results indicate that students taught by trained teachers achieved higher post course scores on standardized testing instruments, after controlling for differences in student attributes, teacher characteristics, and the non-random selection of teachers into the training program. However, both the cognitive and affective improvements would have been greater even if teachers had been randomly assigned to the program. The authors call for additional research to evaluate the criteria and methods used to recruit and select teachers for participation in training programs such as the IEEEP.
A21|Enhancement of the teachers work at the upper - secondary schools to speci|In connection with the Czech Republic accession to the European Union there is an effort to enhance educational system so that students can compete not only in the Czech labour market but also in the markets of the other European Union member countries. At the secondary schools in economic education is necessary to provide some changes in structure of subjects, contents, structure and methods of teaching. The paper is devoted to the innovation of subject economics, which belongs between basic compulsory economic subjects and is taught at all secondary schools. It characterizes his history and some key changes which can be with creating school education programs expected. Article describes methods of teaching at the secondary schools, especially using methods of teaching at the subjects of economics. In the end of the paper is to analytically describe possibilities in the connection with the quality enhancement of the future teachers preparation at the upper - secondary schools.
A21|The pylons of e-economy|The Society Based on Knowledge is the key for survival of humanity, presently, based on the respect of each individual for human being. World wide, the connection of these problems suffered an intense ascension. In this complex transformation process lead by globalization, there can be initiated programs capable to discover the primal senses of humanity, fact resulted from the reconciliation between humans being, from the integration between the two approaches specifically to human creation: contemplation / action. The society based on knowledge is the one in which “the treatment” for human “healing” is knowledging, acknowledging and assuming of the human designation in the context of creation.
A21|Wirtschaftsethik für die Schule|Dieser Beitrag wendet sich an Lehrer und ist daher primär didaktisch orientiert. Das Ziel besteht darin, einige Kernüberlegungen aus dem Forschungsprogramm einer „ökonomischen Theorie der Moral“ so vorzustellen, dass sie für den Schulunterricht adaptiert werden können. Mit Hilfe des wirtschaftsethischen Grundmodells sozialer Dilemmata wird zunächst eine Situation analysiert, die für Schüler lebensweltlich nachvollziehbar ist: das Mogeln in einer Klausur. Sodann wird gezeigt, dass es institutionelle Vorkehrungen gibt, die – im Interesse der Schüler! – das Mogeln unterbinden können. Aus diesem Beispiel heraus werden dann mehrere Analogieschlüsse gezogen, die die Logik des Arguments von der Schule auf die Wirtschaft übertragen. Auf diese Weise können Schüler – quasi spielerisch – in die Lage versetzt werden, die Funktionsweise der Marktwirtschaft zu verstehen (und als Bürger zu gestalten).
A21|Family Background or the Characteristics of Children: What Determines High School Success in Germany?|It is becoming more and more important to be highly skilled in order to integrate successfully into the labor market. Highly skilled workers receive higher wages and face a lower risk of becoming unemployed, compared to poorly qualified workers. We analyze the determinants of successful high school graduation in Germany. As our main database, we use the youth file of GSOEP for the period extending from 2000 to 2007. Because the decision as to which secondary school track to attend - general school (Hauptschule), intermediate school (Realschule) or high school (Gymnasium) - is made after the end of elementary school (Grundschule) at age of ten, parents are responsible for this decision. Therefore, the characteristics of the child as well as those of its parents are the main determinants of educational attainment. We also include the characteristics of grandparents in our regression framework, something which has not been done in any previous study so far. In order to disentangle the determinants of successful graduation at high school, we use the Cox proportional hazard model. We find markedly different determinants of successful graduation for males and females. Furthermore, the results indicate a strong linkage between mothers and daughters, as well as between fathers and sons.

A21|Entropy and stability in time use – An empirical investigation based on the German Time Use Survey|Flexibility is a tool for preserving the stability of a system. In general, we can expect that the more variant its behaviour, the more stable a system will be. The investigation provides an example of this principle within the discipline of home economics. For a sample of single-person households from Germany’s national Time Use Survey 2001/2002, it can be shown that the stability of activity sequences is greater, the higher the entropy of time use. For this purpose, a Markov model is derived from heuristic considerations. The Markov matrices are estimated and their eigenvectors and eigenvalues then calculated. It is evident that the entropy of an attractor is higher, the lower the norm of the second eigenvalue of the corresponding Markov matrix. The main components of this relationship, namely diversity and stability in time use, turn out to be only weakly associated with the usual socio-economic regressors. Hence, new empirically and theoretically relevant dimensions for socio-economic research emerge.

A21|District level mandates and high school students' understanding of economics|This paper investigates the impact of district-level course mandates on students’ end-of-course economic understanding. Data were collected from Mississippi high school students studying economics in three different course environments. Students were either enrolled in a one semester economics course required for graduation, enrolled in a one semester course taken as an elective, or studying economics as an infusion subject within a United States history course. A regression-based selection model was estimated to control for students’ demographic characteristics, educational attributes, market experiences, and school attributes. The results indicated that student test scores were significantly less for those students studying economics as an infusion subject and when taking a mandated stand-alone course, ceteris paribus. The authors conclude that course mandates may result in teacher and student issues that reduce the overall observed level of test performance.
A21|Bestimmungsfaktoren des Erwerbs der allgemeinen Hochschulreife in Deutschland|Für Deutschland als ressourcenarmes Hochlohnland ist die Bildung von Humankapital ein bedeutender Faktor für das Wirtschaftswachstum. Im Vergleich zu anderen entwickelten Volkswirtschaften ist der Anteil der Bevölkerung mit einem tertiären Bildungsabschluss relativ gering. Durch die zunehmende Globalisierung und aufgrund des faktorverzerrenden technologischen Wandels zu Gunsten von hochqualifizierten Arbeitskräften ist die relative Nachfrage nach gut ausgebildeten Arbeitskräften gestiegen. Die Integration von gering qualifizierten Arbeitskräften wird in Deutschand zunehmend schwieriger. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist eine gute schulische Ausbildung zukünftiger Generationen entscheidend für die Entwicklung Deutschlands. Wir untersuchen mit einem Random-Effects Panel Probit Modell die Determinanten, erfolgreich die allgemeine Hochschulreife zu erlangen. Als Basisdatensatz wird hierzu der Jugenddatensatz des SOEP der Jahre 2000 bis 2007 herangezogen, den wir mit dem Hauptdatensatz und weiteren Biographiedatensätzen des SOEP zusammenfügen. Als Determinanten dienen umfangreiche Informationen über die Charakteristika der Jugendlichen, der Eltern und der Großeltern. Wir finden deutliche Unterschiede zwischen Mädchen und Jungen. Insbesondere haben Eltern und Großeltern einen größeren Einfluss auf die Mädchen im Vergleich zu den Jungen.
A21|Selección adversa en la convocatoria docente para educación primaria, media y básica en Colombia|This paper analyses the selection of teachers in basic and media education in Colombia under an adverse selection model. We monitor the teacher´s wages and the institutional change, and the results of one of the contests for Medellin. The relative wages of attachment to the teaching profession are competitive, but the incentives are limited in time. In the analyzed contest the non-teaching professionals are going relatively well in the written tests, but lose that advantage in the analysis of their curriculum vitae and the interview, evidencing a high interference by local authorities in those results. We conclude that a change in management and valuation, as in the administration of both activities, delegating in independent institutions increase the efficiency.
A21|Selección adversa en la convocatoria docente para educación primaria, media y básica en Colombia|Resumen: Este artículo analiza la elección de docentes en educación básica y media en Colombia bajo un modelo de selección adversa. Se hace seguimiento a la situación salarial, al cambio institucional y a los resultados de uno de los concursos para Medellín. Los salarios relativos de vinculación a la carrera docente son competitivos, aunque los incentivos en el tiempo son exiguos. En la selección a los profesionales no docentes, les va relativamente mejor en las pruebas escritas pero pierden dicha ventaja al evaluar la hoja de vida y la entrevista, evidenciando una alta injerencia de las autoridades territoriales. Se concluye que un cambio, tanto en la ordenación y valoración, como en la administración de ambas actividades delegándolas en instituciones independientes, aumentaría la eficiencia.

Entre los resultados más destacados, se encuentra que aproximadamente el 34% de la población estudiantil ha aplazado semestres, principalmente por motivos económicos. En este sentido, los estudiantes financian su carrera básicamente por medio de recursos familiares y propios. Igualmente, se evidencia que el 76% de la población estudiantil labora. Adicionalmente, se identifica que una de las principales motivaciones para entrar a estudiar economía es la conveniencia laboral. Por otro lado, la mayoría de estudiantes presentan un PGA inferior a 3,8 y se encuentra que en las áreas nucleares es donde se presenta menor PGA. Finalmente, se realiza un análisis de algunos factores intrínsecos a los estudiantes que podrían incidir en su desempeño académico."
A21|Financing Education And Development In Eritrea – Some Implications|Education has long been recognized as a central element in development. The human capital formation is receiving increased attention from policy makers and scholars in different parts of the world particularly in developing countries. Eritrea is a newly born nation in Africa and is striving hard to develop its higher education. An attempt is made in this paper to analyze the sources of finance, the strategies and challenges for higher educational development in the country. Furthermore, the paper also delves the development of higher education in the country since independence. The paper provides some implications for the for the policy purpose to develop higher education so as to curb the use of expatriate manpower in different sectors of the economy.
A21|Münsteraner Ernährungsmuster- und Lebensstilstudie bei Schulkindern: MEALS 2006|A school study of food pattern and life styles of more than 900 pre-college pupils aged 10 to 16 years in Münster, Germany shows that the participants, according to the recommendations of the Dortmund Research Institute of Child Nutrition, nourish themselves in no more than a marginally acceptable manner. The everyday consumption of fruit as well as of meat, meat products and potatoes several times a week is favourable. Conversely, the low consumption of fish, vegetables, wholemeal bread and milk products, as well as the high consumption of sweets, is unfavourable. These results largely confirm other, especially representative, German studies. Every second child establishes its life style long before its 13th birthday. The four empirically-identified life styles can be separated by the food patterns. Family-centred children have comparatively favourable consumption patterns, outdoor & sociable youth and sport & leisure/culture-oriented youth have acceptable food patterns, while multimedia kids prefer unhealthy food and refuse healthy food more than other children. Furthermore a link is evident between life style and individual perceptions of self-sufficiency. The connection is positive for outdoor & sociable youth and sport & leisure/culture-oriented youth who perceive themselves as exceptionally self-sufficient. Family-centred children and multimedia kids often perceive themselves as less self-sufficient. This seems more problematic with multimedia kids, because they also have the most unhealthy food patterns. The results confirm the fact that explicit consumption-related and food-related education should commence not only when the children are about 12 years old, but take place in all classes and school forms and in the form of a separate and distinct subject.

A21|L'impact du Printemps arabe sur les transferts de fonds des migrants tunisiens|Le phÃ©nomÃ¨ne migratoire suscite un dÃ©bat passionnÃ© au sein de la classe politique, comme dans la communautÃ© scientifique, aussi bien dans les pays d'accueil, que dans les pays d'origine. Sans doute ceci est-il dÃ» au fait qu'il touche Ã plusieurs aspects : humains, Ã©conomiques, sociaux ou financiers (Makhlouf, 2013). La question de la contribution des populations immigrÃ©es Ã l'Ã©conomie des pays d'accueil gagne en audience dans le dÃ©bat public des pays concernÃ©s. Dans la littÃ©rature Ã©galement, les Ã©tudes sont nombreuses sur les dÃ©terminants des transferts de fonds et leur impact sur l'Ã©conomie des pays d'origine. L'infl uence des facteurs internes au pays d'origine sur les transferts de fonds des migrants continue de susciter la curiositÃ©. En effet, dÃ©terminer l'effet d'Ã©vÃ©nements politiques ou sociaux majeurs dans leur pays d'origine sur les migrants n'est pas chose aisÃ©e. Si l'on peut postuler que les migrants sont sensibles Ã un choc survenu dans leur pays d'origine, par exemple le Printemps arabe, il est plus difficile d'en conclure que cette empathie les conduit inÃ©luctablement Ã modifier leur comportement en matiÃ¨re de transfert de fond.
A21|Taschengeld und Sparverhalten bei Grundschulkindern: eine empirische Untersuchung in Nordwestdeutschland|This working paper presents the results of a survey of 330 schoolchildren from three primary schools in small rural towns in North-Rhine Westfalia and Lower Saxony. The questions dealt with pocket money and savings behaviour and the data related to two main issues. Firstly, a measure was made to the extent to which the investigated families apply the central recommendations of pocket money pedagogy. Secondly, the data was considered in the context of the established attitudinal-behavioural models. The results reveal that approximately 80 % of the children receive pocket money regularly. The average weekly amount is EUR 2.29, with a standard deviation of EUR 1.61. Within the attitude-behaviour-framework, a relationship was proven between the perceived behavioural control of the children and their ability to come out with the pocket money. This results supplements and confirms analogous findings from health didactics, in which strengthening the self esteem of children has emerged a central pillar of prevention of unhealthy behaviour.
A21|La démocratisation de l'enseignement en France et ses répercussions en termes de taux de rendement sur le marché du travail|This study focus on the impact of the schooling massification on the rate of return to schooling in France during the period 1983 to 2002. Moreover, it allows us to make a statement on the advancement of econometric methods that have been developed during the past fifty years. In this way, we explain why it is essential for us to introduce implicit and explicit costs, taxes on wages or the probability of unemployment, which differs according to schooling attainment. When we take into account these several elements, the rate of return of High School degree decreases until 1990. He is now negative around -3% contrary to the return to college who converge to 8%. The schooling democratization seems to lead to a depreciation of the High School degree. It gives birth to a new period compartmentalizing individuals who continue school in college or not in two distinct classes.
A21|Education in Post-Independent Eritrea – A Brief Description|Education is an important pillar in the national economic development. It contributes to economic growth in varied forms. The educational system in Eritrea shows all the symptoms of prolonged neglect under colonialism and war. But education plays a key role in the development after independence. This paper discusses educational growth and development in post-independent Eritrea. It also analyses educational finances, and challenges for development in the country and thus provides some implications.
A21|Transições e Pontos Críticos das Trajectórias de Escolaridade: Estudo de Caso em seis Escolas Secundárias da Grande Lisboa<BR>[Transition and Turning Points in Scholar Trajectories: Case Study with Six Lisbon Upper Secondary Schools]|Abstract: Analyses concerning success and failure during Upper Secondary usually do not rely upon individual longitudinal data as we do in the present paper. Neither do they generally use that kind of data when trying to assess two among the most important scholar turning points as the transition from the Lower Secondary and the entry into the University. In our perspective this represents an important caveat as success and failure being dynamic processes can only be correctly addressed with data sensitive to time interdependencies. In this paper we had access, throughout a specific survey, to longitudinal data relative to 530 students from six Upper Secondary schools in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. Accordingly we were able to adjust a life-cycle segment’s model and depict either the “school effect” – actually the main purpose in this research – and the influences exerted by the social and economic status of the students’ family and by each one’s previous scholar trajectory as well. For that purpose we subdivided the work sample into two reciprocal control subgroups according to school´s social and economic environment and performed both contingency and discriminant statistical analyses. As main conclusions we obtained the relevance of the “school effect” especially in what has to do with success between inter cycles transitions. And the importance displayed firstly by mothers’ and fathers’ school level and by students’ relative success during previous schooling. A gender effect which we had admitted at the beginning could not be proved in the ligh
A21|Does School Improve Equity? Some Key Findings from Portuguese Data|"Does School Improve Equity? ABSTRACT Most school inequality research usually emphasize the role played by pupils' family social, cultural and economic condition, their parents' educational achievement, previous own school story and gender, among other factors. Despite also considering these same determinants, our main purpose in this paper had to do with assessing the specific role played both directly and indirectly by the ""school effect"" upon pupils' scholar trajectories; and thereby trying to investigate how far does school alleviate or reinforce the other factors inequality outcomes. Therefore, we began by identifying the statistically meaningful variables on the basis of contingency analysis, then went on to investigate the joint influence exerted by those variables upon two different success/failure school outcomes. Finally, we applied discriminant with control analysis in order to assess the magnitude of ""school effect"" throughout its diverse intervention forms along school course. We concluded that Portuguese secondary school actually amplifies both the vicious and the virtuous cycles generated by the other inequality variables, depending mostly on school characteristics themselves and possibly with their interaction with surrounding area characteristics (author abstract)"
A21|The Apprenticeship System in Canada: Trends and Issues|This report provides an overview of the trends and issues related to the apprenticeship system in Canada. It first discusses theoretical perspectives on apprenticeship, then reviews the institutional features of apprenticeship systems in Canada and in other countries. The report concludes that the market for apprenticeship is principally constrained by employer demand rather than by the supply of potential apprentices. Consequently, it proposes reforms based on three main principles: apprenticeship programs should focus on improving the quality rather than the quantity of potential apprentices; financial incentives should be primarily directed towards firms; and strong apprenticeship sectoral committees are important in improving apprenticeship training and helping employers make investments in apprentices.
A21|Financing Of Education In Eritrea - A Case Study Of Zoba Maekel|Educational investment is an engine of economic development in Eritrea and thus financing education is like a blood to human body; while this is widely accepted, little empirical research has been conducted on the topic. This paper analyses patterns of educational finances in secondary education in Eritrea particularly in the zoba –Maekel. It presents data on selected secondary schools in zoba and other related data tables with the results observed. It also provides the pattern of financing both from public and other related non-governmental organistions. The paper consists of four parts; the first part deals with the introduction, second part explains the cost and financing of education and training in Eritrea, third section provides education expenditure norms and procedures and the final section summarizes the results and concludes.
A21|Market Power in Interactive Environmental and Energy Markets: The case of Green Certificates|Markets for environmental externalities are typically closely related to the markets causing such externalities, whereupon strategic interactions may result. Along these lines, the market for Green Certificates is strongly interwoven in the electricity market as the producers of green electricity are also suppliers of Green Certificates. In this paper, we formulate an analytic equilibrium model for simultaneously functioning electricity and Green Certificates markets, and focus on the role of market power. We consider two versions of a Nash-Cournot game; a standard Nash-Cournot game where the players treat the market for Green Certificates and the electricity market as separate markets; and a Nash-Cournot game with endogenous treatment of the interaction between the electricity and Green Certificates markets with conjectured responses. One result is that a certificate system faced with market power may collapse into a system of per unit subsidies, as the producers involved start to game on the joint functioning of markets.
A21|School Failure and Intergenerational “Human Capital” Transmission in Portugal|School Failure and Intergenerational Human Capital Transmission… ABSTRACT A new education reform is about to be passed into Law, in Portugal, the extension of compulsory education until the 12th grade being one of the main goals. Given huge value school failure indicators (e.g., illiteracy rates, drop-outs, retention rates) still exhibit for Portuguese education system, we keep large doubts on the effectiveness of such an aim. Moreover, education outcomes inertia between generations appears to be strong, in the light of some indirect indicators, although no recent specific research has been addressing such an issue. In this paper we therefore try to shed some light on the potential impact intergenerational school achievement would exert upon actual school failing and also control for possible endogeneity both with students' own previous trajectory indicators and school effect. For that purpose, we rely on 2003 data relative to Lisbon Metropolitan Area four schools as case studies (author abstract)
A21|Economic education as public policy: the determinants of state-level mandates|This paper presents an empirical examination of the factors that influence a state's decision to mandate the teaching of economics within the K-12 curriculum. 38 states currently require some form of economics instruction within their approved curriculum. A binary choice probit model was estimated to determine the relationship between a variety of socioeconomic, political and policy environment variables in the decision to implement and maintain an economic education mandate. The results indicate that the number of university-based centers for economic education and the number of parents belonging to state parent-teacher associations positively affect the mandate choice. The incidence of poverty was found to be negatively associated with a state's requirement to include economics within the curriculum. These and other results highlight the need for additional research into the aggregate effects of required investments in economic human capital.

A21|Economic Education in U.S. High Schools|The teaching of economics at the high school level is vital for increasing basic economic literacy. This assessment of high school economics in the United States covers seven topics: enrollments in courses; course content; the testing of students; achievement in economics courses; economics instruction in related courses; teacher preparation for economics instruction; and the contributions from organizations and economists. Significant improvements are found in the teaching, content, and testing of high school economics over the past two decades, but more work is needed because a formal course in economics is taken by less than half of high school graduates.
A21|Economic Education for At-Risk Students: An Evaluation of Choices & Changes|This paper presents an evaluation of Choices & Changes , an economics education program designed to teach â€œat-riskâ€ children in elementary and junior high school that they can control their future by making wise choices and investing in themselves. Using program-specific instruments and a national sample of approximately 1600 students, a controlled experiment was conducted to determine the effect of Choices & Changes on student learning and attitudes. The experimental data were analyzed using a simultaneous model estimated by 2SLS with correction for self-selection due to sample attrition between pre- and post-test observations. The results indicate that Choices & Changes had a positive effect on economic understanding for each grade level examined, ceteris paribus. Significant positive effects on attitudes were found in only one of the four student groups. These findings suggest that Choices & Changes is meeting its short-run objective of producing cognitive understanding of economic concepts and that the attitudes of at-risk students can be altered but may require additional intervention.
A21|Economic Literacy or Economic Ideology?|The Test of Economic Literacy (TEL), is a standardized multiple choice test developed under the auspices of the Joint Council on Economic Education with esteemed economists in an advisory role. The Test of Economic Literacy (TEL) is administered in many high school economics courses both to measure economic understanding and to monitor the effectiveness of teaching. We found that some of the questions in the test have a pronounced ideological slant. We view the biases in the TEL as characteristic vices of economists. In their weaker moments, economists can slip into a thought pattern which glorifies laissez-faire microeconomics while at the same time favoring Keynesian interventionist macroeconomics; this is precisely the bias of the TEL. The next two sections examine the ideological components of the microeconomics and macroeconomics respectively. For each part, we present a few of the questions and discuss their ideological content. For the micro part, we use the TEL data bank to analyze a matched sample of students who took the test before and after a course in economics. This empirical exercise allows us to address the questions in the title of the paper: what is taught and measured, literacy or ideology?
A21|A Flawed Ideological Critique|In their critique of the Test of Economic Literacy (TEL), Nelson and Sheffrin draw the conclusion that the TEL is an ideological test. In making their case, however, they neglect to cite the TEL Examiner's Manual by John Soper and myself (1987). In the 67 pages of that achievement test manual are the multiple choice questions, written rationales for the correct answers, explanations of the test development and structure, psychometric data, item analysis, and instructions on test administration and use. This information is necessary for anyone making a careful assessment of the test or using it with high school students. A brief description of the development and major features of the TEL is also necessary for analyzing the critics' complaints about TEL questions. The TEL is not perfect, but the charge that the TEL is an ideological test, however, is an extreme one and without foundation.
