M16|Relocation in conditions of uncertainty: the Spanish automobile components industry during the economic crisis (2008-2012)|This paper analyses production relocation patterns in conditions of uncertainty. Analysis of the Spanish automobile components industry during the recent economic global crisis shows that the number of relocations was comparatively lower than in the period before the crisis. Uncertainty weighs more than the advantages derived from the operational flexibility of multinationals in relocation decisions. The main drivers of relocation in the sector are the search for lower labour costs and corporate restructuring. When there is uncertainty, these are conditioned by relocation costs and the risks inherent in such processes. The main implication of the research is that it helps identify the vulnerability of a region in relocation processes. This is key for defining public policies to prevent relocation and avoid its impact on regions that have traditionally suffered such processes.
M16|Estimating the Scope Elasticity of Multinational Firms: An Empirical Assessment|This paper offers an empirical assessment of the scope elasticity of multinational activity at the world level. By scope elasticity, we refer to the relationship between the productivity of the parent firm and the probability of operating in a given foreign market through subsidiaries with the same main activity. Elasticities are estimated for a baseline cross-section of 36 countries that represent 74% of total outward FDI investment at the world level. At the aggregate level, results indicate quite consistently, through various estimation methods, that a 10% increase in productivity of the parent firm increases the probability in a range between 0.8-1.5%. Elasticities for manufacturing more than double the elasticities for the service sector. The paper also explores the heterogeneity of scope elasticities across home countries and sectors. This heterogeneity is related to differences across bilateral home-host country characteristics such as the size of the potential host market, bilateral distance, average tariff, institutional quality of host countries and other factors. The signs attached to these factors are in general consistent with the predictions of models of firm heterogeneity and FDI activity. Once heterogeneity and survey biases are controlled, scope elasticities reduce somewhat.
M16|Effects of Hofstede?s Cultural Factors and Commitment on IJV Performance in ASEAN Country of Thailand|This study focuses on the effect of Hofstede?s cultural characteristics and commitment on international joint ventures (IJVs) performance in the Southeast Asian country context. The study has been provided the unpublished database of international joint venture (IJV) firms operating in Thailand from Thailand Board of Investment. The mail survey via questionnaire has been used as data collection method to obtain data from 89 target respondents, IJV managers. OLS regression is the main data analysis method of the study. The results indicate that all Hofstede?s cultural characteristics of IJV managers have no direct significant effect on awareness of IJV importance, but individualism and power distance have been found the significant effect on commitment. Uncertainty avoidance and power distance directly and positively impact on team performance. Interestingly, power distance has negatively effect on the IJV performance. In addition, the study can find the partial mediating effect of awareness of IJV importance mediating the association between Hofstede?s cultural characteristics and commitment, however, the moderating role of team commonality cannot be found. These results suggest that effective IJV managers have to effectively and efficiently manage the relationships, attempt to boost the commitment and the awareness of IJV importance, and robustly synergize the strengths among managers that come from different cultural background in order to successfully create better coordination and performance for organization.
M16|Business Strategy as a Mediation of Management Capabilities and Entrepreneurial Orientation in Business Performance|Objective – This article aims to analyze the influence of mediating Business Strategy variables on Management Capabilities (MC) and Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO) toward Business Performance. Methodology/Technique – This study was conducted on group of students of Economics and Business Department who practiced as entrepreneurs, using Path Analysis (Amos,18.0). Findings – The results of the analysis show that the management capabilities do not support the indirect influence of business strategies on business performance. However, entrepreneurial orientation supports the indirect influence of business strategies on business performance. Meanwhile, management capabilities have a significant direct effect on business performance. Novelty – Without going through a business strategy, entrepreneurial orientation does not have a significant direct effect on business performance, because business strategy supports business performance or direct influence. Type of Paper: Empirical
M16|Effects of Tourists' Trust on Behaviour Intention in the Thai Tourism Market: Mediating Effects of Perceived Authenticity|Objective - The increasing growth of the Thai tourism market has resulted in international tourists flooding into Thailand and providing significant economic benefits for the country's tourism development. The purpose of this research is to examine a comprehensive model for Thai tourism. This study aims to investigate how tourists' trust can enhance their behaviour intentions in travelling to Thailand through perceived authenticity. Methodology/Technique - The research tests a model linking trust to authenticity, and behaviour intention to current Thai tourism. Using a convenience sampling method, a sample of 453 international Asian tourists who travelled to Thailand were surveyed. Finding - The findings show that different levels of trust directly influence tourists' behavioural intentions, trust influences perceived authenticity, perceived authenticity further affects behaviour intention, and perceived authenticity mediates the relationship between tourists' trust and their behavioural intention. Moreover, demographic factors moderate the effects of trust on tourists' perceived authenticity. Novelty – The present research is expected to clarify the potential research topics in the field of Thai tourism development. Type of Paper - Empirical.
M16|Corporate Foresight In The Strategy Of Multinationals|The purpose of this paper is to explore corporate foresight as a new important instrument within strategic management system of multinational corporations (MNCs). The author directly connects the recent rise of corporate foresight with MNCs’ growing need to fill the gaps of traditional corporate strategic management, struggling with the challenges of today’s global turbulent business-environment (known as VUCA world characterized by unprecedented volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity). From this perspective corporate foresight is capable to provide a number of viable responses. They include significant expansion of the horizon of MNCs’ long-term future vision, enhanced capabilities of business-environment scanning (identifying not only clearly visible trends but the so-called weak signals as well) and strengthening intra-firm communications in the course of strategy development process, thus contributing to the implementation capacity of multinational corporate team. Within analysis of actual corporate foresight practices of major multinationals special attention is attached to the common features of foresight organization (standard process phases, typical set of methods used) and peculiarities related mainly to different MNCs’ sector-specific environment characteristics, including complexity and dynamics of change. The attempt is also made to disclose the actual impact of corporate foresight activities on the effectiveness of the key functions of MNCs’ strategic management. The author draws the conclusion that corporate foresight is becoming a core element of the strategic management architecture of multinational business, striving to protect and strengthen its global market positioning in increasingly turbulent and unpredictable environment. For MNCs’ top management, trying to find the right strategic course in radically changing competitive landscape, this powerful tool is increasingly playing the same role as GPS navigator for car drivers.
M16|The roots of Spanish banking internationalisation: BBVA and Santander|Since the 1990s, BBVA and Banco Santander have undergone a huge transformation; they have gone from being two of the largest Spanish banks to two of the world’s biggest. Although the internationalisation process intensified from the 1990s on, some of the banks that were merged to form BBVA and Banco Santander had a previous history of internationalisation. This paper addresses two main issues. Firstly, we explore why Spanish banks internationalise and why Latin America has been the main region of expansion for these two banks. Secondly, we examine how Spanish banks internationalise and how BBVA and Santander adopted different internationalisation strategies. To that end, the paper examines the roots of international expansion and explains the main changes occurring in the 1990s that encouraged the internationalisation process of both banks.
M16|Model of Strengthening the Entrepreneurship Character through Entrepreneurship Commitment|Objective - This study aims to determine the relationship between entrepreneurship character with entrepreneurship commitment. Methodology/Technique - 87 randomly selected undergraduate students studying Business Economics at the As-Syafi'iyah Islamic University Jakarta are surveyed and the data is analyzed using descriptive analysis, correlation and regression methods. Findings - The results show that entrepreneurship commitment has a strong positive influence on entrepreneurship character (0.66). Entrepreneurship commitment is therefore an important instrument to strengthen the character of entrepreneurship. Further, strengthening the character of entrepreneurship can be predicted by entrepreneurship commitment using a simple regression model: Y = 0,658 + 0,823 X. Novelty - In addition, the contribution of entrepreneurship commitment towards the formation of character of entrepreneurship is 44%, with factors such as discipline, perseverance, honesty, fighting power etc. contributing the remaining 56%.
M16|Control Systems and Strategy: A Literature Review|Objective - Organisational change necessarily requires an adaptation of a company's information structure, particularly its Management Accounting and Control Systems (MACSs). These systems should be designed according to the defined strategies to assist managers in the decision-making process. This paper reviews research that analyzes the MACSs concept and the elements that characterise it, so that it may be used to identify and characterise the existing systems in any company. Methodology/Technique - Based on a contingency approach to management, the authors perform a broad literature review. Among other aspects, MACS information outputs will be analyzed in terms of the style of use, its nature and the type of decisions supported. In an attempt to broaden the scope of MACS functions, this paper reviews the present literature and provides a theoretical framework for studying the operationalization of MACS. Findings - The results obtained indicate that the operationalization of the MACS concept can be achieved through the way information is managed and characterised, establishing three categories and six different dimensions. Novelty - Theoretically, this framework characterises the existing MACS concept to analyse its impact on company strategy. The authors conclude that knowledge on the relationship between MCAS and strategy is limited, providing considerable scope for further research. In the future, the authors intend to develop a case study to analyse the impact of this framework on companies' internationalisation strategy.
M16|Pull factors driving Russian multinationals into five CEE countries, a sectoral overview|Investigating the Russian economic footprint through outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) and the activities of Russian multinationals has not become either outdated or less interesting, even though, understandably, most of the current attention on Russian influence in Europe has been focused on direct interference in political affairs. This paper is the second of a four-part series that outlines the international expansion of Russian multinationals in five EU-member Central and East European (CEE) states, i.e., the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Here, the focus is on the pull factors responsible for Russian FDI inflows into these countries, as well as on the sectors in which investments are made. In doing so, the research relies on company data analysed using Dunning’s eclectic paradigm of international production and his typology of four motives behind FDI. We find that most Russian FDI has been done in hydrocarbons, iron, steel and machinery, but banking, software solutions, electronic production, real estate and even the light industry have also been targeted. Investment is dominated by market-seeking and, to a lesser extent, efficiency-seeking projects carried out by state-owned or state-related private firms. There are a limited number of innovative private Russian companies on the market that show features similar to those of multinationals from developed countries.
M16|Factors Affecting Variation in SMES' Export Intensity|Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are more constrained to participate in export market than their large counterparts despite various export assistance provision by the government. Extant literature on SME internationalization mostly focus more on how non-exporting SMEs can become exporters than on how exporting SMEs can sustain and expand their export. This study aims to investigate the factors affecting SMEs’ export intensity with reference to the case of Indonesia. Fractional-logit regressions were used to identify the inﬂuence of export-exhibiting factors, export-inhibiting factors, and ﬁrm and owner characteristics on SMEs’ export intensity. The evidences were collected from 497 SMEs in seven provinces in Jawa, Madura and Bali regions. The ﬁndings show that SMEs’ export intensity is affected by some ﬁrm characteristics including ﬁrm age and total employees. Export intensity is also affected by some exhibiting factors including owners’ overseas and MNC/exporting ﬁrm work experience, central government agencies’ assistance, network relationships with non-government actors, location, export market of choices and years of exporting. By contrast, export intensity is adversely affected by perceived difﬁculties in overcoming informational and human resources barriers, distribution, logistics and promotional barriers, ﬁnancial barriers, foreign government barriers, procedural barriers and price barriers. The policy and managerial implications of the ﬁndings are discussed.
M16|Approccio al mercato cinese del turismo (Approaching the Chinese tourism market)|The outbound Chinese tourism market is relatively recent. The purpose of this work is to draw attention on this phenomenon and its characteristics. Specific attention is devoted to identify the future opportunities connected and the critical issues related to the definition of a strategy for attracting this type of tourists in Italy.
M16|Argo Tractors: un caso di reshoring di successo (Argo Tractors: a successful reshoring case)|Scholars and policy makers are devoting increasing attention to reshoring. This phenomenon can be defined as the decision to relocate back to the home-country the company’s activities previously offshored. Reshoring can be explained by the pursuit of different types of benefits, not only economic, and calls for research to understand better the connected risks, opportunities, and implications. This work aims to investigate a specific case of reshoring developed by a well-known Italian company, operating in the agro-mechanical industry, which decided to relocate all its activities back to Italy.
M16|The Review of Language Studies in International Business: Suggestions and Future Directions for Japan|We conduct a systematic and narrative review of the literature in the area of language studies in international business (IB). Our contributions seek to outline the research of language in IB both in Western countries and in Japan. Moreover, we aim to open up the debate of language studies in IB in Japan as the most important contribution; we offer suggestions for future research in Japan based on prior studies and discuss managerial implications for Japanese corporations. The pertinent literature we use in this paper is based on chronological and categorical turns, by dividing language studies in IB into three stages: infancy, toddler and preschool stages.
M16|The Concept of Cockroach Theory of Sustainable and Scalable Organizational and Individual Growth|The question of survival and sustenance is very critical for every individual or organization. There are various factors that are essential for growth and sustenance of companies. There have been many research studies undertaken to gauge the success factors or to break down the components and study success in detail. Since Prahalad and Hart propounded the need for multinationals to serve the large base of the pyramid markets, which could be done profitably and need not be left only to government and aided agencies, many multinationals across the world have been made significant steps in reaching out to these markets especially in emerging economies. In these strategies, there have been some successes and many failures. In previous papers we have studied many such strategies and we have proposed a “theory of sustainable and scalable growth for organizations and individuals” also called the “Cockroach theory”.
M16|Repercussions of International Trade on the Market Power of Firms in Different Market Structures|The purpose of this paper is to provide an introduction of market power in different market structures and how this market power diminishes because of international trade and the effects on welfare. A review of relevant literature from Pugel (2012), McConnel Bruce and Flynn (2012) and Bernheim and Winston (2014) provides the effects of international trade on the market power conditions in different market structures and the effects on welfare. Asprilla, Berman, Cadot and Jaud (2016), Devereux and Lee (2001) and Krugman (1994) serve to provide further evidence through PTM literature, bilateral exchange rate shocks and protectionism.
M16|Post-Entry Performance of International New Ventures: The Mediating Role of Learning Orientation|This paper investigates the role of learning orientation in the post-entry performance of international new ventures (INVs) by examining the relationships of niche strategy, network resources, and learning orientation with the multi-dimensional post-entry performance of INVs. Based on the INV internationalisation literature, we develop and validate a conceptual model using a sample of 147 INVs from two relatively small and open economies from New Zealand and Australia. The results show that learning orientation of INVs positively mediates the relationship between niche orientation and network resources and INVs' post-entry performance. Our study indicates that learning orientation may be an important capability through which INVs' focused international business strategies and resources (e.g., niche orientation and network resources) may influence their multi-dimensional post-entry performance in terms of operational, financial and overall effectiveness measures. We draw key implications for research on INVs' post-entry behaviour by explicating the role played by the firms' learning capabilities, and how these capabilities may interact with their strategies and resources in enhancing the post-entry performance of INVs.
M16|An Empirical Review of the Integrated Tourism and Leisure Enterprise on Corporate Social Responsibility Engagements - The Macao Context|As the global business platform has accelerated innovative competitive advantage to a new frontier, more countries and organizations engage corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices, both public organizations and private enterprises penetrate deeper philosophy with enhanced understanding to reinforce the CSR for one?s long-term sustainable development in the global market environment. Corporate social responsibility has been nurtured for more than a few decades. It has been taken long tail period to develop from intangible ideology to the current status with popular general acceptance by broad stakeholders. As the well-off developed nations and countries have cascaded to the developing regions to proceed the latent CSR, it is denoted that the execution of such good intent is inherent to particular local conditions to interpret its unique corporate social responsibility dimensions and perspectives. In this empirical study, the research aims to inquire and assess the dimensions and experience of the integrated tourism and leisure enterprise (ITLE) in Macao on CSR and their effects. The research methodology adopted a combined approach. The qualitative content analysis draws on data from real-time seminar presentation reporting of the six gaming and leisure enterprises and an interview. One of the findings is that the government deemed having a key role to impact CSR engagements in an evolving contextual environment. Another finding is that the developing region may display an outside-in management perspective with shifting pattern CSR initiatives to share discretionary corporate management reporting. The research result provides researchers evaluative angles to gain pertinent understanding and aggregate insights to alert CSR directions for Macao. It also provides a snapshot of the future strategic CSR management development angles to advocate Macao towards a world-class leisure and resort tourism hub. The research results add understanding of the practical knowledge to the contextual CSR engagement and implication. Future research is proposed for the mixed method in order to comprehend and track sustainable CSR development under the hybrid competitive environment. The research concludes with business marketing and management implications.
M16|Expatriate managerial adjustment in the United Arab Emirates: antecedents and consequences|International workforce mobility is worldwide. Expatriates bring skills and new perspectives that can enhance organizational performance. Dealing positively with these workers is important to improve their performance, particularly given the risk of maladjustment they may experience from a new culture.The purpose of this study is to (a) determine the influences contributing to expatriate adjustment in the UAE, (b) ascertain constructive influences such as social networking, work and life satisfaction, and personal growth, and undesirable influences such as stress and adjustment issues, and (c) identify how employers and communities can better support expatriates.We will produce two versions of the findings. The first will be an extended version containing interview summaries, survey results and conclusions based on our hypotheses. The second will take the form of an executive summary useful to practitioners, and containing recommendations for expatriates, HR professionals and related personnel. This summary will assist organizations to better understand the experiences of expatriates, enabling the introduction of better supporting frameworks.In summary, we will use our findings and recommendations to develop awareness of the issues expatriates face and encourage more effective use of the resources and perspectives they bring. For example, the results of this study may be useful as a counterpoint to the policy of Emiratization which seeks to limit the hiring of foreign workers, even those with valuable skills, knowledge or experience. Expatriates in the UAE or other Middle Eastern nations and prospective expatriates, managers and HR practitioners in organizations employing expatriates, UAE government policy developers and community leaders will all find the outcomes of this study beneficial.The study is quantitative in nature, employing between 350 and 550 questionnaires. Intended participants, to be selected by random sampling, would be targeted based on their non-Arab background, language difficulties, and their length of tenure in their UAE organization. A pilot survey of approximately 50 to 75 questionnaires will be used to improve the research instrument?s validity and reliability. Government representatives will be included as they are the intended beneficiaries of this research, thus enhancing the possibility of including in government policy the insights gained. Various media platforms such as websites can be used to disseminate the results to potential expatriates and their employers as a component of the outreach program. University facilities will be use to conduct the study. This research will be strengthened through gaining feedback at conferences within the next two years, with a view to subsequently publishing the findings.
M16|Host Population Perceptions Of Sporting Events|The purpose of this research was to investigate perceptions of people who live around The Rajamangala National Stadium regarding sporting events impact on the community. The Rajamangala National Stadium is the national stadium of Thailand and the home stadium for the Thailand national football team. It is part of the HuaMak Sports Complex, locate in HuaMak Subdistrict, BangKapi, Bangkok. Host population perceptions were measured through a two-page self-completed questionnaire written in Thai, administered to a sample of 400 residents of the district of Bangkapi (population 67,931 members) in Bangkok, Thailand. Resident questionnaires were distributed within 2 months, August ? October 2017. The questionnaire comprised 27 questions. The first part aimed to identify awareness of event being staged. The second part contained 2 Open ended questions designed to find out how sporting event effect community, positive and negative impacts, with 8 items measure of residents? perceptions of impact. These items related to personal quality of life, quality of life of community, sense of community and community pride. The final part included questions relate to involvement characteristics of respondents; attend sporting events in year 2017 or previous years, level of interest in event, type of involvement in event by respondent or household member, distance from house, and socio-demographic data. Once collected, all data were entered into SPSS version 15.0 for further analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the subjects and the perceived impacts of sporting events. Because of qualitative approach, the findings were described the central position of a frequency distribution for a group of data by mode. Mode is the number that occurs most often in a set of numbers. The results presented by descriptive with percentage in the form of tables, and text. We found both positive and negative impacts of sporting events performance on the community. The findings were identified as seven main positive impacts and six main negative impacts. These impacts related to economic, social and environmental of the community. The directions for future sporting events research on environmental studies: impact and evaluation studies including sustainability and greening of sporting events such as reducing garbage. More research on consequences of sporting events effect local culture community.
M16|Industrial Products and Shift in Value chain ? Perspectives behind innovation policy|To get to a final industrial product the consequent value chain always involves changes from left ? the basic raw materials to the right- the final product .Not getting into the technological nitty gritty this paper is an humble attempt to understand this shift in value chain of an industrial product with aspects like export portfolio and national innovation systems of different countries. This paper has tried to build up the narrative of ( Ling & Tang ,2009) by revisiting their perspectives with aspects like innovation systems and export portfolio .On this basis an attempt has been made to conceptualise a pertinent innovation policy of different category of countries based on economic and other factors. The aim of this paper is to help in the process of understanding of optimum innovation policies through various assorted aspects which can be interlinked with various innovation activities of a country.
M16|Automotive industry in the Visegrad Group|The article is focused on the current situation of automotive industry in the Visegrad Group. The main goal of the article is to analyze the current situation and define the major aspects of automotive industry in V4 countries. The main sources for the article are secondary data gained from publicly available databases. Analyses rely on basic macroeconomic indicators of V4 countries in comparison with German economy as the main leader of automotive industry in Europe. In the comparison of national?s automotive industries are used following indicators: GDP, GDP per capita, unemployment rate, GVA and turnover of automotive industry, Capital Expenditures and vehicles production. All the informations were acquired from well-known and recognized national, European and other international institutions. The result of the analysis is a compact view of automotive industry?s significance in V4 countries, which is according to initial assumption very high. One of the partial outcomes of the analysis is also a finding proving lack of relevance of some indicators frequently used as a sole scale for automotive industry importance. This have been proven especially on the absolute number of produced vehicles, which doesn?t have to describe the capability of national automotive industry in a relevant way. The article also contains recommendations for further research in this field.
M16|Knowledge management in Interreg cross-border cooperation: A project perspective|"The management of knowledge in projects delivers benefits, while the im-plementation of knowledge management is challenged by (project-specific) issues. Based on practice in interorganizational, cross-border projects funded by the Interreg South Baltic Programme (SBP), this paper analyses the potential value and hindrances of knowledge management in projects funded within Interreg programs. The SBP mentions repeatedly ""Transfer of knowledge and exchange of good practices"" as an example activity in the program manual (Interreg South Baltic Programme 2016b, pp. 13, 25, 34, 38), however, dedicated knowledge management processes, tools or plans are not part of the com-pulsory application for funding nor its assessment. Knowledge management (KM) can provide value at different levels: to individuals, project partner organisations, the entire programme and even cross-programme as well as other project stakeholders. While KM can support strategy towards building competitive advantage in the programme region, KM processes can enhance the efficiency of project implementation. Worth noting is the impact of KM on individual motivation both for joining a project and for contributing to knowledge exchange. [...]"
M16|Factors Influencing SMEs Engagement in Direct Export Activities|The benefits of trade liberalisation are not shared equally among countries and enterprises across the globe. Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries are less able to participate in export market than their large counterparts despite various export assistance provision by the government. This study aims to investigate the factors influencing Indonesian SMEs decision and ability to engage in direct exporting activities. The evidences were collected from 271 exporting SMEs and 226 non-exporting SMEs in seven provinces in Jawa, Madura, and Bali regions. Logistic regressions were used to identify the distinct characteristics of exporting SMEs. The findings show that the exporters differ from non-exporters in firm and owner characteristics, perceived export barriers, participation in government export assistances and network relationships. The policy and managerial implications of the findings are discussed
M16|Foreign acquisition and internal organization|We study the effect of foreign takeovers on firm organization. Using a comprehensive data set of Portuguese firms and workers spanning two decades, we find that foreign acquisitions lead to: (1) an expansion in the scale of operations; (2) a higher number of hierarchical layers; and (3) higher wage inequality between the top and bottom layers. These results accord with a theory of knowledge-based hierarchies in which foreign takeovers lead to improved productivity, higher demand, or reduced internal communication costs, and thereby induce the acquired firms to reorganize. Evidence from auxiliary survey data reveals that acquired firms are more likely to use information technologies that reduce internal communication costs.
M16|Firms’ Internalisation Theories – (non) applicability for Micro- and Small Enterprises in the Bulgarian Airfreight Forwarding Market|The article discusses aspects of the popularity of firms’ internationalisation theories and their (non)applicability among micro and small enterprises in the Bulgarian market. The theories of internationalisation are classified best practices of successfully internationalised companies. In an effort to create a universal theoretical model scientists move away, in one or another aspect, from the concrete: business situations in the companies, organizational management structures, the personality of the business leaders, the business culture, the relevant economic policy, the national business infrastructure and others. The increased turbulence and business dynamics after the advent of the Internet, changed the way of doing business and questioned the applicability for today’s business conditions in Bulgaria of a number of internationalisation theories. The answer to the question of (non) applicability is sought among internationalized, due to the nature of its activities, micro and small enterprises in the airfreight forwarders sector, through personal interviews of 26.7% of companies operating in Sofia Airport, during the Feb-Nov 2014 period.
M16|Omission bias under risks and Japanese companies stagnation in emerging markets: Managers f information gaps between head office and local office|This paper analyse the background of stagnation in the emerging market by Japanese companies. From the case study of the global strategy of Kokuyo Co.,Ltd. and questionnaires and interview surveys for Japanese companies, I found the possibility that managers f omission bias of head office prohibited decision making especially in situations where risks are strongly recognized. Resource allocation are required in noncontiguous market, but managers f omission bias prohibit entering innovation spiral through glearning by doing h. It is important to create a system with conscious of the bias elimination based on the decision theory.
M16|Functional and Linguistic Bridging in Multinational Corporations: Moderating Effect of Cultural Identity Integration|In this study, we explore the role of functional and linguistic bridging in multinational corporations (MNCs) using a sample of 200 Japanese employees working in Japanese overseas subsidiaries. We draw on the social network theory and Job Demands- Resources (JD-R) model to advocate the idea that bridging roles (functional and linguistic bridging) influence team-member exchange (TMX) and emotional exhaustion positively via the mediating role of occupational social capital and role conflict. We found that employees who possess low cultural identity integration were more versatile in moderating between a bridging role, team member relationships, and emotional outcomes. Our findings make a theoretical contribution in exploring bridging roles from both the positive and negative sides of international business. We suggest that although bridge individuals can lead to positive team member relationships, they can also signal emotional burnout stemming from role conflict. We also offer suggestions on how to recognize cultural identity integration as a resource in elaborating on bridging roles and mitigating negative emotional outcomes.
M16|Zastosowanie standardow spolecznej odpowiedzialnosci w Polsce i na swiecie|Research background: Spoleczna odpowiedzialnosc (SR – social responsibility) jest koncepcja zarzadzania, ktora ksztaltuje sie podobnie do zarzadzania jakoscia czy zarzadzania srodowiskowego. Jak kazda koncepcja posiada portfel narzedzi, ktore mozna wdrazac w organizacjach majacych potrzebe posluzenia sie dana koncepcja w swoich dzialaniach. W chwili obecnej katalog narzedzi SR stale sie rozrasta i ulega kolejnym modyfikacjom. Purpose of the article: Celem artykulu jest analiza zastosowania znormalizowanych narzedzi SR. Najpierw przyblizono istote SR oraz scharakteryzowano zestaw znormalizowanych narzedzi. Stan ich zastosowania poddano analizom empirycznym. Methodology/methods: Postawiono dwa pytania badawcze: Jak wyglada zastosowanie standardow SR na swiecie wedlug aktualnych danych? Jak wyglada zastosowanie standardow SR w poszczegolnych krajach oraz w Polsce wedlug aktualnych danych?Do odpowiedzi na powyzsze pytania posluzono sie oficjalnym danymi pochodzacymi od organizacji formalnie odpowiedzialnych za analizowane standardy, uznano je za wiarygodne i kompletne. Z uwagi na to, ze dane pochodza z roznych zrodel analizy maja charakter pogladowy. W analizach uwzgledniono ISO 14001, SA 8000, AA 1000AS i G4, nie uwzgledniono ISO 26000 ze wzgledu na charakter normy (nie przeznaczona do certyfikacji) i w zwiazku z tym brak odnosnych danych. Findings: Najczesciej stosowanym standardem SR jest ISO 14001, kolejne standardy sa juz duzo rzadziej stosowane. Z jednej strony to pocieszajace, ze dobrowolna norma z zakresu ochrony srodowiska jest relatywnie czesto stosowana, z drugiej jednak dziwi fakt, ze narzedzia z innych zakresow tematycznych (warunki pracy, raportowanie zrownowazonego rozwoju i stosunki z interesariuszami) maja znikome zastosowanie. Jezeli chodzi o zastosowanie znormalizowanych narzedzi SR w roznych krajach to widac silna tendencje wsrod krajow spoza rozwinietych i stabilnych gospodarek do stosowanie analizowanych narzedzi, swiadczy to o ich wiekszej motywacji do poprawy konkurencyjnosci z wykorzystaniem takze koncepcji SR. Niestety w Polsce taka tendencja nie istnieje a analizowane standardy praktycznie nie sa stosowane, pewnym wyjatkiem jest ISO 14001.
M16|The new automobile modular platforms: from the product architecture to the manufacturing network approach?|This paper analyses the key factors for the adoption of the new automobile modular platforms through an eclectic perspective linking the product architecture with the manufacturing network approach. An exploratory analysis of the European production networks of seven automobile manufacturers shows that the benefits of the modular platforms’ adoption depend on two factors: the degree of platform modularity and the manufacturing issues of each carmaker —product portfolio, production volumes and network size. The results indicate that the degree of modularity of the platform chosen should be aligned with the manufacturing issues; otherwise, benefits might not reach expectations<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
M16|Cultivating greater self-confidence in African management research|Although strategic management has taken root in many African organisations, much of the existing body of African management research offers little insight into the current state of knowledge and direction in terms of Africa finding its voice within the mainstream research. We draw on a review of the literature to develop a conceptual framework for classifying the contributions in African management research. The conceptual model captures the indigenous (intra-Africa) and inter-Africa dimension of macro-strategy and organisational behaviour/human resource research. The accumulated body of research indicates a sign of growing self-confidence in African management research which must be maintained and revitalised. The paper contributes to the literature by developing a unified conceptual model which captures both the indigenous and comparative dimensions of management research. A number of fruitful avenues for future research have been advanced.
M16|Human Capital Flows in Failing Organizations: An Integrated Conceptual Framework|Purpose – The paper examines the dynamics of human capital accumulation and human capital depletion in the processes leading to business failure. Design/methodology/approach – Building on the human capital theory, strategic human resource and business failure literature, this paper develops a conceptual framework which links the inward and outward dimensions of human capital flows in the business failure process. Findings – The analysis sheds light on why some highly skilled individuals may opt to flee declining firms to avoid being stigmatised whilst others become motivated to joint such firms. Research limitations/implications – The paper suggests that understanding the nature and dynamics of both flows are essential when seeking to avert collapse. Originality/value –In spite of a growing body of research on business failure and intense competition for top talent, much of the existing literature has circumvented the relationship between them. This study develops a unified model towards enhancing our understanding of the human capital flows.
M16|Knowledge Management Strategy To Improve Business Sector|Every organization needs the proper knowledge management (KM) strategy for its development. In the last decades, the business environment has changed and recently it became more dynamic and more complex. At present, KM is valuable not only for individuals, and organizations, but also for global humanity. So, the directors of the organizations must emphasize on the existing knowledge and try to develop them to achieve the competitive advantage. The purpose of the study is to explore the recent KM practice in the organizations and to show the ways to develop the new KM strategy in future. An attempt has been taken here to apply KM strategy in business performance, business intelligence, and e-business.
M16|The impact of home and host country institutions in the internationalization of an African multinational enterprise|We demonstrate that firms can exploit their knowledge of â€˜weakâ€™ institutional settings and turn it into a source of advantage as they internationalize into locations with similar institutional â€˜weaknesses.â€™ Using the case of one Africaâ€™s most successful multinational enterprises we illustrate the value gained from initially capitalizing upon institutional complementarity (utilizing the comparative advantage linked to institutional know-how) by exploiting the experience of the home countryâ€™s environment into similar settings. Over time and through learning-by-doing, pressure arose to diversify the risk linked with over-exposure to institutional uncertainty and country risk, and this was associated with the process of institutional substitution into more advanced countries. We see an emerging multinational learning and building its capabilities by leveraging off its understanding of its home country institutional environment.
M16|Is negotiating with Chinese for Eastern European businessmen a paradox or a coopetition?|The purpose of the paper is to assess how dynamic nature of culture impacts negotiation strategies. This paper focuses on changing cultural values in relationship management in the context of negotiations. We illustrate the cross-cultural differences and commonalities by applying multiple case study method. We have found that negotiations in China are contextually and geographically based and can differ substantially in terms of the location within China, industry, business partner characteristics, and nevertheless guanxi (i.e. relationships, acquaintances, etc.) you and your partner possess. Most of the interviewees claim that negotiations in China are very much connected with the hierarchy, which is usually tight to the age of the counterpart. The most important and the biggest decisions are always made only by the firm owner, if the firm is private, or the highest ranked businessman. It is important to know, that in formal business meetings Asians seldom show any emotions with the face gestures. More importantly, their negotiation strategies are changing in time, which confirms the dynamic nature of culture. The added value of this paper is putting negotiation strategies in the context of a new yin-yang school of culture. Opposed to Chinese-Western relationship studies that are dominating the negotiation literature, we offer insights to Chinese-Eastern Europe relationships with a common cultural history. In sum, paper draws on literature from two disciplines, international trade and business negotiations, extending the scope of research contribution.
M16|Internationalisierung im unternehmensnahen Dienstleistungssektor: Formen, Hemmnisse und Unterstützungsbedarfe deutscher KMU|Dienstleistungen werden handelsbeschränkende Eigenschaften zugeschrieben wie beispielsweise hohe Erklärungsbedürftigkeit, geringe Standardisierbarkeit und die Interaktion zwischen Erbringer und Empfänger. Ebenso lassen die begrenzten Ressourcen in KMU ein niedriges Niveau an Handelsaktivitäten im Dienstleistungssektor erwarten. Der Beitrag untersucht den Einfluss dieser Faktoren auf die Internationalisierung im unternehmensnahen Dienstleistungssektor auf der Basis von Experteninterviews. Danach führt der Aufwand einer grenzüberschreitenden Geschäftsanbahnung und Informationsgewinnung, in Kombination mit einer fehlenden strategischen Ausrichtung auf das Ausland, zu negativen Rentabilitätserwartungen. Folglich unterbleibt die Internationalisierung häufig. Der Aufwand steigt wegen länderspezifischen Rahmenbedingungen (öffentlich und marktseitig). Eine handelsfreundliche Ausgestaltung internationaler Rahmenbedingungen ist daher zu empfehlen.
M16|Kennzahlenmanagement und -controlling: Prozessorientiertes Performance Management in internationalen Unternehmen|Wenn prozessorientiertes Performance Management in nationalen Unternehmen und in internationalen Unternehmen gleich ausgeprägt ist, können viele Synergieeffekte erreicht werden. Dazu wurde eine explorative Studie auf Basis von 26 Industriepartnern mit Hilfe einer anonymisierten Online-Fragebogenaktion an der Hochschule Pforzheim im 4. Quartal 2014 durchgeführt. Die Ergebnisse der Fragebogenaktion lassen erkennen, dass sich die Kennzahlen der in der Studie untersuchten deutschen Muttergesellschaften häufig nicht von den Performance Measures der internationalen Tochtergesellschaften unterscheiden. Welche Ursachen sich dahinter verbergen, zeigt dieser Forschungsbeitrag. Dieses Ergebnis könnte zukünftig differenzierter ausfallen, wenn auch durch weitere Forschung die internationalen Muttergesellschaften in die Untersuchung miteinbezogen werden würden.
M16|Offshoring Accounting Services: New Opportunities for Developing Countries|The aim of this paper is to explore the viability of off-shoring of accounting services to foreign companies by providers of such services located in Republic of Macedonia. We have assessed the potentials of accountants in Republic of Macedonian to offer off-shored accounting services by using the criteria for assessment of outsourcing destinations in general as established by the McKinsey Institute. We have founded that there is considerable potentials for off-shoring of accounting and related services. Exploitation of these potentials would result in significant contribution to the accounting profession development and the employment of young graduates in accounting. In these terms, we offer some practical recommendations to the profession and to the policy-makers for further promotion of this business opportunity.
M16|The Samurai Bond: Credit Supply And Economic Growth In Pre-War Japan|While credit supply growth is associated with exacerbating financial crises, its impact on general economic activity and long run development are unclear. To identify a causal impact, we use bond payments to samurai in nineteenth century Japan as a quasi-natural experiment and exploit variation between regions. Our proxy for credit supply, samurai population shares, is positively associated with per capita levels of firm establishment and capital investment and average firm capital. Initial samurai population share affects output per capita in the short and long run only in regions with early access to railways, mainly through the tertiary sector. Our interpretation is that increased credit supply may have a positive and persistent impact on output if a region has productivity-enhancing investment opportunities.
M16|Dealing With Liability Of Foreignness: The Case Of Philips In Australia, 1945-1980|How do multinational enterprises (MNE) respond to the ‘liability of foreignness’ (LoF) they experience in foreign markets? The case study in this paper demonstrates that firms develop dynamic, interactive strategies to minimise the LoF risks they perceive. The Australian subsidiary of Dutch MNE Philips Electronics experienced a significant LoF during 1939-1943, when it came close to being nationalised. In response, Philips Australia set out to build ‘FDI legitimacy’ after 1945 in order to maximise both its ‘national embeddedness’ in the host country and its influence on government policy that guided the rapid development of Australia’s postwar electronics industry. This strategy aimed to minimise risk and maximise commercial opportunities for the firm. Philips Australia localised senior management, maximised local procurement and local manufacturing, took a leading role in industry associations, engaged politically influential board members and used marketing tools to build a strong brand and a positive public profile in Australia. The firm became aware of the limitations of this strategy in 1973, when a new Labor government reduced trade protection. Increasing competition from Japanese electronics firms forced Philips Australia to restructure and downsize its production operations. Despite increasing reliance on imports from the parent company’s regional supply centres and efforts to specialise production on high- value added products, the firm saw its profitability and market share in Australia decrease. The case demonstrates that the success of strategic responses to minimise LoF and maximise ‘FDI legitimacy’ is highly context-dependent.
M16|Repatriation Taxes and Foreign Cash Holdings: The Impact of Anticipated Tax Policy|We examine whether anticipation of Congress enacting a reduction in repatriation taxes affects the amount of cash U.S. multinational corporations (MNCs) hold overseas. Prior papers have focused on which U.S. MNCs repatriated foreign cash and how they deployed these funds following the repatriation tax holiday in 2004. We build on this literature and examine whether MNCs were willing to incur the costs of holding excess cash in response to proposed, but uncertain tax legislation. We find that U.S. MNCs most likely to benefit from this legislation began accumulating significant cash holdings once Congress initially proposed and began deliberating a second repatriation tax holiday. Further tests reveal that this cash accumulation was accompanied by two complementary activities designed to maximize expected tax benefits: tax-motivated income shifting and increases in permanently reinvested foreign earnings. The documentation of such preemptive behavior by corporations contributes to the literature on how firms respond to tax-induced incentives, provides a new explanation for the dramatic growth in cash holdings by U.S. MNCs over the last decade, and raises important questions about the long-run consequences of enacting temporary tax regulation.

M16|Retailers’ Responsibility towards Consumers and Key Drivers of Their Development in Poland|Multinational retailers are now very powerful and their activities could influence whole economies. In this paper, we investigate why they engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices towards consumers, how it fosters sustainable development, and what the role of institutions are in the process of developing CSR strategies. Changes that have taken place in Poland since 1989, when the transition process into a market economy started, constituted an excellent research field due to the fact that the retail market was not saturated at the beginning, consumers were only slightly protected by the law, and there were no institutions promoting the implementation of social responsibility standards by companies. Research involving analysis of secondary data drawn from retailers’ websites, CSR reports, and published data relating to the CSR institutions allowed the following: (1) identification of three stages of development in consumers’ conception of CSR characterized by the immoral, amoral, and moral management; (2) showing that these activities have a business case; and (3) explaining the role of institutions and competition in this process. It is also shown how multinational retailers could contribute to the sustainable development of less mature markets in which they invest.
M16|Strategy Implementation Style and Public Service Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Equity|Strategic decision-making theories suggest that organizations that combine rational and incremental strategy implementation styles are likely to perform better than those that emphasize a single style. To assess whether these arguments apply to the public sector; we explore the strategy implementation style and perceived service effectiveness, efficiency and equity of Turkish municipal government departments. Using fuzzy cluster analysis, we identify four distinctive though inter-related styles of strategy implementation in our sample organizations: logical-incremental; mostly rational; mostly incremental; and no clear approach. A logical-incremental and mostly rational style of implementation are associated with better effectiveness, efficiency and equity; with the absence of an implementation style associated with worse performance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
M16|The Functions of a Servant Leader|Servant leadership has been researched internationally and various types of favourable individual, team, and organisational outcomes have been linked to the construct. Different servant leadership measures have been validated to date and a clear distinction has been made between the theory of servant leadership and other leadership theories. However, it seems that research on the implementation of servant leadership within an organisation is still in need. The main functions of a servant leader are not yet conceptualised in the literature to help researchers or practitioners to implement servant leadership successfully within organisations. After conducting a systematic literature review, the main functions of a servant leader were identified. These functions were clustered into strategic servant leadership and operational servant leadership and supported by servant leadership characteristics and competencies as defined by current literature. The results of this study might help practitioners to develop servant leaders more effectively and assist organisations to cultivate a servant leadership culture within companies. Limitations and future research needs are discussed.
M16|Can Servant Leaders Fuel the Leadership Fire? The Relationship between Servant Leadership and Followers’ Leadership Avoidance|This study tested the effect of servant leadership on followers’ inclinations to strive for and, in contrast, to avoid leadership responsibility. Results from a study in the health care context, including two waves of data from 222 employees, revealed that servant leadership had a small but positive effect on followers’ leadership avoidance. This effect was influenced by followers’ implicit conception of an ideal leader. Specifically, servant leadership was found to reduce leadership avoidance when the congruence with the followers’ ideal leader prototype was high. Furthermore, followers’ core self-evaluations and affective motivation to lead mediated the relationship between servant leadership and reduced leadership avoidance. Implications of these patterns for theory and practice and avenues for future research are discussed.
M16|The Impact of Heavy Perceived Nurse Workloads on Patient and Nurse Outcomes|This study investigated the relationships between seven workload factors and patient and nurse outcomes. (1) Background: Health systems researchers are beginning to address nurses’ workload demands at different unit, job and task levels; and the types of administrative interventions needed for specific workload demands. (2) Methods: This was a cross-sectional correlational study of 472 acute care nurses from British Columbia, Canada. The workload factors included nurse reports of unit-level RN staffing levels and patient acuity and patient dependency; job-level nurse perceptions of heavy workloads, nursing tasks left undone and compromised standards; and task-level interruptions to work flow. Patient outcomes were nurse-reported frequencies of medication errors, patient falls and urinary tract infections; and nurse outcomes were emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction. (3) Results: Job-level perceptions of heavy workloads and task-level interruptions had significant direct effects on patient and nurse outcomes. Tasks left undone mediated the relationships between heavy workloads and nurse and patient outcomes; and between interruptions and nurse and patient outcomes. Compromised professional nursing standards mediated the relationships between heavy workloads and nurse outcomes; and between interruptions and nurse outcomes. (4) Conclusion: Administrators should work collaboratively with nurses to identify work environment strategies that ameliorate workload demands at different levels.
M16|The new automobile modular platforms: from the product architecture to the manufacturing network approach|This paper analyses the key factors for the adoption of the new automobile modular platforms through an eclectic perspective linking the product architecture with the manufacturing network approach. An exploratory analysis of the European production networks of seven automobile manufacturers shows that the benefits of the modular platforms’ adoption depend on two factors: the degree of platform modularity and the manufacturing issues of each carmaker —product portfolio, production volumes and network size. The results indicate that the degree of modularity of the platform chosen should be aligned with the manufacturing issues; otherwise, benefits might not reach expectations
M16|The Influence of Institutionally Embedded Ownership on Anglo-American Corporate Governance Migration into Emerging Economy IPO Firms|We argue that the corporate governance of emerging economy IPO firms is influenced by firm-specific institutionally embedded block ownership groups. Applying an extended institutional logic perspective and using a mixed-effects ordered probit model, our findings from 190 IPO-firms from 22 African countries 2000–2016, support the notion that five major block owner categories (corporate, private equity, non-executive, business group, state) exerts very different influence on African firms’ degree of adoption of Anglo-American corporate governance measures. We find that the influence from the various block owner groups is significantly moderated by institutional quality and tribalism, but to different degrees and directions across block owner groups. Our contextually embedded firm-specific results support the criticism of a one-hat-fits-all global and uniform corporate governance model.
M16|International expansion of Russian multinationals - a focus on home-country push factors, Europe and five CEE countries|Russian multinationals play an active role in international capital flows, although, over the past decade, two financial crises have interrupted the upward trend of their outward foreign direct investment (OFDI). This paper focuses on the specific characteristics of Russian OFDI and multinationals in general, in particular regarding their presence in the European Union – Russia’s prime export market and the main destination of Russian OFDI – and, more specifically, five EU-member Central and East European states, including the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Besides official statistics, the research relies on company data gathered to present the activities of Russian multinationals in this region. Among the investment motives, the focus is on home-country push factors, both negative and positive. The paper also asks whether the emergence and presence of Russian multinationals could be explained by using an existing FDI framework.
M16|Food Value Chains: Social Networks and Knowledge Transfer in a Brazilian Halal Poultry Network| This paper describes a food value chain driven by Muslim precepts, exploring the influence of religion on social networks aspects and on knowledge transfer. Religions have a growing importance for international business, shaping the value chain. Assimilating religious precepts can contribute to better business network management for actual and intended food producers. A qualitative case study based on interviews, non-participant observation, and document analysis was conducted. The main results are that trust and commitment give a competitive edge to the Brazilian Halal poultry network when serving Muslim markets worldwide. Knowledge transfer is influenced by the religious context, with a small group of companies (Islamic Centers) governing interpretations of the Muslim precepts.
M16|How to Transfer a Coupon-Based Event into a Hedonic Shopping Experience? Retail Branding Implications Based on the Glamour Shopping Days|The paper examines the motivational drivers behind the participation of Hungarian consumers on a special shopping event, also known as Glamour Days. The study encompasses a variety of related conceptualizations such as hedonic/utilitarian shopping values, self-gifting as well as impulsive buying practices. After the introduction of relevant consumer behaviour concepts and theoretical frameworks, the paper presents a qualitative research on adult and adolescent female consumers’ shopping experiences during Glamour Days. By building on phenomenological methodology, this study also portrays the ways this shopping event has changed consumer society within an originally strongly utilitarian attitude driven Hungarian culture. The phenomenological interview results highlight differences within the motivational drivers of pleasure-oriented shopping for the two age groups. For teenagers, the main motivation was related to the utilitarian aspect due to their financial dependence and the special opportunity to stand out of their peer group by joining an event that is exclusively held for adult women. On the other hand, adult women are motivated by combined hedonic and utilitarian values manifested in self-gifting and impulse buying within an effectively planned and managed shopping trip. Based on the results, retail specific strategies are provided along with future research directions.
M16|The Internationalization Motives of SMEs from the Czech Republic in the Context of EU Accession|Foreign competition in domestic markets is still strengthening and for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) internationalization may be one way to deal with this growing rivalry. Pan-garkar (2008) states that for SMEs the benefits of internationalization outweigh its disadvantages and that with the increasing degree of involvement in the internationalization process the performance of SMEs also improves. However, for SMEs from some sectors of our economy, involvement in internationalization is more complex than for large enterprises; moreover, they are often inclined to enter foreign markets due to different motives. The authors carried out several surveys among Czech SMEs during the last three years and found that SMEs from some sectors of the Czech economy mentioned the EU accession of the Czech Republic as their motive for internationalization. The aim of this paper is to find out whether EU membership represents the determining factor of the SMEs’ decision to get involved in internationalization, and what its advantages or disadvantages are as perceived by SMEs in connection with their international activities. Conclusions are drawn on the basis of primary data obtained from Czech SMEs through electronic questionnaire surveys.
M16|Korporacje transnarodowe a standardy CSR w zakresie ochrony środowiska / Transnational Corporations and CSR Standards in Environmental Protection|The subject of this paper is the analysis of the factors that have the greatest importance regarding the implementation of the principles of social responsibility in transnational corporations. International standards for assessing corporate social responsibility define the framework and guidelines in the evaluation of the corporation in this regard. From the company's point of view, the involvement in social activities is used primarily for improving their own image. Companies try to reconcile the desire for profit with social considerations and environmental protection, however, this process is very complex. Corporations should carry out these policies and implement appropriate procedures. Additionally, consumers want to see the use of the CSR principles in practice, so corporations should measurably help the local community and/or support social organizations. In this context, the corporation may serve a wide audience, communities, and have a significant impact on the environment. The paper will attempt to answer the question regarding which factors affect the application of CSR in corporations.
M16|Corporate Social Resposonsibility w kontekście imperatywu kategorycznego Kanta / Corporate Social Responsibility in the light of Kant’s Categorical Imperative|Immanuel Kant’s philosophy, especially his categorical imperative, is one of several ethical theories mainly used to morally legitimize actions, referred to as Corporate Social Responsibility. The aim of the current article is to evaluate if Kant’s philosophy can be used as the ethical foundation for Corporate Social Responsibility as well as to present its advantages and disadvantages in a theoretical and practical approach.
M16|The Role Of Accounting Information Systems In Making Investment Decisions|The Accounting Information Systems is necessary for the business organizations managers to take as a basis for their making decisions. The role of the accounting information is to assist in the selection of investment opportunities that can achieve the maximum profitability in the long run.The analysis presented in the present paper is based on predictions that help the decision makers in choosing among available alternative investment opportunities.
M16|The rights of shareholders – basic principle of corporate governance by means of case-specific jurisprudence|Respecting shareholders’ rights represents one of the fundamental principles of corporate governance, underpinning the establishment of economic entities, as a form of association of individuals and / or legal entities in order to carry out profit-oriented activities. However, there are situations in which the management, the other shareholders, or even the authorities, do not respect certain shareholders’ rights, leading to a number of negative effects, such as the closing of companies. Based on these considerations, in this paper, we set as research objective to analyze the circumstances, which may affect shareholders’ rights. To meet the research objectives, we analyzed the case-specific jurisprudence published by the courts of law till 31st of December 2015. The results of the study show that the shareholders’ rights, which are not respected, include: the property right, the right to receive dividends, the right to participate and vote in the general assemblies of shareholders, the right to be elected in the governing bodies, and not the least, the most important one in accounting terms, the right to be informed.

The main areas and directions of potential cooperation between partner enterprises are identified. Sources of synergy in such cooperation are generalized. By means of multi-criteria optimization tools (the analytic hierarchy process and TOPSIS), using the concept of potential synergies based on the model of strategic interaction, the model of choosing partners to create strategic business alliances is developed.
M16|Knowledge - Imperative Assets For The Management And Performance Of Modern Business|The purpose of this paper is to present the main factors that offer to the management of a company the possibility of improving its administration activity, factors identified during a period of individual study, theoretical and empirical research and summarized within this article. In this regard, through the present paper, I underlined the role of knowledge (especially of the tacit ones) in business organizations and I argued their importance for successful decision making in the demarche of reaching the competitive advantage in the current competitive nebula.
M16|Romanian Cultural Specificity Reflected In The Romanian Post-December Studies|In this article we proposed an inventory of the main post-December researches conducted by Romanian researchers, on the Romanian cultural specificity, with suggestions of valorization in organizations, especially for the management. The analyzed diagnoses, whose findings are synthetically presented, are grouped according to their reference level: national or regional one. The conclusions extract the main axiomatic trends, discussing the positive and / or negative implications within the working place.
M16|Intercultural Competence Between Desirability And Necessity|This article is an attempt to scan and inventory the key aspects concerning intercultural competence on appeal to literature and information provided by training centers. Punctually, our concerns have focused on the definition and components of intercultural competence, but also on some models and tools that form it. Specific aspects in management were highlighted and we make a proposal for a positive exploitation of the ample material, a rather redundant one which we had access to using innovative collaborative networks, within a multidisciplinary and multicultural project.
M16|Influencia de los estilos de liderazgo en el desempeno de las empresas ˜ exportadoras colombianas|Este artículo parte de la teoría de rasgos de liderazgo para analizar la influencia del tipo de liderazgo de las empresas colombianas sobre su desempeño exportador. Para cumplir este objetivo se utiliza una base de datos de 306 empresas exportadoras colombianas y por medio de un análisis de conglomerados bietápico se analizan los diferentes tipos de liderazgo: democrático, autocrático y liberal. Los resultados obtenidos identifican un conglomerado de empresas con alto desempeño exportador que combinan el liderazgo liberal y el democrático, mientras que el segundo conglomerado está conformado por las empresas con bajo desempeño exportador que asumen un liderazgo liberal. Se concluye que para alcanzar niveles de desempeño superior los gerentes colombianos ejercen el liderazgo como un equilibrio entre libertad y control.
M16|Presencia de la expansión internacional en la misión y visión de las principales empresas privadas y estatales de América Latina|Este trabajo busca identificar la presencia de la expansión internacional (EI) en los planteamientos estratégicos de las principales compa˜nías latinas del ranking «Las 500 mayores empresas de América Latina». Para realizar lo anterior se utilizó una técnica cualitativa de análisis de contenido de la misión y visión de sus páginas web. En el estudio se identificaron 232 empresas latinas (200 privadas y 32 estatales) que hacían explícitos dichos planteamientos, a partir de lo cual se encontró que más de la mitad de estas empresas (51,7%) no aluden a la EI; el 25,4% lo hace solo en la visión, y apenas un 13,4% en la misión y visión. Por otra parte, al diferenciar por tipo de propiedad se tiene que el 46% de las empresas privadas y el 62,5% de las estatales consideran la EI en su misión y/o visión.

M16|“Made In China” Products and the Implication of Ethnic Identification Strength|This paper seeks to examine the effect of ethnic identification strength between the Malays and Chinese towards purchasing “Made in China” products. A quantitative approach by means of self-administered questionnaire was adopted. 252 Malay and 251 Chinese respondents’ data were collected from local institutions of higher learning. Independent sample t-tests and multiple regression analysis were used to look into difference and relationship pertaining to country of origin (COO) image, product knowledge, product involvement, information search and purchase intention. The findings show Malays and Chinese are different in terms of their perceptions towards COO image and product involvement. Moreover, COO image is found to be significantly different among Malays and Chinese with strong and weak ethnic identification. However, COO image is found to have no effect on information search and purchase intention although both ethnic groups are generally in favor of products “Made in China.” Instead product knowledge and involvement are found to be essential. This study suggests that marketers and managers need to understand what is shared and what is not among Malays and Chinese in a developing and diverse society like Malaysia. Despite the effect of COO image and ethnic identification strength, product knowledge and involvement play pivotal role in understanding consumers today.
M16|Effect of Self-esteem on Customer Citizenship Behaviors among International University Branch Campus Students|Major universities have expanded overseas by establishing international branch campuses (IBCs) since the mid-1990s. Many campuses have only been in operation for a decade. Hence, engagement of students is valuable to assist in the design, development, and review of transnational programmes. Customer citizenship behaviors (CCBs) of individual student such as self-willingness to provide constructive feedback to university and help other students are valuable to improve university operation efficiency. Most CCB antecedents have been found based on social exchange theory by believing that customer reciprocates positive behavior for rewarding those who benefit them. However, Rosenberg (1965) uses self-consistency theory to argue that self-esteem influences behavior due to self-consistency motive. This research argues that it is still not clear whether the self-esteem leads to pro-social responses among students. Hence, this research aims to examine effect of self-esteem on CCB among IBC students. A sample of 400 students from four IBCs in Malaysia was collected via survey questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS and partial least squares 3.0 (PLS3) which empirically support that self-esteem has positive effect on all three CCB dimensions. Thus, CCBs of IBC students are explained by self-consistency theory in which students perform CCB with the motive of maintaining self-image.
M16|Marketing within the Boundaries of Psychology: What Influences the Choice Whether to go for International Education?|Procurement of international educational services is caused by the special social importance of education in life of modern society, namely realization of such functions by it, as broadcasting and dissemination of culture in society, socialization, social selection, social and cultural change of society in general, and in life of the specific person, in particular. Research objective: Theoretical justification and empirical studying of international procurement of educational services as social and psychological phenomenon. For validation of a hypothesis and the solution of objectives the following methods of research were used: Theoretical analysis of literature, content analysis of documents, modeling, supervision, methods of polls (conversation, questionnaire). The theoretical importance of work is expressed in development of the complete social and psychological concept of procurement of educational services in system of international education. And also in a contribution to development of social psychology of marketing and economic psychology; in the field of studying of international educational services as social and psychological phenomenon of economic consciousness and behavior of consumers; in the social and psychological analysis and psychological definition of such initially economic categories, as “Advance,” “Demand,” “Educational service;” in the field of the theoretical and empirical analysis of groups of consumers of educational services, in development of psycho-diagnostic tools on a problem, in a contribution to an imagology as new interdisciplinary area of scientific knowledge.
M16|Cross-border acquisitions by state-owned and private enterprises: A perspective from emerging economies|Leveraging insights from the institutional theory, resource- and industry-based views and OLI paradigm, we conceptually design a dialectic globalization framework to analyze the acquisition strategy of emerging economy (EE) enterprises. Firstly, we provide trend analysis of the market for cross-border acquisitions by Chinese and Indian multinationals over the last two decades, 1995–2014. Specially, this paper, to date, is the first to analyze high-valuation cross-border acquisitions of Chinese state-owned (SOEs) and Indian private enterprises (POEs). Based on 61 high-valuation deals valued at approximately US$200 billion, we find that Chinese SOEs completed more high-valuation deals, seek to invest in resource-scarce industries, and diversify their risk by targeting developed, emerging and developing countries. While Indian POEs largely prefer to invest in developed economies for both market and strategic-asset seeking, and follow an effective portfolio matrix by concentrating diversified sectors. Lastly, we discuss several policy implications pertaining to disinvestment and turnaround strategy of loss-making SOEs in EE, national interest and security concerns over EE state-driven outbound acquisitions, and foreign investment regulations.
M16|La internacionalización de la industria alimenticia española. El caso de Ebro Foods| [ES] A lo largo de la historia de la economía y dirección de empresas diferentes teorías y modelos han tratado de explicar el proceso de internacionalización de la empresa. La mayoría de ellos se basaban en modelos económicos que daban una visión estática. Para solucionar este problema surgió una corriente que basaban sus análisis en la evolución de la empresa en el entorno, otorgando dinamismo al modelo de internacionalización. El presente trabajo muestra los resultados obtenidos del análisis del caso de estudio realizado a la empresa española Ebro Foods con el principal propósito de demostrar la teoría secuencial con una empresa de verdad, con especial atención a la deslocalización de actividades.
M16|Phenomenon of â€œBorn Globalsâ€ in the internationalization of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Czech Republic|"The article aims to depict the typical features of the internationalization of small and medium-sized enterprises from the perspective of research conducted and available sources, from 1989, and their assessment in connection with the ""born globals"" phenomenon. The outcome of individual studies conducted in the Czech Republic suggests there is a certain set of typical features, referred to as a western pattern of globalization. The western pattern of globalization is characterized by gradual expa nsion to foreign markets. On the other hand, there is the phenomenon of â€žborn globals"", which offers an opportunity to examine this pattern of globalization of SMEs in the Czech Republic."
M16|Factors of Attracting Customers in Jordanian Consumer Markets: A Case Study of Amman Markets|This study aims to identify the influential factors of shopping patterns in commercial markets. The study was carried out on a random sample consisting of 249 consumers in the city of Amman. The study also used a questionnaire as an essential tool to collect data for the study population; also it used scientific research in the field of commercial markets and consumer behaviors in collecting secondary data. After conducting a statistically significant analysis, the study showed the following results: the study sample is affected by the quality of provided services and how much these services exhibit convenience and appropriate use. Also, the promotional policies such as advertising, samples, gifts and withdraw on goods and much more can attract customers towards these markets. Moreover, the study found that psychological factors and consumes’ patterns of purchasing have a direct impact on their choices of commercial markets.
M16|Cluster Approach to Institutional Distance: Middlemen Hypothesis Application|We propose a methodology for gravity models which overcomes weakness of institutional distance measures identified in international business literature (Shenkar, 2001). Our methodology is based on combination of the distance approach with cluster analysis of states according to their institutional level. The methodology reflects the critiques concerning symmetry, linearity and “discordance illusion” of traditional distance specification of institutional variables within gravity models and tries to bridge the gap between those two streams of literature. We also use the methodology to test the “middlemen hypothesis” theorising that intermediate corrupt countries can mediate the trade flows between low and high corrupt groups because they possess skills to succeed on both markets. To present the methodology and examine the hypothesis we estimate micro-founded augmented gravity model for bilateral exports of 131 countries within period 1995-2013. The model is estimated also on disaggregated data. The results confirm that the proposed methodology overcomes discussed weaknesses especially when we estimate the model on disaggregated data because we find significant heterogeneity between sectors. We conclude that when we are interested in causal claims about the impacts of institutions on trade we should abandon traditional distance specifications. However, we reject the middlemen hypothesis.

M16|Is Self-Regulation Sufficient? Case of the German Transparency Code|The German pharmaceutical industry is stepping ahead with its implementation of a new transparency disclosure code for cooperation between pharmaceutical companies and health care professionals (HCPs) and health care organisations (HCOs). In Germany, this transparency code (“Transparenzkodex”) is applicable since January 2015, and data will be publicly available around mid-2016. No empirical work has been done that addresses the impact of the transparency code on cooperation between HCPs, HCOs and the pharmaceutical companies, including the possibilities of competitive analysis of the available data. In this paper, we interviewed experts from 11 pharmaceutical companies representing small, medium-sized as well as multinational corporations which represent 80% of the German pharmaceutical market. Besides interviews, the authors designed a game to evaluate possible financial investments in key opinion leaders. The market can be regarded as a zero sum game. By allowing public identification of such key HCPs and HCOs, the amount spent on them might increase and not decrease. In a way, the transparency code may foster more and not less spending; in our simulation game, the financial investment in marketing key HCPs and HCOs exceeded sustainable limits.

M16|Advertising between Archetype and Brand Personality|The aim of the paper is the alignment of C.G. Jung’s (1954) archetypes and Aaker’s (1997) brand personality framework in the context of advertising. C.G. Jung’s theories had a tremendous impact on psychology. David Aaker and his daughter Jennifer are seen by many as the branding gurus. Despite the fact that both frameworks refer to persons/personalities there is no publication linking the two frameworks. Our research tried to fill this gap by developing a joint framework combining Jung’s and Aaker’s attributes and apply it by analyzing two distinctively different TV commercials from Asian hotel chains. A total of 102 Executive MBA students had to watch both TV commercials and then conduct an Archetype (C.G. Jung) Indicator test and rate Brand Personality (Aaker) traits of the two commercials. Results show that there is common ground. This has implications for advertisers who may want to specify an archetype and related personality attributes for their promotional campaigns. Game changers in the hospitality sector may want to be seen as Outlaw whereas established hotel chains may position themselves as Lover with personality attributes such as welcoming, charming, and embraced.

M16|Understanding Collaboration in Integrated Forms of Project Delivery by Taking a Risk-Uncertainty Based Perspective|Background: Cross-discipline team collaboration between the project ownership team, design team and project delivery team is central to effective management of risk, uncertainty and ambiguity. A recently-developed framework that was developed to provide a visualisation tool to enable various project procurement and delivery forms has been adapted to answer the research question How can uncertainty best be managed in complex projects? Methods: The research involved reviewing transcribed recorded interviews with 50 subject matter experts that was originally analysed using axial coding with Nvivo 10 software to develop the framework that the paper refers to. It extends analysis to focus on risk and uncertainty previously reported upon in that study. Results and Conclusions: The adaptation presents a hypothetical partnering and alliancing project collaboration map taken from a risk and uncertainty management perspective and it also refines its focus on coping and sensemaking mechanisms to help manage risk-uncertainty in a practical and ‘how to do’ manner. This contributes to theory by extending the relationship based procurement (RBP) framework from taking a purely procurement theory focus to being applied in a risk-uncertainty project management theory domain. It also provides a practice contribution by explaining how the RBP mutation to a collaboration and risk-uncertainty management framework may be applied.
M16|Value of Uncertainty: The Lost Opportunities in Large Projects|The uncertainty management theory has become well established over the last 20–30 years. However, the authors suggest that it does not fully address why opportunities often remain unexploited. Empirical studies show a stronger focus on mitigating risks than exploiting opportunities. This paper therefore addresses why so few opportunities are explored in large projects. The theory claims that risks and opportunities should be equally managed in the same process. In two surveys, conducted in six (private and public) companies over a four-year period, project managers stated that uncertainty management is about managing risk and opportunities. However, two case studies from 12 projects from the same companies revealed that all of them had their main focus on risks, and most of the opportunities were left unexploited. We have developed a theoretical explanation model to shed light on this phenomena. The concept is a reflection based on findings from our empirical data up against current project management, uncertainty, risk and stakeholder literature. Our model shows that the threshold for pursuing a potential opportunity is high. If a potential opportunity should be considered, it must be extremely interesting, since it may require contract changes, and the project must abandon an earlier-accepted best solution.

M16|Successful Control of Major Project Budgets|This paper differs from scientific papers describing current research. In line with the theme of this special issue, it challenges conventional risk management practice against the background of former research results successfully finished decades ago. It is well-known that conventional practice frequently results in budget overruns of large projects. International reviews document that. Severe delays of schedules are also well-known. This paper describes successful research results from almost three decades ago, which successfully challenges this severe problem and has led to new practices. The research involved is an unusual mix: Scandinavian researchers from psychology, statistical theory and engineering economy. The resulting procedure has been widely used since around 1990 and challenges conventional procedures. The procedure is documented to be able to yield statistically correct prognoses, when the “rules of the game” have been correctly followed. After a short summary of the basic situation, this paper summarizes the research, followed by some resulting experiences, focusing on two recent studies each of 40 infrastructures and other major projects. In both sets, the actual final cost largely equaled the expected project cost. This result is a marked change from international past and present experience. Finally, the need for further research and progress is discussed.
M16|Strengthening the Energy Policy Making Process and Sustainability Outcomes in the OECD through Policy Design|This study investigates the nature of the energy policy making process and policy priorities within the OECD in order to identify opportunities for improvement in these processes and to improve sustainability outcomes. The Qualitative Content Analysis methodology is used, investigating governance and energy policy making alongside energy policy goals and priorities within eight OECD nations. A congruous energy policy making process (policy cycle) is discovered across the assessed nations, including the responsible bodies for each stage of the policy cycle and the current energy policy priorities. A key weakness was identified as a disconnect between the early stages of the policy cycle, issue identification and policy tool formulation, and the latter stages of implementation and evaluation. This weakness has meant that the social aspects of sustainability goals have been less developed than environmental and economic aspects and a heavy burden has been placed on the evaluation phase, risking a break down in the policy cycle. An additional “policy design” stage is proposed including a sustainability evaluation process prior to decision making and implementation, in order to remedy these identified shortcomings.
M16|The Effects of Traditional and Electronic Word-of-Mouth on Destination Image: A Case of Vacation Tourists Visiting Branson, Missouri|The effects of integrated word-of-mouth (WOM), both traditional and electronic, on tourism products are yet to be fully investigated. The current study aims to assess the effects of and differences between traditional WOM and electronic WOM, between personal WOM and commercial WOM, and between positive and negative WOM on a destination image. Results of the study indicate that traditional WOM had a greater influence on destination image compared to electronic WOM. Personal traditional WOM had a greater influence on destination image compared to electronic personal WOM and commercial WOM. However, negative WOM exerted less influence on the destination’s image compared to positive WOM while negative electronic WOM had a greater influence on destination image compared to negative traditional WOM.
M16|Farmer-Entrepreneurs, Agricultural Innovation, and Explosive Research and Development Cycles|Private sector research and development (R&D) in food processing has seen a growing share of agricultural R&D. This paper analyzes market and technological links between farmer-entrepreneurs and food processing firms. It is shown that processing sector R&D tends to display explosive cycles. To avoid explosive cycles, the processing sector sets the R&D growth path and its target. Dynamic adjustments are related to the shadow price of R&D and farm output price. In equilibrium, the effects of increases in technological innovations (e.g., at the farm level, in public agricultural research, from entrepreneurial talent, in processing sector R&D, and in the price of final goods) on agricultural price and output are positive. The patent race does not affect steady-state agricultural price and output, nor processing sector R&D; it only reduces the opportunity cost of R&D.
M16|Challenges in Cost Estimation under Uncertainty—A Case Study of the Decommissioning of Barsebäck Nuclear Power Plant|Cost estimation is an important part of project planning. Over the years different approaches have developed, taking uncertainty into account in the cost estimation processes in order to tackle the dynamic nature of projects. However, when implementing these approaches, some challenges have been revealed. The aim in a cost estimation process is to establish a realistic overview of the total project costs and its uncertainties. Even though tools and methods for taking uncertainty into account are implemented, projects with cost overruns are often seen. In this paper we look into some challenges with the practice in cost estimation processes and identify possible improvements to overcome them. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate better solutions to some of the major weaknesses identified in current cost estimation practice. We use a case study of decommissioning of Barsebäck Nuclear Power Plant to illustrate how to overcome these challenges. First of all, this is an interesting case with challenges related to the project and the cost estimation process, given the complexity in the situation and that very few have experiences related to decommission of nuclear power plants. Second, we applied an approach that is not yet commonly used to develop cost estimates for this kind of projects. The paper concludes that it is possible to improve the results of uncertainty analysis of cost estimates. A well prepared process, with a suitable group of experts that go through a well-structured process, focusing both on risks and opportunities and using a top-down approach can compensate for some of the challenges related to cost estimation under uncertainty.
M16|The Effect of Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations on Academics’ Entrepreneurial Intention|This work investigates entrepreneurial intentions among academic scientists. Drawing from the literature on entrepreneurial behavior, it contributes to delineate the differences in motivations that are correlated with entrepreneurial intention to those that are considered to be linked to entrepreneurial behaviors. By disentangling the concept of motivations in its ultimately basic constructs of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, we investigate how these two different types of motivations are related to the formation of entrepreneurial intention at the level of academic scientists. Through a survey conducted at the University of Ferrara—one of the leading universities in Italy in terms of technology transfer and scientific production—findings reveal that while academic entrepreneurial intention seems to be mostly driven by intrinsic motivations, the effect of extrinsic motivations, which are regarded as a main antecedent of entrepreneurial behavior among scientists, are largely mediated by academic positions, work environment and different combinations of these two factors. This work therefore highlights the importance of social norms in the investigation of entrepreneurial intention in academia.
M16|Drafting an Effective Ethical Code of Conduct for Professional Societies: A Practical Guide|Academic, medical, and research communities are struggling to quickly and effectively address unethical conduct within their professional ranks. Without a policy in place, individuals and institutes are subject to convoluted procedures and unnecessary consequences. In addition to policies geared to prevent harassment and assault, it is important to protect the ethical basis for research and provide a set of guidelines for how professionals treat each other, students, and trainees. Since drafting a policy of this nature is complex, 10 guidelines are provided as a framework for how to draft, implement, and establish an ethical code of conduct. Further implications for nonprofit societies and professional societies in particular are discussed.
M16|Investigating the Reliability and Validity of the Leadership Practices Inventory ®|This review explains the origins of the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI) as an empirical instrument to measure The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership framework, a major transformational leadership model. The essential psychometric properties of the LPI are investigated using both the LPI normative database, with nearly 2.8 million respondents, as well as reviewing pertinent findings of several hundred studies conducted worldwide by scholars utilizing the LPI in their research. Issues of both reliability and validity are considered, with the conclusion that the LPI is quite robust and applicable across a variety of settings and populations.
M16|Linking HRM Practices and Institutional Setting to Collective Turnover: An Empirical Exploration|The present study addresses the relationship between human resources management (HRM) practices and employee turnover by taking into account the influence of socioeconomic environment. Data was collected at company level with an international sample of 830 companies from 12 countries (Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom, Brazil, Switzerland, China, France, Italy, Poland, Germany, South Africa, and Spain). A division into four bundles of human resources (HR) practices is introduced: remunerative, communication, developmental, and well-being practices. The influence of the socioeconomic environment was factored in by including the institutional setting in terms of the level of coordination as a country-level variable. The results showed that collective turnover is related to both a country’s institutional determinants and to company HR practices. Remunerative HR practices may have a negative influence in terms of enhancing turnover, particularly within countries high in coordination. HR well-being practices are the most beneficial practices in terms of reducing employee turnover. Our study adds to our knowledge on the relation between HR practices and turnover from an international perspective. It complements the empirical knowledge on the effectiveness of HRM practices in a cross-national setting and supports the notion that the institutional context should be given more attention when studying HR effectiveness.
M16|What Is Public Agency Strategic Analysis (PASA) and How Does It Differ from Public Policy Analysis and Firm Strategy Analysis?|Public agency strategic analysis (PASA) is different from public policy analysis because public agency executives face numerous constraints that those performing “unconstrained” policy analysis do not. It is also different from private sector strategic analysis. But because of similar constraints and realities, some generic and private sector strategic analysis techniques can be useful to those carrying out PASA, if appropriately modified. Analysis of the external agency environment (external forces) and internal value creation processes (“value chains”, “modular assembly” processes or “multi-sided intermediation platforms”) are the most important components of PASA. Also, agency executives must focus on feasible alternatives. In sum, PASA must be practical. But public executives need to take seriously public value, and specifically social efficiency, when engaging in PASA. Unless they do so, their strategic analyses will not have normative legitimacy because enhancing public value is not the same as in some versions of public value or in agency “profit maximization”. Although similarly constrained, normatively appropriate public agency strategic analysis is not “giving clients what they want” or “making the public sector business case”. PASA must be both practical and principled.
M16|University Knowledge Transfer Offices and Social Responsibility|Numerous studies and reviews about University Knowledge Transfer Offices (UKTO) have been written, but there are few that focus on Social Responsibility (SR). We present a systematic review of the research on both fields. We consider not only logics from agency theory and resource-based view, but also the dynamic approach from institutional theory, as they aim to generate sustainable economic and social value. The evolution of Knowledge Transfer Offices depends on their role as brokers of collaborations among different stakeholders, according to their mission and capacity to confront the innovation gap. We follow the line of SR viewed as a response to the specific demands of large stakeholders. Building upon recent conceptualizations of different theories, we develop an integrative model for understanding the institutional effects of the UKTO on university social responsibility.

M16|Determinants of Academic Startups’ Orientation toward International Business Expansion|This study explores the determinants of academic startups’ orientation toward international business expansion, focusing on their technological capabilities, availability of public support, the regional characteristics of their locations, and the research standards of their parent universities. Using unique survey data on 448 academic startups in Japan and by estimating an ordered logit model, we find that academic startups are strongly oriented toward expanding their businesses internationally if they have strong technological capabilities, receive public support, are established in regions with a high ratio of exporting small firms, or are affiliated with a parent university with an excellent research reputation.
M16|The Role of Institutions in the Migration of Corporate Governance Practice into Emerging Economies – The Case of Africa|This study examines the role of institutional environment in influencing the migration of corporate governance best practice into 22 emerging African economies. Using a unique and comprehensive sample hand-collected sample of 202 IPO firms from across the continent we adopt a novel institutional logics perspective in studying the diffusion of CEO salary disclosure – a central element of corporate transparency. Our findings reveal that the adoption of CEO salary disclosure by firms is more likely in more homogenous informal institutional contexts. Complementarities arising from disclosure originating from an Anglo-American shareholder value governance framework and indigenous formal institutions adhering to English common law infer disclosure is more likely than in contrasting civil code law contexts. Finally firms with higher proportions of their boards of directors being drawn from indigenous social elites are less likely to disclose CEO salary – where this is reversed in the context of elevated institutional quality. Our findings are important for regulatory authorities, investors and policy makers alike who are involved in institutional improvements in emerging economies.
M16|The Joint Influencing Mechanism of Proximities and Knowledge Base on Multinational Companies’ Global Innovation Networks|This paper explores the joint influencing mechanism of the two-dimensional proximity, namely geographical and organisational proximity, and knowledge base on the relational pattern of multinational companies’ (MNCs) global innovation networks (GINs). It argues when it comes to MNCs’ GINs, the conventional geographical-proximity-and-knowledge-base framework allows only for an incomplete understanding of the network relational patterns and particularly the observed differences between different GINs. The paper suggests an extended theoretical framework based on a two-dimensional proximity concept and the knowledge base approach for understanding how and why MNCs’ GINs are organised in specifically different ways. An in-depth comparative case study with social network analysis is used to illustrate the applicability of the framework in question.
M16|Mergers And Acquisitions Strategies For Market Penetration In New Countries: The Case Of Alsea Group|The principal subject matter of this document is to present the use of mergers and acquisitions as market entry modes, through the international strategy and global standardization. How practical part will be held strategic analysis of Grupo Alsea a Mexican company dedicated to the operation of restaurants in Mexico, Latin America and Spain, will show how it has managed to penetrate the Latin American market and beyond the European market, what were their strategies for penetrating markets in other countries? And how effective are these strategies? Thus, concluding that the use of mergers and acquisitions for Alsea group represented its main strategic key coupled with the synergy of corporate governance, social responsibility, sustainability and development of its employees.
M16|Organizational Support and Self-Efficacy as the Predictors of Dissenter Behavior among Hotel Employees|The aim of this study is to manifest the degree of the predictive role that the self-efficacy levels of employees and organizational support have on the formation of organizational dissent trends. A structural equation model covering the variables relevant to the subject based on the theoretical basis obtained as a result of the executed literature search has been established and the adaptive values regarding the model have been studied. A survey study has been carried out among the employees working in hotel operations in Istanbul, one of the metropolitan provinces of Turkey. According to the empiric findings obtained as a result of the survey the support provided by administrators to employees has an impact on the self-efficacy levels and articulated type of organizational dissent (articulated, antagonistic, displaced and hidden). At the same time faith in self-efficacy which is significantly affected by organizational support has a linear impact on the articulated dissension trends of employees. At the same time the selfefficacy level of employees undertakes a mediating variable role in the interaction of organizational support and articulated dissent. The strategic importance of the participatory management approach of organizational support as well as the versatile development of employees is emphasized with this study which is resolved with a structural equation model using a combination of three variables for the first time.
M16|An Examination Of The Impact Of Culture On Ifrs Risk Disclosures For Firms That Cross- List In The U.S|Accounting disclosures is an important factor in the decision making process of users of financial statements. Differences in cultural values across countries may result in different opinions regarding the adequacy or extent of the disclosures on the financial statements. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of culture on IFRS 7 risk disclosures in firms that cross-list in the United States. This paper extends the current literature in the area of culture and IFRS risk disclosure requirements. The study sample consists of 62 international firms that trade in the New York Stock Exchange. A cross country analysis related to IFRS 7 disclosure level of financial risk was prepared for each firm. Using Hofstede (1983) and Grayâ€™s theory (1988), each company and country was divided by cultural area and by a level of secrecy and conservatism scale. A level of risk disclosures was created for each company after considering the extension of the IFRS 7 disclosures in their annual reports. The results suggest that culture (secrecy and conservatism) do not have a significant impact in IFRS 7 disclosure levels. However, other economic and political factors seem to influence risk disclosures in financial statements
M16|Identification Of Innovation Capabilities For Micro And Small Enterprises In Morelos, Mexico|Innovation is usually associated with the use of new technology or with important research and development departments, leaving micro and small enterprises (MSE) lacking. Our research shows that MSE can find success by doing things differently, better, quicker and more cost efficiently. Unfortunately, the innovation level of MSEs is hard to evaluate because most innovation models have been developed for medium and large enterprises. This paperâ€™s main objective is to determine indicators that can efficiently measure innovation in MSE in Morelos, Mexico dedicated to service and commerce activities. Three innovation models were analyzed: Innovating for the next three billion report by Ernst & Young, Measurement of basic processes and innovation enabling and The Innovation Kite Model. From this analysis, and after the identification of the characteristics and needs presented by the Mexican commerce and service MSE, we stablished 12 innovation capabilities to measure innovation levels
M16|An Introduction To Linking Theor|Characteristics of winning organizations in the 21st century include fast, friendly, focused, and flexible customer-centered infrastructure (Kotze, 2002). For global organizations to be successful, a supportive infrastructure is critical (Kotze, 2002; Theodore, 2014; Tyson, 1998). Popular organizational theories do not address the need for a supportive infrastructure to link business strategy with operational tactics and as such, face significant problems in overcoming the challenges of competing in the rapidly changing, global environment (GÃ¼rel, 2014; Kotze, 2002; Theodore, 2014; Tyson, 1998). By linking strategy, operational infrastructures (lean or balanced scorecard), communication activities, and human resources practices, businesses can increase their ability to improve customer satisfaction and financial performance. Linking theory states to maximize organizational effectiveness in the 21st century global corporations should align their business strategy to organizational infrastructure using human resources and tools to increase customer satisfaction and business performance. Linking theory focuses on strategy, structure, and customer satisfaction and as such, is applicable to all types of global businesses. Since customer satisfaction is the focus of the strategy and structure, employees and managers efforts center on the customerâ€™s definition of satisfaction. Strong technology and communication platforms facilitate internal and external communications providing additional links between strategy and human resources.
M16|Competitiveness And Supply Chain In The Productive Sector Of Valle Del Cauca, Colombia,Competitividad Y Cadenas De Abastecimiento En El Sector Productivo Del Valle Del Cauca, Colombia|Modern commercial dynamics implies constantly evaluation of models not only for negotiation, but distribution of the stock production. It involves establishing a categorical importance to logistics processes of supply and physical distribution, either at the national or international level. This research aims to characterize and visualize main processes or nodes that articulate the supply chain productive sectors of Valle del Cauca. We correlate this with obtaining competitive advantages in these sectors. From this perspective we observe that logistics remains an operational process of instrumentation supply or distribution. It is an active part of commercial positioning strategies of companies as well as a key element to reduce costs in the technological structure of the productive sector
M16|Doing Business in Emerging Market: Successful Strategies|Doing business today become a very challenging endeavour, drivers such as globalization, technological changes, economic crisis, just mention a few are changing the competitive game. Successful firms, appear to be those that demonstrate a real capacity to compete 'differently' and especially to innovate in their business models. Emerging markets are seen now as a unique environment which requires a systematic approach, in developing novel business models and strategies. Going global is one thing but targeting emerging economies is quite a different story. It is a real need to develop strategies for doing business in emerging markets that are completely different from those used in their home country. The successful companies customize their strategy implementation to fit the nationâ€™s institutional context. Adapting constantly their strategies seems to be the best way to cope with unexpected market developments.
M16|Motivación Del Empresario Y Atención Informativa En La Internacionalización: Un Análisis Regional En El Sector Español De Piedra Natural / Entrepreneurial Motivation And Informational Attention In Internationalization. Regional Study To Spanish Natural Stone Industry|Internacionalización, Motivación promoción, Motivación prevención, Atención informativa / This study focuses on an analysis of motivation by entrepreneurs as regards international expansion, and how their motivation impacts their informational preference. Entrepreneurs may be grouped according to their motivational orientation: promotion and prevention. Promotion entrepreneurs approach internationalization spurred on by an inherent motivation, whereas Prevention entrepreneurs engage in internationalization driven by the requirements of the competitive environment. Motivational orientation thus shapes the interests of the entrepreneurs. This study is carried out based on a regional analysis of the Spanish natural stone industry. The findings indicate that exploiting international opportunities is more closely linked to the personal motivation of the entrepreneurs (focus promotion) than to the demands of the competitive environment (focus prevention). With regard to informational concerns, the entrepreneurs consulted showed a clear preference for information related to support programmes, followed by issues linked to knowledge of markets. Nevertheless, entrepreneurs show different orientations and display quite differing informational concerns, especially in these regions leading the internationalization of industry.
M16|Chinese Returnees and High-tech Sector Outward FDI: The Case of Changzhou|The rapid growth and high levels of internationalization by Chinese firms, raise a natural interest in the study of the factors which have led the notable international presence of Chinese firms. To contribute to this effort, we use data from the 2008-10 survey of China's High-tech firms, conducted by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, to estimate the determinants of Chinese firm outward FDI (OFDI). In our analysis, the primary independent variables include high-tech intensity, human capital acquisition, and institutional factors. We have also controlled for various firm characteristics such as firm age, total value of fixed assets, and firm ownership. Estimation from our fixed-effects model uncovers a number interesting patterns in OFDI outcomes. Most notable, among the significant determinants of OFDI, the number of Chinese returnees employed by a firm seems to be more important than tax reduction policies. Further, the effects of the Chinese returnees have a stronger effect on non state-controlled firms than they do for state-controlled firms. This finding is intuitive, since the Chinese returnees who were trained in the West have an understanding of product markets, labour markets, financial markets, language and business culture, and trade laws in both China and the West. Their unique skill sets and knowledge appear to serve as an important catalysts in the growth of OFDI and internationalization by Chinese firms.
M16|The Impact Of Expatriates’ Home Country Culture On Their Time To Proficiency: Empirical Evidence From The Indian Context|The time required by expatriates to become proficient in their new positions is important to both employers and employees. The existing literature on expatriate success is largely blind to what may be significant factors in the process of creating and sustaining job performance amongst the expatriate group: the effect of time and the effect of home country culture. In this study, we examined the impact of five organizational antecedents (role clarity, role discretion, supervisory support, coworkers support and perceived organizational culture dissimilarity) on corporate expatriates’ Time to Proficiency (TTP) in four home country cultures (HCC) samples. We specifically examine the direct impact of HCC on expatriates’ TTP and the moderating effects of HCC on TTP’s organizational antecedents. We used a self-administrated questionnaire on a sample of 224 expatriated managers in New Delhi, India, from four different home countries: France, Germany, Korea, and Scandinavia. To analyze the data, we used PLS Graph version 3.00, a component based Structural Equation Modeling technique. We tested the impact of HCC on TTP by examining the mean scores in TTP across HCC. Differences between path coefficients across the four HCC were analysed using path coefficients’ comparison. Our results show that 1) on the full sample, all five organizational antecedents have a significant impact on expatriates’ TTP, 2) TTP mean scores significantly vary across HCC and 3) the organizational antecedents of expatriate TTP and their relative importance vary across HCC. Our results are broadly consistent with the cultural studies: except for the Korean expatriates, the larger the cultural distance, the longer the TTP. Knowledge that HCC is a significant predictor of TTP suggests that organizations may need to reconsider their international staffing policies, especially in the fields of recruitment, staffing policies and support policies.
M16|International SMEs from emerging markets—Insights from the Colombian textile and apparel industry|Abstract The internationalization of firms from emerging markets has been studied mainly from the perspective of large firms. Smaller and younger international firms based in emerging markets suffer from underrepresentation in the literature. This study sheds light on the internationalization of emerging market SMEs, focusing on Colombian textile and apparel exporters. Using mixed research methods, it illustrates the role of firm age in influencing internationalization strategy. It examines 1165 export contracts by 50 SMEs, discussing export intensity, speed, and geographic scope using recurrence analysis and cluster analysis. It contributes to international entrepreneurship by exploring new empirical evidence and examining it using a novel methodological approach.
M16|Coordination mechanisms for international innovation in SMEs: effects on time-to-market and R&D task complexity as a moderator|As SMEs increasingly internationalize their innovation activities, our study strives to improve our understanding of the coordination mechanisms that SMEs can adopt to orchestrate these activities. Building on the evolutionary theory of organizations, we link three established coordination mechanisms (centralization, formalization, and socialization) to the time-to-market of SMEs’ product innovations. We also argue that the complexity of the internationalized R&D tasks moderates the relationship between the three coordination mechanisms and time-to-market. Survey data from 103 SMEs with international innovation activities broadly support our theoretical account. With respect to the main effects, our findings suggest that a high degree of centralization tends to prolong the time-to-market, whereas formalization tends to shorten it. The moderation results further indicate that centralization can become more beneficial when a firm internationalizes highly complex R&D tasks, while formalization tends to become less beneficial with increasing task complexity. Main and moderation effects with respect to socialization are inconclusive. We discuss the implications of these findings for the academic literature and management practice.

M16|A tale of soil and seeds: the external environment and entrepreneurial entry|Abstract While the study of international entrepreneurship has been dominated by studies of international new ventures, the study of comparative international entrepreneurship has received relatively little attention. We argue that since such international differences are often the underlying drivers for entrepreneurship that crosses borders, this area of research has a rich potential to improve our understanding of international entrepreneurship. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to examine the effects of the external business environment (the soil) on the entrepreneurial entry by individuals (the seeds). This leads us to fundamental predictions regarding differences in the extent of entrepreneurship in different national contexts. While in developed economies business ventures are more likely to be launched when the turnover rate of incumbent firms is high, the opposite is true in developing economies. Estimates generated using a large-scale data set provide empirical support for our theoretical predictions. Our findings suggest important avenues for new research regarding the role of factors such as the liability of newness and the stigma of failure in different national contexts, as well as the manner in which entrepreneurial dynamics evolve over time.
M16|Analysis About The European Shipping And Payment Trends 1975 – 2015|In shipping, more than in other economic sectors, changing trends are very frequent, because of the specific dynamic of markets. The freight rates and second hand prices in the dry bulk market seem to be stationary. This result is in contrast to the findings of a number of papers. However, the results confirm that classical shipping market was stationary in freight rates, which is not the case, if the freight rates followed a random walk. By transforming, all observations, from US$, to Japanese yen, showed that freight rates and prices saw to become stationary and volatility, reduced.
M16|Benchmarketing - Fashionable Term Concerning Traditional Processes|Marketing is a major factor to boost the competitiveness of the firm in an environment which is more and more turbulent. It centers the company’s management as being the ideal satisfaction of the current and potential consumer. This is why, in our conception, the marketing’s management represents a subsystem of the company’s’ general management by which shall be administered to specific activities, and also designed to contour the company’s’ activity object. In this article, the intent is to highlight the fact that the benchmarketing has come loose from cultivating the traditional process to the innovative organizational culture product. In this paper, the authors consider benchmarketing as a process of qualitative organizational culture adaptation to market requirements, depending on the context, so as to ensure the improvement of the economic criteria of appreciation of the business lucrative activities. Based on direct observations concerning small firms, followed by analysis, comparison and synthesis, the authors suggest taking into consideration the theoretical and practical benchmarketings’ approach, as being the current strategy of acquiring and cultivating excellence, as initiation philosophy and business development.
M16|Operational Hedging of Exchange Rate Risks|Exchange rate exposure of firms diminishes when imported intermediates and exports are denominated in currencies that move together. Appreciations of the domestic currency, raising foreign currency export prices, then also reduce marginal costs, allowing firms to counter the increase in foreign prices. Using firm-level data from seven European countries I estimate a structural model showing how exchange rate pass-through into sales depends on intermediate imports and the co-movement of export and import related exchange rates. I find that operational hedging requires firms to intentionally choose export and import regions with comoving currencies. Analyzing the locational choice of firms confirms that the co-movement of currencies indeed appears to be taken into consideration
M16|Redesigning Scenarios and Defining Business Opportunities|The purpose of this paper is to help businesses to define their business opportunities that are most attractive and feasible for them by using newly developed practical techniques. It is intended to find the factors that would affect and change the outlook mostly in the current status and anticipated future, based on the results obtained from environmental analysis. In short, using the trends to be revealed by the environmental analysis, it is possible to anticipate how the field of business in which we operate or plan to enter will evolve in the future. The status is reviewed according to the assumptions and the results to be obtained are evaluated. Thus, assumptions are grouped under various scenarios, their potential impacts on the industry are identified, and the potential status in the industry is defined. In conclusion, taking into consideration the characteristics of the business that offer competitive advantages, the potential opportunities for the business in the industry are identified. Another intention here is to provide strategic planners an easily understandable and applicable comprehensive procedure by assembling the disconnected and disorderly ideas, processes and techniques.
M16|Risk Management in Global Supply Chains|Modern global supply chains operate in com­plex and dynamic international environment. They are exposed to a variety of factors giving rise to a number of risks for them. In the last two de­cades we have witnessed a significant increase in risk events causing damage to the global supply chains of many companies: natural disasters, ter­rorist attacks, military conflicts, economic crises, cyber-attacks, spreading computer viruses and others. This raises the need for effective risk man­agement in global supply chains as an essential condition for their long-term success. The article presents the essence of risk management in glob­al supply chains. Discussed are the main types of risks inherent in these chains. Provided is a pro­cess-oriented approach for risk management. Dis­cussed are the elements of a resilient supply chain and the strategies for risk mitigation. The article argues that effective risk management in today’s global supply chains requires a rethinking of tra­ditional methods and strategies and seeking new approaches to risk management in these chains.
M16|Competitive Strategies: A New Perspective on the Internationalization of the Czech Enterprises| The entrance of an enterprise on the market itself allows for a significant business opportunity. The entrance and activities of entrepreneurial subjects on the international markets can be complicated owing to a number of factors that are given by the environment on one hand, and by the position and situation of the entrepreneurial subject itself on the other hand. The companies that decide to enter international entrepreneurship must be aware both of entrepreneurship opportunities and risks, which are inseparably connected with entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial activities on international markets bring significant changes in strategy and strategic management of enterprise and are conditioned by them as well. This paper aims to investigate the competitive strategies of Czech companies on the international markets at the first foreign entrance. The paper is based on data collected in interviews with managers and founders of Czech enterprises. The companies included in the study are those that have already undertaken internationalization activities and are incorporated in the Czech Republic. Strategies of the Czech enterprises have been researched using the method of questioning: the main primary data collection instrument was a questionnaire-interview.
M16|Do foreign owners favour short-term profit? Evidence from Germany|Comparing domestic- and foreign-owned firms in Germany, this article finds that foreign-owned firms are more likely to focus on short-term profit. This influence is particularly strong if the local managers of the German subsidiary are not sent from the foreign parent company. Moreover, the physical distance between the foreign parent company and its German subsidiary increases the probability of focussing on short-term profit. These findings conform to the hypothesis that foreign owners facing an information disadvantage concerning the local conditions of their subsidiaries are more likely to favour short-term profit. However, we do not identify differences in ‘short-termism’ between investors from Anglo-Saxon and other foreign countries; rather, results point in the direction of more general features of corporate globalisation.
M16|Brief Analysis on the Share of Romania Related to International Trade in Services During 2001 â€“ 2010|This analysis is intended to present, in short, a painting, in a decade, on the share of services inRomania, during from the pre-accession of the country, to the European Union, in the immediatepost-accession period. Integration into the European single market has imposed a strategicreorientation of Romania, with fundamental consequences, including, increasing of the share ofservices being one of them. One of the criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of any country isrepresented by the percentage of services from around economy and opportunities for growth withthe development of multiple hoists on the real economy, but also and the evolution of Romaniansociety. ÃŽn the results of my study, I show that after a decade with increases and decreases, due tothe economic crisis, the share of Romania's services is on an upward path.
M16|Global production sharing: Exploring Australia's competitive edge|Global production sharing — cross-border dispersion of production processes within vertically integrated global industries — has been an increasingly important structural feature of economic globalization in the recent decades. This paper examines patterns and determinants of global production sharing with an emphasis on how Australian manufacturing fits into global production networks (GPNs). Though Australia is a minor player in GPNs, there is evidence that Australian manufacturing has a distinct competitive edge in specialized, skill-intensive tasks in several industries such as aircrafts, medical devices, machine tools, measuring and scientific equipment, and photographic equipment. Specialization in high-value-to-weight components and final goods within GPNs, which are suitable for air transport, helps Australian manufacturing to overcome the 'tyranny of distance' in world trade. Being predominantly 'relationship-specific', Australian GPN exports are not significantly susceptible to real exchange rate appreciation.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
M16|China's evolving role in global production networks: the decoupling debate revisited|This paper examines the implications of the evolving role of China in East-Asia centred global production networks for regional and global integration of the Chinese economy. The main focus is on the 'decoupling' thesis, the notion that China's rise has been instrumental in reshaping the East-Asian region as a self-contained economic entity with potential for maintaining growth dynamism independent of the developed economies. The analysis is based on a new dataset that permits delineating the role of the other East Asian countries as suppliers of parts and components for assembly bases in China and China's dependence on third-country markets. We find that China's reliance on East Asian neighbours for parts and component supply has significantly declined in recent years, reflecting deepening of China's engagement in production networks. China is also emerging as a significant supplier of parts and components within global production networks. There has been a notable geographic diversification of China's assembly exports with a significant increase in the shares of extra-regional developing countries, but Western countries still absorb a sizeable share.
M16|Quantum strategy synthesis by Alphabet Inc|We make the business at the time of great transition from the digital disruption to the quantum disruption, when the multiple quantum inventions in the natural/social sciences lead to the quantum leaps realization by the modern firms in the hi-tech industries in the quantum creative economies of the scales and scopes in the quantum disruption age. At this opportunities/challenges time period, a chairman of the board of directors must take a personal responsibility for the creation and execution of the quantum strategy - a most effective winning virtuous organizational strategy - toward the optimal business model design/discovery for the prosperous effective organization in the quantum creative economies of the scales and scopes in the quantum disruption century. The quantum strategy uses the quantum strategy search algorithm, applying the quantum logic (the probabilistic logic) on the top of the inductive, deductive and abductive logics (the value based logics) with the purpose to create the most effective optimal winning virtuous organizational strategy by the chairman of the board of directors with the interlocking interconnecting directors in the modern firms in the quantum creative economies of the scales and scopes in the quantum disruption time. We study the case on the quantum strategy formulation and execution by a chairmen of the boards of directors with the interlocking interconnecting directors in the modern firms such as Alphabet Inc, expressing a great confidence that the quantum strategies will continue to be implemented by the prosperous organizations to increase their valuations in the quantum creative economies of the scales and scopes in the quantum disruption century.

M16|Corporate Restructuring in the Asian electronics market: Insights from Philips and Panasonic|The surge in Asian electronics business becomes a global platform for international vendors and customers. Conversely, Chinese and Korean firms have become the foremost manufacturing & fabrication nucleus for electronic supplies in the world. This is also a roaring example of success from Asian developing nations. This case presents the fortune of Asian rivals in the electronics business that made Philips and Panasonic to redesign and reform their global tactics for long-term sustainable occurrence in the emerging economies market. Further, it also discusses the reasons behind their current mode of business and post deal issues. This case describes a way to impart the managerial and leadership strategies from the regular business operations happening in and around the world. Exclusively, it focuses on designing inorganic choices such as self-off, joint venture, shuffle and merging strategies from theory to application.
M16|Institutional Voids and Tax litigation in Emerging Economies: The verdict of Vodafone cross-border acquisition of Hutchison|Extensive research on cross-border mergers and acquisitions performed in different institutional settings shows that legal and regulatory infrastructure, level of investor protection, and key macroeconomic factors are the most important determinants. With this in mind, we analyze and discuss the telecommunications market leader Vodafone’s cross-border acquisition of Hutchison equity stake in CGP Investments, which has long-time delayed (litigated) in an Asian emerging market‒India‒in the view of corporate gains tax. Regarding theory testing and development, we test 14 theories and two theorems that have propounded in five management research forums, namely international economics, international business (IB), strategic management, organization studies, and corporate finance. Further, based on shortcomings of the existing theories we develop new theory‒Farmers Fox Theory‒and offer lawful propositions for future research that would advance the existing IB knowledge on Institutional Voids in Emerging Economies. We therefore conclude that a given country’s weak regulatory system benefits both the acquirer and the target firm; at the same time, this economic behavior would adversely affect its fiscal income or budget. Lastly, we offer some policy guidelines for legal and regulatory system, and suggest fruitful recommendations for multinational managers.
M16|A tecnologia empresarial Odebrecht como filosofia de projeto organizacional – um estudo de caso na Braskem S.A<BR>[Odebrecht entrepreneurial technology as organisational project philosophy – a case study in Braskem S.A]|r e s u m o Este estudo analisa a aplicac¸ão da tecnologia empresarial Odebrecht (TEO) na Braskem S.A, de acordo com os critérios do modelo estrela de Jay Galbraith, apresentando como os conceitos e princípios da TEO se relacionam aos critérios do projeto organizacional de uma empresa do grupo Odebrecht. A escassez de estudos que abordam a TEO enquanto modelo para a arquitetura organizacional é o problema central que motivou esta pesquisa, que se justifica pelas dificuldades enfrentadas por organizac¸ões no Brasil, além da relevância da TEO no ambiente empresarial brasileiro. O trabalho foi desenvolvido utilizando como base a técnica de análise de conteúdo, proposta por Lawrence Bardin para analisar uma série de entrevistas realizadas na Braskem S.A., verificando a coerência entre a teoria e a prática organizacional. A partir dos resultados obtidos, foi possível elaborar um diagrama que incorpora a TEO ao modelo de Galbraith. O desfecho do estudo propõe uma maneira de a TEO ser utilizada no projeto de uma organizac¸ão, de acordo com a proposta de Galbraith. Assim, foi possível concluir que a TEO pode ser utilizada para orientar o projeto de novas organizac¸ões ou o redesenho das existentes tanto no Brasil, quanto no mundo. a b s t r a c t This study analyses the application of the Odebrecht entrepreneurial technology (TEO) in Braskem SA, according to the criteria of Star Model of Galbraith. It aims are to show how the concepts and principles of TEO are applied in the organisational design of an Odebrecht group company. The few studies that deal with TEO as a model for the organisational architecture is the main reason for presenting this study, which is justified by the difficulties faced by organisations in Brazil and the relevance of TEO in the Brazilian business environment. The work makes use of the Bardin technique to analyse a series of interviews in Braskem SA, checking the consistency between theory and organisational practice. As a result, a diagram is drawn up that embodies the TEO to Galbraith model. The outcome of the study proposes a way for TEO be used in the design of an organisation. Thus, it was concluded that TEO can be applied in new or redesigned project organisations in Brazil or in the world.
M16|A Comparative Analysis of Polish and Czech International New Ventures|The goal of this paper is to compare the characteristics of Polish and Czech companies which follow the Born Global internationalization model. More concretely, the analysis aims to discover the differences or similarities in terms of the internationalization paths of Polish and Czech SMEs in the characteristics of their managers in terms of the so-called “international vision” and in their innovativeness level. The introductory part of article provides a description of this internationalization model and the International New Ventures traits (INV) and summarizes the recent studies on this topic conducted in Poland and Czech Republic. In the empirical part, the International New Ventures from the two countries are compared. The Polish sample includes 105 companies which were surveyed with use of computer assisted telephone interviews in autumn 2014. For the Czech Republic, the sample consists of 54 small and medium-sized companies, which were surveyed using the computer assisted web interviews from November 2013 till January 2014. The surveyed companies in both countries fulfilled the definition of Born Globals. Descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation analysis and non-parametric tests are applied to accomplish the goals of the paper.
M16|Crisis Typologies Revisited: An Interdisciplinary Approach|For effective crisis management and communication, a decision maker has to understand the causes and nature of a crisis and how it influences stakeholder perceptions. Identifying an organization’s vulnerabilities is essential for crisis prevention but practitioners often lack the ability to define crisis scenarios, especially the worst-case ones. A crisis typology is a structured approach to analyze crisis situations and to introduce measures for crisis prevention and containment. This paper aims to review recent literature on crisis classifications and to discuss their application. Because a single typology cannot capture the complexity and the interdisciplinary nature of a crisis, four relevant typologies from different disciplines are compared. Their combined application in an interdisciplinary framework is suggested. The paper discusses the need for typologies that reflect the cultural and contextual dimensions. Conclusions concerning the limitations and directions for further research are drawn.
M16|Port Regionalization and Landlocked Hinterland: The Czech Republic|The expansion of the European Union (EU) and economic growth have propelled the devel-opment of intermodal transportation and logistics activities in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Yet, the inland location of most CEE economies requires improved connectivity to port terminals on both the Atlantic/Baltic and Mediterranean/Black Sea ranges. The paper pro-vides a broader research perspective on inland logistics platforms focusing on the CEE region, particularly as it concerns the role of the public sector in port hinterland infrastructure devel-opment. The paper identifies the current bottlenecks in logistics activity in regard to the whole range of the national transport chains. A dual regionalization process is taking place between the ports of the Northern and Mediterranean ranges and that the Northern Range is more ef-fective at servicing the CEE region, including the Czech Republic, in spite of the proximity advantage of Mediterranean ports.
M16|Effectuation and causation: Two decision-making logics of INVs at the early stage of growth and internationalisation|The purpose of this study is to explore what decision-making logic (effectual or causal) is dominant in the new venture internationalisation process and what influences its changes over time. To this end, we present a case study of a Polish international new venture (INV) operating in the audiobook industry. The study’s findings reveal that decision-making logic at the early stage of company growth and internationalisation cannot be assigned to one type of logic, but rather may shift from effectuation to causation and vice versa. Moreover, we argue that INVs may apply two logics simultaneously, depending on the characteristics of the problem space.
M16|Internationalization of top management teams: A comprehensive analysis of Polish stock-listed firms|For most Polish firms, doing business across borders is very common. In order to identify whether the firms’ internationalization is reflected by the internationalization of their upper echelons, we conduct a descriptive study on top managers of firms listed at the Polish stock exchange. We apply a holistic approach to measuring board internationalization by taking into account multiple dimensions (e.g., nationality, international education, international work experience, foreign language skills). Our results show that the average level of top management internationalization in Polish firms is relatively low and barely corresponds with the firms’ international business activities.
M16|The diversity of European manufacturing plant roles in international manufacturing networks|It is generally assumed that Western European (WE) plants belonging to multinational companies are more developed and have higher competence levels than their Central and Eastern European (CEE) counterparts. Nevertheless, empirical evidence on the plant level is very scarce. Thus, a sample of 291 manufacturing subsidiaries from 14 European countries is used to test this general statement. We argue that the clear distinction between the two regions is gradually changing with diverse plant roles coexisting in both European regions that reflect different development paths or strategies. Our results show that while less competent plants based on low cost factors are still more prevalent in CEE, a considerable group of highly competent plants is also emerging in the region that use their access to local skills and knowledge to become knowledge hubs within their networks. Nevertheless, highly competent WE plants still preserve a unique position within the multinational’s network.

M16|SME supplier upgrading during the cooperation life cycle – Evidence from Central and Eastern Europe|This paper proposes mechanisms of SME supplier upgrading during the cooperation life cycle, in the CEE context. The methodology consists in 1) confronting and then combining the global value chain governance and the resource-based streams of research on upgrading and learning with the use of the cooperation cycle as a mediator and 2) formulating research hypotheses to be tested in the specific type of case study, namely a prospective case study. According to the findings, in the initial phase of cooperation, upgrading is primarily determined by the network governance mode, which depends on asset specificity, contractual hazards, and supplier capability. At this stage of cooperation, we also identified absorptive capacity as instrumental to introducing customer-driven innovations. During the evolution of cooperation, upgrading is determined by absorptive capacity and dynamic capabilities of the supplier, while the governance mode forms an institutional framework enabling these factors to act.
M16|Training practices and organisational performance: A comparative analysis of domestic and international market oriented organisations in Central & Eastern Europe|The paper explores organisational level training practices in the Central and Eastern European (CEE) region and tests their impact on overall organisational performance. We draw upon data from the CRANET international survey of HR practices in order to provide a comparative overview of training and development in selected CEE Countries. Distinguishing between organisations focusing on the international and on the domestic market, and drawing upon data from 1147 companies in eight countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Serbia), we examine training practices and approaches and test their impact on organisational performance. Our findings demonstrate that the use of more developed training practices contributes to better organizational performance assessed by reference to service quality, productivity, profitability and rate of innovation. The market focus of the organisation in terms of serving a domestic or an international one also appears consequential with those operating internationally recording more extensive training practices.
M16|Slovenian business culture – How proverbs shape dynamic leadership styles|This paper examines the characteristics of Slovenian business culture in a proverbial context using the Yin-Yang (holistic, dynamic, dialectic) approach to analysing cultures. The results show that Slovenian managers are generally risk prone, and apply feminine values in their leadership. The charismatic leadership style dominates. The research makes several contributions to the literature. It is the first practical application of the Fang (2012) dialectic approach in Slovenia. Second, the research builds a bridge between Fang (2012) and Hofstede by systematising proverbs. Third, this study stresses the importance of introducing a more dynamic understanding of leadership styles in a cultural context through paradoxical proverbs.
M16|Emerging advanced topics in an advanced emerging market? International business research in Poland in the period 1990-2014|The main objective of this paper is to present the findings of a structured review of contributions to international business research in Poland in the period 1990-2014. In order to address this objective, qualitative and quantitative methods were integrated to identify main research areas, their relative importance and changes thereof within the analysed timeframe, as well as specific research topics within each area. The results indicate that macro- and micro-level internationalisation, followed by international firm competitiveness and international entrepreneurship have consistently remained dominant research areas, although their relative importance has evolved throughout the period under study. Quantitative research methods, with a strong focus on descriptive statistics, have been the main tools in previous contributions. In addition to highlighting the need for more attention to performance- and competitiveness-related issues, the results of the review also prompt IB scholars to devoting more attention to interrelationships between macro-, meso- and micro-level variables.
M16|A born global’s radical, gradual and nonlinear internationalization: A case from Belarus|This paper contributes to the literature on internationalization processes by showing that a born global can experience nonlinear internationalization (de- and re-internationalize) after radical/fast initial growth, and use some subsidiaries as bases for further gradual expansion. After studying a case of a Belarusian door producer that has invested to seven and exported to 11 more countries, we conclude that a home country’s political/economic environment can be a crucial ‘push’ factor for a firm’s fast internationalization but, thereafter, it can internationalize gradually due to lacking knowledge or other resources, and de- and re-internationalize due to various internal and/or external reasons.

M16|Employee share ownership in Germany: A cluster analysis of firms' aims|Politicians and scholars alike praise the significant benefits associated with employee share ownership (ESO). However, little is known about the concrete motives of firms to provide ESO to their employees. In particular, it is unknown how these motives correlate with firms’ contexts. Drawing on an institutional theoretical framework, this article examines what aims firms pursue through the provision of ESO. The data originate from a survey of firms in Germany. The cluster analytic findings indicate distinctive patterns of relationships between aims and firm characteristics. Aims related to employee performance are most important to foreign-owned firms, financial aims are most important to non-public small and medium-sized firms and aims related to corporate image are most important to big firms and to firms that do not provide profit sharing. Aims related to employee attraction and retention are almost equally important to all kinds of firms.

M16|Time planning and Cost Management in Strategic Alliances|The paper highlights a mutual support example out of ten simulations regarding strategic alliances based on the hypothesis that every partner allocates its resources and budget in an equitable manner according to total expected time (PERT). In todayâ€™s strategic alliances, the partner plays an essential role regarding the support capacity of the firm, assuming the statement: â€œmany hands make light workâ€ . The equitable allocations of time and cost, that the firms are able to honor, will be an advantage within the strategic mutual support. If one of the partners fails to respond with the same resources that the other partner offers, within a certain phase of the process, he will have the possibility to prove his capacity of support in another phase, when the other partner cannot afford to allocate the same resources. Mutual support between partners, time planning and cost management represent the best ways for a complex mechanism, such as the strategic alliance, to work properly.
M16|Demographic Factors that affect the Entreprenuership Intentions of Students in Tourism Department: Comparison of Two State Universities|Recently, entreprenuership is one of the most important subjects. Because most countries are aware that they can achieve economic development and growth by the help of entreprenuership. Therefore, these countries try to create tangible and intangible opportunities that would unfold entreprenuership potential. Turkey needs entreprenuers in tourism sector. It is important for Turkey to lead their students who studies in tourism department to entreprenuership because of abundance in touristic destinations and labor-intensive characteristics of the tourism sector. In this study, entreprenuership intentions of students in tourism departments at Afyon Kocatepe University and Trakya University are compared, and similarities and differences in students’ entreprenuership intentions are put forth. For this purpose, Cronbach Alpha is used to test the reliability of the study, and Kruskal Wallis analysis is conducted to test the impact of demographic factors on the entreprenuership intentions of students. The similarities of demographic factors that affect the students’ entreprenuership intentions of both universities are seen on the same age groups and same objectives (establishing their own businesses, not considering to work in state agencies), and differences are observed in terms of gender and grades (semester). One of the important findings of the study is that entreprenuership education at Trakya University affected the entreprenuership intentions of the students partially and for a short period of time.
M16|Ownership Concentration, Location, and Internalization Advantage in Financial Performance|Taiwan maintains close economic cooperation with the Southeast Asian countries through trade, investment, and industrial advancement. This paper focuses on multinational enterprises in the Taiwanese electronic industry that invested in Southeast Asia from 1997 to 2009. Regression results show that ownership concentration, location, and internalized advantage have various effects on firm financial performance. Performance indicators reveal that ownership concentration has a positive effect on return on equity and return on invested capital, and location has a positive effect on Tobin’s q, whereas internalization advantage is significant for each of them but with less explanation power. Ownership concentration exhibits the greatest explanation power of financial performance. To explore the host country effect, this paper also decomposes the country samples and indicates the theoretical and managerial implications of the research findings.
M16|Increasing Absorptive Capacity to Improve Internal and External Knowledge Transfer in Multinational Companies: A Multiple Case Study Approach|This study investigates how the absorptive capacity could be increased to improve internal and external knowledge transfer in subsidiaries of multinational companies. We look at the way in which the literature on absorptive capacity has evolved, and how it links the internal and external knowledge transfer. Based on 3 case studies conducted at Romanian subsidiaries of multinational companies, we find some patterns, which could explain how the successful knowledge flows should be managed within the multinational company and outside of it, in the supply chain network.
M16|Research on the Current Telecommuting Trends in United States and European Union Markets|In the context of globalization and due to the accelerated progress made in information and communication technology, more and more companies offer their employees the option of telecommuting. For the past twenty years, telecommuting has been on an asceding trend, an incresing number of people embracing the ability to work from home, using a computer and internet connection to communicate for their jobs. The goal of the paper is to explain the overall notion of telecommuting and to analyze the current trends in the United States and European Union markets. Another objective is to assess the advantages and disadvantages of telecommuting and the important role played by this concept within the striving purpose of corporations to achieve their strategic targets. The study is based upon specialized literature reviews regarding the emergence of telecommuting and the role it plays in organizations. A comparative analysis was conducted by the authors on two regional markets, United States and the European Union, in order to assess the trend in telecommuting and the factors that influence it. The outcome of the research shows that although the benefits of telecommuting are numerous, it does not come without challenges, both being applicable for both the employer, as well as for the employee. The research results of this study can be used by organizations when considering to offer their employees flexible work opportunities which can positively influence the long term business performance.
M16|Cultural Adaptation of Websites: A Comparative Study of Portuguese and Dutch Websites|In a globalized world cultural adaptation has become a vital strategy for companies that desire to succeed beyond borders. However, adapt a website is not only to translate the local content of a website to the native language. The content analysis methodology was used to study a sample of Portuguese and Dutch websites collected from the “list of Fortune 500 companies and their websites”. The objective was to evaluate the extent of cultural adaptation of websites to Portuguese and Dutch based on Hofstede and Hall frameworks. The results showed that only the masculinity/femininity dimension were supported meaning that the websites were culturally adapted for both Portuguese and Dutch websites. The high/low-context culture hypothesis, although statistical significant, show that only the Dutch websites were culturally adapted. The collectivistic/individualistic dimension, although statistical significant, showed that only Dutch websites has been culturally adapted. The hypotheses H2 and H3 are both not statistical significant.
M16|A Separation between Supply Chain Management and Supply Chain Governance|Governance and management are commonly debated at firm’s level as two inter-related concepts. As supply chains and networks of firms tend to become the most important players of the economic world, one question addressed within this article is whether at supply chain level these two concepts have specific and different meanings. A theoretical review is performed. The main conclusion is that a real differentiation has not been yet performed, as long as the interest for supply chain governance between supply chain practitioners and researchers is very low.
M16|Latecomer challenge: African Multinationals from the periphery|Multinational corporations have commenced foreign direct investment (FDI) activities since the 1960s by moving operations to resource-rich, low-cost labour and capital markets (Wilkins, 1970; 1974; 1988; Jones, 1994; 2005). The first wave of outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) during the 1960s and 1970s was motivated by efficiency and market-seeking factors. This wave was dominated by firms from Asia and Latin America. A second wave of OFDI followed in the 1980s, led by strategic asset-seeking enterprises from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea (Dunning et al., 1996; UNCTAD, 2005b: 3s). Since the 1990s China, Brazil, India, Russia (the so-called BRIC countries) Malaysia, Turkey and South Africa are among the countries expected to add significantly to OFDI growth (UNCTAD, 2005c: 4). The emergence of EMTNCs (Emerging Market Transnational Corporations) makes up a growing proportion of outward FDI and they acquire an increasing share in foreign affiliates from developed markets conducting business in their regions. This paper reflects on the transformation of businesses and business practice in Africa, from isolated peripheral actors to global players. A growing number of African multinational corporations extended business operations from behind marginalized peripheral operations to global markets. This paper investigates the history of leading emerging market multinational corporations from Africa since the 1980s.

M16|Chinese investments in Africa: what have we known and what should we know?|This study conducts a systematic review of the researches on Chinese investments in Africa, publishing in major journals of business administration and international business over these last 10 years. It studies the motivational factors for Chinese firm?s presence in Africa, the modes of entry of Chinese investment, the management issues, and their impacts on local economy and firms. It aims to provide an organizing framework for emerging theoretical and methodological issues, as well as future research direction in this field.Based on the international business theories, the findings of this study indicated that, to date, the majority of research has attempted to either qualitatively or conceptually criticize the cooperation between China and Africa, and there are very few studies that define model and develop measurement tools to empirically test the effects of the Chinese presence in the African continent and its impacts on local enterprises. Very few studies have provided robust evidence to establish the role that China is playing and the crowding-in or crowding-out effects of the Sino-Africa cooperation. This paper discusses about 5 major flaws in the existing literature and concludes with some emerging issues, the practical implications of this review, and future research directions.
M16|Respect Differences: Role of National Cultures in subsidiary autonomy in global product development|Food industry is an industry that has difficulty differentiating among products, so some product characteristics are easily copied by the competitors which lead a high failure rate among food products and a creativity crisis in the food industry. According to conventional wisdom, product localization with high local responsiveness is considered the lifeblood of establishing global competitiveness among food multinational corporations (MNCs). Within this perspective, a MNCs` subsidiary is considerate as an important source of knowledge for MNCs to be able to pursue charter enhancement and reinforcement initiatives. The research presents two research questions: How the autonomy was granted to MNCs subsidiary according to the national culture? And how a food MNCs develops understanding in national culture for subsidiary autonomy determination in local product development? The purpose of this ongoing research is to raise the importance of respect differences in national cultures aspect for subsidiary autonomy determination.
M16|SME Internationalization in Emerging Markets: Symbiotic vs. Commensal Pathways|Purpose - The purpose of this research is to develop, test, and validate the symbiotic networking concept of SMEs internationalization pathways. Design/Methodology/Approach - Survey data were collected from managers/owners of SMEs operating in the textile industry in China and Russia. The applied data analysis technique employed is structural equation modeling. The survey was pretested to address reliability, validity, and cross-cultural stability issues. Findings - The symbiotic networking relationships in SMEs were shown to be positively related to their degree of internationalization. The relationship between networking and internationalization is significantly stronger in the conditions of high rather than low environmental turbulence. Research Limitations/Implications - Further research should validate the findings in other industries and other countries. Future research may also include in the model other cultural, attitudinal, environmental, and managerial variables, as well as other dependent variables, first of all from consumer behavior and marketing communications fields. Practical Implications - The findings may assist in identifying networking clusters of SMEs in emerging economies that are more likely to enter foreign markets and develop more targeted support and educational programs aimed at facilitating the internationalization of small businesses. The research results also assist in the elaboration of managerial tools in multinational entrepreneurial businesses. Originality/Value –The research contributes to the field by empirically investigating, testing, and putting into a unified framework the measurement tools required for identifying the symbiotic networking interactions of SMEs and the influence of these interactions on SME internationalization pathways.
M16|The International Environment and Its Influence on the Entrepreneurial Internationalization of Firms: The Case of Polish Businesses (Miedzynarodowe srodowisko i jego wplyw na miedzynarodowa przedsiebiorczosc firm: przypadek polskich firm)|The article focuses on the international environment, which is one of the main variables in the internationalization process of firms from the perspective of international entrepreneurship. The main goal of this study is the identification of the key factors in the internationalization of the firms, inherent in the international environment, and the exploration of the impact of these factors on the process of the internationalization of Polish firms. The paper presents the partial results of a survey based on a sample of 355 companies operating in Poland. The questionnaire was completed in 2015 as a part of the OPUS 4 project as carried out at the Cracow University of Economics. Using information from Polish companies, the study finds that pull factors have a positive influence on the level of internationalization of the examined businesses. Production companies are the main beneficiaries of the internationalization process and Polish born globals take advantage of their adjustments to the ecology. The results presented in the article are just a starting point for further analyses, including not only the simple seven-dimensional PLESCET approach, but also the process of organizational learning, the accumulation of knowledge coming from the environment, and the taking advantage of environmental opportunities.
M16|Foreign Language Anxiety in Professional Contexts|Abstract While increasing globalization of the business world and rising numbers of people working in foreign language contexts are undoubted facts of modern work life, there are surprisingly few studies on individuals’ emotional reactions to working in a foreign language. Facilitating further research, we introduce a short scale for foreign language anxiety that is applicable in business and other professional contexts. Additionally, we investigate its relationship with gender and general personality traits. Our analysis of survey data from 320 adult bilinguals with Dutch as their mother tongue and English as foreign language demonstrates the reliability of the short scale. Furthermore, we find that females experience higher levels of FLA, but that this association is mediated by differences in personality. Our study contributes to the emerging literature on individuals’ (emotional) responses to using foreign languages in business contexts.

M16|Culture-Laden Imports: International Market Entry and Cultural Taboos|This empirical study investigates American market responses to a Spanish product that is strongly culture-laden and may violate cultural taboos. Surveys were conducted in two contrasting US universities in Arkansas and California. Contrasting student majors were also chosen: Art and Business. The product is a life-sized baby doll, designed to be breast-fed rather than bottle-fed, which highlights the benefits and normality of breast-feeding babies. Although this product is popular in its original European market, US media accounts suggested strongly negative morality-based American reactions. This study found a strong overall non-acceptance of this product in all groups, but with significant differences between groups. Results quantify the market reaction and illuminate its cultural basis by comparing responses between two culturally different regions, two contrasting college majors, different genders, and different ethnicities. In doing so, this study helps to break new ground in the international marketing of culture-laden products.
M16|Taiwanese Foreign Direct Investment in Southeast Asia: An Empirical Investigation of the OLI Framework|Foreign direct investment (FDI) is critical in the economies of both developing and developed countries. FDI is a new trend in emerging markets. The purpose of this study is to investigate entry mode choice through Dunning¡¦s eclectic paradigm within an ownership, location and internalization (OLI) framework, which is useful for explaining foreign investment activities. The data in this study were extracted from the Taiwanese electronics industry¡¦s FDI in Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) from 1997 to 2009. The results of the logistic regression analysis show that OLI factors influenced the choice of FDI entry modes. The ownership factors of international experience and firm size led to wholly-owned investments. The location factor of the complete infrastructure of communication in the host countries led to joint ventures. Finally, the internalization factor of cultural distance between the home and host countries led to wholly-owned investments. The results also confirm the contribution of the eclectic paradigm and the OLI factors to successful international business investment.
M16|The effect of internal capabilities and external environment on small- and medium-sized enterprises’ international performance and the role of the foreign market scope: The case of the Malaysian halal food industry|Diese Studie untersucht die internen Kompetenzen, das externe Umfeld und die Moderator-Beziehung der geografische Reichweite (internationale oder globale geografische Präsenz) auf den internationalen Unternehmenserfolg von kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen (KMU) in der malaysischen Halal Lebensmittelindustrie. Nachdem sich der Grossteil der empirischen Forschung bezüglich der Internationalisierung von KMU auf entwickelte Länder und wissensbasierte Branchen beschränkt, fokussiert diese Studie auf ein Entwicklungsland und einen darin befindlichen aufstrebenden industriellen Sektor. Weiters mangelt es in einem Gutteil der internationalen Entrepreneurshipliteratur an der Berücksichtigung von geografischer Reichweite: Gegenwärtige Erkenntnisse sind daher noch weitgehend unschlüssig in Bezug auf die Frage welche Faktoren den Unternehmenserfolg bei variierender Marktpräsenz beeinflussen. Diese Studie ist holistisch und baut auf einer Reihe von theoretischen Grundlagen auf. Wir stellen fest dass es wichtig ist, interne und externe Faktoren parallel zu geografischer Reichweite untersuchen, um das Verständnis ihrer Auswirkungen auf der internationale Leistung der KMU zu verbessern.

M16|Causal ascriptions and perceived learning from entrepreneurial failure|We examine how failure ascriptions (how the core causal characteristics of a failure are identified) impact perceptions of learning, defined here as the ability to transfer knowledge from a failed venture to a subsequently started new venture. Our findings are consistent with prior work in that internal unstable failure ascriptions are associated with greater perceived learning, while external stable ascriptions are associated with less perceived learning. Inconsistent with prior work, however, we find that starting a new venture more quickly after failure enhances perceived learning for entrepreneurs who made internal unstable ascriptions. Further, entrepreneurs with external stable ascriptions have even less perceived learning when they abandon their previous domain in their new venture. Implications for research on failure, ascriptions, and perceived learning for future ventures are discussed. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
M16|How to create social value within the international hotel industry. Hotel chain case study|This paper presents the hotel business as part of the tourism market, which, globally, is in a continuous process of development by increasing the number of properties. The paper is based on the analysis of the factors that support this statement and that bring the hotel business among the most dynamic businesses today. People travel for various reasons, whether for business or personal purposes – most often for relaxation. The methodology used was that of an almost exhaustive research of both types of tourism that are growing, supported by globalization. Companies open offices in various countries, entrepreneurs find business opportunities even in the most remote places. Social values are those elements like dignity, bodily integrity, property, wealth, kindness, generosity, tolerance, respect for the elderly, goodwill, honesty, cheerfulness, seriousness, job well done, which, in the mentality of a community, are considered important, and are treasured as such. All of them are found in the hospitality industry!
M16|Relations, Assessment Methods and Development Strategies in Travel Industry|"The main goal of this paper is to analyse the tourism development strategy, which is the art of selecting and optimizing resources and means that any travel company may have at its disposal, in order to achieve one or more progress objectives, imposing the location, timing and the conditions of the ""competitive struggle"" to its competition. The research methodology consists of an inventory and analysis of assessment methods, as well as of the identification of strategy types (market penetration, retention and loyalty) of the travel industry, all being meant to support tourism and the success of the companies operating in this field. In principle, these methods and strategies are designed to offer alleged advantages, fully observing the quality standards of tourism products. This connection is not always real, but the preference for these strategies is prevalent among American managers, as well as the European ones. The research should result in identifying certain strategies in the travel industry; likewise, it considers that any individual working in this field should know when and how to apply them in order to bring profits to the tourist organisation he belongs to."
M16|Orosz befektetések a visegrádi országokban. Az elméletek temetője?<BR>[Russian investment in the Visegrád countries - a cemetery for extant theories?]|A tanulmány az orosz cégek visegrádi országokban végrehajtott beruházásainak fő jellemzőit és motivációit vizsgálja. Fő következtetése, hogy a nemzetközi befektetések meglévő elméletei - Dunning eklektikus paradigmájának kivételével - kevéssé képesek megmagyarázni az orosz multinacionális vállalatok visegrádi országokbeli tevékenységét. Ezért az orosz befektetők tulajdonosi előnyeit elsősorban a dunningi eklektikus paradigma segítségével elemzi, megfelelően igazítva azt az adott vállalati kör sajátosságaihoz. A cikk a statisztikai jellemzőkön túl a legfontosabb, visegrádiakba befektető, orosz cégeket is bemutatja. Ezek között a kőolaj- és földgáz-, az acélipari és atomenergetikai, valamint a piac- és erőforrás-orientált állami tulajdonú vagy államhoz közel álló orosz vállalatok hajtják végre a legjelentősebb beruházásokat. Továbbá - bár jóval kisebb számban - jelen vannak innovatív orosz magánvállalatok is, amelyek sokban hasonlítanak a fejlett országok multinacionális vállalataira.

M16|Transnational Entrepreneurship: A Interview with Lebanese-American Restaurateur Charbel Saliba|Literature on transnational entrepreneurship, while expanding, leaves much to be desired. For instance, there is paucity of qualitative surveys that capture the “voice” of a real life transnational entrepreneur. This article aims to contribute to the academic and business literature by showcasing the viewpoint of a Lebanese-American transnational entrepreneur. Charbel Saliba is a successful ethnic restaurant owner in Illinois, USA. Through an interview conducted by Dr. J. Mark Munoz of Millikin University, with the assistance of business student Matthew Herek, Saliba shares his thinking on transnational entrepreneurship and its implications on his business.
M16|International and Cultural Implications on Internationalization Analysis of Multinational Firms|This paper is aims to analyze some of the institutional and cultural implications on internationalization analysis of multinational firms. The analysis begins questioning what the main institutional and cultural variables are considered in the involvement of internationalization of multinational firms. To answer this question, a literature review types approach in areas like internationalization of multinational firms based on institutional and cultural frameworks is followed. Secondly, these institutional and cultural variables are analyzed to integrate findings. Finally, the paper argues the need to design a better institutional and cultural balance among the development of a glocal-regional transformation, convergence and governance.
M16|Can Uppsala Model Explain the Internationalisation of Central European SMEs?|The aim of this paper is to scrutinize some aspects of the Uppsala model whose applicability for SMEs’ internationalisation is often questioned. This model explains internationalisation as a sequential process based on learning in which an enterprise increases its international commitment in incremental steps. The assumptions of Uppsala model are discussed in conditions of SMEs from different countries, namely the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Austria and Germany. The paper is based on primary data obtained by questionnaire survey performed in 2014. Respondents were small and medium-sized firms from the above mentioned countries. Following assumptions are scrutinized: SMEs start internationalisation by exporting to neighbouring markets, SMEs behave in internationalisation according to the establishment chain, SMEs’ risk perception regarding foreign markets with different psychic distance changes with the obtained knowledge and SMEs’ risk perception regarding particular foreign markets differs depending on the country which the enterprise comes from.
M16|Managers' Perceptions of the Impact of Cultural Differences on the Process of Internationalization of Polish Companies|A large sector of researchers in the International Business field, along with those in other fields (such as International Marketing and International Management), have dedicated themselves to research involving the reliability, applicability and generalizability of the psychic distance phenomenon.This construct has an influence on theinternationalization of companies. The aim of the article is to present qualitative research results on managers’ perceptions of the importance of one of the psychic distance stimuli, namely cultural differences,in the process of internationalization of companies. In the theoretical section of the article, the definition and operationalization of psychic distance and different stimuli of this construct are described.Particular consideration is dedicated tocultural differences. The second part of the article focuseson the research background.In the third part of the article, the importance of the differences in culture in the process ofinternationalization isevaluated. The article presents the respondents’ opinions on the significance of cultural values and practices, differences in religion and differences in languages in managers’ decisions on internationalization. The authorsfocus on the impact of cultural differences on the choice of directions of foreign expansion, market entry strategies, the amount of foreign expansion markets, the pace of internationalization as well as the value of sales and capital engagement abroad.
M16|Does Foreign Entry Spur Innovation?|Our estimates, based on large firm-level and industry-level data sets from eighteen countries, suggest that FDI and trade have strong positive spillover effects on product and technology innovation by domestic firms in emerging markets. The FDI effect is more pronounced for firms from advanced economies. Moreover, our results indicate that the spillover effects can be detected with micro data at the firm-level, but that using linkage variables computed from input-output tables at the industry level yields much weaker, and usually insignificant, estimated effects. These patterns are consistent with spillover effects being rather proximate and localized.
M16|Internationalization Process of Entrepreneurial Activities: A Comparative Study of Czech Companies|Internationalization of entrepreneurial activities is not only a matter of large enterprises. Currently, the majority of SMEs is undergoing the process of internationalization. The purpose of this paper is to compare the internationalization process of Czech large enterprises and SMEs. The companies included in the study are those that have already undertaken internationalization activities and are incorporated in the Czech Republic. The findings of the comparison show that the company size affects only the speed of internationalization of Czech companies. The choice of geographical coverage and entry mode is not affected by company size.
M16|Shaping Japanese Management Abroad: How and Why Japanese Companies are Embedded with Particular Practices in India|This paper investigates the human resource (HR) practices of Japanese companies operating in India. We studied 10 Japanese companies based on 17 interviews. The paper elaborates five major HR practices and explains why Japanese companies have established a specific set of HR practices in India. It then provides the details on how these HR practices have been originated, adjusted and integrated. The findings suggest less-focused training and developmental programs, and identical performance appraisal systems across all companies. Similar socio-cultural characteristics such as seniority-concerned and teamwork-orientation have facilitated the adoption of Japanese way of management in India.
M16|Quality Strategies Used by Market Leader in the Competitive Coffee Industry|In Romania, the cafes market has experienced lately a significant growth, the competition becoming very strong. Starbucks is a great company known worldwide, it is the biggest chain of coffee shops in the world, being a world leader in coffee roasting and retailing. This paper aims to study the quality strategies used by Starbucks over the time, strategies that have made the company to become the market leader and being appreciated by millions of consumers worldwide.
M16|Whether and How Network Structure Shapes the Value of Firm Capabilities?|This study examines how firm performance is driven jointly by individual firm-specific capabilities and the characteristics of networks in which firms are embedded. By using business groups in emerging economies as the organizational lens and adopting stochastic frontier estimation to measure firm capabilities, we find that the value of a firm’s capability is contingent upon the structure and the content of the intra-group network in which it is embedded. Specifically, we find that a dense intra-group network is likely to make innovative capability more valuable, although this effect varies across different types of network ties. While a dense network of intra-group buyer-supplier ties and equity ties enhances the value of innovative capability, a dense network of intra-group directorship ties does not influence the efficacy of a firm’s innovative capability.
M16|Evaluating Investment Profitability and Business Controlling Methods|If we ask economists or controlling managers, then they will define the business controlling developments on quite different ways, but it is easily observable that each of the business controlling projects have goals which are mainly improving the effectiveness of the business by reducing negative outcomes and retaining the benefits. So the business controlling development is essential in companies’ life. It is a very important management task to focus on business controlling developments and invest in such kind of projects. This field has more and more come into prominence during the economic crisis started in 2008, because several companies were able to survive only with the help of new and innovative controlling functions. The research tries to prove that the performance of the company is strongly influenced by the controlling developments and by the profitability planning from which the organization can gain benefit within a short term. This hypothesis was strengthened by surveys too conducted among managers in multinational firms.
M16|Trends of the Sales Force Monitoring Development in Multinational Firms|The sales-force is one of the most important function in the marketing mix in case of many companies. It comes more into prominence when the company operates in business to business relations. The objective of this research to explore and present the development trends of the sales-force controlling procedures in field-force oriented, multinational firms. Having the sales-force management in key functionality is essential to support this field by well developed innovative reporting system. Decisions are strongly influenced by the sales force reports, so their continuous developments plays very important role in the companies’ life. Without that the firm will lose its position in the strong competition. So it is essential to invest in the sales force monitoring developments.
M16|Revisiting and Reinforcing the Farmers Fox Theory: A Study (Test) of Three Cases in Cross-border Inbound Acquisitions|This paper aims to revisit and reinforce the early-development of Farmers Fox theory (Reddy et al. 2014a) through analyzing three cases in cross-border inbound acquisitions stream. A qualitative case method is adopted to explore findings from sampling cases include Vodafone-Hutchison telecom deal, Bharti Airtel-MTN broken telecom deal and Vedanta-Cairn India oil deal. We have highlighted discussions on organizational factors, due diligence issues, deal characteristics and country-specific determinants. Importantly, we have tested various theories propounded in economics and organization’s literature, and thereby established an interdisciplinary setting both to redefine the theory and to reframe the propositions. We thus propose that the government officials’ erratic nature and ruling political party influence was more in foreign inward deals that characterize higher bid value, listed target company, cash payment, and stronger government control in the industry. Lastly, the findings from this case research not only help researchers in strategy and international business but also help multinational managers participating in cross-border negotiations.
M16|Macroeconomic Change, and Cross-border Mergers and Acquisitions: The Indian Experience, 1991-2010|The purpose of this paper is to analyze the market for cross-border mergers and acquisitions (CB-M&A) representing the Asian emerging market-India for the period 1991 through 2010. I also compare the market in India among the BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia and China (including Hong Kong)) for various reasons. To do so, I use statistical data on CB-M&A transactions from UNCTAD’s World Investment Report-2011, and discuss potential changes in the market performance based on inductive and deductive logics and case examples. I check macroeconomic indicators of the BRIC group in order to support the economic, banking and financial reforms in India. Further, I highlight the internationalization process of Indian firms by supporting the data on parent corporations and foreign affiliates. I eventually draw conclusions from India’s share as a percentage of the world economy, developing economies, BRIC group and Asia. All in all, India is next to China for all selected categories.
M16|The impact of the global financial crisis on border-crossing mergers and acquisitions: A continental/industry analysis|While referring to the recent study on the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, and cross-border mergers and acquisitions in 26 countries (Reddy, Nangia, & Agrawal, 2014b), this paper aims to further examine the impact of financial crisis on the later form of market in 13 sub-continentals, three sectors and 21 industries. Using their research design, we define and test the hypotheses whilst improve the discussion on historical views of the financial crisis and market for inbound acquisitions in the world economy, developed markets, developing markets and BRIC group. We find that rate of growth in number (value) of cross-border acquisitions has markedly declined reporting to continentals and industries around the crisis. We eventually suggest that emerging market economies in Asia, Africa and Latin American regions are found to be exciting in attracting direct international investments from both developed and other developing markets whilst focusing deeply on fiscal deregulation and policy amendments, particularly during post-crisis.
M16|Extant Reviews on Entry-mode/Internationalization, Mergers & Acquisitions, and Diversification: Understanding Theories and Establishing Interdisciplinary Research|This paper aims at accomplishing three objectives while drawing attention to the speed of adapting international management practices in emerging markets. Firstly, we summarize 67 extant review studies on entry-mode/internationalization, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and diversification. Secondly, a synopsis of 17 theories propounded in different disciplines refer to business organization and management is being presented, namely theory of foreign direct investment, market imperfections theory, theory of transaction cost economics, internalization theory, eclectic paradigm, Uppsala theory of internationalization, long-purse theory, resource-based-view theory, resource dependence theory, theory of competitive advantage, organizational learning theory and learning-by-doing, bargaining power theory, information asymmetry theory, agency theory, institutional theory, liability of foreignness, and market efficiency theory. Lastly, we propose a two-band model both for establishing interdisciplinary research and for promoting more theory building research in global strategic management. Further, we also recommend a few research arguments for potential explorations in entry-mode, M&A and diversification.
M16|Market for Corporate Control and Contractual Buyout (CoBO): A New “Collective Ownership-and-Administrative” Strategy|Contractual buyout (CoBO) is a new “collective ownership and joint administrative strategy”, which gives an opportunity to buy a target firm in the given period when the given contract ends between acquirer, target firm, and financier. It is a takeover defensive method and tends to avail tax advantage via entering CoBO deal. In particular, it would be efficient inorganic magnetic for international venture capitalists and private equity firms while entering foreign markets. More specifically, CoBO is likely a concept of Dating-before-Merging and it would be the better model for cross-border mergers and acquisitions integration strategy. The explored CoBO propositions may be useful in various implications such as information symmetry and administrative changes, employment and employee role, operating performance and financial arrangement, tax savings, choice of market entry strategy, integration strategy, and government and policy makers. We recommend the developed country investors choose CoBO as investment vehicle to avail the competent business opportunities in both emerging and budding economies.
M16|The State of Case Study Research in Mergers & Acquisitions: A Review of the Literature in Different Management Streams|Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the state of case study research in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) literature that account for different management streams. It also recommends directions for future research and suggests fruitful guidelines for establishing better research rigor in qualitative methods. Methodology: This study draws attention to the case study method in qualitative research and thereby aims to review previous studies using said approach in M&A related literature. Findings: The main findings include, 57 journal articles are found to be using different qualitative methods of which 40 (17) articles have focused on developed (emerging) markets, single (multiple) case based studies are 29 (24) and remaining four have used survey and interview methods. Importantly, a meager number of studies have accomplished the purpose of case study research in business administration, i.e. testing extant theory and building new theory. Albeit, doing case study research among emerging markets is exiting and these institutional countries provide a unique setting to build theory as well as advance the current knowledge because of increasing prospects for M&A and other growth strategies. Research limitations: This stylized review of case study research in M&A literature is limited to journal publications and qualitative methods. Hence, a survey of qualitative and quantitative methods in growth strategies is left to future research. Practical implications: Qualitative researchers, in general, would benefit from the bibliometric analysis and comprehensive summary of past research. While, case study researchers, in particular, would benefit not only form the later content but also from suggestions reflecting the research quality and validity. Originality: This study, indeed, is an original attempt at presenting the current state and review of case study method in M&A research, provided no earlier study claims this.
M16|Why do Cross-border Merger/Acquisition Deals become Delayed, or Unsuccessful? – A Cross-Case Analysis in the Dynamic Industries|The purpose of this paper is to analyze three litigated cross-border inbound acquisitions that associated with Asian emerging market-India, namely Vodafone-Hutchison and Bharti Airtel-MTN deals in the telecommunications industry, and Vedanta-Cairn India deal with oil and gas exploration industry. To do so, we adopt a legitimate method in qualitative research, that is, case study method and thereby perform a unit of analysis and cross-case analysis. We suggest that government officials’ erratic nature and ruling political party influence were more in foreign inward deals that characterize higher bid value, listed target company, cash payment, and stronger government control in the industry. Importantly, the liability of foreignness and liability of localness was found to be severe in Indian-hosted deals that describe higher valuation, cash payment and dynamic industry. We eventually propose implications of mergers and acquisitions for extractive industries thus to enhance productivity and improve welfare measures during post-integration phase.
M16|Determinants of Cross-border Mergers and Acquisitions: A Comprehensive Review and Future Direction|The purpose of this paper is to review and summarize earlier studies analyzing the determinants of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As). We primarily describe the motives of cross-border acquisitions and present the market performance for corporate control transactions over the period 1994-2013. Then, we illustrate the factors affecting cross-border investments and acquisitions in various taxonomies, namely deal-specific factors, firm- and industry-specific attributes, organizational learning and prior-acquisition experience, and country-specific factors. We draw special attention to the country-specific taxonomy for various reasons include economic and financial markets environment, institutional and regulatory framework, political situation (including corruption), tax system, accounting and valuation matters, geographical factors and cultural issues. We also provide a synopsis of earlier studies addressing the diversification motive in M&A decision. We thus propose that a host-country’s institutional laws and regulatory system, accounting and tax provisions, economic performance, financial markets development, investor protection, geographical, political and cultural factors distinctly affect cross-border acquisition’s completion. Lastly, we outline contemporary issues in M&A research, and suggest promising areas for future exploration.
M16|Worker problem-solving and the nature of the firm: new theory, new evidence|This paper proposes a different theory of the firm and demonstrates how it can be employed to yield hypotheses about differences in innovation and human resource strategy according to the shareholder/stakeholder and liberal/coordinated market dichotomies. The theory assumes that feasible production and demand sets are nonconvex due to interaction among activities; thus firms exist to permit the identification and exploitation of profit opportunities through coordinated action. This implies that firms face a nonconvex profit landscape comparable to the fitness landscapes invoked in evolutionary biology. Given the complexity of these landscapes and the uncertainty of the location of profit hills, there is a tradeoff between exploiting existing or adjacent hills and prospecting for more distant ones: the first minimizes risk, the second maximizes potential profit. A further assumption is then introduced, that shareholder firms seek to maximizes the present value of expected future profit streams, while stakeholder firms maximize the likelihood of achieving profitability over a given time horizon. Combining these theoretical priors, we characterize the likely innovation, organizational and human resource characteristics of the two types of firms and the effects exerted by their external environment, as described in the Varieties of Capitalism literature. These theoretical predictions are confirmed in a set of case studies of a stakeholder firm in liberal and coordinated environments and a shareholder firm in a coordinated environment. This is seen through differences in the role of worker problem-solving, which brings together innovation and learning, organizational structure and human resource strategy.
M16|Multivector strategy vs quantum strategy by Apple Inc|We propose that the quantum strategy can be considered as a most effective winning virtuous organizational strategy, allowing the board of directors to build a prosperous organization with the optimal business model in the economies of the scale and scopes at the time of the great opportunities and unexpected challenges by the globalization. We provide a concise definition on the quantum strategy: The organizational strategy, which can be derived with the use of the quantum strategy search algorithm by the interlocking interconnecting directors in the board of directors in the modern organization at the time of the global integration. We demonstrate that the quantum strategy search algorithm applies the quantum logic (the probabilistic logic) on the top of the inductive, deductive and abductive logics (the value based logics), aiming to create the most effective optimal winning virtuous organizational strategy by the interlocking interconnecting directors in the board of directors in the modern organization in the information century. We highlight the main existing differences between the multivector strategy (the multiple different strategies implementation at the selected time period) and the quantum strategy (the most effective optimal winning virtuous organizational strategy implementation at the selected time period), considering the real-life case study on the strategy formulation and execution by the interlocking interconnecting directors in the board of directors in the Apple Inc. We express a research opinion that the quantum strategy can be clearly defined/distinguished in line with the generally accepted scientific definitions/meanings/ principles in the quantum mechanics science. We think that the prosperous organizations will create and implement the quantum strategies to increase their valuations and outperform the competitors in the economies of the scales and scopes at the time of globalization.
M16|Teleological Dynamics of Organizational Performance: From Process to Practice and Performance|Workforce education forms one of the core aspects of organizational learning which aims for performance as well as efficiency. Learning is goal oriented in business organizations. Organizations activities are highly oriented towards customer satisfaction. Organizations learn from practice and delivery of services to meet consumer needs and necessities. Perfection, efficiency and smart practices define today’s multinational organizational culture. But how multinational organizations achieve such perfections in their business operations? This paper addresses this issue by linking teleological aspects of learning and practice to performance, adoption of routines, and learning-induced adaptation in order to explain how they achieve “perfection” in practice and operations. The paper furthermore attempts to study a particular aspect of organizational (teleological perfectionism) process by modeling scenarios which define goal oriented organizational learning and adaptation, and underpins how such teleological processes effectively benefits organizations in the long run. Conclusions drawn up from an example being modeled in this paper suggests that the role of teleology, or teleological dynamics play significant role in shaping today’s organizations and help explain some (or high) degree of perfectionism in their operations.
M16|Global Strategy of Asian Market Enterprises|Emerging Markets have recently been attracting increasing attention in investors’ minds as the post financial meltdown of 2008 and the series of Euro crises have been casting a deep shadow of gloom and uncertainty on the economic performance of the developed economies. Specifically, two important issues are associated with the internationalization of Asian market enterprises (AMEs), namely free-flow of investment at ease of exchange norms and the recent global financial crisis. In addition, availability of free-cash-flows and limited expansion of local markets are the other major factors that push many AMEs to choose internationalization as a growth strategy. Thus, all the papers are original contributions in this special issue and it is our view that they will lead to better understanding of the implications of managing global strategy from a cross section of Asian companies and a richer understanding of the theoretical issues in global strategic management.
M16|Hodnocení vlivu zastoupení rodiny ve vlastnické a řídící struktuře firem na jejich finanční výkonnost pomocí metody zkoumání shody párů<BR>[Evaluating the Impact of Family Presence in Ownership and Management on Financial Performance of Firms Using Matched-Pair Investigation]|The role of family businesses in management theory has been getting a topic of interest of academics and practitioners. This paper deals with the analysis of performance and financial structure gaps between Czech family and nonfamily firms. Using surname matching definition, we created a sample of 890 Czech large and medium-sized family businesses. Then we used the matched-pair investigation to determine the major gaps in profitability, labor productivity, liquidity and leverage between family and nonfamily firms. The results suggest that Czech family businesses are more profitable in terms of return on assets, profit margin and absolute values of earnings. Czech family businesses also have higher labor productivity and capital intensity, however, the asset turnover appears to be lower. Another important finding is that the overall level of debt is lower in the case of family companies which is accompanied by a higher level of liquidity and working capital.
M16|Success factors and development barriers perceived by the Polish born global companies. Empirical study results|The paper presents a review of literature concerning the success factors and development barriers of the born global companies, followed by results of two empirical studies conducted in Poland in 2012 and 2013. The first was performed with use of the individual interview technique, followed by content analysis of the conversation transcripts. The second was a CATI survey of 256 Polish born global companies, the first such survey in Poland performed on such a wide sample. The research revealed that the Polish born globals perceive product quality and pricing as their main success factors. They face similar managerial and environmental challenges as described in literature concerning companies based in foreign countries.
M16|Innovation, institutions and cultures: Exploring the European context|The aim of this explorative study is to provide a systematic mapping of the most innovative firms in Europe, in order to identify their distinctive local innovation dynamics in terms of geographical, sectoral and cultural distribution. The research seeks to assess whether innovation performance in Europe is “culture-specific”. From the findings, it emerges that the most innovative clusters are the Nordic Cluster, the Anglo Cluster and the Germanic Cluster. This supports the idea that innovation performance is indeed “culture-specific”.
M16|Universitaetsmanagement und universitaere Individualitaet|Die Forschung verdeutlicht, dass es zwischen Universitaeten vielfaeltige managementrelevante Unterschiede gibt. Jede Universitaet besitzt managementrelevante Individualitaet. Hierzu zaehlen die universitaeren Idealvorstellungen der Wissenschaftler, die mit ihrer Arbeit den Erfolg ihrer Universitaeten bestimmen. Die tatsaechliche Beruecksichtigung und Nutzung universitaerer Individualitaet im Universitaetsmanagement blieb jedoch bislang weitgehend unerforscht. Vor diesem Hintergrund wurde in der Untersuchung, die diesem Buch zugrunde liegt, zunaechst der Frage nachgegangen, wie deutlich die Personen, die in Universitaeten Managementaufgaben wahrnehmen, die Individualitaet ihrer eignen Organisation in den Blick nehmen. Leitungspersoenlichkeiten unterschiedlicher organisationaler Ebenen – darunter Rektoren und Stabsstellenleiter – konnten umfassend dahingehend untersucht werden, wie sich in ihren Meinungen, Situationsdefinitionen und -interpretationen, Legitimationen, Erklaerungen und Bewertungen kausaler Zusammenhaenge das Individuelle ihrer eigenen Universitaet widerspiegelt. Aufgrund der identifizierten Unterschiede zwischen den untersuchten Personen interessierten dann im zweiten Schritt die Ursachen dieser Differenzen. Der Arbeit liegt eine systemtheoretische Perspektive zugrunde. Das spezielle Erkenntnisinteresse erforderte eine neue Variante systemtheoretisch fundierter empirischer Forschung sowie eine breite Auseinandersetzung mit dem systemtheoretischen Konzept der strukturellen Kopplung.
M16|Privatization in Romania – A Challenge both For the Government and For the Companies|The privatization in Romania was conceived as an extended program, including on one side a free component and on the other side selling block shares to interested investors. The positive aspect of this process, undoubtedly, is represented by the privatization of the economic activity, with direct measurable result in the increase of its contribution to the GDP. The privatization process was conducted in parallel with the establishment of the capital market that played the role of an accelerator that transmitted the information to possible investors from the company equally with the transmission of information toward the company from the investors. However, excepting the last 3 years, this method has been underused unlike traditional methods. The results obtained following the calling of this method have been positive, with little exceptions when deficiencies wave been registered, while preparing the listing.
M16|The Impact of Fractionalization on Cultural Distance Measures|We examine the impact of ethno-linguistic fractionalization (ELF) on existing cultural measures employed in various social sciences. Not only do high levels of fractionalization affect the use of statistical means to account for cultural distance, we show that it is not constant and therefore the dynamics of change need to be addressed. This provides us with an opportunity to bridge the cultural distance and institutional distance literature as institutions impact upon culture and MNEs, and institutional development is, in turn, affected by these. We call for a more realistic assessment of what is being captured in cultural measures and for recognition of the complexity of the notion of identity formation and its dynamics. Countries may have different underlying cultural schisms, including ELF, and its introduction will allow for a richer exploration of distance and diversity in the social sciences.
M16|Risk Perception in an Arab Country|The main aim of this paper is to examine risk perception in transport among a representative sample of the Jordanian public.The results are based on a questionnaire surveys carried out among a representative sample of the Jordanian public in 2013. The results showed that transport risks fell into two main categories: public and private mode of transport. Respondents assessed the probability of experiencing risk as lower for themselves than others, and they were also more worried about others experiencing a transport threat.Overall, worry was found to be the most important predictor of risk perception. Female subjects were found to emphasize worry in regard to both public and private transportation. Worry was found to be most important in regard to public transportation whereas probability assessments (i.e. cognitive evaluations) were found to be most important in regard to private mode of transport. This difference may guide how risk is communicated to the public.
M16|Study on employees? satisfaction in the Total Quality Management context. Evidence from Romanian metal industry|The present paper aims to present a model for evaluating and analysing the employees? satisfaction, seen as internal customers, from the Romanian metallic confections industry. This study is part of a more complex research whose objective was to develop a diagnostic model for implementation and development of total quality management system. In this sense, this paper focuses on the employees? satisfaction analysis as a measure of leadership effectiveness, as an important component of total quality management system. Regarding the research methodology, the study was based on an exploratory and explanatory research type, being conducted on a representative sample of 14 companies from the Romanian metallic confections industry, therefore, the research sample consisted of 388 employees within those companies. Regarding the research tools, as methods of data collection was used a survey based on questionnaire and a semi-structured interview with the firms sampled employees. The questionnaire was composed of 112 items divided into a number of 7 variables, which evaluate and analyse the employees? satisfaction, in this respect, a number of 500 questionnaires was distributed which were collected and validated 388 which means a response rate of 77.6% which is considered good. Also, within the qualitative research was used a semi-structured interview with the managers of firms sampled. The results of the study are intended to ensure and strengthen the competitive advantage of analysed firms and industry.
M16|Trans-nationalisation of a main office in a multinational firm|The purpose of this research is to prove quantitatively whether the transformation of the international business model of a Japanese multinational firm has influenced the trans-nationalisation and diversity in the main office in Japan. Moreover, it is proving quantitatively the influence of the management on the move-in region by trans-nationalisation and diversity of a Japanese main office. According to the previous research, it was traditionally one of the big traits of the personnel system of a Japanese multinational firm that trans-nationalisation of employment does not progress as compared with a European or American company. However, the consciousness of the top managers of a Japanese multinational firm is changing recently. The top managers of Japanese multinational firm recently faced the big transformation of the management environment that an emerging-countries market grows up rapidly, while the Gross Domestic Product of Japan fell to the third in the world. As a research methodology, a questionnaire was given to the multinational firms which has advanced to emerging countries. In conclusion, it was verified that trans-nationalisation of a main office has progressed because the international business model in the emerging countries of a Japanese firm converted. Moreover, it was verified that trans-nationalisation of a main office has promoted the relationship with various stakeholders in an emerging country as an effect on management.
M16|The Management Control Exerted By American And Japanese Multinational Corporations Operating In Thailand|With subsidiaries operating in various countries, MNCs find themselves surrounded by the complexity and cultural diversity that are different from their home countries. MNCs need to develop and choose the appropriate degree of management control to exert on their subsidiaries. The objectives of this research are (1) To study the factors that influence the degree of management control used by MNC headquarters on their subsidiaries in Thailand; (2) To study the degree of management control that American and Japanese MNCs exerted on their subsidiaries in Thailand; (3) To study the variables that influence the effectiveness of both American and Japanese subsidiaries in Thailand; and (4) To study the effect of management control exerted by American and Japanese MNCs on their subsidiary effectiveness. The research uses a survey-based method to examine American and Japanese subsidiaries operating in Thailand. The results indicate that (1) the degree of MNC ownership plays an essential role in determining the degree of each type of control system that the parent company might choose to control its subsidiaries; (2) the Nationality of MNC have influence the degree of control employed over their subsidiaries; (3) Cultural distance also plays as an important role in determining the degree of particular types of control; (4) Decision-making structure influences only the degree of output control used over the subsidiaries, but does not influence the degree of input control. The findings also indicate that American companies use both input control and output control more than do Japanese companies. Regarding the effectiveness of MNC?s subsidiaries, cultural distance is the only contextual factor found to play an important role in achieving the effectiveness of the subsidiary. In addition, the degree of input control used by American and Japanese MNCs over their subsidiaries in Thailand does not play an important role in determining the effectiveness of the subsidiary. On the other hand, output control will influence the subsidiary effectiveness when considered with other contextual factors. In summary, the subsidiaries will achieve high or low effectiveness when the degree of output control used over it are considered or examined with other contextual variables.
M16|What do business managers value when they negotiate? Empirical evidence from the Arabian Gulf|Social psychological outcomes subjectively valued by Middle Eastern Arab business negotiators were explored through a qualitative interview-based study. Participants included 15 business managers from various organizations in the Muscat metropolitan area of Oman for whom negotiation constitutes an essential part of the job. The semi-structured format of the interviews ensured consistency and flexibility in the data collection. Analysis of the narratives showed that the subjective value structure includes the following components: balance and moderation, concern for the negotiation outcomes of the counterpart, the motivation to create a win-win situation, honesty, patience, trust and trustworthiness. Managerial implications for the practice of cross-cultural negotiations are discussed.
M16|Designing the Structure in similar Cultures: A comparative study between Japan and Jordan|As considerable research has examined cultural influences on organizations exploring if cultural similarities between nations might lead businesses to matched structures arise an important issue. Hence, this study aims to examine the structure of Jordanian and Japanese companies on subjective cultural and the objective structural characteristics. The cultural characteristics of Jordan and Japan were established on their power distance and uncertainty avoidance orientations, and the structural characteristics were established on the locus of decision making and the degree of structuring of activities. The sample comprised of twelve companies each from Jordan and Japan matched in size, dependence and operation technology. Data of the Jordanian companies were collected through structured interviews and data of Japanese companies were derived from Azumi and McMillan?s study (1975) that used the same instrument of measurement. The analysis revealed that on the cultural dimensions a ?full bureaucracy? is a preferred structure in Jordan and Japan because it fits the desired ?pyramid form? in the minds of Jordanian and Japanese managers, but on the structural dimensions, results revealed that companies in Jordan and Japan are designed in a ?personnel bureaucracy? form of structure. The results have implications for further research in cross-cultural comparative management.

M16|Generation Y on the e-commerce market. Comparison between Polish and South Korean young consumers’ behaviour|This article investigates the problem of Polish and South Korean Millennials’ consumer behaviour on the e-commerce market. There were arguments about whether Generation Y members as Digital Natives are rather a coherent or diversified cohort of consumers. They were raised in the culturally diversified world, but the trend of globalization and the use of the Internet may in fluence their consumer behaviour in a similar way. The aim of this paper is to reveal particular patterns crucial to understanding their way of making an online purchase. An online survey was conducted among Polish and South Korean respondents from Generation Y in order to investigate this issue. Besides being the representatives of culturally distant cultures, the two groups from the research sample revealed mostly convergent preferences and attitudes towards making an online purchase. Also, Polish and South Korean respondents revealed different attitudes online and of fline, when compared to the cohort general analysis. In terms of making an online purchase via their mobile phones, Poles and Koreans remained coherent outside their national group and diversified inside their national group in terms of e-commerce but patterns slightly differed. Since this research was limited by too general e-commerce context, the aspect of making m-purchase should be investigated in the future.
M16|Overseas factories, domestic employment, and technological hollowing out: a case study of Samsung’s mobile phone business|Analysing the case of Samsung Electronics’ mobile phone business, this paper examines the effects of establishing factories abroad on domestic jobs and the issue of technological hollowing out. The offshoring of mobile phone assembly to China, India, Brazil and Vietnam did not result in a reduction of domestic jobs. On the contrary, Samsung’s domestic employment increased from 5960 persons in 2002 to 20,500 in 2012. This increase mainly reflects a net increase in high-paying jobs (R&D, engineering, design, marketing) while the number of low-paying jobs (assembly) remained stagnant. To cope with possible technological hollowing out, Samsung kept its core engineers/technicians in a special unit, instead of firing them, whenever domestic assembly lines were reduced or foreign lines were established. They were kept inside the so-called “global manufacturing technology center,” with the number of its employees increasing from 80 in 2006 to more than 1103 in 2011. These employees visit overseas factories to conduct activities such as maintenance, monitoring, re-modeling of assembly lines, and automation. In terms of strategy, Samsung engages in offshoring, but not outsourcing. This is in contrast to Apple which does both offshoring and outsourcing by contracting with Foxconn.
