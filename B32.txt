B32|The Property Market, Affordability and the Malaysian National Housing Policy|Key Messages • The industry is suffering a downturn that might lead to a wider economic crisis. The negative stage experienced by the housing sector is recognizable in the increasing number of unsold units, in the declining number of transactions and in the progressive cooling down of prices. Failing to recognize this fact would lead to the risk of being unprepared for an economic downturn. • The debate on affordable housing is incomplete if it is not contextualized in the realm of the general evolution of the property market. The current discussion is strongly unbalanced toward the issue of affordability, while the property market’s cyclical dynamic is disregarded; such a tendency could lead to a situation in which the country will not be equipped to face the consequences of the downturn that has already started. • With regard to the affordability issue, the present study argues that home ownership is less of a problem than what the political debate would tend to suggest: with 76.3 per cent of home ownership, Malaysia is performing better than neighbouring countries. • The affordability issue is a complex one, and looking at it simply by looking at the ratio between median house price and median income is simplistic and misleading; in order to decide what is affordable is a choice involving a trade-off between three elements: price, floor area and location. • The low-end market segment is not disregarded by the private developers because it is naturally unprofitable, but because it is artificially made unprofitable by a series of regulatory obstacles that become supply-side bottlenecks. Recommendations • In order to face a downturn in the property market, this paper suggests primarily acting to address home-owners’ negative equities. In the case of the emergence of a severe mortgage crisis, loan condition modifications should be helpful in seeking to reboot homeowners’ damaged balance sheets in an effort to arrest a prolonged deleveraging process and more quickly restore household demand to levels no longer dominated by negative home equity. Keep in mind that this should be an emergency measure to be implemented only in dramatic circumstances. • Fiscal discipline and strict down-payment rules are recommended. In particular, it would be important for the government to monitor quantity and quality of the expenses, being clear on how eventual deficits are financed. With reference to down-payment rules, mortgage, property insurance, and property taxes should not exceed 30 percent of income. • Redesign of the fiscal system in favour of consumption taxes rather than income taxes. A mix of GST and reduced income taxes can be studied in order to ensure a source of income for the government from one side and to orient consumer attitudes toward saving, and so support re-building the monetary funds available for investment projects. • The better way to generate affordable projects would be to remove regulatory obstacles, starting with reducing the direct involvement of government agencies in building low-cost homes. • In contrast with what is suggested by the National Housing Policy, too-strict requirements for low-cost developments (i.e. minimum size) should be avoided in order to facilitate the interaction between supply and demand, taking into account the location and size factors, and therefore allowing lower income people to move toward the economic heart of the country, supporting thus not only their housing issues but also promoting their possibilities for a higher degree of social mobility. • Disruptive entrepreneurship will play a key role in developing new technologies for making housing developments cheaper from the cost side. However, in order to emerge such kind of entrepreneurship requires freedom to react to market signals and cannot be centrally designed, because of the specific nature of entrepreneurial discovery processes. • A higher role for the rental market is expected to emerge in the future. Under this perspective, the government might consider Jacob’s proposal of guaranteed-rent homes, where the central authority guarantees the loan for those developers investing in affordable projects, and partially covers the rent disbursement, in order to make the projects both affordable and economically viable. This method would have the advantage of avoiding capital expenditure from the government side, and moreover of decreasing current expenditures whenever the subsidised tenants improve their economic conditions.
B32|Tony Atkinson and his Legacy|Tony Atkinson is universally celebrated for his outstanding contributions to the measurement and analysis of inequality, but he never saw the study of inequality as a separate branch of economics. He was an economist in the classical sense, rejecting any sub-field labelling of his interests and expertise, and he made contributions right across economics. His death on 1 January 2017 deprived the world of both an intellectual giant and a deeply committed public servant in the broadest sense of the term. This collective tribute highlights the range, depth and importance of Tony's enormous legacy, the product of over fifty years' work.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

B32|В Память Об Академике Богомолове<BR>[In Memory of Academician Bogomolov]|The paper shows some of the most important points in life and work of Oleg Timofeevich Bogomolov, a great Russian economist and an Academician of AS USSR and RAS. Even though in his 88-year long life Oleg Timofeevich was considered one of the best Soviet and Russian scientists and awarded many prizes, his work has so far not had corresponding social impact. This especially applies to his opinions and papers written in the period of perestroika and market reforms, when his warnings were largely ignored, although they proved to be prophetic. В статье показаны основные даты жизни и работы Олега Тимофеевича Богомолова, великого русского экономиста, академика АН СССР и РАН. Хотя в течение почти 88-летней жизни Олег Тимофеевич слыл за одного из лучших советских и российских учёных, даже приобрел не мало признаний и наград, его работы как правило не имели должного общественного влияния. Особенно подчёркиваются его положения и работы в период перестройки и рыночных реформ, когда его предупреждения не были приняты, хотя и оказались пророческими.

Coase to Economic]|The paper discusses the contribution of R. H. Coase to economics and his role as a founder of the new institutional economics. Coase also contributed to the establishment of Law and Economics as a discipline, he is the author of the transaction cost theory and of the Coase Theorem. The paper discusses main aspects of his theory and his core theoretical contributions including more recent ones as well as their impact on the development of the economic theory and economic policy. The role of transaction costs, well established property rights, the institutional framework and the need to relate economic analysis to the real economic development and to overcome the isolation of the formal economic analysis are identifi ed as crucial contributions of Coase to economics relevant for the current stage of the development of economics and economic systems.

B32|Albert Hirschman: a celebration|"The article is the opening address at the Conference “Albert Hirschman scienziato sociale” held in Rome on the 6th May 2014 at the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei and at the presence of the President of Italian Republic, Sen. Giorgio Napolitano. A previous version of this article was published in Italian and available on line on Moneta e Credito, 2014, vol. 67, issue 266, pages 159–165 ( http://ojs.uniroma1.it/index.php/monetaecredito/index ). In this article the author traces the cultural and political environment of Hirschman stating that he ""was a formidable enemy of the narrow lines of reasoning called 'the economic approach', which had—and still has—much following among many economists and some sociologists, who celebrate economics as a 'conquering discipline'. Rather than having social studies influenced by the emaciated understanding of economics that has weakened economics itself, Hirschman was keen on enriching economics by incorporating social, political and cultural considerations"".

B32|Lawrence R. Klein 1920–2013: Notes on the early years|Klein can well be said to have created the field of macroeconometric modeling almost singlehandedly. His international influence started at an early stage. The article offers scattered archive observations on Klein's early years from undergraduate study to the University of Pennsylvania in 1958. Klein was in 1944 recruited by the Cowles Commission in Chicago to construct the first macroeconomic model in the USA, drawing on the experiences of the interwar modeling work of Jan Tinbergen and the new path-breaking econometric methods developed by Trygve Haavelmo. The first Klein model was taken into use at the end of 1945 to shed light on the prospects for the US economy in the transition from war to peace. After two-three years in Chicago Chicago, Klein traveled for a year in Europe and initiated macroeconometric modeling work in Canada, at the University of Michigan, and at Oxford University. This was only the beginning of the lifelong influence exerted on modelers around the globe. The article pays attention to Klein's relation to Paul Samuelson, Jacob Marschak, Trygve Haavelmo, Ragnar Frisch, and others.

B32|Routines Resistance: How Conflicts within Transactive Memory Obstruct Routinization|Routines resistance is observed among groups of experts that experienced a significant redefinition of their tasks and organizational goals within in a large French government agency. To expose the origins of such resistance, we investigate the processes by which transactive autobiographical memory supported organizational identification as an organization of technical experts, and how this memory structure led to the failed memorization of new action patterns which contradicted the pre-existing expert identity. We find that transactive autobiographical memory is deeply related to a complex process of identification, via the association of different contexts of identity, narrative and temporality, reflecting the levels and functions of autobiographical memory. More specifically, problems arose when managerial directives for new coordination actions conflicted with the pre-existing embedded sense of expert identity, related goals and relationships, leading to dis-identification among employees. The result was failed memorization and routine resistance, driven by conflicts with pre-existing transactive autobiographical memory. We propose a model of the micro-foundations of routines which explains these effects.

B32|The BIS and the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s|"The Latin American debt crisis, which broke out in August 1982, was the first global financial crisis in the postwar period. While the crisis started in the ""periphery"", it constituted a threat to the ""core"" of the world economy, as the banking system was under severe pressure. Alongside the IMF, the BIS played an important role in coordinating the international response to the crisis. Moreover, a lot of work at the BIS in the second half of the 1970s had aimed at restraining the debt build-up. Discussions on the rising debt levels were highly influential in shaping the BIS view of financial stability, with the ""macroprudential"" concept at its core. However, in the analysis of the debt buildup, the role of financial innovations was not really captured. In this paper, we focus on the Latin American debt crisis, discussing first the debt build-up, different initiatives to restrain lending and the BIS role in the management of the crisis. We then turn to the ensuing efforts to strengthen the financial system and the emerging BIS approach to financial stability."

B32|Keynes Post Mercantilista|El pensamiento keynesiano puede entenderse como una suerte de derivación de las ideas mercantilistas. El sistema mercantilista no solamente se debe ver como un conjunto de comerciantes cuya pretensión más importante era la de hacer más rico al Estado y a ellos mismos, sino que también se debe analizar desde la perspectiva de la teoría económica, ya que para ellos era igualmente importante pensar en el empleo, por ejemplo. Las ideas de Keynes por su parte, no pueden verse en el vacío, sino que deben tratarse desde el contexto de la historia de las ideas y por lo tanto como producto del mismo devenir. El documento termina reconociendo los aportes que la teorías mercantilistas, en especial en la discusión sobre el empleo tiene el pensamiento keynesiano.

B32|Una riconsiderazione degli studi da Kalecki sull'economia statunitense|Kalecki devised a novel method of analysis, which was also used by some of his collaborators.Unfortunately however, that method has not had the impact it deserves on applied research, not even among his followers. The objective of the present paper is to revisit Kalecki’s applied studies. I will in the first place explain and discuss Kalecki’s outlook and methodology. In the second place, I will use it to see how much it can help to understand the recent evolution of the US economy. In the current US crisis, monetary policy, in the shape of quantitative easing and historically low rates of interest, has been hailed by publicists and pundits as the solution to confront the decline of private spending and the business downswing. The results of have been rather disappointing. Using Kalecki’s approach and methodology, I have verified that it has been public spending that has played the key role to avoid a deeper crisis than the one that actually took place.

B32|Pierangelo Garegnani: Policy Implications of the Critique of Political Economy|Notwithstanding his fundamental contribution to the critique of the neoclassical notion of capital, we maintain that Pierangelo Garegnani’s research has been especially characterized by the reconstruction of an alternative approach to economics. Following Sraffa’s lead, Garegnani found such an alternative approach in the Classical theory of value and distribution, and put forward a Classical-Keynesian theory for output determination. In this approach, prices are not scarcity indexes, the absence of any spontaneous tendency to full employment abolishes optimality of market economies, income distribution results from social − not natural − forces. The policy implications of this approach are considered.

B32|Alexandre Lamfalussy and the origins of the BIS macro-prudential approach to financial stability|Among the international policy institutions, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is known for its sensitivity to financial stability issues. Typical for the BIS is a ï¿½macro-prudentialï¿½ approach. In this paper, it is argued that Alexandre Lamfalussy, who was at the BIS from 1976 to 1993, played a crucial role in shaping the BIS approach. Typical for Lamfalussy are a broad macroeconomic view and a focus on the systemically important institutions. In Lamfalussyï¿½s view, there is thus very much an overlap between the micro- and macro-prudential dimensions of financial stability. The main reasons for his sensitivity to financial fragility were: a ï¿½Keynesianï¿½ Weltanschauung (that a market economy is not sufficiently self-correcting), the emphasis of Dupriez (his teacher) on cycles, Lamfalussyï¿½s experience as a commercial banker, BIS involvement in financial stability issues, especially the Latin American debt crisis of 1982-83 and research on financial innovations.

B32|On the origins of the BIS macro-prudential approach to financial stability: Alexandre Lamfalussy and financial fragility|"Among the international policy institutions, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is known for its sensitivity to financial stability issues. Attention to the ""macro-prudential"" dimension of financial stability is very typical for the BIS. The Bank's macro-prudential approach first came to the fore in the 1986 Cross Report. It defined the macro-prudential domain as ""the safety and soundness of the broad financial system and payments mechanism"". In this paper, it will be argued that Alexandre Lamfalussy, who was at the BIS from 1976 to 1993, played a crucial role in shaping the Bank's approach to financial stability. Lamfalussy is renowned for taking a broad macroeconomic view and for focusing on the systemically important financial institutions, as the failure of one of these individual institutions would threaten the whole financial system. In Lamfalussy's view, there is thus very much an overlap between the micro- and macro-prudential dimensions of financial stability. This paper traces Lamfalussy's analysis of financial fragility and goes into the reasons for his sensitivity to it. Among the main elements involved were: a ""Keynesian"" Weltanschauung (that a market economy is not sufficiently self-correcting); the emphasis of Dupriez (his teacher in Louvain) on cycles; Lamfalussy's own experience as a commercial banker; BIS involvement in financial stability issues, especially the Latin American debt crisis of 1982-83; and research in the central banking community on financial innovations in the early 1980s"

B32|Charles Feinstein (1932–2005), And British Historical National Accounts|The Meade and Stone approach to national accounting (first published for the UK in 1941) eventually provided the template for the United System of National Accounts. Feinstein’s historical national accounts for the UK developed out of this project and built on its earlier contributions. He was the foremost constructor of historical accounts in the UK, and shared with other national accounting pioneers a pragmatic approach and a bias against neo-classical general equilibrium. He made important contributions to growth accounting and the measurement of standards of living, and also left his mark as a teacher and as an academic leader. His commitment to racial equality in South Africa preceded his academic career, and continued after his formal retirement.
B32|The age of Professor Narmadeshwar Jha|Professor Narmadeshwar Jha was a noted scholar on History of Economic Thought that took its shape under the influence of Alfred Marshall. His widely referred book - The Age of Marshall: Aspects of British Economic Thought, 1890-1915 – was written under the supervision of Professor A.J. Brown of Leeds (UK) and published with a commendatory foreword written by Sir Dennis H. Robertson. Professor Jha devised a methodology to conduct research in the history of economic ideas. This brief paper presents Professor Jha as a teacher, economist and scholar.

B32|Paolo Sylos Labini, 1920-2005|In this article, Alessandro Roncaglia renders a careful and detailed intellectual tribute to the memory of Paolo Sylos Labini. Roncaglia’s contribution provides at once a biographical account and recounts the intellectual trajectory of his Italian colleague. While Sylos Labini’s theory of oligopoly and his market forms obviously take centre stage in these reflections, they also reach much further afield, including political economy, economic dynamics, interrelations between employment, growth and income distribution, development economics and the history of economic thought. This paper highlights, in equal measure, the contributions and achievements of the economist, as well as the qualities of the person and the impartial and engaged citizen Paolo Sylos Labini.
B32|Paolo Sylos Labini, 1920-2005|The paper outlines the intellectual biography of Paolo Sylos Labini, a great economist with strong civic ideals. After recalling his education (in Rome, then at Harvard with Schumpeter and at Cambridge with Robertson), the paper illustrates his contributions in a variety of fields, ranging from economic policy and applied analysis (including the first econometric model of the Italian economy) to the history of economic thought and the analysis of technical progress, from social classes (with a stress on the role of the middle classes) to underdevelopment, and especially to oligopoly theory, conceived as a general theory of market forms, based on the notion of barriers to entry in an industry. Sylos Labini's political involvement and his strong civic values are also briefly illustrated.

Through a close reading of the author's works on traditional agriculture and the rural world, we introduce his main themes, methodology and ideas, stressing the breakthroughs in many of these lines and theoretical approaches. Julio Caro Baroja's perspective, that combines historical and ethnographic analyses, contributes in a unique and very valuable way to researchers today, whether historians, sociologists or anthropologists.

B32|Economics in Relation to Sociology: Dualisms and Vilfredo Pareto's Pluralistic Methodology|Many economists remember the masters of Lausanne for their important contributions to general equilibrium and welfare economics, but Leon Walras and Vilfredo Pareto both pursued much broader social research agendas. Walras did this within the general framework of economics, by complementing his ‘pure economics’ with ‘social economics’. Pareto, in contrast, first isolated economic theory from the influence of other social phenomena and distinguished between the result of theoretical economics and the concrete economic phenomenon. He then developed a general theory of social equilibrium which, inter alia, provided for a synthetic reconciliation of economics with sociology to understand the concrete phenomenon. This paper investigates the relationship between Pareto’s economics and his sociology. Its main contribution is the clarification of the pluralistic character of his methodology. This is done by considering how dualistic distinctions became an important device for Pareto, with particular reference to Sheila Dow’s notion of dualism and Andrew Mearman’s categories of dualism. Pareto’s pluralistic approach is shown as a neo-positive blend of ‘temporary’ Cartesian and non-Cartesian elements, which is not consistent with Dow’s own Babylonian approach to economics. The paper also reveals the economic phenomena that Pareto considered were dominated by sociological influences and, therefore, not amenable to Cartesian analysis.

B32|Unemployment in Canada and the United States: A Further Analysis|"During the 1980s a substantial gap emerged between unemployment rates in Canada and the United States. In this paper, we use microdata from labor force surveys at the beginning and end of the decade to examine the sources of the emergent gap. As in earlier work, we find that most of the relative rise in unemployment in Canada is attributable to an increase in the relative ""labor force attachment"" of Canadians, rather than to any shortfall in relative employment. Indeed, relative employment rates increased in Canada over the 1980s for younger workers and for adult women. The relative rise in labor force attachment of Canadians is manifested by a sharp increase in the propensity of non-workers to report themselves as unemployed (i.e. looking for work) rather than out-of-the-labor force. This change is especially pronounced for individuals who work just enough to qualify for unemployment insurance (UI) in Canada. Moreover, two- thirds of the relative increase in weeks of unemployment among non-workers is associated with the divergent trends in UI recipiency in the two countries. Both findings point to the availability of UI benefits as an important determinant of the labor force attachment of nonworkers."
