J08|Employment protection and firm-level job reallocation: Adjusting for coverage|This paper finds that employment protection legislation (EPL) had a significant impact on employment adjustment in Europe over 2001-2013, once we account for firm-size related exemptions to EPL. We construct a novel coverage-adjusted EPL indicator and find that EPL hinders employment growth at the firm level and increases the share of firms that remain in the same size class. This suggests that stricter EPL restrains job creation because firms fear the costs of shedding jobs during downturns. We do not find evidence that EPL has positive effects on employment by limiting job losses after adverse shocks. In addition to standard controls for the share of credit-constrained firms and the position in the business cycle, we also control for sizerelated corporate tax exemptions and find that these also significantly constrain job creation among incumbent firms.
J08|Worker Heterogeneity and the Asymmetric Effects of Minimum Wages|This paper explores the notion that minimum wages affect different lowskilled workers asymmetrically due to productivity differences. In a search model with worker heterogeneity, a rising minimum wage lowers the employment and labor force participation of the least productive workers by pricing them out of the market, while having the opposite effect on other low-skilled workers that remain hirable. CPS data supports these predictions; a rise in the minimum reduces the employment and labor force participation of teenagers with less than high school education, but has the opposite effect on prime-age workers with high school attainment. The calibrated model requires small firm surpluses to match these observations. If firm surplus is small due to high nonmarket activity values, a moderate rise in the minimum improves aggregate welfare even when the worker's bargaining weight is high.
J08|On Event Study Designs and Distributed-Lag Models: Equivalence, Generalization and Practical Implications|We discuss important features and pitfalls of panel-data event study designs. We derive the following main results: First, event study designs and distributed-lag models are numerically identical leading to the same parameter estimates after correct reparametrization. Second, binning of effect window endpoints allows identification of dynamic treatment effects even when no never-treated units are present. Third, classic dummy variable event study designs can be naturally generalized to models that account for multiple events of different sign and intensity of the treatment, which are particularly interesting for research in labor economics and public finance.
J08|Universal Childcare for the Youngest and the Maternal Labour Supply|In this paper, we investigate whether the expansion of childcare leads to an increase in the female labour supply. We measure female labour supply at both the extensive and intensive margin. For identification, we exploit a nationwide reform that expanded childcare for 1–2- year-olds in Norway. Our results reveal a significant increase in the overall employment of mothers in the target group, but only weak evidence of an increase in contracted hours of work. However, both adjustments are only short term following the reform. When we consider sub-groups of mothers more closely, we find substantial heterogeneity in the affected outcomes and the timing of these effects. In particular, when we exclude mothers on job-protected maternity leave and with currently zero hours of work from the target group, we estimate even larger effects on employment and now significant effects on actual hours of work. For mothers with more than one child, we find significant long-term effects of the reform on both employment and hours of work.
J08|The Price and Employment Response of Firms to the Introduction of Minimum Wages|This paper studies the price and employment response of firms to the introduction of a nation-wide minimum wage in Germany. In line with previous studies, the estimated employment effect is only modestly negative and statistically insignificant. In contrast, affected firms increased prices much more frequently. The price effect is prevalent across different sectors of the economy including manufacturing and is thus not limited to low wage industries. I document that speed and degree of price pass-through were high and firms rolled over the lion’s share of the costs generated by the minimum wage to their customers. Consistent with the role of price pass-through, I find considerable heterogeneity in firms’ responses to the minimum wage depending on their own business expectations, product market competition, and local labor market conditions.
J08|Does It Matter When Labor Market Reforms Are Implemented? The Role of the Monetary Policy Environment|Do labor market reforms initiated in periods of loose monetary policy yield different outcomes from those that were introduced in periods when monetary tightening prevailed? Since economic theory usually pays attention to the steady state change and ignores business cycle interactions of structural reforms, we connect local projection methodology with the Mallow’s Cp averaging criterion to arrive at an inference that does not require knowledge of the exact functional form, is robust to mis-specification, admits non-linearities, and cross-sectional dependence and addresses uncertainty regarding interactions between labor reforms and macroeconomy. We also develop a test to check the importance of monetary policy for any horizon and the entire impulse response function, taking the multiple testing problem into account. We document that replacement rates deliver substantially different outcomes on real GDP, inflation and real effective exchange rate, whereas labor activation schemes bear different effects on unemployment in low- and high-interest rate environments. There is also evidence of monetary policy trend playing an important role and increasing synchronized monetary and labor market policies across European countries.
J08|Escenarios de ajuste al sistema pensional colombiano|Este documento expone un diagnóstico de los principales problemas en el diseño del sistema pensional colombiano y presenta una comparación de tres escenarios de ajuste posibles: (1) hacer ajustes paramétricos al sistema actual; (2) adoptar un sistema de pilares, con el primer pilar administrado por Colpensiones; y (3) hacer una reforma que cierre el acceso al régimen de prima media (RPM), vinculando a todos los nuevos afiliados al régimen de ahorro individual con solidaridad y garantía de pensión mínima (RAIS). Nuestras simulaciones al 2075 indican que, en valor presente neto, la reforma de cierre del acceso al RPM para nuevos afiliados es muy superior a las otras dos propuestas de reforma y que esta reforma complementada con incrementos en la edad de jubilación, incremento de dos puntos en la tasa de cotización y logrando una mayor formalización del mercado laboral, disminuye el déficit público de pensiones asociado a Colpensiones de 57,2% del PIB en 2075 a 23,2% del PIB. Adicionalmente, esta simulación permite incrementar el ahorro privado institucional en más de 10 puntos del PIB. Finalmente, dados estos resultados se hace una propuesta del escenario deseable de ajuste al sistema pensional colombiano.

J08|The Effects of Working while in School: Evidence from Uruguayan Lotteries|We provide the first estimates of the effects of working while in school that use controlled random variation in job offers. We leverage a Uruguayan program offering 9-to-12-month part-time employment in state-owned companies by lottery to enrolled students. Using social security data matched to the universe of over 120,000 applicants, we estimate a 9% increase in earnings over the four post-program years for youth completing a program job. We find large positive effects on school enrollment during the program year, consistent with the conditionality of the program and smaller effects in the post-program years. Our time-use survey indicates that students substitute leisure and household chores with work, without significant reductions in studying time. Finally, a decomposition of the earnings effect shows that accumulation of work experience can explain the majority of the increase in earnings.
J08|Living with the Neighbors: Demand-Driven Youth Training Programs: Experimental Evidence from Mongolia|Because of its high incidence and potential threat to social cohesion, youth unemployment is a global concern. This study uses a randomized controlled trial to analyze the effectiveness of a demand-driven vocational training program for disadvantaged youth in Mongolia. Mongolia, a transitional country whose economic structure shifted from a communist, centrally planned economy to a free-market economy over a relatively short period, offers a new setting in which to test the effectiveness of standard active labor market policies. This study reports positive and statistically significant short-term effects of vocational training on monthly earnings, skills matching, and self-employment. Substantial heterogeneity emerges as relatively older, richer, and better-educated individuals drive these positive effects. A second intervention that randomly assigns participants to receive repetitive weekly newsletters with information on market returns to vocational training shows positive impacts on the length of exposure to and successful completion of the program. These positive effects, however, are only observed at the intensive margin and do not lead to higher employment or earnings outcomes.
J08|What Works at Scale? A Framework to Scale Up Workforce Development Programs|Workforce development policymakers have access to a growing catalog of training programs evaluated with rigorous randomized controlled trials. This evidence base identifies programs that work in specific geographic and temporal contexts but may not necessarily work in other contexts or at a scale sufficient to meet regional workforce needs. The author examines a sample of recent randomized controlled trials of workforce development programs and reports to what extent this body of evidence informs policymakers about what works at scale. The author finds that most programs are implemented at a small scale, use nonrandom samples from the population of interest, and are concentrated in the most populous urban areas and U.S. states. The author then discusses a method to help state and local policymakers, technical colleges, training providers, and other workforce development organizations adopt evidence-based policies in their local contexts and at scale. The two-step method includes a check on the assumptions in a program’s theory of change and an assessment of the sensitivity of projected results to violations in assumptions such as program completion rates. The author provides an example of the method applied to a hypothetical metropolitan area that seeks to adopt an evidence-based training program for youth with barriers to employment.
J08|The Unintended Consequences of Employer Credit Check Bans for Labor Markets|Over the last decade, 11 states have restricted employers’ access to the credit reports of job applicants. We document a significant decline in county-level vacancies after these laws were enacted: Job postings fall by 5.5 percent in affected occupations relative to exempt occupations in the same county and the same occupation nationwide. Cross-sectional heterogeneity in the estimated effects suggests that employers use credit reports as signals: Vacancies fall more in counties with a large share of subprime residents, while they fall less in occupations with other commonly available signals.
J08|Threat effects of monitoring and unemployment insurance sanctions: evidence from two reforms|This paper studies threat effects of unemployment insurance (UI) benefit sanctions on job exit rates. Using a difference-in-differences design, I exploit two reforms of the Swedish UI system that made monitoring and sanctions considerably stricter at different points in time for different jobseeker groups. The results show that men and long-term unemployed individuals respond to the tighter monitoring and the threat of sanctions by finding jobs faster, whereas women do not. I also estimate the effect of receiving a sanction on the job exit rates and find significant sanction imposition effects. However, a decomposition exercise shows that these sanction imposition effects explain very little of the overall reform effects, so that most of the reform effects arise through threat effects. A direct policy implication is that the total impact of monitoring and sanctions may be severely underestimated when focusing solely on the effects on those actually receiving sanctions.
J08|Universal Childcare for the Youngest and the Maternal Labour Supply|In this paper, we investigate whether the expansion of childcare leads to an increase in the female labour supply. We measure female labour supply at both the extensive and intensive margin. For identification, we exploit a nationwide reform that expanded childcare for 1–2year-olds in Norway. Our results reveal a significant increase in the overall employment of mothers in the target group, but only weak evidence of an increase in contracted hours of work. However, both adjustments are only short term following the reform. When we consider subgroups of mothers more closely, we find substantial heterogeneity in the affected outcomes and the timing of these effects. In particular, when we exclude mothers on job-protected maternity leave and with currently zero hours of work from the target group, we estimate even larger effects on employment and now significant effects on actual hours of work. For mothers with more than one child, we find significant long-term effects of the reform on both employment and hours of work.
J08|Measuring the Effect of Student Loans on the College Dropout Rate|Most governments around the world offer student loans to help disadvantaged students to enroll in college to reduce the attainment gap between rich and poor. However, we know little about the consequences of these loans. The reduction of the gap depends not only on initial enrollment but also on the dropout rate before graduation. This paper shows how the availability of loans affects the dropout rate in college. Two programs in Chile assign loans based on a cutoff in the national college admission test, enabling a regression discontinuity design. The analysis uses on students who were not induced by the loan to enroll in the first year. I show that access to loans reduces the dropout rate by 25 percentage points and is highly persistent over time (up to the fifth year after initial enrollment). At the cutoff, access to loans allows eliminating the differences in the dropout rate by family income. Finally, I find that students are not sensitive to tuition costs when loans are available.
J08|Not Everyone Is Engaged: An Innovative Approach to Measure Engagement Levels on the Labor Market|Individuals' level of engagement on the labor market is hypothesized to be of critical importance for labor market outcomes. Based on a recent labor market survey in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), this paper develops an innovative index to measure individuals' labor market engagement across three dimensions: preferences, intensity, and barriers. The index can also to be used to cluster individuals with similar engagement levels to target labor market interventions more effectively and may be used to roughly measure the effectiveness of labor market interventions across time, as it can calculate the score for out-of-sample individuals. The index is computed individually and in aggregate for six labor market groups: employed, unemployed, and out-of-the-labor force, each separately for men and women. The methodology includes: (i) identifying labor subgroups and engagement dimensions, (ii) identifying relevant variables within each group and dimension, (iii) constructing an index for each group and dimension that captures the relative status of an individual against his/her reference group, and (iv) synthesizing the different engagement dimensions into a single indicator. Findings confirm the strong heterogeneity of labor market engagement in the KSA and the usefulness of differentiating interventions for job searchers depending on which cluster they belong to.

J08|"Understanding ""Wage Theft"": Evasion and Avoidance Responses to Minimum Wage Increases"|A holistic assessment of the labor market effects of minimum wage regulation requires understanding employer compliance. The economics literature has paid little attention to this issue. We investigate how minimum wage increases and the strength of enforcement regimes affect the prevalence of subminimum wage payments. We find strong evidence that higher minimum wages lead to a greater prevalence of subminimum wage payments. We consistently estimate that increases in measured underpayment following minimum wage increases average between 10 and 25 percent of realized wage gains. We interpret this as evidence that minimum wage evasion and avoidance are an important reality in the low-wage labor market. Finally, we find that enforcement regimes play an important role in shaping both baseline compliance rates and the response of compliance to increases in minimum wages.
J08|Minimum wage analysis using a pre-committed research design: Evidence through 2017|This paper presents results from the third year of a multiyear, pre-committed research design for analyzing recent minimum wage changes.
J08|The effectiveness of interventions to reduce informality in low- and middle income countries|"Labor markets in low- and middle income countries are characterized by high levels of informality. A multitude of interventions have therefore been implemented in many countries with the objective to increase the formalization of firms and workers, including information campaigns, simplification of registration procedures, reductions of payroll taxes and social security contributions, and interventions that enforce labor or business formalization. In this paper, we compile a database of 157 impact estimates from 32 academic studies that evaluate empirically one or more of these formalization interventions. The empirical analysis correlates the impact estimates of the primary studies - given as either (i) a measure of sign and statistical significance or (ii) the effect size - with explanatory factors such as the intervention type, the outcome variable, the scope of the intervention (program or policy), and other covariates. Several key findings emerge: first, the intervention type is not a strong determinant for the effectiveness of formalization interventions, though tax incentives and labor inspection are most likely to display significant positive effects. Second, the outcome ""worker registration"" shows significantly better results than other outcomes. Third, interventions at scale - i.e. formalization ""policies"" - are more effective on average than singular ""programs""."
J08|The Effects of the Affordable Care Act on Workplace Absenteeism of Overweight and Obese Workers|In this paper, we examine whether the expansion of health insurance coverage brought on by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), led to a decline in absenteeism among overweight and obese individuals. We use data from the National Health Insurance Survey (NHIS) to compare absenteeism among overweight and obese workers to absenteeism among normal-weight workers before and after the ACA. Our results suggest that in the post-ACA period, the probability of being absent declined by about 1.3 (1.5) percentage points among obese (overweight) individuals. Disaggregated regressions suggest that the effect is significant among women, but not among men. Furthermore, our estimates (using a Tobit model) indicate that the obese (overweight) workers missed 0.33 (0.46) fewer days after the ACA. Again, the effect is concentrated among women. Our results show that improved health outcomes led to reduced absenteeism. Our results also show that there are no decline in absenteeism among elderly (age>=65) adults (who did not experience any increase in health insurance coverage as a result of the ACA), suggesting that the decline in absenteeism is indeed due to the expansion of health insurance coverage due to the ACA. Our estimates imply that the ACA reduced the cost associated with absenteeism by about $350 million per year.
J08|Drohender Abschwung in Zeiten der Digitalisierung: Brauchen wir jetzt „Kurzarbeit 4.0“?|Kurzarbeit hat sich bewährt, Unternehmen dabei zu unterstützen, ihre Belegschaft auch in konjunkturellen Durststrecken im Betrieb halten zu können. Dieses Instrument greift aber bei tiefergehenden strukturellen Problemen zu kurz. Da der der Weiterbildungsbedarf in unserer Gesellschaft zudem auf absehbare Zeit nicht konjunkturabhängig sein wird, ist eine Weiterbildungsoffensive – unabhängig von Kurzarbeit – notwendig. Die Verknüpfung von Kurzarbeit und Weiterbildung beinhaltet außerdem nur schwer lösbare Zielkonflikte. Vielmehr gilt es, den schwierigen Spagat zwischen selbstbestimmter Qualifizierung auch losgelöst vom Arbeitsplatz und bedarfsgerechter Weiterbildung unter Einbeziehung der Unternehmen zu bewerkstelligen. Schließlich wird ausdrücklich vor unrealistischen Erwartungen hinsichtlich der Stabilisierung von nicht mehr zukunftsfähigen Arbeitsplätzen durch Kurzarbeit (und Weiterbildung) gewarnt.

J08|Low-Skilled Workers and the Effects of Minimum Wage: New Evidence Based on a Density-Discontinuity Approach|We estimated the impact of the minimum wage on wages, unemployment, and formal-informal sector mobility for women in the domestic-work sector in Uruguay. Applying the dual-economy, density-discontinuity design developed by Jales (2017), we used cross-sectional data for 2006-2016 from the National Household Survey and found that the minimum wage had significant effects on labor outcomes, with almost 20% of women increasing their wages to reach the minimum. This effect was observed in both the formal and informal sector, though the latter was not covered by the policy. Our results showed a drop in employment as well as a significant effect on sector mobility with negative impacts on formality. Nevertheless, these undesired effects were offset by other labour policies undertaken in the period, by sustained economic growth, and by improvement in labor- market conditions. A novel identification strategy that is particularly suited to developing countries provides empirical evidence regarding the effects of a minimum wage on women workers in the informal sector.
J08|Taxation and the future of work: How tax systems influence choice of employment form|Recent policy discussion has highlighted the variety of ways in which the world of work is changing. One development prevalent in some countries has been an increase certain forms of non-standard work. Is this beneficial, representing increased flexibility in the workforce, or detrimental, representing a deterioration in job quality driven by automation, globalisation and the market power of large employers? These changes also raise crucial issues for tax systems. Differences in tax treatment across employment forms may create tax arbitrage opportunities. This paper investigates the potential for such opportunities for eight countries. It models the labour income taxation, inclusive of social contributions, of standard employees and then of self-employed workers (with applicable tax rules detailed in the paper’s annex). The aim is to understand whether countries’ tax systems treat different employment forms differently, before approaching the broader question of whether differential treatment has merit when evaluated against tax design principles.
J08|Annex - Taxation and the Future of Work: How Tax Systems Influence Choice of Employment Form|This annex details the tax treatment of standard employees and self-employed workers in eight countries: Argentina, Australia, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. The accompanying paper models and discusses the labour income taxation, inclusive of social contributions, of standard employees and then of self-employed workers. The aim is to understand whether countries’ tax systems treat different employment forms differently, before approaching the broader question of whether differential treatment has merit when evaluated against tax design principles.
J08|Prospects of Philippine Migration|The paper briefly surveys recent migration policies in major destinations of Filipino migrants and tries to see their effect on migration flows in the past two decades. Most Western OECD economies have heightened their restrictive immigration programs that covered not only those relating to workers but also those for family unification. Their admission for employment is restricted to the highly skilled/highly educated labor. Despite the tightening of policy, emigration to Western OECD increased in the past three decades. Emigration to the US has been declining but emigration to other countries, though relatively small, rose. Saudi Arabia, the largest employer of foreign workers in the Gulf adopted the Nitaqat policy of imposing higher national to foreign labor ratio in the private sector. This may explain the drop in the flow of labor to the GCC in 2015 and 2016. The drop could be a temporary fluctuation as the state could not easily develop sufficient number of skilled and disciplined citizens to replace foreign labor. The GCC states’ heavy dependence on foreign labor is expected to continue. The skill composition of foreign workers may change depending on their future economic and social development.
J08|Skill and Wage Overshooting in Occupational Training with the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program|We investigate the training choices made by workers entering the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program. This is important as more workers enter these types of programs due to technological change and globalization. We show that workers that choose a training occupation beyond their skill level (skill overshooting) or previous wage level (wage overshooting) achieve higher earnings and wage replacement rates with the cost being that it lowers their reemployment rates. Specifically, skill overshooting lowers the reemployment rates for these workers by 2.0 to 3.2 percentage points, but they enjoy an increase in their earnings by 2.0 - 2.2 percent. Wage overshooting leads to a similar decline in the reemployment rate (2.2 percentage points) but shows a much larger increase in their earnings (6.9 to 8.5%). The findings are robust to various subsamples.
J08|No country for old men? Increasing the retirement age in the Armed Forces|An ageing workforce due to low fertility rates and higher life expectancies challenges modern industrialized economies. To secure economic welfare and the balance of public budgets, governments worldwide implement reforms to increase the retirement age. This trend towards higher retirement age confronts a defense sector that for centuries has been in search of an age structure characterized by ‘youth and vigor’. We study the economic gains to society from increasing the special retirement age for military personnel in the Norwegian Armed Forces. By combining the literatures on pension, personnel, and military economics, we identify mechanisms crucial to the outcome of a special retirement age reform. Monte Carlo simulation is applied to illustrate the potential impact on the economic net gains of uncertain variables. We find that an increase in the retirement age provides substantial net benefits to society, even under fairly negative assumptions about the consequences for retention, motivation and efforts, and the value of elderly personnel in the Armed Forces.
J08|Universal Childcare for the Youngest and the Maternal Labour Supply|This paper explores whether the expansion of childcare leads to an increase in the maternal labour supply. Exploiting a large nationwide reform that expanded childcare for 1–2-year-olds to 80 percent coverage, we find a significant increase in employment of mothers with young children, but only weak evidence of an increase in contracted hours of work. The adjustments are short-term effects of the reform. We also find substantial heterogeneity. The effects are relatively large for mothers post maternity leave, noteworthy on actual working hours. For mothers with more than one child, effects are strong in the long-term of the reform.
J08|Why do we need self-employed persons? Some economic reflections, mainly tax related ones|For many years, we have been hearing about the need for innovation and entrepreneurship. Successive Polish government declare their support for entrepreneurs and expand the catalog of privileges, mainly related to taxes and mandatory contributions. Not infrequently, in these discussions the self-employed are equated with entrepreneurs. In this work, we will seek an answer to the questions: Who, then, are the self-employed? Are they really entrepreneurs? Should we support their activities? And finally the fundamental question: What does the economy get from the self-employed? In this work we point out that the differences in rates of self-employment between countries may result from differences in taxation on the labor provided by self-employed and salaried workers. In the main part of the work, taking advantage of the potential of the EUROMOD tax-benefit microsimulation model, we show that in Europe there is no single model of taxation of work conducted as one’s own business. In the majority of the tax-contribution systems we examined, the profitability of employment or self-employment changes along with changes in income. In light of the regressivity of the burdens on the self-employed, as a rule it begins to be profitable only above a certain income level. In the first part of the work we define the self-employed as those who run a business, and later we distinguish within this group entrepreneurs, meaning those who take on risk and create innovations. Discussing the advantages and disadvantages of self-employment from the point of view of the self-employed and the employer, we point out that the benefits – including systemic (tax and contribution) benefits, outweigh the disadvantages. We also discuss in more detail the imposition of income tax on the self-employed. In the second part we present changes in the value of self-employment over the last 25 years. Here we use data from the World Bank and certain data points from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). They allow us to observe how the relationship between the self-employed and the economy is changing: The significance of services provided for other businesses is growing. Additionally, we can see that the significance of self-employment is falling. In Poland the level of (non-agricultural) self-employment is low. The dynamics of the rate of self-employment indicate that the influence of legal regulations on the scale of self-employment is secondary. It seems that in this case, technological and demographic factors are much more significant.
J08|Paid Sick Leave and Employee Absenteeism|This paper studies the response of sickness absences to changes in the replacement rate for sick leave. In June 2008 a national law modified both the strength of monitoring and the monetary cost of sick leaves for public sector employees in Italy. This paper focuses on the National Health Service, which accounts for about 21% of the total number of workers employed in the Italian public administration. Using administrative data I show that absenteeism largely decreased following the reform. I identify the effects of an increase in the monetary cost of an absence using a difference-in-differences strategy that exploits variation in changes to the replacement rate for sick leave. Under the assumption that changes in monitoring had the same proportional impact on absenteeism within the same institutions, I estimate that a 1 percentage point decrease in the replacement rate reduces absenteeism by 1%. JEL Classification: J88, J08.
J08|Labour market institutions, shocks and the employment rate|The average employment rate for the OECD countries was close to 63 percent in the period 2000-2015 but there is considerable variation within and between countries. We find that a dynamic model for employment, derived from a multiple equation macro model with institutional and population variables, can explain much of the development. The estimated models capture the dynamics well and they imply interpretable estimates of the normal employment rate level, conditional on the state of the institutional variables in 2015. The estimated normal employment rate is 2 percentage points higher when shocks are included in the model, implying that shocks have persistent effects. Regulations of the labour market are important for the effect of shocks. Regulated labour markets amplify positive shocks while negative shocks are dampened compared to less regulated labour markets. In the estimation of the models, we use standard panel data estimators, as well as a version of the within-group estimator which is robust to structural breaks in the means. Empirically we find that some of the estimated coefficients of the institutional variables are robust with respect to the breaks, while others are not. We find that the interaction effect between benefit replacement ratio and benefit duration is robust, and that is can significantly affect the employment rate. This result implies that changes in replacement ratios (or duration) may be expected to have larger impacts in countries where duration (or replacement ratio) is long compared to countries characterized by short duration (or replacement ratio).
J08|Who Bears the Brunt? The Impact of Banking Crises on Younger and Older Workers|How do young and old workers fare on the labor market when a banking crisis occurs? Using data on 41 banking crises in 38 developed countries over 1990-2014, we examine how banking crises affect the labor market position of workers from five different age groups (including 65 years and older) and whether employment protection legislation shields workers from unemployment. Results show that unemployment increases across the board in the aftermath of banking crises, but much more so for younger workers. The labor force participation of older women increases significantly in the medium run, whereas older men withdraw from the labor market. Countries with strong employment protection legislation shield workers from the impact of banking crises in the short run, but show signs of increases in unemployment rates for young and middle-aged workers in the medium run.
J08|The Employment Effects of Collective Bargaining|This paper studies the wage and employment effects of Italian collective bargaining. For this purpose, it analyses monthly data derived from administrative archives on the population of private-sector employees, matched with extensive information on contractual pay levels settled in industry-wide agreements bargained by trade unions' and employers' representatives at the national level. The research design is based on a generalised differences-in-differences method, which exploits the numerous contrasts generated by the Italian wage setting rules and controls for space-specific sectoral unobserved time-varying disturbances in a fully non-parametric way. Results show that a growth in contractual wages produced sizeable increases in actual pay levels for all workers, determining at the same time strong and negative effects on employment. The resulting confidence interval of the implied own-price labour demand elasticity ranged between -0.4 and -1.2, and it was even slightly more negative among incorporated companies. Studying interactions of this parameter with firm-level outcomes â€“value added per worker, size, the labour share and capital intensity - we found associations broadly consistent with Hicks-Marshall laws and with traditional models of centralized wage bargaining. Further analyses carefully document the presence of dynamic employment adjustments to contractual wage levels and assess the overall robustness of the results.
J08|Nursing without caring? A discrete choice experiment about job characteristics of German surgical technologist trainees|We know that existing professions in the health care sector value work environment and job conditions to a great extent. However, we are also witnessing an expansion of new roles into the health care sector, many of which substitutie the tasks of existing professions. This may be efficient, in that it releases professionals’ time. However, there is little understanding of what motivates these new professions in entering or remaining in these newly created roles. This study tries to evaluate the preference structure of one of these new staff groups, surgical technologist, through examining the preferences of trainees, defined over a number of attributes, in this group. The DCE study covers 80% of the target population. The results show a vigorous disfavour towards any perceived nursing job characteristics such as caring activities, hierarchical work environment or shift types. The results inform policy makers and hospital manager about the importance to focus not only on the nursing profession but also to take into account the existence of a group of people who is willing to work within the health care system however, associated with strong preferences against nursing activities, especially caring. Implementing and further development of new and specialised profession through reallocating former nursing tasks- should be considered while coping with labour shortage.
J08|EU Faces a Tough Demographic Reckoning|By 2030, labour demand could be equal to labour supply in most of the EU, creating significant challenges for policy-makers and firms. The ‘tipping point’ at which labour demand will become equal to labour supply in the EU – that is, when labour will become a constraint on economic growth – is now imminent. If current trends continue, most EU countries will hit this ‘tipping point’ during the next decade, many by 2025. Vacancy rates and surveys of employers find that firms in some sectors are already facing severe labour constraints on production. Most of CEE will be hit first, not least because they are still losing so many workers to Western Europe. For Western Europe, however, the situation will also become difficult soon, especially for Germany. This is an enormous challenge for policy-makers, and will become even more so in the future. Policy options to counter demographic trends can be split into four main areas higher productivity, immigration, activity rates, or fertility. However, none is a silver bullet. Even if all of these policies are pursued successfully and in combination, they are unlikely to fundamentally alter the picture. The implications of this demographic decline do not have to be all negative. Combined with intelligent upgrading of infrastructure and investment in productivity-enhancing improvements in industry, there is no reason that these population trends cannot go hand-in-hand with increases in per capita GDP and living standards. Much can be learned from Japan in this regard. The politics of the future in the EU is likely to be defined by generational questions, and potentially inter-generational conflict. Policy discussions are likely to centre ever more on immigration, how to fund old-age and child care, how to extend working lives, automation, and the problematic issue of financial incentives to increase fertility rates.
J08|Wie die Digitalisierung genutzt werden kann, um Geringqualifizierte weiterzubilden: Handlungsempfehlung an Individuen, Unternehmen und Bildungsanbieter sowie die Bundesagentur für Arbeit|Die Weiterbildungsbeteiligung Geringqualifizierter ist in den letzten Dekaden stark gestiegen. Wesentliche Gründe sind höhere Anforderungen und technische Veränderungen, die auch die Tätigkeiten von formal An- und Ungelernten betreffen. Um die Weiterbildungsbeteiligung An- und Ungelernter weiterhin zu stärken, sind alle beteiligten Akteure gefragt: Unternehmen soll-ten verstärkt lernförderliche Arbeitsplätze anbieten, auf denen Kompetenzen erworben werden können. Auch Lernprozessbegleiter, die sicherstellen, dass bestimmte Fähigkeiten im Rahmen des täglichen Arbeitsprozesses erlernt werden, sind für Geringqualifizierte wichtig. Neben per-sönlichen Ansprechpartnern eignet sich hierfür auch der Einsatz digitaler Lernbegleiter. Bildungsdienstleister sollten die spezifischen Qualifizierungsbedarfe und -hürden von Geringqualifizierten in den Blick nehmen und entsprechende Angebote entwickeln, die in einem ersten Schritt auch die Selbstlernkompetenz, die An- und Ungelernte häufig nicht haben, aufbauen. Die Selbstlernkompetenz beschreibt die Fähigkeiten, das selbstbestimmte Lernen zu initiieren und zu organisieren. Da digitale Medien einen individuellen Zuschnitt der Lerninhalte ermöglichen, erhöhen sie die Motivation der Geringqualifizierten und bauen Lernhürden wie fehlende Zeit, Versagensängste und Zeitdruck in Präsenzveranstaltungen ab. Damit erhalten Geringqualifizierte mehr Möglichkeiten, wie sie sich weiterbilden können, und sie können mehr Verantwortung für ihre eigene Bildungs- und Erwerbsbiografie übernehmen. Letztlich ist für An- und Ungelernte die öffentliche Förderung von Weiterbildung relevant, da sie seltener an Weiterbildung teilnehmen, die vom Arbeitgeber finanziert wird. Die öffentliche Förderung der beruflichen Weiterbildung sollte sich daher weiterhin stark auf Geringqualifizierte fokussieren, um durch Qualifizierungsmaßnahmen deren Chancen auf Beschäftigung nachhaltig zu erhöhen. Auch hier ist zu prüfen, inwieweit durch digitale Medien und arbeitsplatznahes Lernen auch abschlussorientierte Weiterbildungen intensiver genutzt werden können.
J08|Towards a European Full Employment Policy|Full employment in the European Union member states is a challenge but feasible, also in downswings of the business cycle and during stages of increased robotization. It requires a labor legislation that ensures flexibility and retraining, responsive labor sharing during the business cycle and to individual life cycle needs, government interventions to supply supplemental employment and revamping dual education. The future of work is better ensured with coordinated European full employment labor policies establishing fair work conditions based on long-run business strategies as well as a fair distribution of national income between labor and capital.
J08|Thailand's vocational training and upward mobility: Impact Heterogeneity and Policy Implications|This paper provides the first impact evaluation of vocational training in Thailand using various treatment effect methods with unique longitudinal survey data, covering seven years, to evaluate the impact of vocational training on economic and social mobility in the short, medium and long term. We find that vocational training fails to move participants upward both in terms of earning and employment. However, training participation is found to increase expenditures in the short and medium term but these positive impacts vanish when we strictly confine counterfactuals or allow for the endogeneity of the decision to attend the programme. We also examine the heterogeneity of effects with respect to individual and programme characteristics to answer the questions for whom the training works and which type of training works best. The results suggest that women, rural residents, youth (aged 15-24) and elderly (aged 60 and above), low-educated workers, and economically inactive people, benefit less from the programme. With regard to heterogeneity by type of training, we find that computer training courses, training offered by private institutions and a cooperation of government and private agencies, and training financed by employers are associated with better outcomes.
J08|A Comparative Analysis of the Labour Market Performance of University-Educated Immigrants in Australia, Canada, and the United States|We examine data from Australia, Canada, and the U.S. to inform the potential for immigrant screening policies to influence the labour market performance of skilled immigrants. Our estimates point to improvements in employment rates and weekly earnings of male university‐educated immigrants in all three countries concomitant with policy reforms. Nonetheless, the gains are modest in comparison to a substantial and persistent performance advantage of U.S. skilled immigrants. Given that there is increasingly little to distinguish the skilled immigration policies of these countries, we interpret the U.S. advantage as primarily reflecting the relative positive selectivity of U.S. immigrants
J08|Kritische Anmerkungen zum Umgang mit Langzeitarbeitslosigkeit: Vorbeugen ist besser als Heilen!|"Programme zur Bekämpfung von Langzeitarbeitslosigkeit wie das ""Teilhabechancengesetz"" setzen systematisch zu spät an. Sie sind primär kurativ ausgerichtet und vernachlässigen komplett eine prophylaktische Komponente. Dies begünstigt die Entstehung zusätzlicher Vermittlungshemmnisse während der Arbeitslosigkeit und senkt die Qualität des verfügbaren Arbeitskräftepotenzials. Erforderlich sind daher schon zu Beginn der Arbeitslosigkeit präventive Aktivitäten der Unternehmen und der Arbeitsagenturen. Diese müssen die Erkenntnisse der Psychologischen Arbeitslosenforschung nutzen und sollen typische Belastungswirkungen der Arbeitslosigkeit im Vorfeld eindämmen: Zerfall von Zeitstrukturen, Erosion von Selbstwert und Sozialkompetenz, Verschlechterung der physischen und psychischen Gesundheit. Ein wichtiger instrumenteller Ansatz besteht im flächendeckenden Einsatz von Outplacementmaßnahmen bei jedem Arbeitsplatzverlust."
J08|Fachkräftemangel in der Pflege: Kritische Situationsbewertung und Skizzierung einer Handlungsalternative|Das Bundeskabinett hat am 01.08.2018 das Pflegepersonal-Stärkungsgesetz beschlossen. Unter anderem ist darin die Einstellung von 13.000 zusätzlichen Pflegefachkräften vorgesehen. Angesichts der derzeitigen Mangelsituation in diesem Berufsfeld bestehen starke Zweifel, ob diese Stellen adäquat besetzt werden können. Zukunftsprojektionen für das Jahr 2030 zeigen, dass sich die Pflegekraftlücke noch deutlich vergrößern wird. Auch der Zugriff auf bislang unerschlossene Arbeitskräftepotenziale wird zur Schließung nicht ausreichend sein. Die soziale Dramatik dieses Problems verbietet eine abwartende Haltung. Bisher beschlossene Maßnahmen sind zu kleinteilig und zu reaktiv angelegt. Es sind kurzfristig Handlungen erforderlich, die einen aktiven Lösungsbeitrag in einer substanziellen Größenordnung leisten. Vorgeschlagen wird in einem stark fokussierten Handlungsansatz die Errichtung einer groß dimensionierten Pflegefachschule (10.000 Plätze) in einem Drittland. Es wird ein begründeter Kriterienkatalog für die Auswahl geeigneter Länder vorgestellt. Als potenziell geeignetes Land wird Vietnam diskutiert.
J08|Eine Bewertung aktueller Vorschläge zur Reform der Grundsicherung|Mit Beiträgen von Andrea Nahles und Robert Habeck liegen zwei neue Vorschläge zur Reform der Grundsicherung vor. Im Wesentlichen geht es darum, Leistungen auszuweiten und Mitwir-kungspflichten abzuschwächen. Im Vorschlag von Robert Habeck wird sogar eine vollständige Abschaffung der Verpflichtung zu Eigenbemühungen zur Überwindung der Hilfebedürftigkeit postuliert. Die Vorschläge berücksichtigen nicht die bisher erzielten Erfolge bei der Arbeits-marktintegration von Leistungsempfängern. Sie können auch keine Begründung bieten, die sich auf funktionale Mängel des Status quo stützt. Stattdessen liegt die Begründung in der als negativ eingeschätzten Wahrnehmung der Grundsicherung in der Öffentlichkeit - ein Bild, das nicht zu-letzt durch die undifferenzierte Kritik seitens der Autoren überhaupt erst erzeugt wird. Die Vor-schläge sind überwiegend nicht geeignet, die Integration von Leistungsempfängern in den Ar-beitsmarkt zu verbessern. Bedenkenswert ist allenfalls eine Bündelung und stärkere Pauschalie-rung von Leistungen sowie die Reform der Freibetragsregeln bei der Kombination von Erwerbs- und Transfereinkommen.
J08|Langzeitarbeitslosigkeit: Entwicklung, Ursachen und Lösungsansätze|Während sich der Arbeitsmarkt in Deutschland weiterhin gut entwickelt, wird gemeinhin angenommen, dass im Segment der Langzeitarbeitslosen keine oder nur geringe Fortschritte zu verzeichnen seien. Dies trifft nicht uneingeschränkt zu. So ist die Anzahl der Langzeitarbeitslosen seit ihrem Höchstwert von 1,8 Millionen im Jahr 2006 bis zum Jahr 2016 auf die Hälfte gesunken. Nicht zu Unrecht wird mitunter darauf hingewiesen, dass die offizielle Anzahl der Langzeitarbeitslosen aufgrund der Messmethode das Problem unterschätzt. Doch auch wenn stattdessen die Entwicklung der Langleistungsbezieher betrachtet wird, die über einen längeren Zeitraum Leistungen nach dem SGB II beziehen, ist eine Besserung der Lage durchaus erkennbar. Es dürfte dennoch unstreitig sein, dass das Problem kaum als gelöst angesehen werden kann. Nach wie vor sind knapp eine Million Menschen länger als zwölf Monate ohne Arbeit. Noch größer ist die Anzahl derer, die sich nicht nachhaltig aus der wiederkehrenden Abhängigkeit von Lohnersatz- oder Transferleistungen befreien können. Oft handelt es sich um Personen mit Qualifikationsdefiziten, Ältere, Personen mit gesundheitlichen Einschränkungen oder Personen mit einer Kombination aus diesen Merkmalen. 69 Prozent der Langzeitarbeitslosen streben eine Tätigkeit an, für die keine abgeschlossene Berufsausbildung vorausgesetzt wird oder sind älter als 55 Jahre. Bisherige Ansätze der Arbeitsmarktpolitik haben nur begrenzt Erfolge gezeigt. Ein Grund dafür könnte sein, dass die Mittel der Job-Center für Eingliederungsleistungen strukturell unterfinanziert sind. Das stagnierende Gesamtbudget muss zu immer größeren Teilen zur Finanzierung steigender Verwaltungsausgaben herangezogen werden. Seit 2012 sanken die für Arbeitsmarktpolitik verausgabten Mittel um 386 Millionen Euro. Zwar sank auch die Anzahl der erwerbsfähigen Hilfebedürftigen, dies reichte zur Kompensation aber nicht aus. Das nominale pro-Kopf-Budget ist in diesem Zeitraum um acht Prozent gesunken. Eine Lösung des Problems muss folglich erstens darin bestehen, den Job-Centern ein ausreichendes Budget zur Verfügung zu stellen. Zweitens gilt es, geeignete arbeitsmarktpolitische Maßnahmen zu ergreifen. In dieser Hinsicht können die Befunde der Evaluationsforschung wichtige Hinweise liefern. Vorsicht ist bei der Idee geboten, einen dritten Arbeitsmarkt für vermeintlich chancenlose Langzeitarbeitslose einzurichten. Dies käme dem Versuch gleich, das Arbeitslosenproblem zu lösen, indem man diese in den Staatsdienst übernimmt. Stattdessen erscheint es angebracht, die Bemühungen um die Aktivierung zu intensivieren. Dazu braucht es eine höhere Kontaktdichte zwischen Arbeitslosen und Fallmanagern, die nur mit einer entsprechend ausgebauten Betreuungsrelation sichergestellt werden kann.
J08|Identifying asymmetric effects of labor market reforms|This paper proposes a novel approach to identify structural long-term driving forces of the labor market and their short-run state-dependent effects. Based on search and matching theory, our empirical model extracts these driving forces within an unobserved components approach. We relate changes in the labor market structures to reforms that enhance the flexibility of the labor market in expansion and recession. Results for Germany and Spain show that labor market reforms have substantially weaker beneficial effects in the short run when implemented in recessions. From a policy perspective, these results highlight the costs of introducing reforms in recessions.
J08|Introducing Severance Payment Systems in Japan ——A Proposal for Vacancy Decontrol——| In Japan, the court requires job restoration rather than a severance payment from a firm after it decides that a dismissal has been abusive. This results in a high settlement cost for termination. This paper makes two proposals for introducing severance payments to reduce settlement costs in Japan. The first applies to existing contracts and proposes to specify levels of severance payments that would replace the current job restoration requirement after the court determines that a case is abusive. The second applies to new employees either for a recently vacated position or a new position and proposes vacancy decontrol, which allows firms to set the levels of severance payments freely while also honoring the existing contracts. Within this category, this paper proposes government-assisted vacancy decontrol, a transitional measure, where the government sets a minimum level of statutory severance payment, which is equal to six months of wages for a worker who has worked for 20 years, following the Taiwan precedent. After the need for the transitional measure is dissolved, complete vacancy decontrol should be introduced, abolishing the statutory severance payment. We have proposed that even at this stage, the government should publicly set a default level of the severance payment, which a firm should observe unless an explicit agreement or contract stipulates otherwise. The government should immediately introduce some form of vacancy decontrol for senior workers who have already retired from a regular job.
J08|Minimum Wage Effects on Poverty and Inequality|Minimum wage effect on employment is one of the mostly studied fields in labour economics. Minimum wage is also considered as a redistributive tool but its efficiency is strongly doubted due to potential disemployment effect that may cause. In the present paper, redistributive ability of minimum wage is studied through microsimulation techniques and under several scenarios of employment elasticity. The results indicate that minimum wage can reduce poverty even under the presence of a disemployment effect. Though, this anti-poverty effect is limited as employment elasticity is more negative. Similarly, inequality decreases when minimum wage increases are adopted, but the redistributive effect is weaker when they cause job losses. The above indicate that minimum wage policies should be used with caution and always take into account any possible impact on employment.
J08|Productivity growth in Italy: a tale of a slow-motion change|Productivity is the main factor holding back long-term economic growth in Italy. Since the second half of the 1990s, productivity growth has been feeble both by historical standards and compared with the other main euro area countries. Understanding the reasons for such a performance and finding the most effective policy levers is crucial to increase Italy’s potential growth rate. Against this background, we provide a detailed analysis of the data and a critical review of the available empirical evidence to identify both the structural weaknesses limiting productivity growth and the strengths of the Italian productive system that may support it looking forward. Since the end of the 1990s and more intensively since the second half of 2011, the reform effort has been particularly effective in the regulation of product and labor markets and industrial policy. On other factors which are very relevant for productivity dynamics, the reform action has been less effective so far.
J08|Minimum Wage and Employment Structure: Evidence from Korean Industry-Level Data (in Korean)|This study analyzes the linkage between minimum wage and employment structure. As a result, rising ratio of the workers below minimum wage and who are affected by it turns out to lead to increases in the ratio of irregular workers to regular ones and wage gap between the two groups, but with only limited magnitudes. Furthermore we find that minimum wage hike negatively affects working hours and monthly wage. Although the impacts have been minimal, it is likely that the impact for this time turns out to be different from the previous cases, given the recent drastic minimum wage hike. Our study is meaningful in that we investigate empiric relationship between minimum wage and employment structure by using the data and analysis methodology differentiated from the existing research in circumstances where there is mounting concern as to the impact of rapid icreases in the minimum wage.
J08|Does Federally-Funded Job Training Work? Nonexperimental Estimates of WIA Training Impacts Using Longitudinal Data on Workers and Firms|We study the job training provided under the US Workforce Investment Act (WIA) to adults and dislocated workers in two states. Our substantive contributions center on impacts estimated non-experimentally using administrative data. These impacts compare WIA participants who do and do not receive training. In addition to the usual impacts on earnings and employment, we link our state data to the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data at the U.S. Census Bureau, which allows us to estimate impacts on the characteristics of the firms at which participants find employment. We find moderate positive impacts on employment, earnings and desirable firm characteristics for adults, but not for dislocated workers. Our primary methodological contribution consists of assessing the value of the additional conditioning information provided by the LEHD relative to the data available in state Unemployment Insurance (UI) earnings records. We find that value to be zero.
J08|The quantification of structural reforms: Extending the framework to emerging market economies|This paper estimates and quantifies the impact of structural reforms on per capita income for a large set of OECD and non-OECD countries. The findings suggest that the quality of institutions matters to a large extent for economic outcomes. More competition-friendly regulations, as measured by the OECDs’ Product Market Regulation (PMR) indicator improve economic outcomes. Lower barriers to foreign trade and investment help MFP. Lower barriers to entry and less pervasive state control of businesses boost the capital stock and the employment rate. No robust link between labour market regulation and MFP and capital deepening could be established. But looser labour market regulation is found to go hand in hand with higher employment rates. The paper shows that countries at different level of economic development face different policy impacts. Furthermore, PMR effects depend on the level of labour market regulations.
J08|The Economic and Fiscal Effects of Granting Refugees Formal Labor Market Access|There are over 25 million refugees in the world today and most of them—especially those in developing countries—do not have formal labor market access (LMA). That is, they do not have the right to work or own businesses. In this paper, we argue that granting refugees formal LMA has the potential to create substantial benefits for refugees and their hosts, including reduced vulnerability and higher incomes for refugees, improved labor market outcomes and higher incomes for natives, and positive fiscal effects for the host governments. Overall, even short of formal LMA according to our definition—wherein refugees’ access to the labor market is unrestricted by the government in law and in practice—greater rights around work and business ownership enable greater benefits. Moreover, the fewer barriers there are to realizing these rights in practice—whether related to government policy or otherwise—the greater the benefits. But there may also be costs associated with granting formal LMA for certain groups in the host population and the full range of benefits is not guaranteed. The existence and magnitude of these benefits and costs is determined by key contextual factors, including the current extent of informal LMA for refugees, characteristics of the labor market, the skill and demographic profiles of refugees, the geographic location and concentration of refugees, and, crucially, policy choices and the political context. By creating and implementing policies that support vulnerable people regardless of status, help natives adjust to and benefit from changes, facilitate refugee labor market integration, and grant refugees the complementary rights that will help them succeed (such as freedom of movement), policymakers can amplify the benefits of formalization and mitigate the costs—making formal LMA a critical lever for generating positive outcomes from the presence of refugees.
J08|The supply of skill and endogenous technical change: evidence from a college expansion reform| We examine the labor market consequences of an exogenous increase in the supply of skilled labor in several cities in Norway, resulting from the construction of new colleges in the 1970s. We fi nd that skilled wages increased as a response, suggesting that along with an increase in the supply there was also an increase in demand for skill. We also show that college openings led to an increase in the productivity of skilled labor and investments in R&D. Our findings are consistent with models of endogenous technical change where an abundance of skilled workers may encourage fi rms to adopt skill-complementary technologies, leading to an upward-sloping long-run demand for skill.
J08|Caseworker's discretion and the effectiveness of welfare-to-work programs|In this paper we focus on the role of caseworkers in the assignment and take-up of welfare-to-work programs. We conduct a field experiment that generates exogenous variation in the assignment to different policy regimes to caseworkers. The experiment allows us to provide evidence on the effectiveness of welfare-to-work programs and to study how caseworkers exploit their discretion in assigning these programs to welfare recipients. We find substantial heterogeneity in how caseworkers assign welfare-to-work programs. Participation in the experiment and learning about the effectiveness of the different programs does not induce caseworkers to focus more on the effective programs. This implies that obtaining knowledge about welfare-to-work programs is not enough to improve policy, also effort on implementation is required.
J08|Occupational Licensing, Labor Mobility, and the Unfairness of Entry Standards|The combination of occupational licensing at the local market level often coexists with labor mobility across local markets. We empirically study a labor market in which a district-specific entry (licensing) examination is coupled with labor mobility across districts. Our analysis exploits a change in the grading procedure of the exam, from grading in the local district to grading in a randomly assigned different district. We document that licensing regulation leads to extreme heterogeneity across markets in admission outcomes (up to 50 percent differences in licensing exam pass rates), unfair (discriminatory) admission procedures (up to 49 percent unfair exam results), and inefficient mobility of workers. These findings, together with the estimated impact of the reform on exam outcomes and grading standards, provide the first evidence of regulatory competition based on strategic interaction among licensing boards.
J08|"Trade Secrets and Innovation: Evidence from the ""Inevitable Disclosure"" Doctrine"|"Does heightened employer-friendly trade secrecy protection help or hinder innovation? By examining U.S. state-level legal adoption of a doctrine allowing employers to curtail inventor mobility if the employee would ""inevitably disclose"" trade secrets, we investigate the impact of a shifting trade secrecy regime on individual-level patenting outcomes. Using a difference-in-differences design taking un-affected U.S. inventors as the comparison group, we find strengthening employer-friendly trade secrecy adversely affects innovation. We then investigate why. We do not find empirical support for diminished idea recombination from suppressed inventor mobility as the operative mechanism. While shifting intellectual property protection away from patenting into trade secrecy has some explanatory power, our results are consistent with reduced individual-level incentives to signaling quality to the external labor market."
J08|Measuring the Competitiveness of the Cyprus Economy: the Case of Unit Labour Costs|The focus of this paper is on developments in unit labour costs (ULC) in Cyprus, an important indicator of competitiveness. The data points to a significant correction in the nominal ULC index in the period 2013-2016, almost exclusively driven by the significant wage declines observed in the public and private sectors, with the decline in the private sector driven mainly by construction and the trade, transport and tourism sectors. Once the index is adjusted for the impact of prices (to arrive at the real ULC index, a complementary indicator that is sometimes informative to analyse), the data points to an earlier and more pronounced correction in ULC. The marginal rise in the ULC index in 2017 is due to the small rise in wages, largely in the public sector, which still leaves the level of the index well below its pre-crisis level. Furthermore, developments in the ULC index are in line with recent macroeconomic performance. Overall, the significant wage moderation observed prior to the crisis, and especially the immediate and continuous adjustment of wages (as well as that of prices) following the March 2013 events, demonstrates the Cyprus economy’s potential to achieve internal devaluation as a mechanism for the correction of macroeconomic imbalances.
J08|Does Housing Wealth Affect Consumption? The Case of Cyprus|In this paper we investigate the relationship between housing wealth and consumption in Cyprus. To this end, we employ a vector error correction mechanism to examine interlinkages among house prices, private consumption, disposable income, financial assets and financial liabilities. We find that house prices affect private consumption, particularly in the short term, albeit to a lesser extent than similar studies for other countries. Financial liabilities are found to be important for consumption behaviour, while financial assets of Cypriot households appear to not affect significantly their consumption. Distinguishing consumption between durable and non-durable goods, we find that an increase in house prices boosts consumption of durables, while non-durables are found to register an insignificant effect.
J08|Structural policies in the euro area|Structural policies in the euro area are of great interest for the Eurosystem, particularly as they can support the smooth functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and the effectiveness of monetary policy. This paper adopts a broad definition of structural policies, analysing not only the benefits of efficient labour, product and financial market regulations, but also emphasising the importance of good governance and efficient institutions that ensure high quality and impartial public services, the rule of law and the control of rent-seeking. The paper concludes that there are many opportunities for enhanced structural policies in EU and euro area countries which can yield substantial gains by boosting long-term income and employment growth and supporting social fairness, also via better and more equal opportunities. It provides empirical and model-based analyses on the impacts and the interactions of structural policies, highlighting synergies between growth and inclusiveness, while acknowledging that structural policy changes need to be country-specific to reflect national conditions and social preferences. Welldesigned structural policies would also strengthen economic resilience and convergence of Member States, bringing the euro area closer to the requirements of an optimal currency area and improving the transmission of monetary policy. The paper also discusses the political economy causes of the sluggish implementation of socially beneficial structural policies and assesses ways to deal with possible shortterm costs of reforms.

J08|Forced ruralisation of urban youth during Mao’s rule and women’s status in post-Mao China: an empirical study|This study uses data of “Chinese Household Income Project Survey 2002” to investigate long-term impact of Mao’s persistent policy of “forced/involuntary ruralisation of urban youth” (shangshan xiaxiang, literally “re-settlement in mountains and villages”) during the 1950s and 70s on women’s labour market participation and contribution to family incomes. Our results indicate that the impact of Mao’s forced ruralisation on female labour market participation can be positive (despite diminishing in size due to ageing). In addition, a change from positive to negative impact is largely determined by personal hardship under Maoism and its aftermath. Moreover, regarding female contribution to family incomes, our findings suggest that forcefully ruralised urban women have more bargaining power later in family finance. Our conclusion is that against all the odds Mao’s “forced ruralisation of urban youth” has improved family and societal positions of female victims in the post-Mao era as an unintended consequence of Maoism.
J08|Labour Taxation and Inclusive Growth|The importance of tackling income inequality has been stressed in the context of the European Pillar of Social Rights. In this context, the 2018 Annual Growth Survey underlined the relevance of labour taxes to pursue inclusive growth, as it has an important impact on economic growth but also on income inequality. Not all labour tax reforms, however, can simultaneously foster growth and reduce income inequality: some reforms imply a trade-off while others offer a win-win situation. This paper focusses on those labour tax reforms which offer complementarities between growth and income inequality objectives. It expands on work carried out for the Eurogroup (tax wedge, financing labour tax cuts) and the Economic Policy Committee (secondary earners, design of labour taxation) in supporting the EU political imperative of addressing income inequalities while fostering growth.
J08|The Unintended Consequences of Employer Credit Check Bans on Labor and Credit Markets|Since the Great Recession, 11 states have restricted employers' access to the credit reports of job applicants. We document that county-level vacancies decline between 9.5 percent and 12.4 percent after states enact these laws. Vacancies decline significantly in affected occupations but remain constant in those that are exempt, and the decline is larger in counties with many subprime residents. Furthermore, subprime borrowers fall behind on more debt payments and reduce credit inquiries postban. The evidence suggests that, counter to their intent, employer credit check bans disrupt labor and credit markets, especially for subprime workers.
J08|Socio-economic sustainable development and the precariat: a case study of three Russian cities|Sustainable social and economic processes of the recent decades are characterized by the emergence of new phenomenon known as precarity and its new accompanying class known as the precariat. The precariat as a social class or social community is primarily associated with a factor of instability and insecurity of workers with flexible employment. This paper studies the precarity on the labor market for the socially-oriented professions in the three Russian metropolitan areas: Moscow, Kazan, and Rostov-on-Don. The paper searches for the causes of precarity of socially-oriented professions based upon the analysis of economic processes in the public sector, and of the reformersâ€™ rhetoric and its reflection in the discourses of the main actors about the goals and direction of the reforms. Socially-oriented professions are associated with the creation of benefits, which are very little associated with markets and in most cases belong to public or mixed goods. Our findings suggest that the reforms of Russian education and healthcare spheres are accompanied by large-scale institutional changes which resulted in bureaucratization, orientation toward achieving performance indicators not related to professional values, stagnation of incomes, inequality between regions, and instability of professional trajectories. We conclude that reducing the prestige of socially-oriented professions, the material well-being, along with instability, become the main factors of precarity.
J08|Increased Compulsory School Leaving Age Affects Secondary School Track Choice and Increases Dropout Rates in Vocational Training Schools|This paper examines the effects of increasing the compulsory school leaving (CSL) age from 16 to 18 in Hungary using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) identification strategy. The new CSL age was introduced for those entering their first year of elementary school in 1998. Identification is based on compliance with the age of elementary school start rule. Compliance with the age rule creates a discontinuity in the probability of starting school under the higher CSL age regime around a cutoff date of birth. The treated cohort had known about the change since age 6. This fact allows for testing on how the increase affected forward-looking decision making about secondary school track choice which occurs at age 14. The legislation change resulted in an increased probability that children would choose the academic high school track instead of vocational training schools. At the same time, those choosing vocational training schools are more likely to drop out under the higher CSL age scheme. Potential explanations of increased dropout rates include a decrease in the quality of teaching in vocational training schools due to supply constraints, and a shift in student composition to include more students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.
J08|Economic incentives, disability insurance and labor supply|Using a difference-in-difference model on full population data, I estimate the labor market response to a 2015 Norwegian disability insurance (DI) reform. The reform introduced an incentive program to encourage DI beneficiaries to increase their labor supply, and I find that the program significantly increased the average working hours and modestly affected the labor market participation of DI beneficiaries. There is significant heterogeneity in the estimated effects; young beneficiaries respond positively along the extensive and the intensive labor supply margins. The analysis accentuates the importance of analyzing both labor supply margins when evaluating the effects of DI reforms.
J08|Caseworker's Discretion and the Effectiveness of Welfare-to-Work Programs|In this paper we focus on the role of caseworkers in the assignment and take-up of welfare-to-work programs. We conduct a field experiment that generates exogenous variation in the assignment to different policy regimes to caseworkers. The experiment allows us to provide evidence on the effectiveness of welfare-to-work programs and to study how caseworkers exploit their discretion in assigning these programs to welfare recipients. We find substantial heterogeneity in how caseworkers assign welfare-to-work programs. Participation in the experiment and learning about the effectiveness of the different programs does not induce caseworkers to focus more on the effective programs. This implies that obtaining knowledge about welfare-to-work programs is not enough to improve policy, also effort on implementation is required.
J08|Wage subsidies, job-displacement and Swedish firms: A comparison between policy systems|This paper studies how New Start Jobs (Nystartsjobb) and Employment Subsidies Anställningsstöd) affect Swedish firms. We study effects on the number of employees, firm performance and other firm level outcomes. We use Swedish administrative data from the period 1998-2008. One result is that treated firms substantially outperform other recruiting firms after hiring through subsidies, both in terms of the number of employees and in terms of various production measures, despite having identical pre-match trajectories. This pattern is clear for the period with Employment Subsidies, but less clear for the period with New Start Jobs. For New Starts Jobs we instead see that they have a clear positive effect on firms' survival rates. Overall, our results suggest that targeted employment subsidies can have large positive effects on post-match outcomes of the hiring firms.
J08|The Returns to College Choice: Loans, Scholarships and Labor Outcomes|To estimate causal eff ects of college choice, we exploit eligibility rules for student loans in a regression discontinuity design. Loan programs induce students to pursue college degrees that are more expensive and prolonged relative to technical education. Although higher education is profi table, the marginal return of college is identical to that of technical education when students are about 30 years old. The college premium seems to increase over time, possibly off setting the initial experience gap and covering cost diff erences under moderate discount rates. We study the eff ects of debt burden on college choice using a similar cutoff rule for scholarships.
J08|Rather a trigger than a cause of change.Responses of firms and workers to the statutory minimum wage in Germany| The introduction of the statutory minimum wage in Germany directly affected firms with wage earners paid less than EUR 8.50 per hour. This paper studies a variety of responses by employers and employees to adapt to this shock, in particular changes in compensation packages, employment at the extensive and intensive margin, working conditions, and position in product markets. Strategies of non-compliance are also in focus. The analysis is qualitative and based on 131 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with firm representatives, workers and members of work councils. A key finding is that while many firms and workers changed behavior with the introduction of the minimum wage, these changes are less response to concomitant changes in labor costs. Rather, it appears that the reform at many workplaces served as a catalyst to trigger or accelerate pending change processes.
J08|Working for 200 euro? The effects of traineeship reform on labor market outcomes in Croatia|In this paper we evaluate the effects of active labor market policy (ALMP) reform, the so-called SOR measure (vocational training for work without commencing employment), on labor market outcomes in Croatia. In 2012 SOR was redesigned to ease the first labor market entry and promote on-the-job training, enabling a young person without relevant work experience to get a one-year contract and a net monthly remuneration of 210 euro. The measure soon became popular, especially among university graduates, accounting for around third of their unemployment exits, and absorbing two thirds of funds allocated to ALMPs. Pooling Croatian Labor Force Surveys from 2007-2016 and using difference-in-difference strategy, we estimate the causal intent-to-treat effect of the reform on labor market outcomes of the potentially eligible group: 18-29-year-olds. Results indicate that the reform has had, at best, neutral effects on employment and unemployment; moreover, we find some evidence that a portion of young individuals were propelled into inactivity. However, we do find an adverse effect on wages-driven mostly by wages received by females and university graduates-both at the mean and higher percentiles of the wage distribution. This research provides insights on effectiveness of ALMPs in ameliorating youth unemployment in Europe, and opens questions on the appropriateness of the use of European Union funds in new EU member states.
J08|The Supply of Skill and Endogenous Technical Change: Evidence From a College Expansion Reform|We examine the labor market consequences of an exogenous increase in the supply of skilled labor in several cities in Norway, resulting from the construction of new colleges in the 1970s. We find that skilled wages increased as a response, suggesting that along with an increase in the supply there was also an increase in demand for skill. We also show that college openings led to an increase in the productivity of skilled labor and investments in R&D. Our findings are consistent with models of endogenous technical change where an abundance of skilled workers may encourage firms to adopt skill-complementary technologies, leading to an upward-sloping long-run demand for skill.
J08|A Comparative Analysis of the Labor Market Performance of University-Educated Immigrants in Australia, Canada, and the United States: Does Policy Matter?|We examine data from Australia, Canada, and the United States to assess the potential for immigrant screening policies to influence the labor market performance of skilled immigrants. Our estimates point to improvements in employment rates and weekly earnings of male university-educated immigrants in all three countries concomitant with policy reforms. Nonetheless, the gains are modest in comparison to a substantial and persistent performance advantage of US skilled immigrants. Given that there is increasingly little to distinguish the screening policies of these countries, we interpret the US advantage as primarily reflecting the relative positive self-selectivity of US immigrants.

J08|Minimum Wage Analysis Using a Pre-Committed Research Design: Evidence through 2016|This paper presents results from the first year of a multi-year, pre-committed research design for analyzing recent state-level minimum wage changes. Through 2015 and 2016, we estimate that relatively large statutory minimum wage increases have reduced employment among low-skilled population groups by just under 1.5 percentage points. Our estimates of the effects of smaller minimum wage increases are more variable and include both moderately large positive values and modest negative values. Our estimates of the effects of increases linked to inflation-indexing provisions are also quite variable, taking a small positive value on average across specifications. Results including 2016 diverge nontrivially when we compare estimates using the American Community Survey (ACS) to estimates using the Current Population Survey (CPS), with estimates tending to be more negative in the ACS. Analysis of future data will be needed to determine whether this difference across surveys is most appropriately attributed to sampling variations or to some other cause.
J08|Taxation, Work and Gender Equality in Ireland|In most developed countries, economies are facing population ageing, falling fertility rates and stagnating labour force participation. The ability of governments to fund future pension and health-care expenditure relies to a large extent on income tax and social security receipts from workers. Policymakers are generally in agreement that increasing the labour force participation of women, without reducing the fertility rate, is needed. In the year 2000, with the aim of increasing women's labour market participation, a partial individualisation of the Irish income tax system was initiated. Using the Living in Ireland survey and a difference-in-differences framework, I investigate whether this reform had any effect on female labour supply and caring duties. I find that the labour force participation rate of married women increased by 5-6 percentage points in the wake of the reform, hours of work increased by two per week and hours of unpaid childcare decreased by approximately the same margin.
J08|Live Longer, Work Longer: The Changing Nature of the Labour Market for Older Workers in OECD Countries|Population ageing poses stark dilemmas for labour markets, social protection systems and cultural norms. It will put strong downward pressure on labour supply, leading to falling real incomes and huge financial pressures on social protection systems unless there is an offsetting increase in employment rates. This is especially true for older workers whose employment rates are well below those of prime-age adults. In this paper, I examine how the labour market for older workers has evolved in OECD countries since 1990, what are the main forces at work, what are the main obstacles to working longer and how might public policies help overcome them. I also speculate about the future for older workers faced with the challenges and opportunities posed by the gig economy.
J08|How Demanding Are Activation Requirements for Jobseekers?|"This paper presents new information on activity-related eligibility criteria for unemployment and related benefits in OECD and EU countries in 2017, comparing the strictness of ""demanding"" elements built into unemployment benefits across countries and over time. Eligibility criteria for unemployment benefits determine what claimants need to do to successfully claim benefits initially or to continue receiving them. Benefit systems feature specific rules that define the type of job offers that claimants need to accept, requirements for reporting on the outcomes of independent job-search efforts, obligations to participate in active labour market programmes, as well as sanctions for failing to meet these requirements. Such rules aim to strengthen incentives to look for, prepare for, and accept employment. They may also be used as a targeting device to reduce demands on benefit systems, and on associated employment services. While this may serve to limit support to genuine jobseekers, strict requirements can also exclude some intended recipients from financial and re-employment support, e.g., by discouraging them from applying. This paper presents detailed information on policy rules in 2017, summarises them into an overall policy indicator of eligibility strictness, and gauges recent policy trends by documenting changes in the strictness measures. A novelty is the inclusion of lower-tier unemployment or social assistance benefits in the compilation of policy rules. Results document a large number of reforms enacted after the Great Recession and suggest a slight convergence of policy rules across countries even though overall measures of the strictness of activity-related eligibility criteria have remained broadly unchanged during the recent past. In countries with multiple layers of support for the unemployed, availability requirements tend to be more demanding for lower-tier assistance benefits, while sanction rules tend to be more stringent for first-tier programmes."
J08|A database on the passage and enactment of recent state minimum wage increases|This paper presents a data set that tracks effective minimum wage rates across the US states, including the District of Columbia, from January 1, 2011, to January 1, 2018.
J08|The German labor market during the Great Recession: Shocks and institutions|This paper analyzes Germany's unusual labor market experience during the Great Recession. We estimate a general equilibrium model with a detailed labor market block for post-unification Germany. This allows us to disentangle the role of institutions (short-time work, government spending rules) and shocks (aggregate, labor market, and policy shocks) and to perform counterfactual exercises. We identify positive labor market performance shocks (likely caused by labor market reforms) as the key driver for the “German labor market miracle” during the Great Recession.
J08|Vocational Training for Unemployed Youth in Latvia: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design|This paper evaluates the impact of a vocational training programme on the labour market outcomes of unemployed youth in Latvia. The programme is part of the Youth Guarantee scheme for the period 2014-2020, the largest action launched by the European Union to reduce youth unemployment rate and to support young people aged between 15 and 29 who are not in education, employment or training (NEETs). To estimate the causal effect of participating in the programme on the employment outcomes, we exploit a rule that gives priority for participation to unemployed people under the age of 25 using a fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design setup. The estimated effects of the programme on the probability of being employed and monthly income up to 3.5 years after registering in the programme are positive but not statistically significant, although we find a strong positive effect of the priority rule on programme participation. This is the first evidence on the impact of a programme within the current Youth Guarantee scheme in Europe and our findings are in line with those from the literature on the evaluation of active labour market policies targeting youth.
J08|Wages, Creative Destruction, and Union Networks|Do unions promote creative destruction? In this paper we apply a shift-share approach and historical unionisation data from 1918 to study the impact of changes in regional unionisation on regional wage and productivity growth and job creation and destruction during the period 2003-2012. As local regional-industrial unionisation increases, wages grow. Lay-offs through plant closure and shrinking workplaces increase, but entry and new hires are unaffected. Overall, the increased unionisation yields a positive impact on regional productivity, exceeding the wage growth, partly due to the closure of less productive firms, but also enhanced productivity of the survivors and new entrants.
J08|Marriage, Labor Supply and the Dynamics of the Social Safety Net|"The 1996 PRWORA reform introduced time limits on the receipt of welfare in the United States. We use variation by state and across demographic groups to provide reduced form evidence showing that such limits led to a fall in welfare claims (partly due to \banking"" benefits for future use), a rise in employment, and a decline in divorce rates. We then specify and estimate a life-cycle model of marriage, labor supply and divorce under limited commitment to better understand the mechanisms behind these behavioral responses, carry out counterfactual analysis with longer run impacts and evaluate the welfare effects of the program. Based on the model, which reproduces the reduced form estimates, we show that among low educated women, instead of relying on TANF, single mothers work more, more mothers remain married, some move to relying only on food stamps and, in ex-ante welfare terms, women are worse off."
J08|Do Ban the Box Laws Increase Crime?|Ban-the-box (BTB) laws, which prevent employers from asking prospective employees about their criminal histories at initial job screenings, are intended to increase employment opportunities and reduce economic incentives for crime. This study is the first to explore the relationship between BTB laws and crime. Using agency-by-month data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), we find that BTB laws are associated with a 10 percent increase in criminal incidents involving Hispanic male arrestees. This finding is supported by parallel analysis using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) and is consistent with BTB law-induced job loss due to employer-based statistical discrimination. We find no evidence that BTB laws increase property crime among African American men despite their also facing statistical discrimination. Supplemental analyses from the American Community Survey (ACS) suggest that barriers to welfare participation among Hispanic men may explain this result. Our estimates suggest that BTB laws generate $401 million in annual crime costs.
J08|Theory and Evidence on Employer Collusion in the Franchise Sector|"In this paper we study the role of covenants in franchise contracts that restrict the recruitment and hiring of employees from other units within the same franchise chain in suppressing and hiring of employees from other units within the same franchise chain in suppressing find that ""no-poaching of workers agreements"" are included in a surprising 58 percent of major franchisors' contracts, including McDonald's, Burger King, Jiffy Lube and H&R Block. Theoretical models of oligopsony and dynamic monopsony, as well as incentives for investment in job training, are discussed in the context of these no-poaching agreements. Although the occurrence of no-poaching agreements is difficult to predict from franchise or industry characteristics, no-poaching agreements are more common for franchises in low-wage and high-turnover industries."
J08|The Minimum Wage, EITC, and Criminal Recidivism|For recently released prisoners, the minimum wage and the availability of state Earned Income Tax Credits (EITCs) can influence both their ability to find employment and their potential legal wages relative to illegal sources of income, in turn affecting the probability they return to prison. Using administrative prison release records from nearly six million o enders released between 2000 and 2014, we use a difference-in- differences strategy to identify the effect of over two hundred state and federal minimum wage increases, as well as 21 state EITC programs, on recidivism. We find that the average minimum wage increase of 8% reduces the probability that men and women return to prison within 1 year by 2%. This implies that on average the wage effect, drawing at least some ex-o enders into the legal labor market, dominates any reduced employment in this population due to the minimum wage. These reductions in reconvictions are observed for the potentially revenue generating crime categories of property and drug crimes; prison reentry for violent crimes are unchanged, supporting our framing that minimum wages affect crime that serves as a source of income. The availability of state EITCs also reduces recidivism, but only for women. Given that state EITCs are predominantly available to custodial parents of minor children, this asymmetry is not surprising. Framed within a simple model where earnings from criminal endeavors serve as a reservation wage for ex-o enders, our results suggest that the wages of crime are on average higher than comparable opportunities for low-skilled labor in the legal labor market.
J08|Social Security Programs and Employment at Older Ages in the Netherlands|There have been a vast number of social security reforms aimed at increasing employment at older ages over the last two decades in the Netherlands. These reforms mainly lead to more stringent eligibility criteria for, and reduced generosity of, social security programs. Our empirical evidence suggests that these reforms are likely to have contributed to individuals working longer, but it is difficult to pinpoint which reforms have been most effective. Furthermore, we show that the recent increase in the state pension eligibility age is likely to further increase employment at older ages.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J08|Integration of Migrants, Refugees and Asylum Seekers in Remote Areas with Declining Populations|This paper examines whether immigration can operate as a counter-process of depopulation and economic recession. Based on the comparative analysis of four case studies in Belluno (Italy), Klagenfurt-Villach (Austria), Dalarna (Sweden), and Haßberge (Germany), it analyses the key socio-economic factors explaining the successful integration of migrants, refugees, status holders and asylum seekers and examines under which conditions the arrival of newcomers can turn into a local development opportunity for these territories. The case studies feature four remote territories with the following common characteristics: they have undergone significant socio-economic transformations over the past decade, they face a population decline with an alarming outmigration of youth combined with an increasing ageing population, and central governments have channelled recent immigration and asylum seekers to peripheral areas to counterbalance negative demographic trends. Results show that integration paths undertaken by recipients differ significantly across the four territories. However, all case studies suggest that stable jobs and accommodations render remote and mountain localities attractive for refugees and status holders, who are usually more inclined to move to urban centres. Lastly, results from the case studies highlight the importance of designing individualised integration paths backed by social inclusion initiatives that can incite spontaneous collaborations and work relations with local inhabitants.
J08|Making growth more inclusive in Thailand|The People pillar of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development focuses on quality of life in all its dimensions, and emphasises the international community’s commitment to ensuring all human beings can fulfil their potential in dignity, equality and good health. Thailand’s path from a low-income to an upper-middle-income country over recent decades is widely hailed as a development success story. Poverty has fallen impressively and inequality is on a downwards trend, but more efforts are needed to reduce still widespread informality and persistent, substantial regional inequalities, and to further improve living standards, especially for those who currently work informally. To achieve these objectives, the government needs to: (i) consider tax and regulatory measures to encourage formalisation; (ii) boost the participation rates of informal workers in social protection schemes; (iii) expand adequate social safety nets for poor households and the elderly; (iv) prepare the healthcare system for an ageing and modernising society; and (v) improve the education system, particularly in rural areas. Gaps also remain in ensuring women’s political participation and reducing gender-based violence. This Working Paper relates to the 2018 Initial Assessment report of the Multi-dimensional Country Review of Thailand (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/multi-dimensional-review-thailand.htm)
J08|The quantification of structural reforms|This paper summarises earlier OECD work aimed at quantifying the impact of structural reforms on economic outcomes. It overviews: i.) insights obtained for the linear relationships linking policies and economic outcomes (including multi-factor productivity, capital deepening and employment) for an almost complete set of OECD countries, ii.) non-linear results on how policies interact with each other in OECD countries, and iii.) results extended for emerging-market economies looking at whether policy effects vary across countries depending on the level of economic development and whether institutions have an influence on economic outcomes. The paper lists of policies and institutions that could be used to quantify the effect of reforms. It also gives some guidance on how to quantify reforms in OECD and non-OECD countries. It provides mid-point estimates of the long-run effects on per capita income levels through the three supply-side channels. Finally, it raises the issue of estimation and model uncertainty.
J08|The quantification of structural reforms: Introducing country-specific policy effects|This paper presents country-specific effects of structural reforms. It discusses how sizeable and interesting country-specific effects can be identified in a panel setting by conditioning the impact of individual policies on their own level or on the stance of other policies and institutions. This approach allows for the incorporation of a potentially large set of additional policy areas including institutions and policy areas with limited time-series availability (e.g. sub-components of the Product Market Regulation indicator, housing market regulations and policies, Doing Business indicators and the quality of institutions such as the rule of law indicator or the efficiency of the legal system). Results suggest that for instance, when more stringent product market regulation hurts more in more open economies. Better institutions amplify the positive effect of R&D spending. Tax wedge reduction leads to less employment gains when EPL is not very stringent.
J08|Making Employment More Inclusive in the Netherlands|The Dutch labour market has recovered and the unemployment rate has been converging towards pre-crisis levels. Non-standard forms of work have expanded with a strong trend towards self-employment and an increased reliance on temporary contracts. These developments may reflect a preference of some individuals for a more flexible working relationship, but they could also lower job security and job quality for others. Policies need to protect vulnerable groups in the more dynamic working environment without creating barriers to labour mobility and flexibility of the overall labour market. To improve the fairness of the tax system, policies should ensure a more level playing field between workers on different types of contracts. Regulatory policies should aim at raising labour market mobility to improve the matching of skills to jobs by easing the protection on permanent employment contracts and through a more targeted approach to activation policies for disadvantaged groups. Finally, measures should improve the skills of individuals in vulnerable groups to enhance their opportunities to find better jobs.This Working Paper relates to the 2018 OECD Economic Survey of the Netherlands 2018(www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-the netherlands.htm).

Eligibility criteria for unemployment benefits determine what claimants need to do to successfully claim benefits initially or to continue receiving them.

J08|Do Job Training Programs Motivate the Youth to Get Jobs?|We investigate the effect of participating in a job training program for youth on job-search efforts. The program the present paper focuses is a free job-training program for the youth, which is given by the Japanese government. The youth participating the program has to attend the program everyday in two weeks, and acquires job search skills through various group works. We conducted an original survey for program participants to ask job-search motivation at three time points: on the first day, the middle day and the last day of the program. We also conducted the survey for job seekers who do not participate the program. The results, based on Propensity Matching Method, show that the participants have higher job-search motivation and better prospect of getting jobs than non-participants do on the last day of the program. The results, based on panel estimation controlling for job-seekers’ unobserved effect, also show that the participants gradually improve the motivation and prospect during the training period. A follow-up survey further shows that the participants who improved their prospect of getting a job during the training period have higher probabilities of getting jobs after the program ended. These results suggest that a youth job training program improve a motivation to get a job and the improvement of the motivation lead to get a job.
J08|Cessation of activity benefit of Spanish self-employed workers: a heterogeneous impact evaluation|The goal of this paper is to evaluate the effects of a public policy implemented through the Spanish Social Security system: the Cessation of Activity Benefit (CAB) for self-employed workers. Making use of the Continuous Sample of Working Lives (MCVL) and by means of a Propensity Score Matching (PSM) methodology, our results show that, when we do not take into account heterogeneity in the treatment, self-employed workers receiving CAB experience non-employment spells between 22 and 33 logarithmic points longer than their not entitled counterparts. We also detect that this difference is not constant but depends on the likelihood of being treated. We believe that the two traditional problems that affect the insurance markets, consequence of the asymmetric information, adverse selection and moral hazard, are behind these results.
J08|Cognitive and Non-Cognitive Effects of Nursery Care in the Medium Run under Unobserved Heterogeneity|Unlike the previous literature which focuses on the short run cognitive effects of attending childcare (3-5 years old), we estimate the medium run cognitive and non-cognitive effects of nursery care (0-2 years old) considering not only observed but also unobserved heterogeneity. We constructed a panel dataset with national coverage from different administrative sources. Our results suggest positive selection for Language, Mathematics, Motivation and Self-Esteem, implying that babies and toddlers who are more likely (for unobserved reasons) to attend nursery care have a higher treatment effect. We also find heterogeneous effects in a way that further expansions of public nursery care centers that successfully attract babies and toddlers with high resistance and not currently enrolled in nursery care may yield low returns. This calls into question childcare policies at very early stages especially when there is poor quality involved.
J08|Arbeitsplätze und Beschäftigungswirkungen im und durch das System der Privaten Krankenversicherung (PKV): Kommentierter Literatur-Review unter besonderer Berücksichtigung von Transformationsmodellen zur Bürgerversicherung<BR>[Jobs and employment impact in and by the private health insurance system: Annotated literature review with special regard to transformation models to a “Bürgerversicherung” (single-payer system)]|This paper offers a systematic literature review about jobs and related employment impacts in and by the system of private health insurance (Private Krankenversicherung, PKV). The available literature shows the varying evaluation of private health insurance’s relevance for labor policy depending on emphasis, perspective, methodology and delineation in use. The estimated employment impact of the private health insurance field as insurance carrier and as financier of health care services are complex. Therefore, the number of affected jobs of numerous transformation scenarios to a single-payer system which are discussed by political stakeholders would be substantial. Employment trade-offs in the private health insurance field as insurance carrier are explicitly regarded as unrealistic in current research literature. Neither the expansion of supplementary insurance business in the private health insurance nor employment creation in the statutory health insurance system seems expectable. Additionally, private health insurance companies might refuse to enter the single-payer system-market because of little prospect for success. That would parallel a “cold start” in an unknown and already fully occupied market. Employment impacts through a loss of funding for health care services could be compensated if the financing share of private patients doesn’t lead to a financial loss for health care service providers. In return, that would result in an increase of contribution rate by 1.5 contribution rate points as pointed out in the literature.
J08|Dismissal Laws, Innovation, and Economic Growth|We show theoretically and empirically that dismissal laws—laws that impose hurdles on firing of employees—spur innovation and thereby economic growth. Theoretically, dismissal laws make it costly for firms to arbitrarily discharge employees. This enables firms to commit to not punish short-run failures of employees. Because innovation is inherently risky and employment contracts are incomplete, dismissal laws enable such commitment. Specifically, absent such laws, firms cannot contractually commit so ex ante. The commitment provided by dismissal laws encourages employees to exert greater effort in risky, but path-breaking, projects thereby fostering firm-level innovation. We provide empirical evidence supporting this thesis using the discontinuity provided by the passage of the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. Using the fact that this Act only applied to firms with 100 or more employees, I undertake difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity tests to provide this evidence. Building on endogenous growth theory, which posits that economic growth stems from innovation, I also show that dismissal laws correlate positively with economic growth. However, other forms of labor laws correlate negatively with economic growth and swamp the positive effect of dismissal laws.
J08|Evolución reciente de las principales variables del mercado laboral uruguayo|This document describes the evolution of the Uruguayan Labour Market during the last decade, disaggregating the main indicators by categories such as sex, age and region. In a context of economic growth (53.7% of GDP growth in this period), all of the main Labour Market indicators improved. The Activity Rate and the Employment Rate increased 2.7 and 4.3 p.p. while the overall quality of the jobs also improved. Also, there was a reduction in the average hours worked and a growth of the apparent labour productivity (40.5%), wages per hour increased by 32% and inequiality, measured by the Gini coefficient, went down by 10 p.p. However, there are still vulnerable groups that experience difficulties entering in the Labour Market (the youth unemployment rate is over 20%, womenÅ½s activity rate is 20 p.p. less than menÅ½s and this difference is bigger in the active population with lower educational levels) and there are several groups with poor quality jobs (young workers, people with low educational levels and self-employed). Certain regions of Uruguay continue to have problems with the quality of jobs (in the North and Northeastern regions the percentage of workers without pension rights were 34.2% and 41.5, respectively).
J08|The European Youth Guarantee: A Preliminary Assessment and Broader Conceptual Implications|This paper assesses the current situation of youth unemployment in the European Union. In this context, the main questions are whether the European Youth Guarantee has had any effects and how the school-to-work transitions of young individuals in Europe could be improved.
J08|Digital Challenges for the Welfare State|Digitalization is the buzzword under which profound changes of the labor market can be summarized. Next to automation, i.e., the increasing use of robots, â€œintelligentâ€ machines and more comprehensive algorithms that is no longer restricted to routine tasks, especially the emerging platform economy may pose significant â€œdigital challengesâ€ for the welfare state. This article sheds light on the potentially eroding foundations of the welfare state, it discusses tools for combating a potential digital divide on the individual level, and it proposes a new institutional perspective on firms, workers, and the welfare state.
J08|Das deutsche Arbeitsmarktwunder: Eine Bilanz|Dem deutschen Arbeitsmarkt ging es noch nie seit der Wiedervereinigung so gut wie heute. Die nachhaltige Entwicklung seit 2005 ist auf einen entscheidenden Treiber zurückzuführen: die Umverteilung eines beinahe gleichbleibenden Arbeitsstundenvolumens auf mehr Beschäftigte durch die massive Ausweitung der Teilzeitarbeit. Die Lohnzurückhaltung der Tarifparteien war dabei eine notwendige, jedoch nicht hinreichende Bedingung für diesen Erfolg. Die Kovarianz von Lohn und Erwerbsindikatoren deutet allerdings darauf hin, dass die Arbeitsmarktreformen der sogenannten Agenda 2010 die erwerbsfähige Bevölkerung ab 2005 zur Teilnahme am Arbeitsmarkt aktiviert haben. Insbesondere die Reform der Arbeitslosenunterstützung hat die Ausweitung des Arbeitsangebots im unteren Lohnsegment ermöglicht und bewerkstelligt, dass die sozialversicherungspflichtige Teil- und Vollzeitarbeit zunahm. Ein Rückbau der Reformen könnte diesen Erfolg gefährden.
J08|Employment Protection, Capital Investments and Labor Productivity|In the this paper, I analyze the effect of Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) on investments in physical capital and labor productivity by exploiting the fact that small establishments in Germany below a given size threshold are exempted from certain parts of EPL. I do this by means of an Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) and using establishment-level data for the period 1994-2012. Following the implications of the theoretical literature, I also analyze whether or not EPL affects the employment margin and conduct an implicit test for the possibility of a negative impact of EPL on investments due to hold-up by using linked employer-employee data. I do not find a statistically significant threshold effect on any of these outcomes– also not when analyzing the effect of EPL by industry. The results of EPL on investments and labor productivity are consistent with the predictions of the literature that states if EPL does not affect the employment margin, it should also not impact any other margin of non-labor adjustment.
J08|Unemployment: The Silent Epidemic|This paper examines two key aspects of unemployment--its propagation mechanism and socioeconomic costs. It identifies a key feature of this macroeconomic phenomenon: it behaves like a disease. A detailed assessment of the transmission mechanism and the existing pecuniary and nonpecuniary costs of unemployment suggests a fundamental shift in the policy responses to tackling joblessness. To stem the contagion effect and its outsized social and economic impact, fiscal policy can be designed around two criteria for successful disease intervention--preparedness and prevention. The paper examines how a job guarantee proposal uniquely meets those two requirements. It is a policy response whose merits include much more than its macroeconomic stabilization features, as discussed in the literature. It is, in a sense, a method of inoculation against the vile effects of unemployment. The paper discusses several preventative features of the program.
J08|Impact of short term vocational training on youth unemployment: Evidence from Mongolia|Mongolia is a lower-middle income country characterized by high youth unemployment and a large informal sector. Training programs have been implemented in order to promote employment and tackle these issues. In this study, we evaluate the impact of a vocational training program (VTP) through a field experiment conducted between 2013 and 2015. This time frame allows us to explore short and medium term impacts. In particular, we focus on three outcomes of interest: employment, earnings and job quality. We find a positive and short-term impact on employment and a positive impact on monthly earnings in short and medium terms. We also show that providing information about schooling returns increases attendance and reduces dropout, which may help improve the program’s impact in non-expensive ways.
J08|Maternity and Family Leave Policy|Maternity and family leave policies enable mothers to take time off work to prepare for and recover from childbirth and to care for their new children. While there is substantial variation in the details of these policies around the world, the existing research yields the following general conclusions. First, despite important barriers to the take-up of leave, both the implementation of new programs and extensions of existing ones increase leave-taking rates among new parents. Second, leave entitlements less than one year in length can improve job continuity for women and increase their employment rates several years after childbirth; longer leaves can negatively influence women’s earnings, employment, and career advancement. Third, extensions in existing paid leave policies have no impact on measures of child well-being, but the introduction of short paid and unpaid leave programs can improve children’s short- and long-term outcomes. Fourth, while more research is needed, the current evidence shows minimal impacts of existing U.S. state-level programs on employer-level outcomes such as employee productivity, morale, profitability, turnover rates, or the total wage bill.
J08|Estimating the employment effects of recent minimum wage changes: Early evidence, an interpretative framework, and a pre-commitment to future analysis|Clemens and Strain present early evidence on the employment effects of state minimum wage increases enacted between January 2013 and January 2015 and offer an interpretative framework to understand why it is of interest to study recent changes in isolation.
J08|Immigration Restrictions as Active Labor Market Policy: Evidence from the Mexican Bracero Exclusion|An important class of active labor market policy has received little impact evaluation: immigration barriers intended to raise wages and employment by shrinking labor supply. Theories of endogenous technical advance raise the possibility of limited or even perverse impact. We study a natural policy experiment: the exclusion of almost half a million Mexican bracero farm workers from the United States to improve farm labor market conditions. With novel labor market data we measure state-level exposure to exclusion and model the absent changes in technology or crop mix. We fail to reject zero labor market impact, inconsistent with this model.
J08|Living Up to Expectations: How Job Training Made Women Better Off and Men Worse Off|We study the interaction between job and soft skills training on expectations and labor market outcomes in the context of a youth training program in the Dominican Republic. Program applicants were randomly assigned to one of 3 modalities: a full treatment consisting of hard and soft skills training plus an internship, a partial treatment consisting of soft skills training plus an internship, or a control group. We find strong and lasting effects of the program on personal skills acquisition and expectations, but these results are markedly different for young men and young women. Shortly after completing the program, both male and female participants report increased expectations for improved employment and livelihoods. This result is reversed for male participants in the long run, a result that can be attributed to the program’s negative short-run effects on labor market outcomes for males. While these effects seem to dissipate in the long run, employed men are substantially more likely to be searching for another job. On the other hand, women experience improved labor market outcomes in the short run and exhibit substantially higher levels of personal skills in the long run. These results translate into women being more optimistic, having higher self-esteem and lower fertility in the long run. Our results suggest that job-training programs of this type can be transformative – for women, life skills mattered and made a difference, but they can also have a downside if, like in this case for men, training creates expectations that are not met.
J08|Differentiated Accountability and Education Production: Evidence from NCLB Waivers|In 2011, the U.S. Department of Education granted states the opportunity to apply for waivers from the core requirements of No Child Left Behind (NCLB). In exchange, states implemented systems of differentiated accountability in which they identified and intervened in their lowest-performing schools (“Priority” schools) and schools with the largest achievement gaps between subgroups of students (“Focus” schools). We use administrative data from Michigan in a series of regression-discontinuity analyses to study the effects of these reforms on schools and students. Overall, we find that neither reform had appreciable impacts on various measures of school staffing, student composition, or academic achievement. We find some evidence that the Focus designation led to small, short-run reductions in the within-school math achievement gap – but that these reductions were driven by stagnant performance of lower-achieving students alongside declines in the performance of their higher-achieving peers. These findings serve as a cautionary tale for the capacity of the accountability provisions embedded in the recent reauthorization of NCLB, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), to meaningfully improve student and school outcomes.
J08|The impacts of reduced access to abortion and family planning services on abortions, births, and contraceptive purchases|Between 2011 and 2014, Texas enacted three pieces of legislation that significantly reduced funding for family planning services and increased restrictions on abortion clinic operations. Together this legislation creates cross-county variation over time in access to abortion and family planning services, which we leverage to understand the impact of family planning and abortion clinic access on abortions, births, and contraceptive purchases. In response to these policies, abortions to Texas residents fell 16.7% and births rose 1.3% in counties that no longer had an abortion provider within 50 mi. Changes in the family planning market induced a 1.2% increase in births for counties that no longer had a publicly funded family planning clinic within 25 mi. Meanwhile, responses of retail purchases of condoms and emergency contraceptives to both abortion and family planning service changes were minimal.
J08|Is Occupational Licensing a Barrier to Interstate Migration?|Occupational licensure, one of the most significant labor market regulations in the United States, may restrict the interstate movement of workers. We analyze the interstate migration of 22 licensed occupations. Using an empirical strategy that controls for unobservable characteristics that drive long-distance moves, we find that the between-state migration rate for individuals in occupations with state-specific licensing exam requirements is 36 percent lower relative to members of other occupations. Members of licensed occupations with national licensing exams show no evidence of limited interstate migration. The size of this effect varies across occupations and appears to be tied to the state specificity of licensing requirements. We also provide evidence that the adoption of reciprocity agreements, which lower re-licensure costs, increases the interstate migration rate of lawyers. Based on our results, we estimate that the rise in occupational licensing can explain part of the documented decline in interstate migration and job transitions in the United States.
J08|Jevons’s Ideal Role for Labor Unions as a Form of Co-operation|This research examines the ideas about labor unions found in William Stanley Jevons's works. I focus on the collaborative role Jevons envisioned for these organizations as part of a broader cooperative vision between workers and capitalists. Even though Jevons was not a supporter of labor unions and regarded them as monopolies with limited power to increase wages, on the one hand, and with great potential for generating dead losses of wages due strikes, on the other, he did not consider indispensable their elimination as long as they were guided to co-operate with business. This study concludes that there is more than one form of co-operation in Jevons’s thought. One explicit, from capitalist to workers, via profit sharing, and a second one, implicit, through the collaboration of workers to capitalists via their participation in labor organizations different than traditional labor unions. A major implication of this scheme is that both forms of co-operation have to be present for it to be beneficial for both classes. The latter, however, would not ensure that they are equally beneficiated.
J08|Employment, Education and the State|The 2016 India Employment Report demolishes the myths of both `demographic dividend' and `jobless growth' in the India growth story. But it recognises that the growth of decent, productive employment is too slow even to absorb the annual increment of new workers in the workforce, let alone eliminate the huge backlog of open unemployment and low productivity underemployment. This paper argues that this challenge is a man-made problem, the consequence of a range of dysfunctional policies that have a strong anti-employment bias. Moreover, a long standing elitist bias in education policy has pre-empted the provision of quality basic education without which the bulk of the workforce cannot be suitably skilled for decent, productive employment. The paper suggests that these dysfunctional policies are attributable to a fractionalized polity and India's soft state, which stands in sharp contrast to the hard states seen in the dramatically successful East Asian model of guided capitalism.
J08|Union Density, Productivity, and Wages|We exploit tax-induced exogenous variance in the price of union membership to identify the effects of changes in firm union density on firm productivity and wages in the population of Norwegian firms over the period 2001 to 2012. Increases in union density lead to substantial increases in firm productivity and wages having accounted for the potential endogeneity of unionization. The wage effect is larger in more productive firms, consistent with rent-sharing models.
J08|The quantification of structural reforms in OECD countries: A new framework|This document describes and discusses a new supply side framework that quantifies the impact of structural reforms on per capita income in OECD countries. It obtains the overall macroeconomic reform impacts by aggregating over the effects on physical capital, employment and productivity through a production function. On the basis of reforms defined as observed changes in policies, the paper finds that product market regulation has the largest overall single policy impact five years after the reforms. But the combined impact of all labour market policies is considerably larger than that of product market regulation. The paper also shows that policy impacts can differ at different horizons. The overall long-term effects on GDP per capita of policies transiting through capital deepening can be considerably larger than the 5- to 10-year impacts. By contrast, the long-term impact of policies coming only via the employment rate channel materialises at shorter horizon.
J08| Has the Gender Wage Gap been Reduced during the 'Peruvian Growth Miracle?' A Distributional Approach| Between 2004 and 2014 the Peruvian economy experienced a noticeable growth which surpassed most of Latin American countries during that period, leading some to quote this episode as the Peruvian Growth Miracle. Yet, growth of wages would not have been accompanied by an equally marked reduction in wage differentials between men and women despite government efforts to address this issue. Consequently, this study analyzes and decomposes the gender wage gap in Peru for 2004 and 2014 using the Machado and Mata (2005) decomposition method correcting for sample selection bias in the context of quantile regression (Albrecht et al. 2009). This allows to decompose the differential in terms of the endowment and treatment effect at each point of the income distribution instead of, as has been customary in previous studies for Peru, only at the average of the distribution. Using data from the National Household Survey, we find that unconditional and conditional gaps, which favour men, have deepened between 2004 and 2014 at every point of the distribution, while there is evidence of sticky floors and glass ceilings in both years. Decompositions consistently reveal that, for both years, discrimination against women is the most important factor behind gender gaps at each percentile even though the effect of endowments plays in favor of those. All in all, this raise doubts about the aggregate effectiveness of pro-equity policies applied in recent years. JEL Classification-JEL: C01, J08, J16, O12
J08|The labour market policy in the EU|In the era of demographic changes and need for rationalization of public expenditure, the European Union social policy promotes the activation approach. In addition, there can be noticed a growing importance of increasing the efficiency of public policies. The authors are presenting the main theoretical assumptions concerning efficiency as well as classification of methods for measuring of efficiency of labour market policies. Moreover, the EU countries are classified in clusters according to their level of expenditure on different categories of LMP. The paper is based on critical analysis of literature as well as analysis of secondary research findings. The cross-country labour market situation in the EU is based on the analysis of the Eurostat data by the k-means method. There is a need to work out a complex evaluation of labour market policies in the EU to provide comparative analysis of the EU countries (or groups of countries). It would allow determining the level of development of the country in terms of the efficiency of labour market policies.The EU countries with the best labour market situation represent diverse levels of LMP expenditure.
J08|Natural and cyclical unemployment: a stochastic frontier decomposition and economic policy implications|The main goal of the present work is to split effective unemployment into two components, one dealing with the natural rate of unemployment, and another with cyclical unemployment. With this purpose in mind, an estimation of stochastic cost frontiers is performed where natural unemployment is identified as a lower limit and cyclical unemployment as the deviation of effective unemployment with regard to that limit. To achieve this purpose, information is used from the 17 autonomous communities in Spain over the period spanning 1982 to 2013. Results evidence a greater importance of the natural component as the principal determinant of effective unemployment at a regional scale. The latter part of the work compares stochastic frontier estimations to those obtained when applying univariate filters, which are in widespread use in economic literature. The main conclusion to emerge is that the proposed decomposition modifies the weight distribution amongst the various types of unemployment, increasing the importance of cyclical unemployment. This finding has significant implications for economic policy, such as the existence of a greater margin for aggregate demand policies in order to reduce cyclical unemployment, particularly during growth periods.
J08|‘Private sector’ Emiratisation: job satisfaction and sociocultural influences|Purpose — To gauge the job satisfaction levels of UAE nationals employed in the (‘real’ and quasi-) private sector. Despite private sector Emiratisation (labour market nationalisation) having been in place since the late 1990s and considered a strategic government priority in 2007, the numbers of nationals employed in the private sector as a ratio to those employed in the public sector remains particularly low. Design/methodology/approach — This study is based on a survey of 653 nationals employed in the non-classic sector (i.e., working at commercially-run entities). The instrument used was based on the Job Satisfaction Survey construct and assessed, inter alia, the impact of sectoral pay and benefit discrepancies and prevailing societal sentiment towards the ‘appropriacy’ of pursuing a non-conventional career path. Findings — statistically significant relationships between the dependent variable of “continuance intentions” and various predictor variables were observed: β .399 for salary and benefits; whilst sociocultural influences was found to have a significant and negative relationship, β -.423. Originality/value — This research can help in a) identifying and prioritising the economic and social issues that are impacting the pace of Emiratisation and b) in understanding what incentives and measures can be useful and effective for the operational implementation of labour nationalisation policies throughout the Arab Gulf and therefore adds to the growing body of literature on an Arab Middle East HRM model.
J08|The Effect of Job Readiness Programs on Criminal Behavior|In this paper, I find that participants in a job-readiness program, Cincinnati Works, in Cincinnati, Ohio are nine percentage points less likely to be charged with a felony compared to non-members. Given that 18 percent of non-members are charged with a felony sometime in the five years after their applications, Cincinnati Works decreases the probability of criminal charges by 50 percent. Moreover, the reduction in crime is driven by those individuals who were not previously felons. Cincinnati Works appears to be more effective at keeping individuals out of the criminal justice system for the first time, compared to reducing the recidivism rate. I find that the taxpayer benefit per Cincinnati Works participant is between $486 and $1,584 a year, depending on whether or not the marginal costs of a prison system include employee compensation. However, because the average cost per participant is $4,669, the program is unlikely to pay for itself based only on a reduction in criminal recidivism.
J08|Explicando la brecha entre el salario real y la productividad laboral en la República Dominicana: Análisis macroeconómico y recomendaciones de políticas basadas en microsimulaciones<BR>[Explaining the Gap Between Real Earnings and Labor Productivity in the Dominican Republic: Macroeconomic Analysis and Policy Recommendations based on Microsimulations]|This paper addresses the determinants and causes of the gap between real earnings and labor productivity in the Dominican Republic, using data from the National Labor Force Survey. Our estimates indicate that the main determinants of the gap between real earnings and labor productivity are the bargaining power of workers, the downward pressure the Dominican Republic receives from lower-wages exporting countries, and the level of education of the working population. Likewise, in order to evaluate possible solutions to close the real earnings-labor productivity gap, we run micro-simulations, in order to evaluate the impact of four specific public policies would have on real earnings: firstly, an increasing the formality rate of employment; secondly, an increase the bargaining power of employees; thirdly, an increase of higher education; and finally, an increase of vocational education in the working population. Our results suggest that increasing both the scope of higher education and vocational education, as well as increasing the bargaining power of the working population, would translate into gains in terms of real wages that would help to close the gap between real earnings and labor productivity.
J08|The Evaluation of Employment Policies for Older Adults in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia|Adults aged 65 and above comprise the fastest growing sector of the world’s population. In the context of increasing numbers of older adults, employment policies have become a prominent issue. Governments recognize the importance of increasing participation in working age population and providing them with equal workplace opportunities. Yet, it appears that policies raising employment rates of older adults have become a slogan that governments use for election purposes, but the reality is different. In the groundbreaking report “Working Better with Age: Poland” prepared by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (2015), Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia belong to a group of countries where the increase in the employment rate of older adults is well below the OECD average. The objective of our critical review is to evaluate current employment policies for older adults, including but not limited to healthy work conditions, age management strategies, employment services for older workers, and strategies implemented to prevent age discrimination, in these three countries. This article also discusses the reasons for the reduction in the employment of older adults, the current barriers in employing older adults that require governments’ attention, and suggests solutions for creating an age-friendly labor market that can effectively make use of older adults’ competencies. Employment rates for people of different ages are significantly affected by government policies with regard to higher education, pensions, and retirement age.

J08|The Impact of Immigration on Wages, Internal Migration and Welfare|This paper studies the impact of immigration on wages, internal migration and welfare. Using U.S. Census data, I estimate a spatial equilibrium model where labor differs by skill level, gender and nativity. Workers are heterogeneous in city preferences. Cities vary in productivity levels, housing prices and amenities. I use the estimated model to assess the distributional consequences of several immigration policies. The results show that a skill selective immigration policy leads to welfare gains for low skill workers, but welfare losses for high skill workers. The negative impacts are more substantial among the incumbent high skill immigrants. Internal migration mitigates the initial negative impacts, particularity in cities where high skill workers are relatively mobile. However, the negative impacts on some workers intensify. This is because an out-migration of workers of a given type may raise the local wages for workers of that type, while reducing the local wages of workers with complementary characteristics. Overall, there are substantial variations in the welfare effects of immigration across and within cities. Further, I also use the model to assess a non-selective immigration policy and deportation of unauthorized immigrants in specific areas.
J08|Union Density, Productivity and Wages|We exploit tax-induced exogenous variance in the price of union membership to identify the effects of changes in firm union density on firm productivity and wages in the population of Norwegian firms over the period 2001 to 2012. Increases in union density lead to substantial increases in firm productivity and wages having accounted for the potential endogeneity of unionization. The wage effect is larger in more productive firms, consistent with rent-sharing models.
J08|Crime and the minimum wage|How does the minimum wage affect crime rates? Empirical research suggests that increasing a worker's wage can deter him from committing crimes. On the other hand, if that worker becomes displaced as a result of the minimum wage, he may be more likely to commit a crime. In this paper, I describe a frictional world in which a worker's criminal actions are linked to his labor market outcomes. The model is calibrated to match labor market outcomes and crime decisions of workers from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, and shows that the relationship between the aggregate crime rate and the minimum wage is U-shaped. The results from the calibrated model, as well as empirical evidence from county level crime data and state level minimum wage changes from 1995 to 2014, suggest that the crime minimizing minimum to median wage ratio for 16 to 19 year olds is 0.91. However, the welfare maximizing minimum to median wage ratio is 0.87, not equal to the crime minimizing value. The median wage of 16 to 19 year olds in the United States in 2018 was $10, suggesting that any federal minimum wage increase up to $8.70 may be welfare improving. (Copyright: Elsevier)
J08|Government-sponsored labour-market training and output growth - cyclical, structural and globalization influences|Empirical work on the effects of government-sponsored labour-market training programs (LTPs) has been largely focused on the unemployment-exit and employment-entry probabilities of program participants using micro-level data. This paper seeks to add to the current literature by providing broad cross-country evidence on whether or not additional public-sector resources allocated to LTPs contributes to raising output growth and per-capita incomes. Using data from OECD countries during 1989-2009 and GMM estimation, we find evidence suggesting that on average labour-market training programs are growth-enhancing. The positive growth-effect of LTP-spending is found to be stronger the more favourable are business-cycle conditions, the larger is the magnitude of structural shocks at country level and the greater is the scale of opening-up of markets at the global level.
J08|Active labour-market policies and output growth: Is there a causal relationship?|While the labour-market impact of ALMP interventions has been extensively studied, an issue that has not been widely addressed in the literature is to what extent active labour-market policies have beneficial effects for the whole economy at the macroeconomic level. This paper addresses this issue by examining how additional resources allocated to active labour-market policies relate to output-growth rates. It also examines the sensitivity of the growth-ALMP relationship to the business cycle. Based on a structural model, we find that whether or not additional resources allocated to ALMPs contribute to raising output growth is a priori unclear. However, using data from OECD countries during 1991–2011 and GMM estimation to account for potential endogeneities, we find evidence suggesting a net positive output-growth differential due to implementing active labour-market policies in normal times of between 0.004 and 0.006 percentage point. This differential becomes larger during economic upturns when market conditions are improving relative to trend.
J08|Differences by Gender on the Slovak Labour Market|Gender differences between men and women may manifest in any area, such as the gender inequality of men and women, as well as rights and inequalities in the labour market. In recent years, one of the issues discussed in economically advanced countries is the issue of equal opportunities for men and women in the labour market. These differences may be due to different nationality, gender, age, religion or sexual orientation. With respect to the labour market, we focused on gender discrimination, i.e. the different positions of men and women in individual labour market areas on the basis of their gender. The aim of this paper is to identify and evaluate the development of gender differences in the Slovak labour market in the context of global understanding of this issue and to determine whether these differences have a growing trend or are on the decline. Additionally, the paper set out to find in which job positions these differences are the most pronounced. The theoretical approaches and legislative norms governing the equal status of men and women are the basis for this paper. This is followed by an analysis of the development and the current status of women in the Slovak labour market.
J08|Unemployment insurance, job mobility and formalization: an analysis of the Brazilian case|In order to assess the recent rise in the fiscal expenses due to unemployment insurance (UI) in Brazil, we build a simple matching model that takes into account the growing formalization rate, job mobility and other institutional characteristics of the country’s labor market. Our results indicate that around 77% of the positive variation in the UI expenses is due to an increase in the formalization rate, while 22% is due to a rise in the job mobility between 2000-2014.
J08|Methodological Framework for ex-ante Assessment of Active Policies on the Labor Market - Experimental Approach|Ex-ante assessment is a mandatory step before the process of implementation of policies because it brings, through the analyses undertaken improvements for initial design, contributing, on a case by case basis, to increasing of efficiency, effectiveness, relevance, sustainability, equity and of its internal and external coherence. In recent years, at international level, but especially in the EU countries (EU), the ex-ante socio-economic programs and public interventions have become an extremely necessary instrument in decision-making, which is linked own economic and social development of the EU Member States. The article presents a methodological framework for ex-ante assessment of active measures for the employment growth in the context of rural areas, on the bases of efficiency, effectiveness and coherence criteria. Ex-ante social impact assessment of an active policy can have beneficial effects on employment under quantitative and qualitative aspects. The novelty of the article consist in the specific, experimental approach of the development and of ex-ante evaluation of active labor market policies, in the context of rural areas.
J08|Macroeconomic impact of flexicurity on the integration of people with disabilities into the labour market. A two-regime spatial autoregressive analysis|Abstract The aim of this paper is to examine the impact of flexicurity upon regional labour market performance in the employment of disabled people. To this purpose, we estimate a matching function by means of a two-regime spatial autoregressive model on Italian regions for the period 2006–2011. Our results highlight the importance of spatial interactions in the matching process of disabled people, which enable Northern–Central Italy regions to find a job for a number of disabled persons five times higher than the one employed by Southern Italy regions.
J08|Speculation on a Flexicurity Index for Disabled People: The Italian Case|Abstract The aim of this paper is to analyze a flexicurity index for disabled people by using Italian regional data. To this purpose, the empirical results are based on a composite index denoted as Mazziotta-Pareto Index. Our results show that Northern Italy regions show a higher flexicurity degree than Southern Italy ones. In addition, by estimating an augmented matching function, we verify that flexicurity increases the probability of finding employment for a disabled person. In particular, we test that the flexicurity indicator that gives more weight to the economic independence of disabled people represents the indicator that most favors the labour matching process.
J08|Impact of a Work-Study Programme for Teenagers: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial|We present an impact evaluation of a labour programme oriented to young students called “Yo Estudio y Trabajo” (“I Study and Work”) carried out in Uruguay. It is one of the first such evaluations for this country. We estimate the programme’s effects on the probability of being formally employed and continuing to study. Impacts on the very short term (about three months after the programme ended), on the short term (15 months after programme finalisation) and on the medium term (27 months after the programme was completed) are analysed. We use administrative records provided by the public social security provider, the public education administration and the state university. We were able to match all candidates for selection into the programme (over 46,000) with their administrative records. Exploiting the programme’s random selection process, we apply experimental techniques to evaluate its effects through univariate models. In addition, we allow for interdependence between the decisions of working and studying through a bivariate probit model. Results indicate different effects depending on the characteristics of the individuals and the time span considered. In particular, for socially vulnerable youths we find that the programme increases their probability of being formally employed between 8 and 12 percentage points (depending on the particular model considered) in the medium term. These results are robust to different specifications and provide evidence in favour of increasing the programme’s coverage of socially vulnerable youth (a policy that has been under way since 2015).
J08|(How) Do Non-Cognitive Skills Programs Improve Adolescent School Achievement? Experimental Evidence|Non-cognitive skills programs may be an important policy option to improve the academic outcomes of adolescents. In this paper, we evaluate experimentally the EPIS program, which is based on bi-weekly individual or small-group non-cognitive mediation short meetings with low-performing students. Our RCT estimates, covering nearly 3,000 7th and 8th-grade students across over 50 schools and a period of two years, indicate that the program increases the probability of progression by 11% to 22%. The effects are stronger amongst older students, girls, and in language subjects (compared to maths).
J08|Hiring subsidies for people with disabilities: Do they work?|This article evaluates the effectiveness of hiring subsidies targeted to people with disabilities. By exploiting the timing of implementation among the different Spanish regions of a subsidy scheme implemented in Spain during the period 1990-2014, we employ a differences-indifferences approach to estimate the impact of the scheme on the probability of DI ben- eficiaries of transiting to employment and on the propensity of individuals of entering the DI program.
J08|Effects of public policy on child labor: Current knowledge, gaps, and implications for program design|Household decisions about child labor are influenced by income, uncertainty, and relative returns to work and education. The complexity of the phenomenon implies that a large set of policy instruments can be used to address child labor or can affect child labor. This review of 33 impact evaluations provides a comprehensive look at pathways through which social protection (credit and microfinance, cash transfers, vouchers, food programs), and labor programs affect child labor. Despite the complexity of integrating findings across different child labor definitions, implementation contexts, and policy instruments, some patterns emerge. For example, programs that address child labor by reducing the vulnerability of the household produce the desired effect. Transfers reduced child labor in most cases. Similarly, programs that help the household cope with exposure to risk, for example, health insurance, reduce household reliance on child labor. On the other hand, policies aimed at increasing adult household members’ participation in the labor market or entrepreneurial activities, can generate demand for adolescent and child work. Of course, such programs are an important component of anti-poverty strategies, but they could be modified and integrated with additional interventions to ensure that they do not produce adverse effects on child labor. While progress has been made over the past decade, there is still much to learn about the effects of public policy on the labor participation of many children in developing countries.
J08|How Effective Are Active Labor Market Policies in Developing Countries? A Critical Review of Recent Evidence|Jobs are the primary policy concern of policymakers in many countries. The 2007–2008 global financial crisis, rising demographic pressures, high unemployment rates, and concerns over automation all make it seem imperative that policymakers employ increasingly more active labor market policies. This paper critically examines recent evaluations of labor market policies that have provided vocational training, wage subsidies, job search assistance, and assistance moving to argue that many active labor market policies are much less effective than policymakers typically assume. Many of these evaluations find no significant impacts on either employment or earnings. One reason is that urban labor markets appear to work reasonably well in many cases, with fewer market failures than is often thought. As a result, there is less of a role for many traditional active labor market policies than is common practice. The review discusses examples of job-creation policies that do seem to offer promise, and concludes with lessons for impact evaluation and policy is this area
J08|Can Non-Cognitive Skills Programs Improve Achievement? Quasi-Experimental Evidence from EPIS|Do investments in soft skills pay off in terms of student achievement? This paper evaluates a large private-sector program in this area, EPIS, based on individual and small-group sessions of mediators that seek to improve the non-cognitive skills (e.g. motivation, self-esteem, conscientiousness) of selected students. Our quasi-experimental evidence is drawn from rich longitudinal student data and the different timings of the roll-out of the program, within and across schools. The results highlight the potential of targeted, small-group, non-cognitive interventions, as we find that the EPIS program reduced grade retention by at least 10 percentage points and did so in a cost-effective manner.
J08|On the Interaction Between Trade Reforms and Labor Market Regulation: Evidence from the MENA Countries' Labor Markets|Using a panel of MENA countries, this paper tries to examine the interaction between trade reforms and labor market regulations on the outcome of the labor market. The theoretical predictions of this literature show that the effects of trade liberalization in any given country are conditional on the nature of labor market regulations since trade liberalization is more likely to have a positive impact on employment and wages in countries with flexible labor markets and vice versa. Moreover, more regulated labor markets tend to have higher wages at the expense of sector wide employment. Our main findings show that labor market rigidity reduces the positive impact of trade reform on employment. While this result is stronger for females, it is not for males.
J08|Reform der Arbeitslosenversicherung: Eine Bewertung aktueller Reformvorschläge|Dank einer starken Zunahme der sozialversicherungspflichtigen Beschäftigung und einer sinkenden Anzahl von Empfängern von Arbeitslosengeld steht die Arbeitslosenversicherung finanziell gut da. Vor diesem Hintergrund sind mehrere Vorschläge vorgelegt worden, den Leistungskatalog der Bundesagentur für Arbeit auszuweiten. So wurde angeregt, die Voraussetzungen für den Bezug von Arbeitslosengeld zu erleichtern, bestehende Regelungen zur Verhinderung versicherungsschädlichen Verhaltens zu entschärfen sowie die Bundesagentur mit einem weit gefassten Auftrag zur Weiterbildungsförderung von Erwerbstätigen zu versehen. Überwiegend liegen diesen Forderungen keine empirischen Analysen zugrunde. Vielmehr handelt es sich um normative und qualitative Argumentationsstränge. Somit fehlt den avisierten Reformen nicht nur eine tragfähige Begründung. Darüber hinaus kann gezeigt werden, dass von ihnen negative Effekte auf die Arbeitsmarktentwicklung ausgehen können. So ist in der arbeitsmarktökonomischen Forschung theoretisch und empirisch gut belegt, dass eine Verlängerung der Bezugsdauer von Arbeitslosengeld zu einer Verlängerung der individuellen Dauer der Arbeitslosigkeit führt. Dennoch wird genau dies im Kontext der Erweiterung des Arbeitslosengeldanspruchs bei Weiterbildung vorgeschlagen. Auch die Erleichterung der Anspruchsvoraussetzungen für den Erhalt von Arbeitslosengeld wird zu höherer Inanspruchnahme von Leistungen und erschwerter Eingliederung in den Arbeitsmarkt führen. Für keine der Reformvorschläge kann gezeigt werden, dass sie die ökonomischen Funktionen der Arbeitslosenversicherung stärken oder effizienter gestalten. Somit wäre die Schlussfolgerung zu ziehen, dass die finanziellen Gestaltungsspielräume für eine Senkung des Beitragssatzes genutzt werden sollten, sobald eine Reserve angesammelt ist, die den Erfordernissen einer konjunkturellen Krise gerecht wird. Wenn die Arbeitsmarktpolitik im Allgemeinen und die berufliche Weiterbildung im Besonderen gestärkt werden sollen, wäre eine bessere finanzielle Ausstattung der Job-Center im Segment der Grundsicherung für Arbeitsuchende ein besserer und ertrag-reicherer Ansatz.
J08|Frankreich - Herausforderungen für die Finanz- und Wirtschaftspolitik|Frankreich steht vor wichtigen Herausforderungen in der Arbeitsmarkt-, Finanz- und Wirtschaftspolitik. Die Arbeitslosigkeit ist seit vielen Jahren persistent hoch und liegt bei etwa 10 Prozent; die Jugendarbeitslosigkeit sogar bei etwa 25 Prozent. Bei den öffentlichen Finanzen ist dem Land eine nachhaltige Reduzierung des öffentlichen Defizits noch nicht gelungen, der Schuldenstand der öffentlichen Haushalte liegt nur wenig unterhalb der 100-Prozent-Marke. In absoluten Zahlen hat Frankreich bei der öffentlichen Verschuldung Deutschland eingeholt. Bei internationalen Vergleichen zur Wettbewerbsfähigkeit erzielt Frankreich eher einen mittleren Platz. Frankreich hat in den letzten Jahren mit einer Reihe von Reformen auf diese Herausforderungen reagiert. Die Regierung hat besonders mithilfe von fiskalischen Maßnahmen versucht, die Arbeitskosten für die Unternehmen zu senken. Dazu zählen die Steuergutschrift für Unternehmen (CICE) und der Pakt für Verantwortung und Solidarität (RSP). Mit dem sogenannten Macron-Gesetz kam es zu Deregulierungen am Arbeitsmarkt, indem unter anderem die Nutzung von Beschäftigungsschutzabkommen zwischen Unternehmen und Arbeitnehmern erleichtert wurde und indikative Schwellenwerte für einen finanziellen Ausgleich bei Entlassungen eingeführt wurden. Außerdem wurden mit diesem Gesetz im Bereich der Dienstleistungen einige Deregulierungen in Gang gesetzt: Ausweitung der Ladenöffnungszeiten, Liberalisierung von Preisen und Zugangsbedingungen für einzelne reglementierte Berufe. Für einen nachhaltigen Durchbruch zum Besseren muss eine reformorientierte Politik fortgesetzt werden, die jedoch oft auf den Widerstand der Gewerkschaften stößt. Handlungsbedarf besteht ganz besonders im Bereich der öffentlichen Haushalte. Die staatliche Neuverschuldung konnte zwar seit 2010 deutlich zurückgeführt werden, sie liegt aber immer noch über dem 3-Prozent-Kriterium des europäischen Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakts. Es ist auch noch nicht gelungen, die hohe Staatsquote, gemessen als staatliche Ausgaben in Prozent des BIP, zu senken. Maßnahmen zur Senkung der Arbeitskosten in Form von Steuergutschriften führen gleichzeitig zu einer Verschlechterung der öffentlichen Finanzen. Offensichtlich hatte die letzte französische Regierung andere wirtschaftspolitische Präferenzen und eine Neigung zu einer eher keynesianischen Orientierung im Bereich der Makroökonomie. Hier wird letztlich ein fundamentaler Unterschied zur marktwirtschaftlichen Konzeption über die Rolle des Staates im Wirtschaftsprozess deutlich.
J08|Active Labour Market Programmes in Latin America and the Caribbean: Evidence from a Meta Analysis|We present a systematic collection and assessment of impact evaluations of active labour market programmes (ALMP) in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The paper delineates the strategy to compile a novel meta database and provides a narrative review of 51 studies. Based on these studies, the quantitative analysis extracts a sample of 296 impact estimates, and uses meta regression models to analyse systematic patterns in the data. In addition to analysing earnings and employment outcomes as in previous meta analyses, we also code and investigate measures of job quality, such as the effects on hours worked and formality. We find that ALMPs in LAC are particularly effective in increasing the probability of having a formal job, compared to other outcomes. Our results also show that training programmes are slightly more effective than other types of interventions. Moreover, when looking at the sample of training programmes alone, we observe that formal employment is also the outcome category that is most likely to be impacted positively by these programmes. In terms of targeting, we find that ALMPs in the region work better for women than for men, and for youth compared to prime-age workers. Finally, medium-run estimates are not more likely to be positive than short-run estimates, while programmes of short duration (4 months or less) are significantly less likely to produce positive effects compared to longer interventions.
J08|Can social safety nets protect public health? The effect of India's workfare and foodgrain subsidy programmes on anaemia|Can large-scale social safety nets be nutrition sensitive even if they do not explicitly incorporate health and nutrition as programmatic goals? This paper focuses on the consequences of a countrywide guaranteed workfare programme (MGNREGA) and subsidised food distribution scheme (PDS) in India for the prevalence of anaemia, examining whether individuals in districts with a broader reach of these mega-programmes are less likely to be anaemic. Using an Instrumental Variable (IV) approach to address the endogeneity of programme scale, we find that an individual residing in a district where the programmes have broader reach is less likely to suffer from all forms of anaemia and has a lower haemoglobin deficit from the benchmark suggested by the World Health Organisation (WHO) - ranging between 0.91 to 6.2 percentage points for a 10 percentage point expansion in programme scale. While the PDS seems to be more effective in reducing the incidence of mild anaemia than moderate or severe anaemia, while the strength of effects for MGNREGA seem to be the least for mild. These are catch-all effects that represent partial and general equilibrium impacts through multiple pathways. Programme interaction effects suggest the MGNREGA and PDS may be substitutes - associated improvements in anaemia for regions with higher PDS access (MGNREGA participation) are more pronounced when the scale of MGNREGA participation (PDS access) is low. There exist nonlinearities in these relationships with the efficacy of both programmes varying across scales of implementation.
J08|Advice from Women and Men and Selection into Competition|We study how gender affects the impact of advice on men’s and women’s entry into a real-effort tournament and how advice varies with gender and gender matching. Our results show that advice reduces expected forgone earnings. The result is exclusively due to the positive reaction of women’s behavior, regardless of the advisor’s gender. The gender gap is not reduced. With respect to the advice process, our main findings are that, for medium performers, women are less likely to recommend tournament entry than men, women’s advice is worse, and men enter the tournament significantly more often than women with advice. Men follow the advice to avoid the tournament less often than women, independently of whether it comes from a male or female advisor. Overall, the gender of the paired advisee (advisor) does not impact advice giving (following).
J08|Minimum age regulation and child labor: New evidence from Brazil|We suggest new evidence on minimum age regulations using a natural experiment. In 1998, a constitutional reform has changed the minimum working age from 14 to 16 in Brazil. The reform was the legislative counterpart of a broad set of measures taken by a government strongly committed to fighting child labor. We document the fact that enforcement and compliance may have been heterogeneous across regions and job types. The setting allows improving upon past approaches based on the comparison of employment rates of children below and above the minimum age. Precisely, we observe 14-year old children the year after the reform and exploit discontinuous treatment depending on their birthdate (only those who turned 14 after mid-December 1998 are banned). Regression discontinuity and difference-in-discontinuity designs show no effect of the ban overall, nor a reallocation towards less visible activities, or a substitution of labor within families. Importantly, however, we find a significant drop in child labor among those with highest chances of compliance, namely children in visible activities and in regions characterized with an above-average intensity of labor inspections. We provide power calculation and extensive sensitivity checks.
J08|The local economic impacts of regeneration projects: Evidence from UK's Single Regeneration Budget|We study the local economic impacts of a major regeneration programme aimed at enhancing the quality of life of local people in deprived neighbourhoods in the UK. The analysis is based on a panel of firm and area level data available at small spatial scales. Our identification strategies involve: a) exploiting the fine spatial scale of our data to study how effects vary with distance to the intervention area; and b) comparing places close to treatment in early rounds of the programme with places close to treatment in future rounds. We consider the long run impact of schemes funded between 1995 and 1997 on outcomes up to 2009. Our estimates suggest that the programme increased workplace employment in the intervention area but this had no impact on the employment rates of local residents.
J08|Treatment-Related Naturalization Premiums in Two European Countries: Evaluation and Comparison|We conduct an empirical study in order to estimate the impact of naturalization on labor market integration of first generation immigrants in two European countries, France and Denmark. The study contributes to the existing literature by: (1) comparing the employment opportunities and incomes of naturalized and non-naturalized migrants in European labor markets to those of the native population, and (2) attempting to estimate the impact of characteristics of a country’s citizenship policy on this relationship. The results suggest the existence of high naturalization premiums and full socioeconomic integration of naturalized migrants in France, a country with relatively soft naturalization policies, but not for Denmark, which has strict naturalization policies.
J08|Price Floors and Employer Preferences: Evidence from a Minimum Wage Experiment|Minimum hourly wages were randomly imposed on firms posting job openings in an online labor market. A higher minimum wage raised the wages of hired workers substantially. However, there was some reduction in hiring and large reductions in hours-worked. Treated firms hired more productive workers, which can explain, in part, the reduction in hours-worked: with more productive workers, projects were completed in less time. At the conclusion of the experiment, the platform imposed a market-wide minimum wage. A difference-in-differences analysis shows that, in equilibrium, firms still substitute towards more productive workers, adversely affecting less productive workers.
J08|Wedges: Distribution, Distortions, and Market Integration|This paper proposes a stylized model of policy determination and imperfect international integration. A policy wedge aims to correct laissez-faire market imperfections and/or redistribute welfare across heterogeneous agents. Policy is subject to both race-to-the-bottom and beggar-thy-neighbor forces if the country's politico-economic equilibrium interacts with the rest of the world. Variation of international market wedges induces patterns of country-specific regulation and deregulation that depend on political and structural features in non-obvious, intuitive, and empirically realistic ways.
J08|Immigration Restrictions as Active Labor Market Policy: Evidence from the Mexican Bracero Exclusion - Working Paper 451|An important class of active labor market policy has received little rigorous impact evaluation: immigration barriers intended to improve the terms of employment for domestic workers by deliberately shrinking the workforce. Recent advances in the theory of endogenous technical change suggest that such policies could have limited or even perverse labor market effects, but empirical tests are scarce. We study a natural experiment that excluded almost half a million Mexican ‘bracero’ seasonal agricultural workers from the United States, with the stated goal of raising wages and employment for domestic farm workers. We build a simple model to clarify how the labor market effects of bracero exclusion depend on assumptions about production technology, and test it by collecting novel archival data on the bracero program that allow us to measure state-level exposure to exclusion for the first time. We reject the wage effect of bracero exclusion required by the model in the absence of induced technical change, and fail to reject the hypothesis that exclusion had no eect on US agricultural wages or employment. Important mechanisms for this result include both adoption of less labor-intensive technologies and shifts in crop mix.
J08|The Impacts of Reduced Access to Abortion and Family Planning Services: Evidence from Texas|Between 2011 and 2014, Texas enacted three pieces of legislation that significantly reduced funding for family planning services and increased restrictions on abortion clinic operations. Together this legislation creates cross-county variation in access to abortion and family planning services, which we leverage to understand the impact of family planning and abortion clinic access on abortions, births, and contraceptive purchases. In-state abortions fell 20% and births rose 3% in counties that no longer had an abortion provider within 50 miles. Births increased 1% and contraceptive purchases rose 8% in counties without a publicly-funded family planning clinic within 25 miles.
J08|Wedges: Distribution, Distortions, and Market Integration|This paper proposes a stylized model of policy determination and imperfect international integration. A country-specific policy wedge corrects labor market imperfections and/or redistributes welfare across differently wealthy agents. Capital market integration with the rest of the world, indexed by another wedge, shapes the politico-economic equilibrium policy through race-to-the-bottom and beggar-thy-neighbor channels. The policy and welfare implications of tighter international integration depend in sharp and empirically realistic ways on country-specific political and structural features.
J08|A Property Rights Approach to Temporary Work Visas|Rules for temporary labor visas in the United States are criticized on three grounds: for failing to allocate visas efficiently, for failing to adequately protect domestic workers, and for exposing migrant workers to exploitation. We argue that it is possible to address all three problems by reconfiguring the property rights associated with the visas and carefully designing the mechanism for allocating those rights. Our core insight is to unbundle the two rights that today are typically combined: the firm's right to employ a foreign worker and the worker's right to reside and work in the country during that time. A three-pronged approach--auctioning abstract precontract visas to firms, allowing their trade on a secondary market, and transferring the visa's ownership to the worker upon signature of the employment contract--has the potential to improve the efficiency of visa allocation, to better shield domestic workers, and to protect foreign workers from exploitation.

J08|Zur Berechnung von Bruttostundenlöhnen - Verdienst(struktur)erhebung und Sozio-oekonomisches Panel im Vergleich|The statutory minimum wage in Germany was set as hourly wage. Thus, valid information on gross hourly wages must be calculated from monthly wages and weekly working hours. This paper compares the German Socio-Economic Panel and the Structure of Earnings Survey. There exist conceptual differences regarding sampling and collection of data on employees in the household survey (SOEP) and on jobs in the mandatory survey (V(S)E.) Accordingly, weighting and definition of types of employment vary. This also accounts for central characteristics of units observed. Monthly wages, weekly working hours and gross hourly wages differ especially in the lower range of the respective distribution. Aufgrund der Festlegung des gesetzlichen Mindestlohns als Stundenlohn müssen valide Informationen, zu Bruttostundenlöhnen aus den Angaben zu Monatsentgelten und wöchentlichen Arbeitszeiten, berechnet werden. Dieser Beitrag vergleicht methodisch sowie empirisch das Sozio-oekonomische Panel und die Verdienst(struktur)erhebung. Demnach bestehen grundlegende konzeptionelle Unterschiede, in der Stichprobenziehung und Erhebung von Angaben zu Beschäftigten in der Haushaltsbefragung, des SOEP und zu Beschäftigungsverhältnissen in der amtlichen Erhebung der V(S)E. Dementsprechend, differieren die Abgrenzungsmöglichkeiten der Beschäftigungsformen sowie die Verteilung, der beobachteten Einheiten nach zentralen Merkmalen. Mit Blick auf die monatlichen Arbeitsentgelte, wöchentlichen Arbeitszeiten und Bruttostundenlöhne zeigen sich insbesondere im unteren Bereich, der jeweiligen Verteilung Unterschiede.
J08|Raising the standard: Minimum wages and firm productivity|This paper exploits the introduction of the National Minimum Wage (NMW) in Britain and subsequent increases in the NMW to identify the effects of minimum wages on productivity. We find that the NMW increased average labour costs for companies that tend to employ low paid workers, both upon the introduction of the NMW and more recently following the Great Recession when many workers experienced pay freezes or wage cuts, but the NMW continued to rise. We find evidence to suggest that companies responded to these increases in labour costs by raising labour productivity. These labour productivity changes did not appear to come about via a reduction in firms' workforce or via capital-labour substitution. Rather they were associated with increases in total factor productivity, as theories of organisational change, training and efficiency wages would suggest.
J08|A long-term employment index for Mexico|This paper presents a multidimensional index that considers a series of dimensions and related indicators that characterize the quality and quantity of employment. The paper focuses on the microeconomic aspects of labor market which add to the macroeconomic dimensions of labor and help to thoroughly depict labor market situations at an individual level. We carried out a multidimensional analysis that took into account persistence and duration of some household’s features that may predispose to unemployment in the long-term. Based on the Mexican labor survey Encuesta nacional de ocupación y empleo (ENOE) for years 2007 and 2014 we analyzed the dynamics of long-term employment deprivation in Mexico.
J08|The Impact of the Action Plan for Promoting Employment and Combating Unemployment on Employment Informality in Algeria|This paper examines whether the Action Plan for Promoting Employment and Combating Unemployment, a labor market intermediation program adopted by the Algerian government in 2008, reduced the informality of employment in Algeria. Using repeated cross-section data from the Household Survey on Employment for the period from 1997 to 2013, and a difference-in-difference methodology, we estimate whether the Action Plan has reduced the probability that workers are employed informally in enterprises of more than 5 workers – the type of enterprise that is most likely to be directly affected by the Action Plan. Our results show that the Action Plan has in fact contributed to reducing employment informality in such enterprises, but with heterogeneous effects. More precisely, it reduced informality for employees of establishments of 10 workers or more but had no significant effects on informality for those working in enterprises of 5 to 9 workers. Furthermore, when we restrict our estimates to new entrants only, we do not find statistically significant effects.
J08|Digital Challenges for the Welfare State|"Digitalization is the buzzword under which profound changes of the labor market can be summarized. Next to automation, i.e., the increasing use of robots, ""intelligent"" machines and more comprehensive algorithms that is no longer restricted to routine tasks, especially the emerging platform economy may pose significant ""digital challenges"" for the welfare state. This article sheds light on the potentially eroding foundations of the welfare state, it discusses tools for combating a potential digital divide on the individual level, and it proposes a new institutional perspective on firms, workers, and the welfare state."
J08|Can social safety nets protect public health? The effect of India’s workfare and foodgrain subsidy programmes on anaemia| Can large-scale social safety nets be nutrition sensitive even if they do not explicitly incorporate health and nutrition as programmatic goals?

There exist nonlinearities in these relationships, with the efficacy of both programmes varying across scales of implementation.
J08|EMU and Labour Market Policy: Tensions and Solutions|Reforms observed in EMU do not conform to commonly expressed views that international economic integration comes with labour market deregulation, and that both are beneficial. This essay examines the country-specific policy reforms evidence generated by inception of Economic and Monetary Union and by its disruption during the Great Recession and the Eurozone crisis, outlines non-technically how a distributional perspective can explain key features of those experiences, and discusses how these empirical observations and theoretical insights may bear on the sources and consequences of more general tensions between Europe’s policymaking framework and market integration process.
J08|The Recent Reform of the Labour Market in Italy: A Review|Italy undertook a major reform of the labour market in 2014-2015 (Jobs Act). This paper provides a compendium of the key changes introduced. The analysis shows that the Jobs Act has contributed to bringing Italian labour market institutions more closely into line with international benchmarks and with the principles of flexicurity. Employment protection legislation for permanent contracts has been brought into line with that of major European partners, although it remains more restrictive than the OECD average. The focus of passive labour market policies has shifted from job to worker protection, which will facilitate the reallocation of workers to more productive occupations. The designed strengthening of active labour market policies would improve job matching and reduce structural unemployment, but thorough implementation remains the key factor for achieving this critical goal. Extending the new rules on employment protection legislation also to existing permanent contracts and the strengthening of the collective bargaining framework could be considered as a follow up to the recent reform. Flanking measures to open product markets and reform the public sector are crucial to deliver the entire potential impact of the reform.
J08|Do Labor Market Institutions Matter for Fertility?|Using annual data for 20 OECD countries over the period 1961-2014, we study whether labor market institutions (LMIs) not targeted to maternity impact the total fertility rate (TFR). We distinguish between employment rigidities (ER) and real wage rigidities (RWR), since the former reduces and the latter amplifies the response of the business cycle to shocks. Panel regressions and principal component analysis reveal that ER, such as employment protection and union strength, increase TFR. On the other hand, RWR, proxied by the centralization of wage bargaining and unemployment benefits, reduce TFR. We also find evidence that unemployment volatility reduces fertility whereas wage volatility raises fertility. Thus, to the extent that labor market institutions affect unemployment and wage volatility, they may also affect fertility. We complement our analysis with a DSGE model that incorporates households' fertility decision as well as unemployment and wage rigidities. We find that downward wage rigidities amplify real contractions in response to negative demand shocks and lead to large drops in employment and fertility.
J08|Microdata for social sciences and policy evaluation as a public good|The balance between the right to privacy and the right to freedom of information is altered when scientific research comes into play, because of its inherent needs and societal function. This paper argues that, for research purposes, microdata should be characterised as a public good. The evolution of the rules and practices in the European Union (EU) for protecting confidentiality while allowing access to microdata for research purposes is reviewed. Two key directions are identified for further improvement: remote access to confidential data and the enlargement of the notion of ‘European statistics’ to include microdata produced for evaluating interventions (co)financed by the EU.
J08|Hiring subsidies for people with disabilities: Do they work?|This article evaluates the effectiveness of hiring subsidies targeted to people with disabilities. By exploiting the timing of implementation among the different Spanish regions of a subsidy scheme implemented in Spain during the period 1990-2014, we employ a differencesin- differences approach to estimate the impact of the scheme on the probability of DI beneficiaries of transiting to employment and on the propensity of individuals of entering the DI program. Our results show that the introduction of the subsidy scheme is in general ineffective at incentivizing transitions to employment, and in some cases it is associated with an increased propensity of transiting to DI. Furthermore, we show that an employment protection component incorporated to the subsidy scheme, consisting in the obligation for the employer to maintain the subsidized worker in employment, is associated with less transitions to permanent employment, more transitions to temporary employment and more transitions to DI, suggesting that these type of employment protection measures can have undesired effects for people with disabilities.
J08|Vocational training programs and youth labor market outcomes: Evidence from Nepal|•We are among the first to study a vocational training program in a low-income country.•We find large effects of trainees taking up informal non-farm employment.•Impacts are mainly driven by female self-employment inside (but not outside) the house.•Low baseline educational attainment and restrictive gender roles for females in Nepal may explain our large program effects.•We suggest that effect channels differ markedly from similar interventions in high and middle-income countries.
J08|The local economic impacts of regeneration projects: Evidence from UKâ€™s Single Regeneration Budget| We study the local economic impacts of a major regeneration programme aimed at enhancing the quality of life of local people in deprived neighbourhoods in the UK. The analysis is based on a panel of firm and area level data available at small spatial scales. Our identification strategies involve: a) exploiting the fine spatial scale of our data to study how effects vary with distance to the intervention area; and b) comparing places close to treatment in early rounds of the programme with places close to treatment in future rounds. We consider the long run impact of schemes funded between 1995 and 1997 on outcomes up to 2009. Our estimates suggest that the programme increased workplace employment in the intervention area but this had no impact on the employment rates of local residents.
J08|Does Medicaid Generosity Affect Household Income?|Almost all recent literature on Medicaid and labor supply has used Affordable Care Act (ACA)-induced Medicaid eligibility expansions in various states as natural experiments. Estimated effects on employment and earnings differ widely due to differences in the scope of eligibility expansion across states and are potentially subject to biases due to policy endogeneity. Using a Regression Kink Design (RKD) framework, this paper takes a uniquely different approach to the identification of the effect of Medicaid generosity on household income. Both state-level data and March CPS data from 1980–2013 suggest that generous federal funding of state-level Medicaid costs has a negative effect on household income. The negative impact of Medicaid generosity on household income is more pronounced at the lower end of the household income distribution and on the income and earnings of female heads.
J08|The â€œDiscouraged Worker Effectâ€ in public works programs: Evidence from the MGNREGA in India| This study investigates the consequences of poor implementation in public workfare programs, focusing on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in India. Using nationally representative data, we test empirically for a discouraged worker effect arising from either of two mechanisms: administrative rationing of jobs among those who seek work and delays in wage payments. We find strong evidence at the household and district levels that administrative rationing discourages subsequent demand for work. Delayed wage payments seem to matter significantly during rainfall shocks. We find further that rationing is strongly associated with indicators of implementation ability such as staff capacity. Politics appears to play only a limited role. The findings suggest that assessments of the relevance of public programs over their lifecycle need to factor in implementation quality.
J08|Human Capital Model as a Strategy for Development of Weaving Home Industry in Sambas District of West Kalimantan|"""Objective – Goals of economic development is to increase economic growth, increase employment opportunity, equalize income distribution, and increase standard of living which will reach out community welfare. Therefore, to achieve all those goals, programs which can enhance economic activities with high intensity are needed. It will create more job opportunities and higher income, which mean poverty can be minimalized. One of the efforts to increase economic growth and public income is to develop human capital. The research is aimed to create the development of human capital model which includes training, skill, experience, and other supports particularly creativity and innovation and regarding enhancing welfare of weaving industry’s workers. Methodology/Technique – This research used quantitative and qualitative methods with primary and secondary data which were taken by interviews, questionnaires, and observation. The research took place in several villages/districts in Sambas Regency, those were Jagur, Tumuk Manggis, Tanjung Mekar, Sumber Harapan, and Sajad districts. Considering that population data was not available accurately, respondents were selected based on purposive method and was adapted with the research goal. Findings – The research showed that human capital model to develop weaving industry was very likely to be done through comprehensive development by stakeholders in Sambas Regency (government and public figures), higher education institutions, and companies (business group) so that labour income could increase. Novelty – This developed model, then, is one of means that can be used to improve welfare of weaving industrial workers so that it can be new finding for human capital theory development."""

J08|The effect of increased general education in vocational schools - Evidence from a Hungarian vocational school reform|This paper aims at the evaluation of the reform of vocational education introduced in 1998 in Hungary. The reform extended the duration of education by one year, and increased teaching time spent on non-vocational subjects. The reform affected two of the three tracks in upper-secondary education in Hungary, vocational secondary school and vocational school. We estimate the effect of the reform on educational attainment, employment and wages in a comparative interrupted time series (CITS) framework, using the academic track and secondary school drop-outs as control groups. The results suggest that the reform has had heterogeneous effects. First, we detect no effect for the vocational secondary track, while the reform has improved labour market outcomes of vocational school students. Second, in the vocational school group the reform has increased men’s wages, while not affected their employment. For women we found a positive employment effect, while wages have increased only for the younger cohorts.
J08|From Salary to the Performance-Based Remuneration of Russian Physicians: How Motivation at Work is Changing|This paper examines changes in the motivation of physicians at work since the start of the salary reforms in 2008. These reforms included a shift from a fixed salary system to performance-based remuneration and an overall increase in salaries. The data of six surveys of health workers from 2007–2016 were used to reveal physician’s motives at work and to track the changes during this period. The changes were minor, and the directions of these changes were contrary to the expected strengthening of financial motivation at work: the importance of earning money is no longer primary. The share of doctors willing to work more and better on the condition of linking salary with labour contribution did not increase. In contrast, almost 66% of physicians believe that they are working at a high level of quality and performance.The majority of physicians desire an increase in the base salary, not the performance-based part. Doctors who receive bonuses for the intensity, quality and performance of their work, and those who have a higher salary overall also wish to see a higher base salary. This is a clear indication that they wish to strengthen the protective function of the base salary rather than to have increased opportunities for earning money
J08|The German labor market in the Great Recession: Shocks and institutions|"""This paper analyzes Germany's unusual labor market experience during the Great Recession. We estimate a general equilibrium model with a detailed labor market block for postunification Germany. This allows us to disentangle the role of institutions (short-time work, government spending rules) and shocks (aggregate, labor market, and policy shocks) and to perform counterfactual exercises. We identify positive labor market performance shocks (likely caused by labor market reforms) as the key driver for the 'German labor market miracle' during the Great Recession.""

J08|Active labour market programmes in Latin America and the Caribbean: Evicence from a meta analysis|We present a systematic collection and assessment of impact evaluations of active labour market programmes (ALMP) in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The paper delineates the strategy to compile a novel meta database and provides a narrative review of 51 studies. Based on these studies, the quantitative analysis extracts a sample of 296 impact estimates, and uses meta regression models to analyse systematic patterns in the data. In addition to analysing earnings and employment outcomes as in previous meta analyses, we also code and investigate measures of job quality, such as the effects on hours worked and formality. We find that ALMPs in LAC are particularly effective in increasing the probability of having a formal job, compared to other outcomes. Our results also show that training programmes are slightly more effective than other types of interventions. Moreover, when looking at the sample of training programmes alone, we observe that formal employment is also the outcome category that is most likely to be impacted positively by these programmes. In terms of targeting, we find that ALMPs in the region work better for women than for men, and for youth compared to prime-age workers. Finally, medium-run estimates are not more likely to be positive than short-run estimates, while programmes of short duration (4 months or less) are significantly less likely to produce positive effects compared to longer interventions.
J08|The dog that barks doesn’t bite: coverage and compliance of sectoral minimum wages in Italy|Abstract This paper provides a comprehensive portrait of the level and compliance with sectoral minimum wages in Italy between 2008 and 2015. The results show that wage floors in Italy are relatively high both in absolute terms and relative to the median wage. However, non-compliance rates are not negligible: on average, around 10% of workers are paid 20% less than the minimum wage established in their reference collective agreement. Non-compliance is particularly high in the South and in micro and small firms, and it affects especially women and temporary workers. Overall, wages in the bottom of the distribution appear to be largely unaffected by minimum wage increases. More effective enforcement practices are therefore needed to safeguard a level playing field for firms and ensure that minimum wage increases are effectively reflected in pay increases for workers at the bottom of the distribution.

J08|Explaining Non-Employment Magnitude and Duration: The Case of Italy|In the past 25 years a vast number of Italian workers have become jobless for long periods of time, often dropping out of the labor market and becoming long-term inactives for the rest of their life. This process has long roots in the past and has been fuelled by Italy's poor economic performance. We intend to analyse its nature and derive policy implications for the years to come. We estimate long-term non-employment and its duration by means of Italian longitudinal databases of administrative origin. Long-term non-employment of men stands at 1.6 million individuals in 2012, about the size of male official unemployment, its average duration exceeding 14 years. We present a micro-econometric exploration of the underlying process. The main driving element works via a substitution effect: the relative cost of new entrants vs. that of retaining individuals already on-the-job has often been too high and widely responsible for such developments as it provides the employers with an incentive to layoff and fill the vacancy with a new entrant. Additional explanation is provided by the wide utilization of temporary and flexible contracts and by reasonable proxies of individual characteristics. Our conclusions indicate important drawbacks in the strategy advocated for many years by the EU Commission to promote youth employment.
J08|The Difficult School-to-Work Transition of High School Dropouts: Evidence from a field experiment|This paper investigates the effects of the labor market experience of high school dropouts four years after leaving school by sending fictitious resumes to real job postings in France. Compared to those who have stayed unemployed since leaving school, the callback rate is not raised for those with employment experience, whether it is subsidized or non-subsidized, in the market or non-market sector, if there is no training accompanied by skill certification. In particular, we find no stigma effect associated with subsidized or non-market sector work experience. Moreover, training accompanied by skill certification improves youth prospects only when the local unemployment rate is sufficiently low, which occurs in one fifth of the commuting zones only.
J08|The Impacts of Reduced Access to Abortion and Family Planning Services: Evidence from Texas|Between 2011 and 2014, Texas enacted three pieces of legislation that significantly reduced funding for family planning services and increased restrictions on abortion clinic operations. Together this legislation creates cross-county variation in access to abortion and family planning services, which we leverage to understand the impact of family planning and abortion clinic access on abortions, births, and contraceptive purchases. In-state abortions fell 20% and births rose 3% in counties that no longer had an abortion provider within 50 miles. Births increased 1% and contraceptive purchases rose 8% in counties without a publicly-funded family planning clinic within 25 miles.
J08|(How) Do Non-Cognitive Skills Programs Improve Adolescent School Achievement? Experimental Evidence|Non-cognitive skills programs may be an important policy option to improve the academic outcomes of adolescents. In this paper, we evaluate experimentally the EPIS program, which is based on relatively short bi-weekly individual or small-group non-cognitive mediation meetings with students selected based on their low school achievement. Our RCT estimates, covering nearly 3,000 7th- and 8th-grade students across over 50 schools and two years, indicate that the program increases the probability of progression by 11\% to 22\%. The effects are stronger amongst older students, girls, and in language subjects, and when the program mediator is of the same gender as the student.
J08|The Impact of the Action Plan For Promoting Employment and Combating Unemployment on Employment Informality in Algeria|This paper examines whether the Action Plan for Promoting Employment and Combating Unemployment, a labor market intermediation program adopted by the Algerian government in 2008, reduced the informality of employment in Algeria. Using repeated cross-section data from the Household Survey on Employment for the period from 1997 to 2013, and a difference-in-difference methodology, we estimate whether the Action Plan has reduced the probability that workers are employed informally in enterprises of more than 5 workers — the type of enterprise that is most likely to be directly affected by the Action Plan. Our results show that the Action Plan has in fact contributed to reducing employment informality in such enterprises, but with heterogeneous effects. More precisely, it reduced informality for employees of establishments of 10 workers or more but had no significant effects on informality for those working in enterprises of 5 to 9 workers. Furthermore, when we restrict our estimates to new entrants only, we do not find statistically significant effects.
J08|Microdata for Social Sciences and Policy Evaluation as a Public Good|The balance between the right to privacy and the right to freedom of information is altered when scientific research comes into play, because of its inherent needs and societal function. This paper argues that, for research purposes, microdata should be characterised as a public good. The evolution of the rules and practices in the European Union (EU) for protecting confidentiality while allowing access to microdata for research purposes is reviewed. Two key directions are identified for further improvement: remote access to confidential data and the enlargement of the notion of 'European statistics' to include microdata produced for evaluating interventions (co)financed by the EU.
J08|Firm Size Distortions and the Productivity Distribution: Evidence from France|We show how size-contingent laws can be used to identify the equilibrium and welfare effects of labor regulation. Our framework incorporates such regulations into the Lucas (1978) model and applies it to France where many labor laws start to bind on firms with 50 or more employees. Using population data on firms between 1995 and 2007, we structurally estimate the key parameters of our model to construct counterfactual size, productivity, and welfare distributions. We find that the cost of these regulations is equivalent to that of a 2.3 percent variable tax on labor. In our baseline case with French levels of partial real wage inflexibility, welfare costs of the regulations are 3.4 percent of GDP (falling to 1.3 percent if real wages were perfectly flexible downward). The main losers from the regulation are workers--and to a lesser extent, large firms--and the main winners are small firms.
J08|Market Regulations, Prices, and Productivity|This study is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to infer the consequences on productivity entailed by anticompetitive regulations in product and labor markets through their impacts on production prices and wages. Results show that changes in production prices and wages at country*industry levels are informative about the creation of rents impeding productivity in different ways and to different extents. A simulation based on OECD regulation indicators suggests that nearly all countries could expect sizeable gains in multifactor productivity from the implementation of large structural reform programs changing anticompetitive regulation practices on product and labor markets.
J08|Regulation, Institutions, and Productivity: New Macroeconomic Evidence from OECD Countries|This paper seeks to understand the drivers of country-level multi-factor productivity (MFP) with a special emphasis on product and labour market policies and the quality of institutions. For a panel of OECD countries, we find that anticompetitive product market regulations reduce MFP levels and that higher innovation intensity and greater openness result in higher MFP. We also find that the impact of product market regulations on MFP may depend on the level of labour market regulations. Better institutions, a more business friendly environment and lower barriers to trade and investment amplify the positive impact of R&D spending on MFP. Finally, we also show that cross-country MFP variations can be explained to a considerable extent by cross-country variation in labour market regulations, barriers to trade and investment and institutions.
J08|Regulatory Races: The Effects of Jurisdictional Competition on Regulatory Standards|This article surveys the literature on regulatory arbitrage in four settings: labor regulation, environmental protection, corporate governance, and banking and finance. For a regulatory race to occur, firms must migrate across state or country borders in response to geographic differences in the costs and benefits of regulation, and governments must shape their regulatory policies with the aim of affecting those migration flows. We find that both these conditions hold only in rare circumstances. Instead, the much more common outcome is for political pressures within jurisdictions to produce a heterogeneous pattern resembling Tiebout sorting. Such regulatory convergence as occurs is more often the result of deliberate harmonization or imitation. ( JEL G18, G28, G38, H73, J08, L51, Q58)
J08|Employment security and workers’ moonlighting behavior in Ghana|Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine the effect of employment security on moonlighting in Ghana as a means to inform policy on enforcing issues of employment security. Design/methodology/approach - The paper followed the work of Shishko and Rostker (1976) by applying their approach to the sixth round of the Ghana Living Standards Survey data. The paper created an employment index from four variables and used the ordered logit as the main estimation technique. Findings - The findings indicated that, as a person with a single job becomes more secured in employment, the likelihood of moonlighting is decreased by 0.03, while for those with two and three or more jobs, the likelihood of moonlighting increased by 0.0297 and 0.0008, respectively, with increasing employment security. This implies that, workers can be made to stick to single jobs by providing them with higher levels of employment security, but once they take on two or more jobs, providing them with employment security will engender the tendency to increase their moonlighting behavior the more. Originality/value - With the current harsh economic conditions in the country and the urgent need for multiple jobs (moonlighting) as a risk coping mechanism, little has been done on the role employment security plays as a catalyst or otherwise. This paper fills the gap by employing a comprehensive index on employment security in the case of Ghana.
J08|Participation in non-farm work and vulnerability to food poverty of households in northern Ghana| Using a 2012 survey data from northern Ghana, this study seeks to establish the impact of participation in off-farm work on the vulnerability of resource poor households to food poverty. Vulnerability to food poverty is assessed based on expected future food expenditure. The potential endogeneity problem associated with participation in off-farm work by households is taken care of using novel instrumental variable approach. Analysis of determinants of expected future food expenditure is done using a standard Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) method. Demographic and socioeconomic variables, location variables, and household facilities are also included in the model as control variables. Results show that participation in off-farm work significantly increased the future expected food consumption and thereby alleviating the vulnerability of households to food poverty. Results also confirmed that food poverty and vulnerability to food poverty are not independent from each other. Off-farm work plays a crucial role in providing the means to overcome the risk of food poverty in these resource poor households. Policy tools should be designed taking into account the vulnerability of these households to food poverty, bearing in mind the significance of their food budget shares and the uncertainties surrounding food production and consumption by these households.
J08|Large-scale social transfer and labor market outcomes: The case of the South African pension program| This paper assesses the effects of the South African old age pension program, the largest cash transfer program in the country, on labor force participation and employment of the elderly and prime-aged individuals. During 2008-2010, the minimum eligible age for males gradually decreased from 65 to 60. Exploiting this change as a natural experiment, the paper finds that the pension significantly discouraged the elderly to work. The intention-to-treat effects estimated using three different independent datasets imply that the labor force participation rate of men aged 60-64 significantly decreased by 5.8, 11.3 and 8.9 percentage points, depending on the datasets used. Correspondingly, the probability of being employed decreased by 4.1-11.8 percentage points. The local average treatment effects estimated suggest that once the elderly started to receive the benefit, the probability of participating in the labor force and being employed decreased by 29.4 and 31.6 percentage points respectively although these estimates are not statistically significant. The estimation of the effects for prime-aged individuals, on the other hand, is in progress.
J08|Active Labor Market Policies|Active labor market policies are massively used with the objective being to improve labor market outcomes of individuals out of work. Many observational evaluation studies have been published. In this review, we critically assess policy effectiveness. We emphasize insights from recent randomized controlled trials. In addition, we examine policy effects that have not been the primary object of most of the past evaluations, such as anticipatory effects of advance knowledge of future treatments and equilibrium effects, and we discuss the actual implementation of policies. We discuss the importance of heterogeneity of programs and effects and examine the extent to which potential participants are interested in enrollment. We also discuss the assessment of costs and benefits of programs.
J08|"The ""E Triangle"": Employment, Employee And Employer In The European Union"|"One of the biggest forces of the European Union is its people, people living and working within this Union. This stands not only for the European Union but for every state, as it is well known that people are the ones that can make a state great or poor. For this reason, the matters regarding labor are a continuous concern both for European Union common institutions as well as for every individual state of the European Union. The main interest, on both sides, is to ensure the best for every part involved in labor process because this means, in the end, added value for everyone. The article focuses on the realities as well as on the expectations regarding the labor field highlighting the most preeminent aspects of the so called ""E triangle"": employment, employee and employer starting with the most needed definition for each and every one of the above going towards even to proposing remedies for the ""spots"" needing improvement."
J08|Insurance Between Firms: The Role of Internal Labor Markets|We investigate how Internal Labor Markets (ILMs) allow complex organizations to accommodate positive and negative shocks calling for costly labor adjustments. Adverse shocks affecting one unit in the organization are shown to increase workers' mobility to other units rather than external firms, with stricter employment protection in the adversely hit unit causing an additional increase in internal mobility. The ILM response to adverse shocks is also stronger when the receiving units in the organization are more productive and have a better financing capacity. We also find that affiliated units faced with positive shocks to their growth opportunities rely on the ILM for new hires, especially managers in the top layers of the organization and other high-skilled workers, thus overcoming human capital bottlenecks that may curb growth. ILMs therefore emerge as a co-insurance mechanism within organizations, allowing them to bypass both firing and hiring frictions, and providing job stability to employees as a by-product.
J08|The effects of wage flexibility on activity and employment in the Spanish economy|In this paper we estimate the macroeconomic effects of the greater wage and firmsâ€™ internal flexibility promoted by various changes in Spanish labour regulations approved since 2012. To do so, we propose a structural VAR that allows us to break down the changes in the main macroeconomic variables into different structural shocks.
J08|Los efectos de la flexibilidad salarial sobre el crecimiento y el empleo|En este trabajo se estima el impacto macroeconomico de la mayor flexibilidad salarial e interna en las empresas favorecida por los distintos cambios en la regulacion laboral aprobados a partir de 2012 en Espana.
J08|A comprehensive ex-post assessment of the Italian RES policy: deployment, jobs, value added and import leakages|A massive deployment of renewable electricity generation took place in Italy in less than eight years. A generous feed-in tariff, coupled with favourable institutional conditions, allowed the installation of more than 28 GW of PV, wind and other RES technologies. By 2014, Italy has already attained its 2020 goals on RES production. Besides, environmental objectives and compliance with EU targets, the policy was aimed at promoting green jobs and industrial production of RES technologies. Exante economic analyses advocated considerable economic and industrial spill-overs from the introduction of RES support policies. Despite official rhetoric and ex-ante studies about jobs and economic growth associated to RES adoption, at scholarly level there is no consensus on the actual effects and implications of these policies on National economies. This paper provides a first comprehensive ex-post analysis of the Italian case, filling an important gap. Our analysis is carried out with the development of a specific input-output model, with refined technological vectors and with the internalization of trade coefficients. We show that the effects have been unequivocally lower than expected; that most of the jobs created belonged to the service sector and not to the industrial sector and that the value added was much lower than expected due to significant export leakages.
J08|Long-Run Effects Of Youth Training Programs: Experimental Evidence From Argentina|We study the effect of a job training program for low income youth in Cordoba, Argentina. The program included life-skills and vocational training, as well as internships with private sector employers. Participants were allocated by means of a public lottery. We rely on administrative data on formal employment, employment spells and earnings, to establish the effects of the program in the short term (18 months), but also â€“ exceptionally for programs of this type in Latin America and in developing countries in general â€“ in the medium term (33 months) and in the long term (48 months). The results indicate sizable gains of about 8 percentage points in formal employment in the short term (about 32% higher than the control group), although these effects dissipate in the medium and in the long term. Contrary to previous results for similar programs in the region, the effects are substantially larger for men, although they also seem to fade in the long run. Program participants also exhibit earnings about 40% higher than those in the control group, and an analysis of bounds indicates that these gains result from both higher employment levels and higher wages. The detailed administrative records also allow us to shed some light on the possible mechanisms underlying these effects. A dynamic analysis of employment transitions indicates that the program operated through an increase in the persistence of employment rather than from more frequent entries into employment. The earnings effect and the higher persistence of employment suggest that the program was successful in increasing the human capital of participants, although the transient nature of these results may also reflect better matches from a program-induced increase in informal contacts or formal intermediation.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J08|Nezaměstnanost Mladých A Její Řešení Na Evropské Úrovni (Youth Unemplyment And Its Solution On The Eu Level)|Článek je zaměřen na analýzu současné nezaměstnanosti mladých v EU a její příčiny konfrontuje s opatřeními EU, mířícími na její snížení. Jelikož ale politika zaměstnanosti patří mezi oblasti s malým stupněm delegovaných pravomocí od členských států na unijní úroveň, jsou možnosti cílenější pomoci relativně omezené. (The article focuses on the analysis of the current youth unemployment in the EU and its causes. These causes are in the other part of the article confronted with the measures EU which aim at the reducing this type of the unemployment. However, the employment policy belongs among the areas with a low degree of delegated powers from the Member States to the EU. Thus the possibility of more targeted support from the EU is relatively limited.)
