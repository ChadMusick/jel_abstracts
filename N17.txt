N17|Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa, 1885-2008|Estimates of GDP per capita are provided on an annual basis for eight SubSaharan African economies for the period since 1885. Although the growth experienced in most of SSA since the mid-1990s has had historical precedents, there have also been episodes of negative growth or “shrinking”, so that long run progress has been limited. Despite some heterogeneity across countries, this must be seen as a disappointing performance for the region as a whole, given the possibilities of catch-up growth. Avoiding episodes of shrinking needs to be given a higher priority in understanding the transition to sustained economic growth.
N17|Productivity, structural change and skills dynamics: Evidence from a half century analysis in Tunisia and Turkey|This article explores the contribution of structural change and the skill upgrading of the labor force to productivity in Tunisia and Turkey in the institutional context of the post-World War II period. Our growth decomposition shows that productivity is mainly explained by intra-industry changes for both countries during the import substitution period. Structural change played an important role in Turkey for a longer period of time than in Tunisia. Based on an instrumental variable regression setting, we find evidence that overall, the change in the share of high-educated workers had a causal impact on productivity levels in Turkey, but no such relation was found in Tunisia. Secondly, we show that this productivity increase has mainly been driven by the reallocation of higher educated labor between sectors rather than the absorption of highly educated workers within sectors. In Tunisia we do not find evidence of links between education demand and productivity. Moreover, the evidence from the instrumental variable regressions show that when we exclude the government sector in Tunisia, the overall skills upgrading is negatively associated with productivity growth, suggesting a downward return to educated labor demand over time.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N17|Economic Growth In Sub-Saharan Africa, 1885-2008|Estimates of GDP per capita are provided on an annual basis for eight Sub-Saharan African economies for the period since 1885. Although the growth experienced in most of SSA since the mid-1990s has had historical precedents, there have also been episodes of negative growth or â€œshrinkingâ€ , so that long run progress has been limited. Despite some heterogeneity across countries, this must be seen as a disappointing performance for the region as a whole, given the possibilities of catch-up growth. Avoiding episodes of shrinking needs to be given a higher priority in understanding the transition to sustained economic growth.
N17|Do African economies grow similarly?|This paper examines economic growth in 52 African countries for 1961-2016 and seeks to find if there is common growth. As all African countries have their particular features, concerning climate, harvest, industry, size, politics, and infrastructure, and more, it seems best to rely on a non-parametric method. Dynamic Time Warping is such a convenient method, also as it allows leads and lags across countries to vary over time, and as it can easily be incorporated into a clustering technique. Five clusters are found, two of which concern Equatorial Guinea and Botswana, and the three other clusters have common growth rates of about 0, 2 and 4 over more than five decades.
N17|Ethnic Inclusiveness of the Central State Government and Economic Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa|We estimate the effect of the share of ethnic groups included in the central government on economic growth, distinguishing between democracies and autocracies in a panel of 41 Sub-Saharan African countries over the period from independence to 1999. We exploit evidence from the Ethnic Power Relations database, which categorises the politically relevant ethnic groups regarding access to state power. We take advantage of the time variation of political participation, using Fixed-Effects and Difference-GMM estimations. Our dynamic-panel growth models display a robust positive effect of the proportion of included groups in democracies. Such an effect is offset in autocracies, and the difference is often significant. This finding withstands the introduction of various controls, outlier tests, and specification checks. Our results support the view that institutional improvements must accompany the promotion of inclusiveness in low-income and weakly-institutionalised countries.
N17|Serving God and Mammon: The ‘Minerals-Railway Complex’ and its effects on colonial public finances in the British Cape Colony, 1810-1910|The resource curse literature underscores the fact that extractive economies face challenges in diversifying their economies. What is less explored are the public finance challenges encountered in these economies when the extractive industries are completely privatized. Using a recently compiled dataset on public revenues, expenditures and debt, this paper explores the nexus between the privatized extractive sector operations and public finance policies of the Cape Colony between 1810 and 1910. The paper finds that despite the natural resource endowment, the Cape Colony became heavily indebted and had huge budget deficits by the time it joined the Union of South Africa in 1910. After the discovery of diamonds, competition for resource-rents caused a slowdown and in some instances reversed the progress made in consolidating state institutions. The drive towards a national program of development inherent in self-governing colonies was overpowered when the competition for resource-rents culminated in rent-seeking led by the interests in the monopolized extractive sector. Rather than being the main source of government revenues and a basis for inclusive economic progress, as expected in a selfgoverning settler colony, diamonds became a trap through the operations of what I call a ‘Minerals-Railway complex’. The insights from the study have important implications for our understanding of both settler colonialism in Sub-Sahara Africa as well as the management of natural resources in developing economies.
N17|Beyond Miracle and Malaise: Social Capability in Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal during the Development Era 1930-1980|This paper investigates the outcome of the efforts to economically catch up during the so-called development era in French speaking West Africa. An attempt is made to measure and discuss key elements of social capability over the period 1930-1980 in Côte d'Ivoire and Senegal following Moses Abramovitz' interpretation of social capability. The paper distinguishes between four elements of social capability: degree of structural transformation, social and economic inclusion, the state's autonomy and its accountability. We find that there was significant but uneven progress in social capability in both countries during the development era. Despite their differences in economic performance both countries confronted fundamental shared challenges. Most notably, our analysis highlights how persistent lack of broad-based access to economic opportunities played a significant role in disrupting sustained economic and social progress in the two countries. This gives an opportunity to reflect on similarities and differences between the development era and the recent African growth phase.
N17|The impact of Brexit on Francophone Africa|Whereas the impact of Brexit on Anglophone Africa was a major issue in the controversial British discussions on the pros and cons of Brexit, possible repercussions on French-speaking Africa have been rarely mentioned up to now. If at all, mostly indirect general effects were declared, both concerning the former British Empire in Africa and a fortifori for the former French colonies as well. Yet, the range of possible Brexit effect is impressive. It spreads from direct influence on farm-gate cocoa-prices in the CFA-currency regions and subsequent percussions on the state budget of these countries, over more indirect effects, e.g. on the cooperation between CEMAC, WAEMU and the EU concerning EDF-programs of which Great Britain has been a major contributor so far, as well as enforced re-negotiation of controversial EPAs, to the revival of progressive social networks in Francophone Africa. The latter are already demanding more political and economic sovereignty, for example with respect to the increasingly anachronistic F CFA currency. Yet, in view of the lack of countervailing power of Britain within the EU in the case of Brexit, the murky network of Françafrique could be re-vitalized and consolidated as well. Besides, there could develop also direct effects of the Brexit. For example, on coca-farmers in Francophone West Africa, because their product is traditionally traded in Pound Sterling. Thus, any fall in the value of the Pound Sterling against the Euro once Britain leaves the EU would have damaging consequences, not only for the producers but also for public finances, because cocoa is priced in Sterling and the CFA franc is linked to the Euro. This impacts also on the revival of the long-standing controversy on the ill-adapted and increasingly anachronistic F CFA. African activists already demand a genuine African debate and a referendum on these issues similar to the Brexit vote.
N17|Senegal: Presidential elections 2019 - The shining example of democratic transition immersed in muddy power-politics|Whereas Senegal has long been sold as a showcase of democracy in Africa, including peaceful political alternance, things apparently changed fundamentally with the Senegalese presidentials of 2019 that brought new configurations. One of the major issues was political transhumance that has been elevated to the rank of religion in defiance of morality. It threatened political stability and peace. In response, social networks of predominantly young activists, created in 2011 in the aftermath of the Arab Spring focused on grass-roots advocacy with the electorate on good governance and democracy. They proposed a break with a political system that they consider as neo-colonialist. Moreover, Senegal’s justice is frequently accused to be biased, and the servility of the Constitutional Council which is in the first place an electoral court has often been denounced.
N17|Measuring Macroeconomic Uncertainty in Zimbabwe|What matters to economic decision-making is whether the economy has become more or less predictable. People and businesses use information around them to form judgements about what might happen in the future. The rise in uncertainty might be associated with increased concern about extreme events, skewed towards worries about bad or disastrous events. The study seeks to measure macroeconomic uncertainty in Zimbabwe, using stock market indices - industrial index and mining index - for the period 2010M1 to 2019M3. Prevalence of macroeconomic uncertainty has been traced from the stock market index trend and stock market returns volatility. The squared residuals of the GARCH(1,1) regression model proxied macroeconomic uncertainty levels. The prevalence of significant macroeconomic uncertainty has been observed, with some periods highly uncertain. The study linked periods of uncertainty to some known political, social and economic events to derive meaning. The study found that some political, social and economic events have a contributing effect on the level of macroeconomic uncertainty. Good events and policies are accompanied by low levels of uncertainty while bad events and controversial policies match with high levels of uncertainty. The study recommends that to create a good economic climate, to attract investment and boost confidence in the economy, policymakers should dwell on reducing macroeconomic uncertainty. Reducing macroeconomic uncertainty require policy consistency, policy consultations, less frequent policy changes, avoiding numerous policies, avoiding policy reversals, among other measures. The observed macroeconomic uncertainty affects proper economic decision-making and is not conducive for high levels of investment for local and international investors; companies may struggle to hire labor, and employees and corporates may delay spending and saving pattern distorted.

N17|Landmines and Spatial Development|"Landmine contamination affects the lives of millions in many conflict-ridden countries long after the cessation of hostilities. Yet, little research exists on its impact on post-conflict recovery. In this study, we explore the economic consequences of landmine clearance in Mozambique, the only country that has moved from ""heavily-contaminated"" in 1992 to ""mine-free"" status in 2015. First, we compile a dataset detailing the evolution of clearance, collecting thousands of reports from the numerous demining actors. Second, we exploit the timing of demining to assess its impact on local economic activity, as reflected in satellite images of light density at night. The analysis reveals a moderate positive association that masks sizeable heterogeneity. Economic activity responds strongly to clearance of the transportation network, trade hubs, and more populous areas, while the demining-development association is weak in rural areas of low population density. Third, recognizing that landmine removal recon figured the accessibility to the transportation infrastructure, we apply a ""market-access"" approach to quantify both its direct and indirect effects. The market-access estimates reveal substantial improvements on aggregate economic activity. The market-access benefits of demining are also present in localities without any contamination. Fourth, counterfactual policy simulations project considerable gains had the fragmented process of clearance in Mozambique been centrally coordinated, prioritizing clearance of the colonial transportation routes."
N17|Structural Change and Patterns of Inequality in the South African Labour Market|In the post-apartheid era South Africa has found itself in a long run growth trap with growth in Agriculture and Manufacturing notably absent from the economy, resulting in an inability of the economy to absorb excess labour supply. To understand the role that structural change has had on inequality in the labour market this paper provides an overview of key labour market trends in the post-apartheid era followed by an analysis of labour demand trends, and structural transformation. The impact of structural transformation on wage shifts and wage inequality is investigated pointing to the existence of a “missing middle” in the real-earnings distribution of those employed. Post-apartheid wage inequality is explained using a participation, employment and quantile regression framework, showing that wage inequality has increased over time. The role of unions, the impact of the New Minimum Wage, and the influence of legislative changes such as the regulatory amendment accounting for workers in Temporary Employment Services, and the employment tax incentive is evaluated. We show that in the two decades following the end of apartheid South Africa’s growth path has been characterised by a rapid relative expansion in the services (or tertiary) sector resulting in the marginalization of workers in the middle of the skills and wage distribution. Ultimately, inequality in South Africa has been replicated through a reversion to a skills biased employment trajectory. With policies in place to protect the bottom end worker, a hollowing out of workers in the middle of the wage distribution has arisen. This “missing middle” is a key new manifestation of the persistent and high inequality in the South African labour market.
N17|Does the Form Matter? Foreign Capital Inflows and Economic Growth|Empirically, results from time series and cross country studies have identified foreign capital inflows to play a pivotal role in the growth process of host countries. The goal of this article is to examine the impact of three of the four forms of foreign capital inflows (which include foreign aid, foreign direct investment and personal remittances) on economic growth in Ghana. The study employs the ARDL Bounds testing approach to cointegration on an annual time series data for Ghana from 1980-2012. The results of the study indicate that all the three forms of foreign capital inflows have positive and significant impacts on economic growth both in the short and long run. The results also show that of all the three forms of foreign capital inflows, foreign aid is the main driver of economic growth in Ghana both in the short and long run. The study recommends the design and implementation of good fiscal, monetary and trade policies to complement the flow foreign aid to the country for the realization of its full impact on growth.
N17|The Khoikhoi Population, 1652-1780: A Review of the Evidence and Two New Estimates|Fourie and Green construct estimates of the Khoikhoi population over the 1652-1780 period using benchmarks for the initial and terminal Khoi populations and benchmarks for the punctuated population declines from smallpox epidemics in 1713 and 1755. I review the evidence underlying each of the four population benchmarks and argue for a revised 1780 benchmark. Qualitative evidence also points to a higher rate of population decline between 1652 and 1723 and a smaller rate of decline between 1723 and 1780. Using the Fourie-Green methodology and adopting 3 of their 4 population benchmarks, I develop two revised estimates of the Khoi population to supplement the original Fourie and Green estimates.
N17|A Comparative Analysis Of East And West African Cotton Cloth Production From The Early Modern To The Post-Colonial Era|Abstract This article examines why “traditional” cotton textiles industries tended to decline in southern and central East Africa during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries while cloth production persisted in much of northern East Africa and West Africa – where per-capita cloth imports were significantly higher – well into the post-colonial period. Comparative analysis reveals that relatively resilient industries tended to arise and persist where textile traditions were adopted comparatively early, allowing industries and demand for domestic cloth to develop several centuries before global integration and colonization; in areas with relatively dense populations and access to large markets; where centralized states developed and pre-colonial institutions helped encourage industrial growth; where local endowments and geography favored income-enhancing cash-crop cultivation; and where nineteenth- and twentieth-century colonial intervention and fiscal institutions were comparatively less disruptive to existing socio-economic organization.
N17|Economic Inequality in Ghana, 1891-1960|This paper contributes to a growing literature on understanding drivers of pre-industrial inequality by constructing social tables for colonial Ghana. Ghana is generally perceived as fairly equal in terms of income distribution, both historically and today. We show, however, that income inequality rose rapidly during the colonial period, to inequality levels comparable to many contemporary African countries. We argue that the introduction and expansion of cocoa cultivation at the end of the 19th century in the forest belt of the country marked the most important development that shaped both national and regional inequality trends. Initial land abundance in the forest area provided opportunities for its population to engage in cocoa growing which increased the overall standards of living in the forest area. Areas where soil quality did not favour cocoa growing fell behind in terms of living standards, resulting in increasing national income inequalities from the 1930s onwards. Due to high set up costs of cocoa farms and increasingly polarized access to economic resources, only a wealthy minority was able to establish substantial cocoa farms, gaining much more than other social classes. The capital intensity of the export crop along with access to economic resources such as land seems an important factor driving inequality trends in Africa.
N17|Tax Stabilisation, Trade and Political Transitions in Francophone West Africa over 120 Years|Contemporary African fiscal systems are usually portrayed as being subject to significant instability, which has negative consequences for public spending and development. However, this paper documents significant long-term fiscal stabilisation in Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Niger and Senegal as measured by reductions in tax revenue instability and the responsiveness of tax revenue to trade over a 120-year period. This historical process of long-term fiscal stabilisation in francophone West Africa has not been properly acknowledged in the contemporary fiscal policy literature that tends to focus on recent decades. Moreover, it is shown qualitatively and econometrically that this fiscal stabilisation has been accompanied with a longterm reduction in the volatility of trade, a change in tax composition away from trade taxes to indirect domestic taxes, and major shifts in development policy paradigms. This points to the value of studying African fiscal systems over long periods of time to identify relationships not apparent from a short-term perspective and understand the intricate mechanisms and dynamics that characterize the development process.

N17|The Long-Term Effects of African Resistance to European Domination: Institutional Mechanism|In this study, we show that historic events have a long term incidence on institutional development. Within the framework of the paper, we attempt to provide insights into a historical dimension that has not received the scholarly attention it deserves in empirical literature, notably: African resistance in the face of colonization. The main finding suggests that contemporary institutions in Africa are endogenous to historical trajectories adopted by countries in the continent. Countries that experienced high resistance to colonial domination are associated with better contemporary governance standards. The findings are robust to a multitude of tests, notably: changes in estimation techniques, accounting for outliers, transformation of the outcome variable, control for endogeneity and changes of the outcome variable.
N17|Britain & Africa: heading for the Brexit rocks|High-flying illusions on the part of the proponents and grim predictions of the sceptics characterize the controversy about Brexit. The article analyses five issues at stake for the Post-Brexit relationships between Britain, the EU and Africa with a focus on the Commonwealth Sub-Saharan Africa: market access, FDI, aid, security and partnership . The British government’s vision of a ‘Global Britain’ relies heavily on a reinforced co-operation with Commonwealth nations. However, most likely this would be possible only at the expense of the poor in Africa and elsewhere. Concerning security cooperation with Africa, London apparently exaggerated its defence input in order to enhance its bargaining position with the EU. It will be crucial for both the EU and UK to find post-Brexit agreements to stem irregular migration and the growth of jihadist groups and terrorism. In a nutshell, the analysis of these different policy field shows that expectations of Brexiteers and African politicians alike concerning an enhanced, partner-like Post-Brexit Commonwealth relationship are largely unfounded.
N17|Assessing the Impact of Ease of Doing Business and Corruption on Economic Growth for Africa Free Trade Zone (AFTZ) Member States|A positive economic growth is one crucial macroeconomic objective of every nation. Many countries have formed regional as well as international trading blocs in an attempt to enhance economic growth and maximise welfare of each member state, the AFTZ member states are not an exception. This paper seeks to investigate the impact of ease of doing business and corruption on economic growth of AFTZ member states. The study employed a panel data analysis for the period 2010-2016, using Stata Statistical Software. The study findings for the bloc, indicated that corruption, trading across borders, getting credit, registration of property, dealing with construction permits, and starting business have a significant impact on the bloc’s economic growth; with insolvency resolving and investor protection of concern as well. Paying attention to country effects test, with the quest for efficient results, the study further divided the AFTZ bloc into 3 groups using average GDP as the determining variable. The usual 3 panel models were run for each group, with efficiency noted from the reported adjusted R-squared and overall R-squared. The study recommends each member state to pay particular attention to the identified affecting variables for improved economic growth. The onus to improve economic wellbeing of each state does not lie on the bloc only but on individual efforts as well, since individual differences prevail. All this will enable the broader efficacy and vision of AFTZ to be realised.

N17|Can Western African countries catch up with Nigeria? Evidence from Smooth Nonlinearity method in Fractional Unit root framework|West African countries have long advocated efforts to promote economic integration and income convergence. In recent trends, Nigeria records the highest GDP in nominal value, yet its neighbouring countries are yet to catch up in terms of both GDP growth rate and GDP per capita growth rate. The general objective of this paper is to examine the convergence of Western African countries to catch up with Nigeria in terms of real per capita income. For the estimation, the paper employs fractional unit root approach to model simultaneously smooth breaks by means of flexible Fourier function in time. The approach adopted is novel, where it is still lacking in the application of economic convergence across countries. The findings show that, while some West African countries do converge among themselves, only Ghana is likely to catch up with Nigeria. As a policy implication, the West-African countries would increase further education level and technology transfers to promote income convergence at different stages of economic development.
N17|Which comes first: good governance or prosperity? A historical experiment from the South African Republic and the Orange Free State|Two neighbouring republics, with a common history and culture, followed very different paths of development in the second half of the nineteenth century. Extraordinary mineral wealth was discovered during this period in the South African Republic (ZAR), the neighbour where political and economic stability was fragile compared with the Republic of the Orange Free State (OFS). We connect these divergent development paths to the literature on the resource curse, especially the recent literature on the conditional resource curse where the quality of the institutional structure plays a crucial role in the outcomes of a large resource discovery. By introducing a new objective measure for the quality of institutions, namely the accuracy of boundaries on maps, we provide evidence of the institutional quality in the ZAR prior to the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand. The statistical technique that we use, Procrustes analysis, is an innovation in economic analysis. The evidence supports Acemoglu and Robinson's account of the development path in the ZAR, and the later Union of South Africa, as compromised by the conditional resource curse.

N17|The Arab Spring was Predictable in 2007: Empirics of Proof|We model core demands for better governance (political, economic and institutional), more employment and less consumer price inflation using a methodological innovation on the complete elimination of cross-country differences in signals susceptible of sparking social revolts. The empirical evidence based on 14 MENA countries show that the Arab Spring was predictable in 2007 to occur between January 2011 and April 2012. While the findings predict the wave of cross-country revolutions with almost mathematical precision, caveats and cautions are discussed for the scholar to understand the expositional dimensions of the empirics.
N17|Australian Exceptionalism? Inequality and Living Standards 1821-1871|Although the Australian historical literature covering the colonies' first century from the initial convict settlement in 1788 at Botany Bay to the post-gold rush census of 1871 is packed with assertions about Australian living standards and inequality exceptionalism - compared with western Europe and America, there has been very little evidence offered to confirm them. This paper will establish the Australian facts about living standards and inequality trends between the 1820s and the 1870s. Where do we find exceptionalism, compared with the United States, and where not? And can exceptionalism be readily explained by the fact that the US was undergoing a dramatic industrial revolution while Australia was following its commodity-exporting comparative advantage? We start by exploring the end-period benchmark, 1871, where previous literature (since Michael Mulhall in 1892) has reported a big Australian income per capita and living standard lead. We ask whether 1871 is a poor choice for making these comparisons, and whether 1861 would be better. The US had just fought a Civil War and underwent a 'lost growth decade'ï¿½ and southern destruction in the 1860s (Lindert & Williamson 2016b). In addition, both countries had to deal with a mineral rent bust, one in Victoria and the other in California and Nevada. The result for 1861 without the devastated American south or the mineral-rich Victoria, California, and Nevada is a smaller Australian living standard lead, but a significant lead nonetheless. Next we ask whether Australia was born (relatively) rich or grew (relatively) rich by commodity-export-led (relatively) fast growth. It was the latter, a conclusion reached in two ways, indirectly ï¿½ la Angus Maddison backcasting and directly ï¿½ï¿½ la historic purchasing-power- parity living standard estimates for the early years. Our new purchasing-power-parity estimates of working class living standards in the 1820s and 1830s place Australian towns below London. This not-born-relatively-rich conclusion is confirmed indirectly by an exceptionally fast growth performance between 1821 and 1871. In addition, we ask whether the convicts had similar living standards as free urban unskilled in the 1830s (the convicts were still nearly half of the labor force). We follow this with two additional questions: Was the 1871 Australian distribution of income as unequal as it was in the US and Western Europe then? Or was it exceptionally equal? If the latter, was it also as equal in the 1820s as it was in America in 1800? While we cannot yet answer either question, we can document inequality trends between those two dates by exploiting various proxies. Here we find exceptionalism since there is little evidence supporting rising income inequality over the half-century prior to 1871.
N17|Australian Squatters, Convicts, and Capitalists: Dividing Up a Fast-Growing Frontier Pie 1821-1871|Compared with its nineteenth century competitors, Australian GDP per worker grew exceptionally fast, about twice that of the US and three times that of Britain. This paper asks whether the fast growth performance produced rising inequality. Using a novel data set we offer new evidence supporting unambiguously the view that, in sharp contrast with US, Australia underwent a revolutionary levelling in incomes between the 1820s and the 1870s. This assessment is based on our annual estimates of functional shares in the form of land rents, convict incomes, free unskilled incomes, free skill premiums, British imperial transfers and a capitalist residual.

N17|The Seychelles Labor Market|This report, produced as a background paper to the World Bank Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD), provides an detailed overview of the Seychelles labor market, highlighting the relationship between changes to the overall structure of the economy and employment levels. We provide an overview of the economy and the labor market respectively, based on the 2011 and 2014 labor force survey (LFS) data. We then discuss employment across major themes, such as changes to employment levels by sector and skills type; migrant labor; and employment in the informal sector. We also discuss unemployment and wage levels using econometric evidence to investigate premiums earned according to age, education, skill, tenure or gender. Our analysis suggests that future economic growth in the Seychelles is dependent on increasing overall labor absorption levels in a manner which ensures that high quality employment opportunities grow at a sufficient pace to absorb the rising number of labor force participants. At the centre of this challenge must be the growing issue of youth unemployment, that if not suitably addressed, could thwart the future economic development trajectory of this island economy.
N17|Violence et non-violence à Madagascar : réflexion sur les formes de régulation sociale|"(english) Countries that have experienced a steady decline in their economy over the long term are most often those who have suffered repeated cycles of poor governance and violence. However, since independence, Madagascar has never been permanently paralyzed by internal armed conflicts and even less external and the island is (or has been) often presented as a ""peaceful"" country populated by ""peaceful"" citizens. This article questions the reality of this non-violence in Malagasy society by mobilizing the available statistical data and going back in time to lay the foundations of a history of political violence. He then proposes elements of interpretation both on the weak use of physical violence, both by the population and by the elites, and on the increase of the feeling of insecurity, far superior to the increase of interpersonal violence. While the limited degree of physical violence may be a mark of a form of social cohesion, it also stems from the structuring of Malagasy society. The weak organization, both on the part of fragmented elites and a geographically and socially atomized population, is not conducive to the emergence of political violence. But it is above all the preponderance of a systemic symbolic violence that allows the maintenance of the established order and hampers the emergence of mobilizations likely to call into question the balance of the society. Organizational weakness, social norms and symbolic violence combine for apparent social peace. This reflects less institutional solidity than the symbolic domination of the elite class. _________________________________ (français) Les pays ayant connu une régression continue de leur économie sur longue période sont toujours ceux qui ont souffert de cycles répétés alliant mauvaise gouvernance et violence. Or, depuis l’indépendance, Madagascar n’a jamais été durablement paralysée par des conflits armés internes et encore moins externes et l’Ile est (ou a été) souvent présentée comme un pays « paisible », peuplé de citoyens « pacifiques ». Cet article interroge la réalité de cette non-violence de la société malgache en mobilisant les données statistiques disponibles et en remontant dans le temps pour poser les jalons d’une histoire de la violence politique. Il propose alors des éléments d’interprétation à la fois sur la faible utilisation de la violence physique, tant par la population que par les élites, et sur l’augmentation du sentiment d’insécurité, bien supérieure à celle de la violence interpersonnelle. Si le degré limité de violence physique peut être la marque d’une forme de cohésion sociale, il découle aussi de la structuration de la société malgache. La faible organisation, tant du côté d’élites fragmentées que d’une population atomisée géographiquement et socialement, n’est pas propice à l’émergence de violences politiques. Mais c’est surtout la prégnance d’une violence symbolique systémique qui permet le maintien de l’ordre établi et freine l’émergence de mobilisations susceptibles de remettre en cause l’équilibre de la société. Faiblesse organisationnelle, normes sociales et violence symbolique se conjuguent pour une apparente paix sociale. Celle-ci reflète moins une solidité institutionnelle que la domination symbolique de la classe élitaire."
N17|Weather shocks and agricultural commercialization in colonial tropical Africa: did cash crops alleviate social distress?|A rapidly growing body of research examines the ways in which climatic variability influence economic and societal outcomes. This study investigates how weather shocks triggered social distress in British colonial Africa. Further, it intervenes in a long-standing and unsettled debate concerning the effects of agricultural commercialization on the abilities of rural communities to cope with exogenous shocks. We collect qualitative evidence from annual administrative records to explore the mechanisms linking weather extremes to harvest failures and social distress. We also conduct econometric testing on a novel panel dataset of 143 administrative districts across west, south-central and east Africa in the Interwar Era (1920-1939). Our findings are twofold. First, we find robust evidence that rainfall anomalies (both drought and excessive precipitation) are associated with spikes in imprisonment (our proxy for social distress). We argue that the key causal pathway is the loss of agricultural income, which results in higher imprisonment for theft, unrest, debt and tax default. Second, we find that the impact of weather shocks on distress is partially mitigated by the cultivation of export crops. Our findings suggest that, even in the British colonial context, smallholder export crop cultivation led to higher private incomes as well as greater public investment. Our findings speak to a topic of considerable urgency today as the process of global climate change accelerates, generating more severe and unpredictable climatic extremes. An increased understanding and identification of adaptive and mitigating factors, would assist in targeting policy interventions and designing adaptive institutions to support vulnerable rural societies.
N17|The conduciveness of the South African economic environment and Small, Medium and Micro Enterprise sustainability: A literature review|Since the early 1980s Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) have been regarded as the driving forces of both developing and developed economies around the world. In a South African dispensation, SMMEs are responsible for adding imperative socio-economic value to the country, particularly in terms of eradicating poverty and diminishing unemployment levels. By doing so, these business entities are believed to contribute at least 50% to the national Gross Domestic Product. Albeit the aforementioned, previous research studies report that up to 75% of South African SMMEs fail after being in existence for only 42 months. Though the latter dispensation has been blamed on many economic factors, over the years the sustainability of South African SMMEs has not improved to a great extent. In order to provide insight on the latter dispensation, this literature review paper was conducted to ultimately formulate two hypotheses for further empirical testing.
N17|Measuring Extractive Institutions: Colonial Trade and Price Gaps in French Africa|A common explanation for current African underdevelopment is the extractive character of institutions established during the colonial period. Yet, since colonial extraction is hard to quantify, the magnitude of this phenomenon is still unclear. In this paper, I address this gap in the literature by focusing on monopsonistic colonial trade in French Africa. By using new archival data on export prices, I provide yearly-estimates of colonial extraction via trade, measured as the gap between actual prices that the colonial trading companies paid to African agricultural producers and prices that should have been paid in a counter-factual competitive market (i.e. world prices minus trade costs). The results show that African prices were about half than what they would have been in competitive markets. This suggests that colonial trade dynamics was characterized by a considerable amount of extraction.
N17|Resource endowments and agricultural commercialization in colonial Africa: Did labour seasonality and food security drive Uganda’s cotton revolution?|Why did some African smallholders adopt cash crops on a considerable scale, while most others were hesitant to do so? This study sets out to explore the importance of factor endowments in shaping the degrees to which cash crops were adopted in colonial tropical Africa. We conduct an in-depth case study of the ‘cotton revolution’ in colonial Uganda to put the factor endowments perspective to the test. Our empirical findings, based on an annual panel data analysis at the district-level from 1925 till 1960, underscore the importance of Uganda’s equatorial bimodal rainfall distribution as an enabling factor for Uganda’s ‘cotton revolution’. We also provide evidence at a unique spatial micro-level, by capitalizing on detailed household surveys from the same period. We demonstrate that previous explanations associating variegated responses of African farmers to cash crops either to the role of colonial coercion, or to a distinction between ‘forest/banana’ and ‘savannah/grain’ zones cannot explain the widespread adoption of cotton in Uganda. We argue, instead, that the key to the cotton revolution were Uganda’s two rainy seasons, which enabled farmers to grow cotton while simultaneously pursuing food security. Our study highlights the importance of food security and labour seasonality as important determinants of agricultural commercialization in colonial tropical Africa.
N17|Income Inequality in Colonial Africa: Building Social Tables for Pre-Independence Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, and Senegal|Today, income inequality in Sub-Saharan Africa is exceptionally high. In this paper, we study whether present-day inequality can be traced back to the colonial period by reconstructing income distributions in a sample of representative colonies. To do so, we use data from colonial records to build new social tables for French colonies in West and Central Africa and we combine them with available information on British colonies in East and Southern Africa. We find that inequality in Africa is not a recent phenomenon. Income inequality was extremely high during the colonial period, in particular because of the huge income differential between Africans and European settlers. Nevertheless, it tended to reduce over time and the post-colonial period is characterized by much lower inequality. Interestingly, the decline of inequality is not necessarily a consequence of independence: the trends toward reduction started under colonial rule.

N17|African Socialism; or the Search for an Indigenous Model of Economic Development|Ralph Austen in African Economic History (1987) noted how few African countries explicitly choose capitalism on independence, and for those who did it was a default model or a residual pattern. ‘African socialism’ was popular in the early decades of independence and pursued by several countries, including Ghana, Guinea, Senegal and Tanzania, the cases considered in this paper. The term had multiple meanings, and its advocates were quick to stress that they were not communist, and some said they were not even Marxist. This paper explores the argument that African socialism was a search for an indigenous model of economic development for a generation that was justifiably ambivalent about capitalism, but wary of being put in the communist camp in the Cold War era. Importantly, advocates of African socialism often proposed bold and transformative visions for their countries. These visions might be worth revisiting, devoid of the paradigm of socialism.

N17|Togo: Political and Socio-Economic Development (2015 – 2017)|The presidential elections of 25 April 2015 resulted in a victory for the incumbent, Faure Gnassingbé. Thus, he secured his third five-year term, consolidating the Gnassingbé-clan’s grip on power. The latter have ruled the country since 1967. In view of the ruling party’s absolute parliamentary majority, further meaningful constitutional and electoral reforms that would have been required for free and fair elections have been postponed indefinitely. Overriding concerns for stability in West Africa in view of the growing threat from Islamist terrorist organizations, combined with Togo’s role as contributor of soldiers meant that the international community largely ignored the government’s indefinite postponement of democratic reforms and local elections. However, the simmering discontent of hardliners within the security forces and the ruling party remained evident. The opposition tried unsuccessfully to overcome internal divisions between its moderate and radical wings. An alliance of opposition parties and civil society groups organized frequently peaceful demonstrations in opposition to the regime, which were violently suppressed. Yet, the human rights record of the government has improved but remains poor. A tense political climate persisted due to the presidential elections in April 2015, and the apparent determination of the president to stay in power for a third and possible a fourth term whatever the cost. Despite undeniable improvements to the framework and appearance of the regime’s key institutions during the review period, democracy remains far from complete. However, the international community, notably Togo’s African peers, the AU and ECOWAS, as well as the Bretton-Woods Institutions, China and the European Union (EU), followed a ‘laissez faire’ approach in the interests of regional stability and their national interests in dealing with Togo. Economic growth remained stable at about 5% per annum. Public investment in infrastructure (e.g. roads, harbor) and increases in agricultural productivity, notably of export crops, had been the key drivers of economic growth. However, growth remains vulnerable to external shocks and the climate and has not been inclusive. Positive growth was overshadowed by increasing inter-personal and regional inequality as well as an increase in extreme poverty. Moreover, money laundering and illegal money transfers grew alarmingly. The business climate improved considerably nevertheless. Though the World Bank still defines Togo as low income, fragile stat, the government aims to achieve the status of a developing economy.
N17|Trends and Features of Research on Foreign Aid: A Literature Review|This paper reviews the economics literature on foreign aid. Aid supporters tend to emphasize results, while its detractors tend to highlight the incentives it provides (although they may still acknowledge some of aid’s positive results, particularly on public health). Like the modes to deliver it, research on foreign aid has evolved over the years. From the traditional aid-growth regressions research has refocused towards micro issues, including institutional inefficiencies or sector-specific bottlenecks. This tendency is positive, in so far as it can lead to useful policy advice that improves the way aid is given. Great gaps in knowledge remain, though. Notably, the aid market is poorly understood in aspects such as donors’ interaction with the recipient government or donors’ coordination. In terms of political economy, recipient countries’ decision making with regards to aid fungibility or the incentives provided by new types of aid (notably China’s) have been largely unexplored. Moreover, the types of public goods that improve households’ living standards are little understood. The scarcity of research on these questions is greatly due to lack of data – or even data opacity; if aid is to be better understood and improved, far greater efforts must be made in terms of collecting and sharing data.
N17|Towards Regional Monetary Unions through Blockchain Networks|The concept of political and economic integration has not progressed beyond the concept of a Nation-state. The primary reason is the trust deficit among citizens in a supra-national entity. We can use Blockchain systems-which are trustless networks-to resolve this issue. We can float a Regional Cryptocurrency (RCC) which can bring about a successful Regional Monetary Unions (RMU) amongst a group of nations in a transparent manner. This paper deals with the idea of realizing a monetary union through Blockchain networks. Firstly I describe the basics of cryptocurrencies and RSBCs. Then we shall evaluate how RMUs have failed due trust deficit among citizens of members of RMU. We then analyse as to how Blockchain networks can be a solution to these problems. The paper concludes by summarizing the difficulties and solutions regarding successful formation of Regional Monetary Unions.
N17|Dependency and Hegemony in Neoliberal South Africa|This article is about South Africa in the post-apartheid period. It has two aspects; first it examines the social and political process through which the African National Congress (ANC) shifted its emphasis away from the construction of the nationalist project (as defined by its 1955 Freedom Charter), towards a world view that privileges markets as the main organising mechanisms in society. Inevitably, accompanying this shift to neoliberalism there has been a corresponding surrender of macroeconomic economic policy autonomy. Such policy is now geared to propitiating global markets that periodically exhibit high degrees of instability. The question arises – how is the ANC able to manage two diametrically opposed tendencies without social upheaval and dislocation? The answers proffered here centres on hegemonic and dependency dynamics that are in motion in contemporary South Africa.
N17|Institutions et ordre politique dans le modèle économique algérien|Notre étude sur longue période de l’économie politique algérienne, prend appui sur l’approche régulationniste inspirée du cadre d’analyse néoréaliste de Bruno Amable et Stefano Palombarini (2009) et des concepts néo institutionnalistes de Mushtaq Khan (2000, 2009) : elle considère que le développement économique de l’Algérie s’opère dans un contexte donné de distribution du pouvoir et d’institutions variées formelles et informelles, qui structurent des accords ou équilibres politiques sur la base de groupes sociaux soutenant la coalition au pouvoir et captant en retour des rentes distribuées.

N17|New Perspectives on Patenting Activity in New Zealand 1860-1899|Existing research suggests that New Zealand was, on a per capita basis, the wealthiest and most prolific patenting nation during the late nineteenth century. By quantifying lapsed applications, patent renewals, and expenditure on patent fees, rather than just patent applications, we consider the real level of innovative activity. Our results show that while reductions in patent fees and required advertising in the early 1880s led to a sharp increase in applications by people living in New Zealand, overseas patent applications and total expenditure on New Zealand patents showed relatively steady growth between 1860 and 1899. Lower fees succeeded in increasing patenting by skilled New Zealand trades workers (although engineers still dominated), however, patenting by unskilled workers, such as labourers, remained low. People living in New Zealand made over sixty per cent of patent applications, but overseas patentees paid over half of patent fees because relatively fewer of their applications lapsed or were not renewed. Although women made greater use of the patent system over time, even in 1899 they accounted for only 2.5 per cent of patent applications.
N17|The Relationship of Patenting Applications and Expenditure with Output and Real GDP in Nineteenth Century Colonial New Zealand|The relationship between patenting and both output series and real GDP was examined using nineteenth century New Zealand patent applications, and applications weighted by fees and required advertising expenditure. For individual output series and real GDP there were considerably more cointegrating relationships with Granger causality for expenditure than for application counts, suggesting the expenditure data provides a better measure of the value of patents. Output series and real GDP usually led patenting, particularly using patent expenditure data, which indicates patentees were concentrating on economic needs. In some of the results, however, output series and real GDP followed patenting.
N17|The Changing Structure of Africa’s Economies|Using data from the Groningen Growth and Development Center’s Africa Sector Database and the Demographic and Health Surveys, we show that much of Africa’s recent growth and poverty reduction has been associated with a substantive decline in the share of the labor force engaged in agriculture. This decline is most pronounced for rural females over the age of 25 who have a primary education; it has been accompanied by a systematic increase in the productivity of the labor force, as it has moved from low productivity agriculture to higher productivity services and manufacturing. We also show that, although the employment share in manufacturing is not expanding rapidly, in most of the low-income African countries the employment share in manufacturing has not peaked and is still expanding, albeit from very low levels. More work is needed to understand the implications of these shifts in employment shares for future growth and development in Africa south of the Sahara.
N17|Understanding African Poverty over the Longue Durée: A Review of Africa's Development in Historical Perspective|The sixteen essays edited and synthesized by Emmanuel Akyeampong, Robert H. Bates, Nathan Nunn, and James A. Robinson contribute significantly to our understanding of the following questions: (1) When did Africa become poor? (2) Why did Africa become poor? (3) Why has Africa remained poor? Although these questions are impossible to answer in a definitive way, the partial explanations offered in this book are insightful and thought provoking and are summarized in this article. However, they also rest primarily on economic and political arguments. The importance of geography, which is mostly not explored in these essays, is reviewed in the final section of this article.
N17|The White Man’s Burden: On the Effect of African Resistance to European Domination|Are there contemporary development effects of African resistance to European domination? This question is the primary issue addressed by this inquiry. We establish that African resistance has had adverse effects on post-colonial African development and discuss possible channels of such causality. This relationship is robust to alternative model and to controlling for the outliers.
N17|Las pequeñas economías insulares africanas, 1950-2010. Una perspectiva comparada|Island economies have some common specific features, such as fragmentation of the internal market due to their archipelagic nature, or their remoteness from foreign markets. This affects the export of their products as well as what they consume and cannot, or it is not profitable, produce locally. They also tend to suffer from a strong atomization of their companies. These and other circumstances have conditioned and determine the evolution of the main macroeconomic indicators. This paper is a comparative study of the socioeconomic situation found in some African island regions —Cape Verde, Comores Islands, Canary Islands, Mauritius, Reunion, Sao Tome and Principe, and Seychelles. It makes a long-term analysis (1950-2010) in order to provide a broad enough perspective to understand how each of them has faced these challenges and the different results obtained.

N17|Economic Analysis and Forecasting in the Global Economy and in Emerging and Developing Regions Including Africa: How Informative is the Ifo World Economic Survey (WES)?|Economists around the world rely in addition to official statistics on business (and consumer) surveys, which are more up-to-date. However, for many emerging and developing countries there is a lack of such surveys. This gap can, at least partly, be filled by the Ifo World Economic Survey (WES). In this paper we first describe this survey and also examine how helpful it is for macroeconomic analysis and short-term forecasting. We find that this survey provides important up-to-date information about the cyclical stage of the global economy and of major emerging and developing regions including Africa. Increasing the number of participating experts could further improve its usefulness for macroeconomic analysis in these regions.
N17|Patterns of Manufacturing Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa: From Colonization to the Present|This paper reviews the Ôlong twentieth-centuryÕ development of ÔmodernÕ manufacturing in Sub-Saharan Africa from colonization to the present. We argue that classifying Africa generically as a Ôlate industrializerÕ is inaccurate. To understand the distinctively African pattern of manufacturing growth, we focus our discussion on the dynamic interplay between the regionÕs specific endowment structures, global economic relationships and government policies. We conclude that the case of Sub-Saharan Africa is best characterized as interrupted industrial growth instead of sustained convergence on world industrial leaders. This is partly because, until very recently, the factor endowments made it very costly for states to pursue industrialization; and partly because successive rulers, colonial and post-colonial, have rarely had both the capacity to adopt and the dedication to sustain policies that modified the regionÕs existing comparative advantage in primary production, by using their fiscal and regulatory powers effectively to promote industrialization.
N17|Economic Development In Africa And Europe: Reciprocal Comparisons|Los avances recientes en la historia de la contabilidad nacional han permitido comparaciones globales del PIB per cápita a través de espacio y tiempo. Los críticos de este enfoque han argumentado que el PIB per cápita no capta adecuadamente la naturaleza multidimensional del bienestar, y han desarrollado medidas alternativas tales como el índice de desarrollo humano (IDH). Si bien se reconoce que estos indicadores más amplios proporcionan una forma adecuada de evaluar los niveles de bienestar, en este trabajo sostenemos que el PIB per cápita sigue siendo una medida más apropiada para evaluar el potencial de desarrollo, centrándose en las posibilidades de producción y la sostenibilidad de consumo. El África del siglo XX y la Europa preindustrial se utilizan para mostrar cómo esos datos pueden guiar comparaciones recíprocas para proporcionar conocimientos sobre el proceso de desarrollo en ambos continentes.
N17|Electricity Consumption and Economic Development in Nigeria|The study examines the relationship between electricity consumption and economic development using an extended neoclassical model for the period 1970-2013. The study incorporates the uniqueness of the Nigerian economy by controlling for the role of institutions, technology, emissions, and economic structure in the electricity consumption-development argument. The study adopted a cointegration analysis based on the Johansen and Juselius (1981) maximum Likelihood approach and a vector error correction model. In order to ensure robustness, the study adopted the wald block endogeneity causality test to ascertain the direction of causal relationship between electricity consumption and economic development. The study found an existence of long-run cointegration equation with electricity consumption inversely related to economic development. Likewise, the vector error correction model failed to reject the null hypothesis of non-convergence in the long-run. Finally, the study found evidence supporting unidirectional causal relationship running from economic development to electricity consumption
N17|Electricity Revenue and Tariff Growth in Malawi|In 2011, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a Washington Based Aid Agency, signed a Compact agreement with the Malawi Government to implement a number of interventions in the power subsector; one of which was power sector reforms. Given that one of the key interventions under the reforms relate to improving the creditworthiness of the existing utility company by advocating for improved financial position (revenue and tariff growth); understanding what drives or impedes power utility growth is important, both in the short- and long-run. The empirical results show that electricity tariffs, electricity generated, and power sector reforms drive revenue growth; while the system losses and inflation impedes revenue growth in the short-run. However, in the long-run, the results show that electricity tariffs and electricity generated drive revenue growth; while system losses and power sector reforms impede revenue growth in the long-run. In terms of tariff growth, the study results show that inflation, real exchange rate (RER) depreciation, electricity revenues, and system losses drive tariff growth; while electricity generated impedes tariff growth in the short-run. However, the long-run results reveal that RER depreciation, revenue growth, and system losses, drive electricity tariff growth; while electricity generated impedes the tariff growth

This period coincides with high economic growth rates in those countries and associated rapidly increasing electricity consumption as well as the ICT revolution that saw the rapid uptake of new ICT by its peoples. Little has been published on the relationship between ICT and electricity consumption in the N-11 emerging economies. This paper examines the hypothesis that increased use of ICT increases electricity consumption. Secondly, how different measures of ICT affect electricity consumption and finally, what are the short-run and long run elasticities of electricity demand with respect to ICT in N-11 countries? The methods used included dynamic panel data models (mean group [MG], pool mean group [PMG], system generalized methods of moments) and show a positive and statistically significant relationship between ICT and electricity consumption where ICT is measured using internet connections, mobile phones or the import percentage of ICT goods of total imports. Long run ICT elasticities are smaller than income elasticities but because ICT growth rates are so much higher than economic growth rates, the impact of ICT on electricity consumption is greater than the impact of income on electricity consumption. Electricity demand projections in emerging economies, which do not include ICT as an explanatory variable, may underestimate actual electricity demand. This can lead to unplanned electricity shortages if actual electricity demand exceeds planned electricity demand. Thus, the paper gives policy recommendations based on the empirical results for the N-11 countries to address this problem
N17|From coercion to comppensation: Institutional responses to labour scarcity in teh Central African copperbelt|There is a tight historical connection between endemic labour scarcity and the rise of coercive labour market institutions in former African colonies. This paper explores how mining companies in the Belgian Congo and Northern Rhodesia secured scarce supplies of African labour, by combining coercive labour recruitment practices with considerable investments in living standard improvements. By reconstructing internationally comparable real wages we show that copper mine workers lived at barebones subsistence in the 1910s-1920s, but experienced rapid welfare gains from the mid-1920s onwards, to become among the best paid manual labourers in Sub-Saharan Africa from the 1940s onwards. We investigate how labour stabilization programs raised welfare conditions of mining worker families (e.g. medical care, education, housing quality) in the Congo, and why these welfare programs were more hesitantly adopted in Northern Rhodesia. By showing how solutions to labour scarcity varied across space and time we stress the need for dynamic conceptualizations of colonial institutions, as a counterweight to their oft supposed persistence in the historical economics literature.
N17|Capitalism in pre-colonial Africa|To what extent did capitalism come into being in Africa before 1850? If by capitalism we mean the production of goods for exchange by capitalists who combine their own capital and land with labor bought from free workers without land, then the accumulative historical evidence tells us that only to a limited extent had capitalism emerged before 1850, and it was most certainly not the dominant system of production in Africa (Iliffe 1983). This does not mean that there was no production for the market. Nor does it imply that there was no wage labor, or that exchanges of capital did not take place. Finally it does not mean that there was no economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa before 1850. As will be analyzed here, markets did exist, there were some wage labor and there were means of exchange that facilitated some economic growth, though growth mostly occurred on the extensive margin.
N17|Historical patterns of economic growth in Africa: A review|The study of long term growth in Africa has recently been invigorated by the work of economists. To date, this literature has been motivated by explaining a divergence of income and has focussed on finding persistent factors that can explain a chronic failure of growth in Africa. This chapter reviews some periods of economic growth in the past two centuries, and suggest that there must be more to learn from studying these periods of economic change and accumulation, particularly because they were accompanied by significant changes in institutions, or how the economy and the society was organized. The African economic history literature does emphasise dynamism - as opposed to persistence, and diversity in outcomes across time and space - in contrast to the average stagnation that has prompted the economic literature. In sum, there is more to learn from studying the history of economic growth in the African past, than what can be gauged from a search for a root cause of African economic underdevelopment.
N17|The development of settler agriculture in British Africa revisisted: Estimating the role of tenant labour in Southern Rhodesia, c. 1900-1960|In this paper I use primary and secondary sources to quantify the role of tenant labour on settler farms in colonial Africa, using Southern Rhodesia as a case in point. My findings show that the rise of wage labour did not mark the end of labour tenancy, as has been assumed in previous literature. On the contrary, the two forms of labour co-existed. The results find support in the theoretical literature on agrarian labour contracts as well as from studies on farm labour on large farms in pre-industrial Europe and America. This literature has been surprisingly neglected in studies of rural labour relations in colonial Africa. Based on my estimates I revise the fundamental question of the role of access to and control of indigenous labour in the growth of European settler agriculture in Africa. In contrast to previous research, I argue that the rise of wage labour was a response to settler farmers’ limited capacity to control tenant labour rather than a sign of the superiority of agrarian capitalist relations of production.
N17|Commodities, Prices and Risk: The changing market for non-slave products in pre-abolition West Africa|In this chapter, we have examined the changing market for African commodities in the decades before the British abolished their transatlantic slave trade. By constructing a new time series of the quantities and prices of goods imported from Africa in the customs ledgers we have shown that there was a far more substantial increase in the trade than the previous data suggested. Furthermore, we suggest that this was driven by slave traders and was primarily a phenomena of the Eastern and more specifically Biafran/Cameroonian region of the West African coast which was a significant reversal of the pattern of commodity trading until the 1770s. These traders also seem to have bought relatively fewer slaves while purchasing greater quantities of non-slave products. We hypothesise that this trend was driven by a number of different factors. Firstly, commodity prices were rising in Europe, while prices on the coast remained relatively stable, in marked contrast to slaves. In addition, the period saw increasing levels of risk and parliamentary legislation to reduce crowding on ships which may have further encouraged captains to purchase more commodities as a risk reduction, profit enhancing strategy.
N17|Social Obstacles to Technology, Technological Change, and the Economic Growth of African Countries: Some Anecdotal Evidence from Economic History|This paper comments on a number of social obstacles to the economic growth and technological change of African economies from the perspective of economic history. Economic history is full of evidence about what held African economies back for years. Some obstacles are of domestic origin such as excessive consumption and luxury masqueraded as public investment. Other obstacles were imposed from outside such as the destruction and weakening of traditional African religions and religious leadership as well as other wide ranging institutions. The combined effects can be summed up in one word: de-institutionalization. De-institutionalization devalued local knowledge (technology) thereby reducing performance. It is not possible to turn the clock back, but current policy is better-off bringing these obstacles into discussion as they stand a good chance of lowering the socalled “Africa dummy” variable common to growth regressions. Future research would also benefit if it sought to adjust conventional economic theory to allow space for the special features of African economies. Market theory is misleading in treating private use rights as antithetical to private ownership rights. For example, the suggestion that land tenure in Africa is anti-growth is inconsistent with the spectacular growth China has experienced even without private property rights.
N17|The White Man’s Burden: On the Effect of African Resistance to European Domination|Are there contemporary development effects of African resistance to European domination? This question is the primary issue addressed by this inquiry. We establish that African resistance has had adverse effects on post-colonial African development and discuss possible channels of such causality. This relationship is robust to alternative model and to controlling for the outliers.
N17|A stylised macroeconomic model incorporating green capital in the framework of Viability Theory|New Zealand’s Treasury, as illustrated by its Living Standards Framework, desires policy that not only promotes economic growth, but also sustainability and equity. This paper studies how taxation and abatement policy can work to keep an economy viable in regards to capital stocks, consumption, debt, environment and the relative factor share (a proxy for income inequality), as well as the trade-oﬀs it faces in diﬀerent levels of pollutant industry. This is done in the context of Viability Theory, a branch of mathematics suited for policy analysis. The results show that reducing an economies environmental impact is key for achieving the multi faceted growth laid out in the Living Standards Framework.
N17|Debt Sustainability and direction of trade: What does Africa’s shifting engagement with BRIC and OECD tells us?|This study assesses the evolution of debt sustainability in the Sub Saharan African (SSA) region. It also examines the respective contributions of OECD and BRIC to debt sustainability in the region. We reveal how the external demand for SSA goods and services from OECD and BRIC helps to lower ‘debt-to-exports’ and ‘debt-service-to-exports’ ratios, two of the main gauges of debt sustainability. Furthermore, using simple growth accounting, we assess how the net exports by SSA to the OECD and BRIC contributes to the region’s GDP growth, and thus indirectly helps to lower the ‘debt-to-GDP’ ratio, which is another important measure of indebtedness. Our study also compares the ‘actual’ debt levels of SSA with ‘hypothetical’ debt levels that simulate the contributions of OECD and BRIC. On the basis of debt sustainability thresholds of the joint IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF), we test how the sustainability of SSA debt has evolved overtime and how much the OECD and BRIC contribute to three classes of ‘weak’, ‘medium’ and ‘strong’ debt sustainability targets.
N17|Interpreting sustainable development goals for 2030: implications for Malawi|The paper assesses the likelihood of Malawi achieving its post-2015 sustainable development goals by 2030, especially goal number 1 of eradicating extreme poverty. The results show that for Malawi to eliminate extreme poverty of less than $1.25 a day from an estimated 74.4% in 2015 to as low as 1.0% in 2030; real GDP per capita is expected to grow at a rate of 21% p.a. If this is to be achieved, Malawi will be expected to invest approximately US$136 billion within the post-2015 period in order for real incomes to increase to levels that eliminate extreme poverty. These are extreme and very hard growth conditions to be achieved for a low-income economy like Malawi; especially when the average growth in real GDP per capital during the period 2010-2014 averaged 1.6% p.a. The study concludes that concerted efforts and significant financial support from the global community is required and needs to be put in place as quickly as possible if countries with high poverty incidences like Malawi are to achieve this ambitious goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
N17|What Drives Long-Run Economic Growth? Empirical Evidence from South Africa|In this study, we examine empirically the key determinants of economic growth in South Africa – using the ARDL bounds-testing approach. The paper has been motivated by the low and dwindling economic growth that South Africa has been experiencing in recent years. Our study finds that the key macroeconomic determinants that are significantly associated with economic growth in South Africa include, amongst others, investment, human capital development, population growth, government consumption, inflation, and international trade. The study finds that in the short-run, investment is positively associated with economic growth, while population growth and government consumption are negatively associated with economic growth. However, in the long-run, the study finds investment, human capital development and international trade to be positively associated with economic growth, while population growth, government consumption, and inflation are negatively associated with economic growth. These results have important policy implications. They imply that economic strategies pursued in the short-run should include policies that attract investment, and reduce population growth and government consumption. However, long-run strategies to be adopted should include those that attract long-term investments, improve the quality of education, as well as trade liberalization; and ensure a reduction in population growth, government consumption and inflation. Cosa guida la crescita economica? Evidenze empiriche dal Sud Africa Questo studio esamina empiricamente le determinanti chiavi della crescita economica in Sud Africa utilizzando l’approccio ARDL bounds-testing. La motivazione che ha portato a realizzare questo lavoro è la lenta e altalenante crescita del Sud Africa negli ultimi anni. Secondo i risultati le determinanti chiave macroeconomiche che sono significativamente associate con la crescita economica in Sud Africa includono, tra le altre, gli investimenti, lo sviluppo del capitale umano, la crescita demografica, la spesa pubblica, l’inflazione e il commercio internazionale. L’analisi ha riscontrato che nel breve termine gli investimenti sono positivamente associati alla crescita economica mentre l’aumento demografico e le spesa pubblica sono negativamente associati con la crescita economica. Comunque nel lungo periodo i risultati di questo studio indicano che il capitale umano e il commercio internazionale sono positivamente associati con la crescita mentre l’aumento demografico, la spesa pubblica e l’inflazione sono negativamente associati alla crescita economica. Queste evidenze hanno importanti implicazioni politiche in quanto indicano che le strategie economiche intraprese nel breve periodo dovrebbero includere politiche che attraggano investimenti e, nel contempo, ridurre l’aumento demografico e la spesa pubblica. Inoltre, le strategie di lungo periodo da adottare dovrebbero attrarre investimenti a lungo termine e migliorare la qualità dell’istruzione, così come l’apertura commerciale. Tali strategie dovrebbero anche assicurare la riduzione della crescita demografica, della spesa pubblica e dell’inflazione.
N17|What makes you poor? Critical Reflections about Ibn Khaldūn and factors of poverty|This article is a brief introduction to Ibn Khaldūn and his contribution to economy. It sets its focus on the subject poverty and tries to highlight some thoughts about this subject, leading us from Ibn Khaldūns work to the modern insights of the book “Why nations fail”. What are the reasons for poverty and income inequality? What are we actually talking about? And which lessons can we take out of this?
N17|Latecomer challenge: African Multinationals from the periphery|Multinational corporations have commenced foreign direct investment (FDI) activities since the 1960s by moving operations to resource-rich, low-cost labour and capital markets (Wilkins, 1970; 1974; 1988; Jones, 1994; 2005). The first wave of outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) during the 1960s and 1970s was motivated by efficiency and market-seeking factors. This wave was dominated by firms from Asia and Latin America. A second wave of OFDI followed in the 1980s, led by strategic asset-seeking enterprises from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea (Dunning et al., 1996; UNCTAD, 2005b: 3s). Since the 1990s China, Brazil, India, Russia (the so-called BRIC countries) Malaysia, Turkey and South Africa are among the countries expected to add significantly to OFDI growth (UNCTAD, 2005c: 4). The emergence of EMTNCs (Emerging Market Transnational Corporations) makes up a growing proportion of outward FDI and they acquire an increasing share in foreign affiliates from developed markets conducting business in their regions. This paper reflects on the transformation of businesses and business practice in Africa, from isolated peripheral actors to global players. A growing number of African multinational corporations extended business operations from behind marginalized peripheral operations to global markets. This paper investigates the history of leading emerging market multinational corporations from Africa since the 1980s.
N17|What explains the recent growth performance in Sub-Saharan Africa? Results from a Bayesian Averaging of Classical Estimates (BACE) Approach|This paper empirically identifies the main driving forces behind the recent development in economic growth across Sub-Saharan Africa based on a two-step procedure. Given the role of convergence in explaining the level of economic development, the first step employs the new extension of the sigma convergence developed by Phillip and Sul (2007) to test and endogenously identify the formation of different steady state paths across a sample of 34 countries selected based on available data over the period 1996-2010. Empirical results vindicate the existence of three main convergence clubs and a divergent group of 8 countries; suggesting that Sub-Sahara African countries do not form a homogenous club. The second step implements a Bayesian Averaging of Classical Estimates (BACE) method on the only convergent groups in order to explicitly account for the assumed conditional convergence in cross-sectional growth regressions. Estimation results prove support that 8 out of 18 selected explanatory variables documented in the literature are significantly and strongly associated with the long term economic growth. Particularly, investment and the relative price of exports are found to be favourable to the recent regional economic performance while public consumption and remittances appear to be of less contribution. Other important variables include scientific research, trade taxes, land availability and population growth which are unexpectedly found to be negatively associated with economic growth. Although their sign certainty probabilities are reportedly insignificant, these results raise a number of policy challenges including poor quality of institutions, the exposure to world shocks given the dependence to international trade taxes, the poor quality of human capital and more importantly a threat of skilled labour immigration.

N17|Revolution empirics: predicting the Arab Spring|Abstract The paper examines whether the Arab Spring phenomenon was predictable by complete elimination in the dispersion of core demands for better governance, more jobs, and stable consumer prices. A methodological innovation of the generalized methods of moments is employed to assess the feasibility and timing of the revolution. The empirical evidence reveals that from a projection date of 2007, the Arab Spring was foreseeable between 2011 and 2012. The paper contributes at the same time to the empirics of predicting revolutions and the scarce literature on modeling the future of socioeconomic events. Caveats and cautions are discussed.

We explore the utility of the CI indicator for Australia by constructing CI data since 1861 and by estimating their relationship with changes in future consumption over periods of 50 years ahead. The CI measures include changes in natural, produced and human capital, and make allowance for exogenous technological progress.The results are used to consider how Australia’s natural capital exploitation influenced the consumption of future generations. Further, we gauge if low CI relative to other leading OECD countries resulted in lower consumption levels in Australia over time than feasible, had it saved more.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N17|The long walk to economic freedom after apartheid, and the road ahead|As South Africa moves further away from the political transition of 1994, the economic history of the post-apartheid era is coming up for debate. The optimism generated by the ANC’s early successes must now, after more than two decades of democracy, be tempered by its conspicuous failures. Not all is lost, though. African growth, technological innovation and private-sector participation in public sector services offer credible opportunities for accelerated development, but will only be effective if policy-makers are cognizant of the political realities. The long walk to economic freedom for many will, unfortunately, continue along a rocky gravel road.
N17|An Empirical Test Of Exogenous Growth Models: Evidence From Three Southern African Countries|This paper aims to empiri-cally investigate the relevance of exogenous growth models to explaining economic growth in three Southern African countries, using the ARDL bounds-testing approach. In addition, the relevance of the conver-gence hypothesis in these study countries is tested using an extended exogenous growth model. The study results reveal that the pre-dictions of the Solow and augmented Solow growth models are consistent in the three study countries, and that the convergence hypothesis holds. However, when addition-al factors are taken into account in exoge-nous growth models, the response of income per capita due to changes in investment and human capital development is slow in economies with low income per capita, such as Malawi and Zambia, compared to South Africa, which is ranked as an economy with a high income per capita. This study has im-portant policy implications in these study countries. These implications include the need for policymakers to ensure that mac-roeconomic stability is encouraged by re-ducing government consumption, inflation, and population growth; and by promoting trade in order to allow for the diffusion of technologies from abroad.
N17|The curious incident of the franc in the Gambia: exchange rate instability and imperial monetary systems in the 1920s|In 1922, British colonial Gambia demonetized the French 5-franc coin, which had been legal tender at a fixed rate in the colony since 1843. Until World War I, this rate was close to the international rate under the gold standard. When the franc began to depreciate in 1918, however, a gap emerged between the Gambian rate and the international rate, prompting a rapid influx of the coins. The demonetization cost the colonial administration over a year's revenue, affecting the later development of the colony. The 1920s have long been a fruitful period for the study of monetary history owing to the instability of exchange rates during and after the war. This article extends the study of this period to examine the impact of these changes on dependent colonies in West Africa, highlighting the importance of local compromises and particularities in colonial monetary systems.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N17|The laffer curve and the debt-growth link in low-income Sub-Saharan African economies|Purpose - – The study of the link between debt and growth has been full of debates, both in theory and empirics. However, there is a growing consensus that the relationship is sensitive to the level of debt. The purpose of this paper is to address the question of non-linearity in the long-term relationship between public debt and economic growth. Specifically, the author set out to test if there exists an established “laffer curve” type relationship, where debt contributes to economic growth up to a certain point (maximal threshold) and then starts to have a negative effect on growth afterwards. Design/methodology/approach - – To carry out the tests, the author has used a methodology that delivers a superior test of inverse U-shapes (Lind and Mehlum, 2010), in addition to the traditional test based on a regression with a quadratic specification. Findings - – The results in the paper present evidence of a bell-shaped relationship between economic growth and total public debt in a panel of low-income Sub-Saharan African economies. This supports the hypothesis that debt has some positive contribution to economic growth in low-income countries, albeit up to a point. Practical implications - – The overall result supports the claim that public debt may start to be a drag on economic growth if it goes on increasing beyond the level where it would be sustainable. Originality/value - – This paper leads the way by implementing a robust test of non-linearity (“inverse-U” test) to the analyses the debt-growth nexus and the laffer curve in Sub-Saharan Africa.
N17|Development and biodiversity conservation in Sub-Saharan Africa: A spatial analysis|The current study seeks to provide a sound analysis of the relationship between economic development and species loss in Sub-Saharan African countries. The motivation is that a better understanding of the impact of economic development on species loss is of great relevance, given the current rapid extinction of species along with challenges born from the context of economic development in poor countries. The analysis draws on the most up-to-date data on threatened species from 48 sub-Saharan African countries. Assuming that spatial autocorrelation is a typical problem for biodiversity data, we use Maximum-likelihood estimators to account for spatial-autoregressiveness in the dependent variable, as well as in the explanatory variables of the models. We find evidence that supports a decrease of biodiversity loss, measured as the percent of threatened bird species, with increasing income per capita. The results also reveal some species-level differences in the biodiversity-development relationship, since we find no significant impact of economic development measured as per capita income on threatened mammal species. This analysis contributes to the literature by partially challenging the paradigm of a strictly positive relationship between biodiversity loss and economic growth in a developing countries context.
N17|Social Structures and Income Distribution in Colonial sub-Saharan Africa: The Case of Bechuanaland Protectorate 1936-1964|In this paper we estimate the level and inequality of income for Bechuanaland Protectorate by constructing four social tables between 1936 to 1964 using colonial archives and anthropological records. We present a working hypothesis that there is need to further analyze Botswana’s colonial era if we are to understand several aspects of contemporary economic structures. Our focus is on identifying the roots of post-independence high levels of inequality. We find that first of all that migrant labour to neighbouring South Africa earned well relative to domestic labour in the Protectorate, both in the formal and traditional sectors. Remittances their families back home and became an important strategy for the poorer segments of society to stay at or above subsistence. Second, the creation of a beef export sector in the 1930s brought with it new opportunities to access export incomes and starting in the 1940s this led to increasing income inequalities and a polarization in cattle holdings. Third, wages for government officials were forging ahead creating an increasing income divide between public and private formal employment. In conclusion we infer that Botswana’s contemporary institutional inequality has far reaching historical roots.
N17|Colonial Origins Of The Threefold Reality Of Mocambique: Fiscal Capacity And Labour Systems|The question whether institutions in Africa were shaped by the metropolitan identity of the colonizer or by local conditions is lively debated in the African economic history literature. In this paper we contribute to this debate by revealing regional differences in tax capacity in the Portuguese colony of Mozambique. Samir Amin (1972) divided the African continent into three different “macro-regions of colonial influence”: Africa of the colonial trade or peasant economy, Africa of the concession-owning companies and Africa of the labour reserves. Interestingly, we argue that Mozambique encompassed all three different “macro-regions” in one sole colony. In regression analysis we find differences in “tax capacity” along this threefold categorization. We use a newly compiled dataset that includes government revenue (direct/indirect taxes) raised on a district level between 1930 and the 1973, derived from the statistical yearbooks and national accounts of Mozambique. Focussing on one country has the advantage over cross country comparisons that one can keep the metropolitan identity constant. We conclude that the tax system developed as a response to the local conditions. and the differences between the three regions were exacerbated during colonial times.
N17|Fiscal Capacity And State Formation In Francophone West Africa 1850-2010|This study contributes to African state and fiscal history by presenting a detailed comparison of the evolution of fiscal capacity in four countries in francophone West Africa – Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Niger and Senegal - over both the colonial and independent periods. While common patterns and persistence can be observed it is instead the unique fiscal pathways of the individual countries that stand out. These pathways can only be understood by analyzing how the underlying economic and political factors of each country develop over time. The importance of the colonial heritage in the development of fiscal capacity for individual countries should therefore not be overemphasized.
N17|Towards a History of the Junk Bond Market, 1910-1955|We present a new monthly index of the yield on junk (high yield) bonds from 1910-1955. We then use the index to reexamine some of the main debates about the financial history of the interwar years. A close look at junk bond yields: (1) strengthens the view that the decline in lending standards in the late 1920s was modest at best: (2) casts doubt on the view that the banking crisis that began in 1930 disrupted financial markets because banks liquidated their holdings of risky bonds; (3) strengthens the view that the cost of capital rose substantially in the early 1930s and remained high for the rest of the decade; (4) casts doubt on the view that financial markets entered a liquidity trap in the second half of the 1930s; and (5) strengthens the case for believing that junk bond yields contain some information useful for making economic forecasts.
N17|Macroeconomic Uncertainty in South Africa|This paper develops a new index of economic uncertainty for South Africa for the period 1990-2014 and analyses the macroeconomic impact of changes in this measure. The index is constructed from three sources: (1) Disagreement among professional forecasters about macroeconomic conditions using novel data from a forecasting competition run by a national newspaper, (2) a count of international and local newspaper articles discussing economic uncertainty in South Africa and (3) mentions of uncertainty in the quarterly economic review of the South African Reserve Bank. The index shows high levels of uncertainty around the period of democratic transition in 1992-4, the large depreciation of the currency in 2001 and the financial crisis of 2008. The uncertainty index is a leading indicator of a recession. An unanticipated increase in the index is associated with a fall in GDP, investment, industrial production and private sector employment. Contrary to evidence for the U.S.A and U.K., uncertainty shocks are inflationary. These results are robust to controlling for consumer confidence and a measure of financial stress. I show that these results are consistent with a simple New Keynesian model subject to volatility shocks in technology. In this model, nominal rigidities induce firms to raise prices as a precautionary measure when future demand becomes more uncertain.
N17|The Cape of Perfect Storms: Colonial Africaâ€™s first financial crash, 1788-1793|This paper investigates the causes and consequences of colonial Africaâ€™s first financial crash, which happened in South Africaâ€™s Dutch Cape Colony. The 1788â€“1793 crisis followed a common sequence of events: trade and fiscal deficits were monetized by printing money, credit extension accelerated, the exchange rate fell sharply and inflation spiked. The domestic conditions were compounded by a deterioration of international conditions and political uncertainty. The final straw was the collapse of the Capeâ€™s own Lehman Brothers â€“ an unregulated merchant house, run by a prominent Cape family, which had been indiscriminately issuing the equivalent of promissory notes. The policy response during the crisis included fiscal austerity, an attempted reorganization of domestic financial intermediation and continued monetary easing, which depreciated the exchange rate and triggered inflation. A new domestic bank was created. Yet the Cape economy would not recover quickly; the effects of the Capeâ€™s first financial crash would be felt deep into the nineteenth century.
N17|Real Sector Output and Financial Liberalisation in Nigeria|This study investigates the impact of financial liberalisation on real sector output in Nigeria by adopting the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) modeling technique for the econometric analysis. Pre-estimation tests such as the Stationarity and Cointegration tests were also done. The results show that the variables of interest in the model are cointegrated and that financial liberalisation (proxied by private sector credit) has a negative impact on manufacturing sector, while it has a positive impact on agricultural sector. This implies that credit to private sector was diverted to some unproductive ventures, rather than productive activities. Furthermore, poor infrastructure, high level of corruption, political and economic instability and high cost fund were found to have constrained the contribution of private sector credit to economic development. On the other hand, its positive impact on agriculture shows that there is an improvement in the agricultural sector since the commencement of financial liberalisation. The study concludes that efforts should be geared towards militating against the socioeconomic cum institutional factors that constrained the contribution of private sector credit to manufacturing output growth in Nigeria within the period under review.
N17|Fiscal policy and current account in an oil-rich economy: the case of Nigeria|This study empirically investigates the link between fiscal policy and the current account in Nigeria. Given the enormous influence of the oil revenue on Nigeria’s economy, the study separates the effects of oil on the fiscal balance and the current account balance. In line with existing literature, the causal link between the fiscal balance and current account takes into consideration the contemporaneous effects on the current account balance brought about by exchange-rate fluctuations, the growth in GDP, and the growth in money supply. The models are estimated using time-series data from 1970 to 2012, using the Johansen estimation techniques. The results from the estimation results reveal the existence of a positive and stable relationship between government budget surplus and the current account balance in the overall economy. In the non-oil segment, on the other hand, there is evidence of a twin-deficit, a fact which has been blurred by proceeds from the oil revenue. The unequivocal conclusion is that the country remains over-reliant on the revenue generated by oil; also, the proceeds from oil have not yet trickled down to the rest of the economy.

N17|When did globalization begin in South Africa?|Economic globalization is defined as the co-movement of prices across a large number of countries (O’Rourke and Williamson, 2002). This research note identifies the period when South African prices began to move in unison with those of the country’s lead trading partner or, in other words, when South Africa globalized. We find that South African wheat prices started reflecting UK trends soon after the discovery of diamonds and gold in the interior of the country. The mineral revolution, it seems, was responsible for integrating the broader South African economy – here proxied by agricultural prices – into the global economy. We further show that this integration was not confined to Cape Town; the coming of the railways ensured that markets in the larger Western and Eastern Cape and, importantly, the town of Kimberley, were well integrated with those in Cape Town. We therefore establish the start of South Africa’s globalization in the 1870s.
N17|State Disengagement In Rural World, Coffee Crisis And Substitution Strategies By Farmers Of Lom And Djerem: The Case Of Diang (1987-1995)|Cameroon’s economy largely depends on the agricultural sector. This economic sector made significant contribution by the traditional cash crops such as coffee, cocoa, cotton amongst others. The liberal creed that called and spends the withdrawal of the state sectors of economic production has been accompanied by a number of structural requirements. At Diang the crisis was accompanied by a drastic fall in prices paid to producers in 1989. This sudden collapse of 47.37 for Arabica coffee had serious consequences on farmers engaged in this sector. To cope with this problem of constant drop in prices, the Diang farmers were able to develop some alternative strategies.
N17|Macroeconomic Consequences of Terms of Trade Episodes, Past and Present|The early 21st century saw Australia experience its largest and longest terms of trade boom. This paper places this recent boom in a long-run historical context by comparing the current episode with earlier cycles. While similarities exist across most episodes, current macroeconomic policy frameworks and settings are quite different to those of the past. This mitigated the broader macroeconomic consequences of the upswing and as the terms of trade decline may do likewise.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N17|The impact of institutions, ownership structure, business angels, venture capital and lead managers on IPO firm underpricing across North Africa|This paper examines the determinants of IPO underpricing in a unique and comprehensive, sample of 86 IPO firms from across North Africa between 2000 and 2013. The findings suggest that, underpricing is used as a mechanism by which to stimulate excess demand (subscription) for newly, issued stock in order to create a relatively small but highly dispersed, and thus disempowered, minority shareholder base. Domestic venture capital and to lesser extend business angels are, associated with elevated underpricing while the reputational impact from foreign venture capital and, lead managers infers lower underpricing. In terms of institutions and state-level corruption control, policies are most closely linked to substantial reductions in underpricing.
N17|African economic growth in a European mirror: a historical perspective|New research on historical national accounting has provided a more comprehensive picture of European economic performance from the medieval period through industrialization and the transition to modern economic growth. These data confirm anecdotal arguments that pre-industrial economies were not stagnant but rather experienced periods of growth followed by reversals which erased gains in living standards. They also provide a framework for comparing the absolute level of economic development in different times and places, using a common unit of account. These data are used here to re-assess the economic performance of African economies during the twentieth century. While African economies have been growing rapidly in recent decades, levels of per capita income remain low and this growth has not always been accompanied by the institutional and structural change witnessed in Europe during the transition to modern economic growth. As a result, growth reversals continue to pose a serious threat to African prosperity, and measures of structural change and institutional quality should be given more weight in assessing the extent to which individual countries have moved closer to achieving sustained economic growth.
N17|Africa's statistical tragedy: best statistics, best government effectiveness|Purpose - – The author aims to analyze the effect of statistical capacity on government effectiveness/efficiency using cross-sectional from a sample of 48 African countries for the period 2003-2008. Design/methodology/approach - – The estimation technique used is a two-stage least squares instrumental variable methodology and ordinary least square. Findings - – The results show that statistical capacity positively affects government effectiveness/efficiency. It follows that countries with higher statistical capacity levels enjoy institutions of better quality than countries with low levels of statistical capacity. Practical implications - – As a policy implication, if Africa does not have effective governments, it is partly because it has a very weak statistical capacity. In such an environment, access to information for effective governance is compromised. Originality/value - – This paper contributes to existing literature on the determinants of institution by focusing on the distribution of the dependent variable (government effectiveness). The author stressed the importance of information and statistics capabilities.
N17|Climate Shocks And Conflict: Evidence From Colonial Nigeria|This paper offers a historical micro-level analysis of the impact of climatic shocks on the incidence of conflict in colonial Nigeria (1912–1945). Primary historical sources on court cases, prisoners and homicides are used to construct an index of socio-political conflict using principal component analysis and measure climatic shocks through deviations from long-term rainfall patterns in a nonlinear (U-shaped) relation, capturing both drought and excessive rainfall. We find a robust and significant relationship between rainfall deviations and conflict intensity, which tends to be stronger in agro-ecological zones that are least resilient to climatic variability (such as Guinean savannah) and where (pre-) colonial political structures were less centralized. We find tentative evidence that the relationship is weaker in areas that specialize in the production of export crops (such as cocoa and palm oil) compared to subsistence farming areas, suggesting that agricultural diversification acts as an insurance mechanism against the whims of nature. Additional historical information on food shortages, crop-price spikes and outbreaks of violence is used to explore the climate–conflict connection in greater detail.
N17|The Curious Incident of the Franc in the Gambia: Floating Exchange Rates and the British Imperial Monetary System in the 1920s|In 1922, the British colonial administration in the Gambia demonetized the French five franc coin, which had been legal tender since 1843. The cost of the demonetization was equal to a year’s revenue, and undermined the stable fiscal position built up over previous decades. The floating exchange rates of the 1920s have long been a fruitful topic of research in European monetary history. Less attention has been paid to the impact of floating on colonial territories in the periphery. This paper uses the rather curious case of a British colonial administration paying to support the local value of the franc to illustrate that the 1920s are an equally useful period in the study of colonial monetary systems. A key aim of imperial governments was to ensure convertibility between colony and metropole, but local conditions in individual colonies often required compromises which went unnoticed until exchange rates became unstable.
N17|Extractive Institutions and Gains From Trade: Evidence from Colonial Africa|A common explanation for African current underdevelopment is the extractive character of institutions established during the colonial period. Yet, since colonial extraction is hard to quantify, its precise mecha- nisms and magnitude are still unclear. In this paper, I tackle these issues by focusing on colonial trade in French Africa. By using new data on export prices, I show that the colonizers used trade monopsonies and coercive labor institutions to reduce prices to African agricultural producers way below world market prices. As a consequence, during the colonial period, extractive institutions cut African gains from trade by at least one-half.

N17|Trajectories and outcomes of the 'Arab Spring' : comparing Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Syria|"Almost three years have passed since the 'Arab Spring' began in late 2010. In the major sites of popular uprisings, political conditions remain unsettled or violent. Despite similarities in their original opposition to authoritarian rule, the outcomes differed from country to country. In Tunisia and Egypt, processes of transiting from authoritarian rule produced contrasting consequences for democratic politics. Uprisings led to armed rebellion in Libya and Syria, but whereas Gaddafi was overthrown, Asad was not. What explains the different trajectories and outcomes of the Arab Spring? How were these shaped by the power structure and levels of social control of the pre-uprising regimes and their state institutions, on the one hand, and by the character of the societies and oppositional forces that rose against them? Comparing Tunisia with Egypt, and Libya with Syria, this paper discusses various factors that account for variations in the trajectories and outcomes of the Arab Spring, namely, the legacy of the previous regime, institutional and constitutional choices during ""transition"" from authoritarian rule, socioeconomic conditions, and the presence of absence of ethnic, sectarian and geographic diversity."
N17|Is Tanzania a Success Story? A Long-Term Analysis|"The purpose of this paper is to provide a historical perspective on the reform process initiated in Tanzania in 1986, and deepened in 1996. In order to do this I concentrate mostly on the period spanning from 1967, when the Arusha Declaration was adopted by the official political party the TANU, and 1996, when a new approach towards foreign aid was implemented. I am particularly interested in investigating how external aid affected Tanzania during the early years, and how it contributed to the demise of the economy in the 1970s and 1980s. I also analyze the role played by foreign aid in the subsequent (after 1996) recovery of the country. I emphasize both technical as well as political economy issues related to imbalances, disequilibria, devaluation, black markets, adjustment, and reform. Because of the emphasis on foreign aid and macroeconomics, I pay special attention to three important episodes in Tanzania's economic history: (a) the exchange rate crisis of the late 1970's and early 1980s; (b) the IMF Stand-by Program and the maxi-devaluation of 1986; and (c) The serious impasse between donors and the Tanzanian authorities in the mid 1990s. At the end of the analysis I ask whether Tanzania is, as officials from the multilateral institutions have claimed repeatedly, a ""success story.""<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
N17|National Institutions and Subnational Development in Africa| We investigate the role of national institutions on subnational African development in a novel framework that accounts for both local geography and cultural-genetic traits. We exploit the fact that the political boundaries on the eve of African independence partitioned more than 200 ethnic groups across adjacent countries subjecting similar cultures, residing in homogeneous geographic areas, to different formal institutions. Using both a matching type and a spatial regression discontinuity approach we show that differences in countrywide institutional structures across the national border do not explain within-ethnicity differences in economic performance, as captured by satellite images of light density. The average noneffect of national institutions on ethnic development masks considerable heterogeneity partially driven by the diminishing role of national institutions in areas further from the capital cities.

N17|Income Heterogeneity and Environmental Kuznets Curve in Africa|The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis asserts that pollution levels rises as a country develops, but reaches a certain threshold where pollution begins to fall with increasing income. In EKC analysis, the relationship between environmental degradation and income is usually expressed as a quadratic function with turning point occurring at a maximum pollution level. The study seeks to examine the pattern and nature of EKC in Africa and major income groups according to World Bank classification comprising low income, lower middle income and upper middle income in Africa. In ensuring the robustness of our study; the paper proceeded by ascertaining the nature of EKC in all fifty-three countries of Africa in order to confirm the results obtained from basic and augmented EKC model. The study could not validate EKC hypothesis in Africa (combined), low income and upper middle income but empirical and analytical evidences supports the existence of EKC in lower middle income countries. Likewise, evidences from the robustness checks confirmed the findings from the basic and augmented EKC model. The study could not attain a reasonable turning point as there are evidences that Africa could be turning on the EKC at lower levels of income. Also, there is need to strengthen institutions in order to enforce policies that prohibits environmental pollution and ensure pro-poor development.
N17|Horse trading? EU-African Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs)|EU- Africa Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) are on the brink. In February 2014 West African leaders agreed in principle to conclude an agreement. However, last-minute objections of the heavy-weight Nigeria which wants to protect its infant industries as well as promising trade relations with new global players are likely to prevent the deal. Whether the ECOWAS EPA in its current form would really create a win-win situation for both partners as asserted by the EU is open to question. Scholarly evaluation of the EPAs reveal double-talk and significant barriers to a sustainable development of African economies. The growing preparedness of African states to challenge EU mercantile interest has been effectively backed by agitation of civil society organisations.
N17|Регионална Икономическа Интеграция В Африка (Дисертация)<BR>[Regional Economic Integration in Africa (Ph.D. Thesis, full text)]|The dissertation is dedicated to specific processes of regional economic integration in Africa. The main goal is to assess systematically the development and potential of regional economic communities in Africa through: - systematization of factors that influence the motivation of developing countries to participate in integration, as well as its specific impact on them; - laying out the possibilities and challenges in the processes of regional economic integration in Africa through an analysis of the direction and structure of international trade of African countries and regional blocks; - assessing the different channels of impact of the EU on the integration processes in Africa. The Introduction sets out the importance of the topic and the goal of the paper and outlines the structure, methodology and the limitations of the research. The first chapter discusses the definition and typology of economic integration, traditional and new theories on its effects (static and dynamic analysis) while the main focus is on the determinants of integration among developing countries. The second chapter presents the development of integration processes in Africa, the economy of regional economic communities, the structure and dynamics of their international trade as well as the results and challenges to their integration. The third chapter systemizes the different channels of impact of the EU on the integration processes in Africa paying special attention on the new framework of trade relations – the Economic partnership agreements. The Conclusion summarizes the general conclusions of the research answering the imposed research hypotheses: - first, that traditional and new integration theories with the drawn in them effects and benefits of integration processes are weakly or not at all applicable to developing countries and in particular to regional economic integration in Africa; - second, that the impact of the EU on regional economic integration in Africa is twofold – it has the potential to give impetus to its development but on the other hand it poses some challenges to the already complicated integration processes.

N17|Direction of International Trade of African Regional Economic Communities|African countries and their regional economic communities are trying to achieve integration through free trade, creation of customs unions and organization of common markets. International trade is a means for acquisition of fixed assets, equipment, materials and processed goods that are critical to economic growth. In this regard, African countries and the institutions of their integration entities must work to expand the volume of total trade, as well as the trade flows between each other, using the means of trade liberalization. The paper analyses the dynamics of trade flows and the trends in trade patterns of African countries and regional economic communities with special focus on intraregional and intra-continental trade. The study presents the main import and export destinations both in continental and global terms thus outlining the trends in African countries? and Regional economic communities? direction of trade for the period 2003-2012 and trying to draw some conclusions on the realization of potential benefits of integration.
N17|A Note on Nonlinear Cointegration, Misspecification, and Bimodality| We derive the asymptotic distribution of the ordinary least squares estimator in a regression with cointegrated variables under misspecification and/or nonlinearity in the regressors. We show that, under some circumstances, the order of convergence of the estimator changes and the asymptotic distribution is non-standard. The t -statistic might also diverge. A simple case arises when the intercept is erroneously omitted from the estimated model or in nonlinear-in-variables models with endogenous regressors. In the latter case, a solution is to use an instrumental variable estimator. The core results in this paper also generalise to more complicated nonlinear models involving integrated time series.
N17|How Vulnerable are Arab Countries to Global Food Price Shocks?| We estimate pass-through effects of international food price movements into domestic food prices for 18 countries in the Middle East and North Africa, using threshold regressions. International price movements transmit to various degrees into domestic prices. Transmission is mostly asymmetric, pushing domestic price levels up as increases in international food prices are typically passed through, but declines are rarely transmitted. This situation is indicative of policy and market distortions, notably the presence of food subsidies in the context of fiscal constraints. Hence, both international prices and their volatility matter for domestic inflation, yet domestic factors also play a role.
N17|Why Is Polygyny More Prevalent in Western Africa? An African Slave Trade Perspective|Polygyny rates are higher in western Africa than in eastern Africa. The African slave trades help explain this difference. More male slaves were exported in the transatlantic slave trades from western Africa, while more female slaves were exported in the Indian Ocean slave trades from eastern Africa. The slave trades led to prolonged periods of abnormal sex ratios, which affected the rates of polygyny across Africa. In order to assess these claims, we present evidence from a variety of sources. We find that the transatlantic slave trades have a positive correlation with historical levels of polygyny across African ethnic groups. We also construct an ethnic group level data set linking current rates of polygyny with historical trade flow data from the transatlantic and Indian Ocean slave trades. We find that the transatlantic slave trades cause polygyny at the ethnic group level, while the Indian Ocean slave trades do not. We provide cross-country evidence corroborating our findings.
N17|The fall of the elephant. Two decades of poverty increase in Côte d’Ivoire (1988 - 2008)|"At the end of 1980s, Côte d'Ivoire entered a deep macroeconomic crisis that put an end to the often praised ""Ivorian miracle"". After the death of the founding father Houphouët-Boigny, unrestrained political competition added to bad economic conditions and led to the nightmare of civil war. Drawing from a series of five household surveys covering two decades (1988-2008), we tell the story of this descent into hell from the standpoint of poverty and living standards. In 2008, after five years of civil war and another episode yet to come (2010-11), extreme 1.25 USD poverty headcount had reached a historical record in poverty, with northern areas deeply impoverished by the partition"
N17|Wirtschaftliche Partnerschaftsabkommen (EPAs) der EU mit Afrika: Dominanz der EU Exportinteressen statt Partnerschaft auf Augenhöhe|Angesichts des globalen Wettlaufs um Afrikas Ressourcen ist die EU darauf aus, Wirtschaftliche Partnerschaftsabkommen (EPAs) mit afrikanischen Staaten bis Oktober 2014 abzuschließen. Diese EPAs sind sollen nicht nur der Liberalisierung des Handels dienen, sondern auch die Wirtschaftsentwicklung in Afrika fördern und so eine win-win Situation in einer Partnerschaft auf Augenhöhe schaffen. Viele Afrikaner verdächtigen die EU jedoch mit doppelter Zunge zu reden und egoistisch eigene Exportinteressen zu Lasten eines inklusiven Wachstums in afrikanischen Ländern zu verfolgen. Die vorgeschlagenen EPAs der ECOWAS dienen als Beispiel um zu zeigen, dass die Spannungen zwischen afrikanischen Ländern und der EU im Wesentlichen auf der Diskrepanz zwischen dem Diskurs und der Praxis der EU Außenhandels- und Entwicklungshilfepolitik beruhen, ebenso wie auf versteckten Interessen der EU-Direktorate und Mitgliederstaaten. Die wachsende Bereitschaft afrikanischer Staaten, die EU-Außenhandelsinteressen in Frage zu stellen wird effektiv unterstützt durch nachhaltige pro-aktive Agitation von NRO und zivilgesellschaftlichen Gruppen innerhalb und außerhalb Afrikas.
N17|Size Matters: The Effect of the Scramble for Africa on Informal Institutions and Development|We argue that the partition of ethnic groups following the Scramble for Africa does not itself matter for development in Africa. It matters only when the partitioned groups are relatively small because small groups lack political representation which may promote ethnic mobilization and foster support for informal (rather than formal) institutions which then may affect development. Furthermore, the analysis of data from the Afrobarometer shows that the persistence of informal/tribal institutions related to property rights and the rule of law is one of the possible channels through which the size of the partitioned group affects development.
N17|Distributional Impact of Commodity Price Shocks: Australia over a Century|This paper studies the distributional impact of commodity price shocks over both the short and very long run. Using a GARCH model, we find that Australia experienced more volatility than many commodity exporting developing countries over the periods 1865-1940 and 1960-2007. A single equation error correction model suggests that commodity price shocks increase the income share of the top 1, 0.05 and 0.01 percents in the short run. THe very top end of the income distribution benefits from commodity booms disproportionately more than the rest of the society. The short run effect is mainly driven by wool and mining and not agricultural commodities. A sustained increase in the price of renewables (wool) reduces inequality whereas the same for non-renewable resources (minerals) increases inequality. We expect the initial distribution of land and mineral resources explains the asymmetric result.
N17|Towards a Measure of Core Inflation using Singular Spectrum Analysis|This paper constructs a number of possible core measures of annual inflation using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). Annual inflation is decomposed into its trend, oscillating and noise components in order to develop an understanding of the trend and cyclicality in South African headline inflation. Five cyclical components are identified with differing amplitude and frequency. The trend and cyclical components of inflation are found to be a good approximation of core inflation, the inertial part of inflation. These core measures are compared to other candidate core measures based on the properties of a good core inflation measure. Generally, the SSA measures outperform commonly use measures of core inflation.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N17|Credit Shocks and Macroeconomic Fluctuations in Emerging Markets|In this paper, we examine the role of global and domestic credit supply shocks in macroeconomic fluctuations for Emerging Markets. For this purpose, we impose a set of zero and sign restrictions within a medium-scale Bayesian Vector Auto-Regressive model. Quarterly data from South Africa and G-7 countries in 1985-2010 show that credit supply shocks impact significantly on macroeconomic aggregates in these economies. However, credit supply shocks have played, on average, a less important role than credit demand shocks. Moreover, shocks originating from G7-countries are the main drivers of real activity in South Africa, although they played a marginal role in the 1996-1999 South African recession.
N17|The Long-Run Effects of the Scramble for Africa|We explore the consequences of ethnic partitioning, a neglected aspect of the Scramble for Africa, and uncover the following. First, apart from the land mass and water bodies, split and non-split groups are similar across several dimensions. Second, the incidence, severity, and duration of political violence are all higher for partitioned homelands which also experience frequent military interventions from neighboring countries. Third, split groups are often entangled in a vicious circle of government-led discrimination and ethnic wars. Fourth, respondents from survey data identifying with split ethnicities are economically disadvantaged. The evidence highlights the detrimental repercussions of the colonial border design.
N17|Tropical economic miracles|During the second half of the last century Botswana and Singapore experienced an unparalleled economic performance among the Tropical countries. This paper explores and describes the main economic and institutional causes behind the rapid economic development observed in these two economies. The quality of institutions —inherited from the precolonial times and the British rule—, the appropriate integration into the world markets, and the political stability —achieved by their single ruling parties—, played a significant role in the “miracles” of Botswana and Singapore.
N17|Pre‐Colonial Ethnic Institutions and Contemporary African Development|We investigate the role of deeply-rooted pre-colonial ethnic institutions in shaping comparative regional development within African countries. We combine information on the spatial distribution of ethnicities before colonization with regional variation in contemporary economic performance, as proxied by satellite images of light density at night. We document a strong association between pre-colonial ethnic political centralization and regional development. This pattern is not driven by differences in local geographic features or by other observable ethnic-specific cultural and economic variables. The strong positive association between pre-colonial political complexity and contemporary development obtains also within pairs of adjacent ethnic homelands with different legacies of pre-colonial political institutions.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N17|VENT FOR SURPLUS OR PRODUCTIVITY BREAKTHROUGH? THE GHANAIAN COCOA TAKE-OFF, c.1890-1936|Through a case-study of cocoa-farming in Ghana, this paper takes up the longrunning but recently neglected debate about the ‘cash crop revolution’ in tropical Africa during the early colonial period. It focuses on the supply side, using quantitative evidence as far as possible, to test the much criticised but never superseded ‘vent-for-surplus’ interpretation of the export expansion as a substitution of labour for leisure. The paper argues that while the model captured certain features of the case, such as the application of labour to underused land, its defining claim about labour is without empirical foundation. Rather, the evidence points to a reallocation of resources from existing market activities towards the adoption of an exotic crop, entailing a shift towards a new, qualitatively different and more profitable kind of production function. This innovation is best understood in the context of the long-term search of African producers for ways of realising the economic potential of their resource of relatively abundant land, while ameliorating the constraints which the environment put upon its use.
N17|The economics of slavery in 18th century Cape Colony: Revising the Nieboer-Domar hypothesis|The Nieboer–Domar hypothesis has proved to be a powerful tool to identify the economic conditions under which slavery is more likely to emerge as a dominant form of labour. It states that in cases of land abundance and labour shortages the use of slavery was more likely to become a vital alternative to increase production. These conditions have been identified for large parts of pre-colonial and partly colonial Africa. The hypothesis has, however, not remained uncontested. Scholars have criticized it on both theoretical and empirical grounds. This paper discusses the validity of the Nieboer– Domar hypothesis using the eighteenth-century Cape Colony as our point of departure. We show that the hypothesis partly holds but needs modified. First, slavery emerged as an urban phenomenon. Second, the use of slaves increased parallel with other forms of labour and the role of slaves can only be understood in relation to a wide range of existing labour contracts. Once established, slavery came to play a significant role in facilitating increased production on the settler farms in the 18th century. Capacity for surplus production was the key factor, but why slaves became a major form of labour was partly a consequence of its’ pre-existence in the urban areas and partly how it be combine slavery with other forms of labour.
N17|Neopatrimonialism and the political economy of Economic Permormance in Africa: Critical Reflections|During the last two decades the idea that neopatrimonialism is central to unravelling the facts behind Africa’s poor economic performance has been advanced by what this study will refer to as the “Neopatrimonialism School”. This paper will argue that while providing descriptions of the styles of exercise of authority, idiosyncratic mannerisms of certain colourful individual leaders, or the socio-cultural practices of states and individuals occupying different positions within them, the concept has little analytical content and no predictive value with respect to economic policy and performance. As the concept is also deployed in comparative analyses, in order to explain why Africa underperforms when compared to other regions in the developing world, this paper touches upon a number of comparisons between Africa and other parts of the developing world

N17|Political centralization in pre-colonial Africa|In this paper we investigate the empirical correlates of political centralization using data from the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample. We specifically investigate the explanatory power of the standard models of Eurasian state formation which emphasize the importance of high population density, inter-state warfare and trade as factors leading to political centralization. We find that while in the whole world sample these factors are indeed positively correlated with political centralization, this is not so in the African sub-sample. Indeed, none of the variables are statistically related to political centralization. We also provide evidence that political centralization, where it took place, was indeed associated with better public goods and development outcomes. We conclude that the evidence is quite consistent with the intellectual tradition initiated in social anthropology by Evans-Pritchard and Fortes in the 1940s which denied the utility of Eurasian models in explaining patterns of political centralization in Africa.
