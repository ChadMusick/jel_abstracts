K00|Centros de Atención Móvil a Drogodependientes (CAMAD)|Los consumidores problemáticos de sustancias psicoactivas enfrentan riesgos de salud excepcionalmente altos. Sin embargo, por razones diversas, estos individuos no acuden a servicios de salud con la frecuencia que se requiere dadas sus condiciones de salud. La estrategia CAMAD fue un programa de reducción de daños cuyo objetivo central fue la prestación de servicios de salud a la población de habitantes de calle. Con base en la información disponible, en este documento presentamos una descripción del programa y de algunos de sus resultados. Entre los hallazgos de la investigación se destacan los siguientes: (i) El programa llegó a cerca de 53 mil personas entre septiembre de 2012 y mayo de 2016. (ii) El 70% de los usuarios no tenía seguro de salud y el 26,5% estaba en el régimen subsidiado. (iii) El 22% de los usuarios se identificó como habitante de calle. (iv) Entre quienes reportaron su ocupación, 54,8% era estudiante y 40% estudiantes de bachillerato. (v) En la población no estudiante, las mujeres representan el 26,5% de los usuarios, en el caso de los estudiantes, esta proporción fue 44%.
K00|Corporate Control around the World|We provide an anatomy of corporate control around the world after tracing controlling shareholders for thousands listed firms from 127 countries between 2004 and 2012. The analysis reveals considerable and persistent differences across and within regions, as well as across legal families. Government and family control is pervasive in civil-law countries. Equity blocks in widely-held corporations are commonplace, but less so in common-law countries. These patterns apply to large, medium, and small listed firms. In contrast, the association between income and corporate control is highly heterogeneous; the correlation is strong among big and especially very large firms, but absent for medium and small listed firms. We then examine the association between corporate control and various institutional features. Shareholder rights against insiders' self-dealing activities correlate strongly with corporate control, though legal formalism and creditor rights less so. Corporate control is strongly related to labor market regulations, concerning, among others, the stringency of employment contracts, the power and extent of unions. The large sample correlations, thus, offer support to both legal origin and political-development theories of financial development.
K00|Access to Justice and Economic Development: Evidence from an International Panel Dataset|We empirically investigate the impact of access to justice (ATJ) on GDP per capita growth in a panel of 83 countries from 1970 to 2014. Our analysis relies on a new database documenting the number of judges per capita as a proxy for capturing the cross-country evolution of ATJ. The proxy measures the extent to which disputes between economic actors can be resolved at a relatively low cost, without dysfunctional delay and discrimination. In a dynamic panel setting using internal instruments, we find that increasing ATJ by 1% increases the five-year growth rate of GDP per capita by 0.86 p.p. (0.17 p.p. annually) with diminishing marginal returns. In line with the diminishing marginal returns argument, we find that the effect of ATJ is two times smaller in Europe compared to other regions due to higher levels of ATJ. We find no evidence of a differential effect of ATJ across other regions, income levels, legal origins, democracy, corruption of the judicial system or human capital levels.
K00|Simplicity Creates Inequity: Implications for Fairness, Stereotypes, and Interpretability|Algorithms are increasingly used to aid, or in some cases supplant, human decision-making, particularly for decisions that hinge on predictions. As a result, two additional features in addition to prediction quality have generated interest: (i) to facilitate human interaction and understanding with these algorithms, we desire prediction functions that are in some fashion simple or interpretable; and (ii) because they influence consequential decisions, we also want them to produce equitable allocations. We develop a formal model to explore the relationship between the demands of simplicity and equity. Although the two concepts appear to be motivated by qualitatively distinct goals, we show a fundamental inconsistency between them. Specifically, we formalize a general framework for producing simple prediction functions, and in this framework we establish two basic results. First, every simple prediction function is strictly improvable: there exists a more complex prediction function that is both strictly more efficient and also strictly more equitable. Put another way, using a simple prediction function both reduces utility for disadvantaged groups and reduces overall welfare relative to other options. Second, we show that simple prediction functions necessarily create incentives to use information about individuals' membership in a disadvantaged group—incentives that weren't present before simplification, and that work against these individuals. Thus, simplicity transforms disadvantage into bias against the disadvantaged group. Our results are not only about algorithms but about any process that produces simple models, and as such they connect to the psychology of stereotypes and to an earlier economics literature on statistical discrimination.
K00|Local referendum: The perspectives of a forgotten legal instrument|Direct democracy is generally represented by national referenda, when the whole population of a country could decide on a particular matter, or could express an opinion. However, in most of the democratic countries, the local communities, regions or townships have also the right to hold referenda from local issues, such as the planned construction of new industrial facilities, or from investments with remarkable environmental impact. These referenda are subject to similar legal framework, than national referenda, but their inherent character is different: this local legal instrument does not constitute essentially the expression of the popular sovereignty, but it creates a tool for the citizens to participate at the self-governance of the local community. Due to this ambiguity, local referenda shall be distinguished clearly from the national level of direct democracy: the legal background, the special campaign, and the remedies of local referenda shall be analysed in depth. Moreover, to outline the different models in this regard, a comparative research would be also crucial to provide an overarching picture from local referenda across Europe.As the outcome of our research, we would provide a deeper understanding of local referendum as an underestimated instrument of direct democracy, and we would conceptualize, how this constitutionally acknowledged legal framework could serve the interest of the citizens and the local communities more efficiently. For this purpose, certain points would be highlighted for consideration for future constitution-making processes. Our research would cover a field, which has been little researched, and it would be based on three strands of literature, which has been rarely used by this integrated manner. Firstly, we would rely on contributions from direct democracy, which give us some sense from the general character of this forgotten legal instrument. Secondly, the literature from the self-governance would be also referred, as local referenda shall be evaluated primarily within this concept. Thirdly, sources directly linked to local referendum would be also revealed from various European countries, where this concept plays a significant role to decide particular issues.
K00|Considering The Impact Of Right To Be Forgotten In The Law Structure In Indonesia: An Analysis On Some Legal Cases In Indonesia|After successfully getting the attention of countries in the Southeast Asia Region as the pioneer in presenting the Right to be Forgotten policy in its legal instruments, Indonesia must now account for the decision. The country must not only make sure the policy can be implemented, but also anticipate problems that will arise due to its implementation.The Law Number 19 of 2016 concerning Amendment to the Law Number 11 of 2008 concerning Information and Electronic Transactions is the basis for the enactment of the Right to be Forgotten policy in Indonesia (UU ITE) . This arrangement has led to debates, considering that to these days Right to be Forgotten is still a sore subject in European countries and the United States. Not only that, Indonesia currently has not had any laws specifically regulating data protection, even the provisions of Right to be Forgotten have not been regulated in detail that it has may lead to different interpretations.Cyberspace data or information related to legal cases in Indonesia is one of the problems that might occur; this includes not only the data existed before the case go on trial, but also the data presents after the case is decided by the court and the convict has served a sentence. This paper will discuss several events related to data and legal processes in Indonesia. The first is about a past photo of Angelina Sondakh, which proved her ownership of a Blackberry mobile phone that led to Supreme Court verdict for 10 years in a corruption case. The second is related to the release of data of legislative candidates who are ex-convicts by the General Election Commission in the General Election Process in 2019. The next data will be information to prove the public lie of Ratna Sarumpaet, an activist who claimed to have been persecuted, and the lie has sparked public criticism against the incident.These three cases have one thing in common, i.e. the presence of information or data that can be accessed via the internet having the potential to be used as an object of Right to be Forgotten. Therefore, regulations to ensure that Right to be Forgotten can work well in accordance with the legal provisions in Indonesia and without reducing other existing rights are necessary.
K00|Peer Effects on the United States Supreme Court|Using data on essentially every US Supreme Court decision since 1946, we estimate a model of peer effects on the Court. We consider both the impact of justice ideology and justice votes on the votes of their peers. To identify these peer effects we use two instruments. The first is based on the composition of the Court, determined by which justices sit on which cases due to recusals or health reasons for not sitting. The second utilizes the fact that many justices previously sat on Federal Circuit Courts and are empirically much more likely to affirm decisions from their “home” court. We find large peer effects. Replacing a single justice with one who votes in a conservative direction 10 percentage points more frequently increases the probability that each other justice votes conservative by 1.63 percentage points. In terms of votes, a 10 percentage point increase in the probability that a single justice votes conservative leads to a 1.1 percentage increase in the probability that each other justice votes conservative. Finally, a single justice becoming 10% more likely to vote conservative increases the share of cases with a conservative outcome by 3.6 percentage points–excluding the direct effect of that justice–and reduces the share with a liberal outcome by 3.2 percentage points. In general, the indirect effect of a justice’s vote on the outcome through the votes of their peers is typically several times larger than the direct mechanical effect of the justice’s own vote.
K00|Kartellrecht und Ökonomik: Institutions matter!|Der vorliegende Beitrag diskutiert die Schnittstelle zwischen Recht und Ökonomik in der Wettbewerbspolitik. Aus einer ökonomischen Perspektive werden Ansätze zu einer institutionenökonomischen Analyse der Kartellrechtsdurchsetzung betrachtet. Im Rahmen einer positiven Institutionenökonomik der Wettbewerbspolitik analysieren die Autoren informationsökonomische Aspekte, verhaltensökonomische Ansätze, sowie die politökonomische Dimension. Zudem werden Bausteine einer normativen Institutionenökonomik des Kartellrechts diskutiert. Schließlich exploriert der Beitrag soziologische Aspekte der Wettbewerbspolitik, welche in der Literatur bisher weitgehend vernachlässigt werden. Insgesamt weisen die Autoren auf zahlreiche offene Fragen für das optimale Institutionendesign bei der Kartellrechtsdurchsetzung hin und identifizieren zahlreiche offene Forschungsfragen für die institutionenökonomische Wettbewerbsforschung.
K00|Homelessness, Property Rights and Institutional Logics|We explore whether there is evidence of property rights amongst the homeless, and if so, how these rights are governed. We show that although the homeless are able to derive some value from assets, and can exclude other members of their community, these rights are precarious and dependent upon state agents not seizing the â€œpropertyâ€ and overriding the communityâ€™s rules of the game. The transferring of assets are especially curtailed. We demonstrate the intersectionality of claims with respect to the same physical property from the varying perspectives of the claimants involved and how this differs depending on the property. Homeless people rely on a community logic to develop rules of the game which results in the appearance of a market logic. In the absence of formal institutions effectively operating in their spaces, they have constituted social norms which provide some semblance of property rights which are respected within the group.
K00|Open Access in the Economic Sphere and Restricted Access in the Political Sphere: The Case of Singapore|This article uses the case of Singapore to argue that the theory of open access order advocated by North and his colleagues goes beyond what is necessary. Although their theory of open access order explains the West relatively well, it does not always apply to contemporary non-Western countries. Similar to the cases of India and Japan examined elsewhere, the case of Singapore shows that what is more important to economic and human development is the open access in the economic sphere and the interconnected institutions in the area of property rights protection and contract enforcement, financial market, rule of law, and human resource accumulation. In other words, countries without open access in the political sphere as practiced in Singapore may also be able to achieve a great deal of success in terms of economic and human development if they ensure open access in the economic sphere and devote adequate resources to establishing the necessary interconnected institutions examined in this article. Further research elsewhere on China will similarly demonstrate this insight.
K00|Joint ventures|When the new Romanian Civil Code entered into force (in 2011), both legal regulations on partnerships and joint ventured were expressly abolished, as the two regulatory documents (meaning the Civil Code of 1864 and the Business Code of 1887) were repealed in full (express repealing according to art. 230 of Law no. 71/2011 for the application of the new Civil Code).However, by means of a similar regulation, the new Civil Code took over the two types of companies without legal personality in Chapter VII (Company Contracts) of Book V (On Obligations), Title IX (Various Special Contracts). The chapter concerning company contracts consists of three distinct sections of which we will hereby approach the 2nd Section (Partnerships) and the 3rd Section (Joint ventures).In fact, in the chapter on company contracts, the new Civil Code includes special provisions referring only to the two types of companies without legal personality. Therefore, the two sections of Chapter VII (the 2nd and the 3rd Section) are the legal framework for the companies without legal personality in Romania and, at the same time, they are a special legal regulation in the matter, that is no other law may govern in this field. As we have previously shown, the Tax Code may rule on various aspects concerning the organization of this type of companies, as a special legal regulation (which applies with preference against the provisions of the Civil Code); nevertheless, we believe that, in legal terms, the tax regulations should not be allowed to change significantly the legal requirements set by the Civil Code for the establishment and operation of the companies without legal personality. Unfortunately, the regulatory contradictions between the two legal instruments (the Civil Code and the Tax Code) are obvious and of essence in some cases, therefore they cannot be overlooked; this is why we have thought it appropriate to approach such matter, namely the interference of civil and tax regulations, as this interesting topic may give rise to many debates in practice.
K00|The other side of the coin: the negative aspect of freedom of religion|It is beyond doubts, that the framework of freedom of religion, as a positive right, entitles people to conduct a wide range of activities. However, what is the proper assessment, when one refrains from a legal duty due to religious reasons, or one refuses to participate in compulsory commitments on religious grounds?It should be highlighted, that freedom of religion influences almost all areas of life worldwide, the issues which are raised, are quite similar in the different countries. As for demonstration, it is broadly accepted, that the free exercise of religion shall not violate disproportionately the fundamental rights of others. The definition of religion and church shall be precised. It is also questionable, whether there is a right to convert someone to one?s religion. Our contribution is dedicated to these issues.
K00|Organic laws in Africa and the judicial branch|During the last decades, several countries have entrenched a special subcategory of law, which is adopted by stricter procedural rules, than the requirements of the ordinary legislative process. These laws are enacted by qualified majority, by the consent of the two chambers of the legislation, they are subject to mandatory constitutional review before their promulgation, or additional safeguards are implemented in the ordinary legislative process. Organic law appears in the French, the Spanish and the Hungarian legal system also as main models. Later, further European countries implemented organic law in their legal system, such as Portugal, Romania or Moldova. Organic law is also known in Latin-America. In Africa, a total of 19 countries have implemented organic law: Algeria; Angola; Benin; Burkina Faso; Central African Republic; Chad; Djibouti; Equatorial Guinea; Gabon; Guinea; Ivory Coast; Democratic Republic of Congo; Republic of Congo; Madagascar; Mauritania; Morocco; Niger; Senegal; Togo; Tunisia; and Cape Werde Islands. Although the fact, that organic law has been introduced in a huge number of African countries, this phenomena has not been researched in depth int he relevant African literature. Several questions might be raised: whether the implementation of organic law is a mere copy of European (French and Portugal) samples, or internal African reasons may be also identifiable? What is the role of organic law in African constitutional systems, could organic laws promote the stability of African constitutional frameworks? Is there any regional differences between organic laws? African organic laws differs remarkably from their European counterparts? Is there any African discussion or jurisprudence from the legal category of organic law?My study will address such issues, and would provide a broad overview from African organic laws. I have three main purposes: to understand the characteristics of African organic laws; to compare the relevant African and the European models; and to analyse the perspectives of organic laws in Africa. My concept would be based on a combined strands of first and secondary African and European sources, which have been rarely used in this integrated manner.
K00|Expunction Of Conviction For Fiscal Criminal Offences In Poland|The subject of the article is the expunction of conviction for fiscal criminal offences and misdemeanours under Polish criminal law. The author starts her article by emphasising the social and legal importance of the expunction of conviction and explains the essence of the institution. She then goes on to present the Fiscal Criminal Code as an independent legal act and elaborates on its connections to the Criminal Code. In the main part of the article, the author analyses the legal basis for the expunction of conviction for fiscal criminal offences and presents an in-depth analysis of the regulations governing the expunction of conviction for fiscal criminal offences. She goes on to examine the issue of absolution of a conviction for fiscal criminal offences and misdemeanours through a Presidential pardon. As a result of the analysis, the author makes assessment of the present state of the law as to the expunction of conviction for fiscal criminal offences and misdemeanours. The author suggests that it is necessary to amend some of the existing regulations and proposes a number of de lege ferenda postulates.
K00|The legal roles and professional ethics of defence attorneys in relation to the electronic monitoring of offenders in Slovakia (vis-à-vis the situation in the USA and the EU)|This paper deals with the legal roles, and to a small extent also with the professional ethics of defence attorneys in relation to the use of electronic monitoring in the criminal justice field. Its scientific aim is twofold: (1) to briefly summarize relevant results of the pilot research conducted within the Slovak-national project acronymed IAEMPS, and (2) to compare them with the relevant desk research results concerning the USA and the EU. In the concluding part, the authors open the discussion about the potential shifts of emphasis (a) from technical aspects of EM aimed at replacing imprisonment to electronically monitored probation programs as autonomous sentences; and (b) from ?traditional penal? attorneys to ?more holistic defence attorneys?.
K00|International legal relations in troubled times and their impact on substantive elements of international trade|Trade between different countries forms a significant part of national economic development worldwide. The significance of the interdependence of countries is increasing with rising globalisation (Helpman, 2011). To facilitate cross-border cooperation, including trade, countries form associations and other cooperative units with established rules, often with economic advantages, amongst the Member States. The European Union (the ?EU?) and the European Economic Area (the ?EEA?) are relevant examples of the above cooperation. One of the main objectives of the EU is the establishment of an internal market without internal frontiers ensuring the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital (Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union 2012, Art. 26). The EEA unites the EU countries with Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, allowing the non-EU members to enjoy the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital without internal frontiers similarly (Agreement on the European Economic Area, 1994, Art. 1). The United Kingdom (the ?UK?) is a Member State of the EU (and therefore the EEA) allowing it to be part of the concept of an internal market. However, the situation for the UK might be changed in the future due to the UK?s EU membership referendum which took place on 23rd June 2016 resulting in the majority of voters expressing their desire for the UK to leave the EU (the UK leaving the EU also ?BREXIT?). BREXIT will inevitably impact various aspects of the existing legal establishment. The area of Private international law (the ?PIL?), encompassing the determination of applicable law, jurisdiction of courts and enforcement of foreign judgement, will be influenced to a significant extent. The paper will briefly examine the current legal establishment and the options the UK has concerning future arrangements of the PIL rules. Further, the paper will investigate future jurisdictional competence, enforceability of foreign judgements taking into consideration the development in a field of international arbitration, specifically the enforcement of arbitration awards and control of arbitration proceedings in the BREXIT context. The paper aims to identify the challenges brought by the potential removal of the current EU PIL regime which can be considered as a ?safety net?.
K00|Moral Nimby-ism? Understanding Societal Support for Monetary Compensation to Plasma Donors in Canada|The growing demand for plasma, especially for the manufacture of therapeutic products, creates an urgent need for a careful discussion on the relative merits of different procurement and allocation systems in a way that addresses the increasing demand while abiding by the prevailing moral values in a society. We conducted a randomized survey experiment with a representative sample of 826 Canadian residents to assess attitudes toward legalizing the compensation to plasma donors, a practice that is illegal in several Canadian provinces. We found no evidence of widespread societal opposition to payments to plasma donors, because over 70% of respondents reported that they would support compensation. The support was higher for paying plasma donors in Australia and the United States than in Canada, but the differences were small, suggesting a weak role for “moral NIMBY-ism” or moral relativism in explaining the findings. Moral concerns were the highest-rated reason that respondents gave for being against payment, together with concerns for the safety of plasma supplied by compensated donors, although most of the plasma in Canada does come from compensated American donors. Among those in favor of legalizing compensation for donors (in Canada as well as in Australia), the highest-rated motive was to guarantee a higher domestic supply. Finally, roughly half of those who declared to be against payments reported that they would reconsider their position if the domestic supply and imports were insufficient to meet domestic demand. Most Canadians, therefore, seem to espouse a consequentialist view to issues related to the procurement of plasma.

K00|Crime and Durable Goods|We develop a theoretical model to study how changes in the durability of the goods affects prices of stolen goods, the incentives to steal and the equilibrium crime rate. When studying the production of durable goods, we find that the presence of crime affects consumer and producer surplus and thus their behaviour, market equilibrium, and, in turn, the social optimum. Lower durability of goods reduces the incentive to steal those goods, thus reducing crime. When crime is included in the standard framework of durable goods, the socially optimal durability level is lower. When considering different stealing technologies, perfect competition either over-produces durability or produces zero (minimum) durability. The monopolist under-produces durability. The model has a clear policy implication: the durability of goods, and the market structure for those goods, can be an effective instrument to reduce crime. In particular, making the durability of a good contingent upon that good being stolen is likely to increase welfare. We also study the incentives to develop and use this optimal technology.
K00|The Greek Justice System: Collapse and Reform|This paper discusses the key structural deficiencies of the Greek justice system and proposes some concrete policy reforms. In the first part, we provide an anatomy of the Greek legal system using cross-country indicators reflecting the formalism, quality, and speed of the resolution mechanisms. The analysis shows that the Greek justice system is failing to protect citizens, as delays in all types of courts exceed five years and in some instances reach a decade. At the same the quality of laws protecting investors, even property, is low. Using comparative data from other EU jurisdictions, we show that the key reasons behind these failures are the absence of information technology, the lack of supporting to judges staff, the absence of specialized courts and tribunals, and a hugely dysfunctional administration. At the same time, there are minimal checks and balances. In the second part, we detail a set of policy proposals. Our proposals consist of immediate measures for clearing the large backlog and a set of more ambitious medium-term reforms (many of which require a constitutional amendment). Our proposals aim to make the Greek justice system professionally administered, less formalistic, suitably flexible, more responsive and more accountable to society at large. Given the strong link between legal institutions and development, justice reform is an absolute priority of the reform agenda and a sine qua non-condition for the much-needed sustainable recovery of the Greek economy.
K00|Is the EU Disinformation Review Compliant with EU Law? Complaint to the European Ombudsman About the EU Anti-Fake News Initiative|The EU’s approach to fake news, as epitomised by the European External Action (EEAS) Service East Stratcom Disinformation Review, violates the rights to freedom of expression and due process of those accused of distributing disinformation. The EU Disinformation Review is a publication of the European External Action Service (the European Union’s diplomatic service) to target fake news and online disinformation. Following our request for access to documents, EEAS conceded that the EU Disinformation Review uses an “ad hoc” methodology for conducting its fact-checks, which makes it an outlier in the international fact-checking community led by the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). Despite being a well-intentioned initiative to respond to the challenges posed by pro-Kremlin disinformation, the EU should ensure the respect of fundamental rights when engaging in fact-checking. The EU Disinformation Review seeks to control the right to freedom of expression by labelling publishers as “disinforming outlets” and their content as “disinformation,” creating a chilling effect on the work of journalists that is central to democracy. The right to freedom of expression is expressed in Article 11.1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2000/C 364/01) and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The labelling of publishers as “disinformation outlets” is contrary to principle of the freedom of press established by the European Court of Human Rights: “[a] general requirement for journalists systematically and formally to distance themselves from the content of a quotation that might insult or provoke others or damage their reputation is not reconcilable with the press’ role of providing information on current events, opinion and ideas.” In addition, the methodology used by EEAS in the EU Disinformation Review is “ad hoc,” which constitutes a violation of the fundamental right to good administration in Article 41 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. Specifically, the ad hoc design and operation of the EU Disinformation Review fails to ensure the review acts “impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time.” First, publications are not provided with the right to be heard or proper notice. The EU Disinformation Review’s homepage offers an opportunity to contact the Task Force report a suspected mistake in a fact-check but the page is only available in English, in violation of the principle of multilingualism, and no notice if given to outlets accused of being “disinforming outlets” before or after fact-checks of their content are published. Second, the EEAS does not fulfil its duty to motivate. EEAS is given a broad margin of discretion to identify disinformation, but fails to do so according to a consistent methodology. Therefore, EEAS cannot justify, on the basis of objective criteria, its choice of which content to review and how to determine its truth or falsehood. To comply with EU law and ensure the respect of fundamental rights, the EEAS should develop and make public (1) a methodology for selecting partnerships and reviewing fact-checks in line with international standards and (2) a notice and response mechanism for journalists, publishers and citizens whose content is being reviewed. If EEAS is unable to comply with the above, the EU Disinformation Review should be shut down.
K00|Towards Transnational European Democracy? The New Battles Lines of the 2019 European Parliament Election|The EU’s political system has never caught up with the impact European integration has had on citizens’ daily lives. EU citizens still vote in the European Parliament elections on different dates, according to different electoral laws, and in support of candidates selected by national parties and on the basis of domestic agendas. Yet this is set to change. With less than a year to go before the European Parliament elections, the EU political landscape is about to undergo a deep and historical shake-up. While populists are poised to disrupt the Parliament, a new wave of little-noticed transnational parties is emerging from the bottom-up. They both threaten established, mainstream political parties that have historically hold a monopoly of the European ‘project’. This paper traces their genesis, evolution and raison d'être before identifying their major features and political prospect.
K00|The Sound of Silence: A Review Essay of Nancy MacLean's Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right's Stealth Plan for America|This essay reviews Nancy MacLean's Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right's Stealth Plan for America, which triggered a huge controversy that virally spread on the internet and in various journals. We will evaluate MacLean's almost biographical account of James Buchanan, which portrays the 1986 Nobel Prize laureate as the mastermind behind today's attacks, by the foot soldiers of the radical right, on American democracy. This essay develops three main points. One, MacLean's general narrative puts too much emphasis on Buchanan and largely neglects the many other important characters who contributed to the intellectual criticism of government intervention. Two, MacLean's account is marred by many misunderstandings about public choice theory, for instance about the role that simple majority rule plays in constitutional economics. Third, in the midst of abundant archival material, her historical narrative is, at best sketchy, and is replete with significantly flawed arguments, misplaced citations, and dubious conjectures. Overall, MacLean tends to overinterpret certain aspects in Buchanan's life and thought, while she overlooks others that are equally important in understanding his work and influence. In particular, we stress that Buchanan was, first and foremost, a scholar, not a political activist, who gave significant attention to ethical considerations in his analysis of markets.
K00|The Individual’S Interests and Motives in Economics|"The human factor is always decisive in social development. The role of active behavior and above all economic behavior is obvious. However, there are some difficulties: the law regulates predominantly ""external"" behavior; psychology covers interests, motives, will, emotions. This paper analyzes individuals’ interests and motives in economics. Coherence and contradictions of the labor interests are investigated on the basis of a survey made in several organizations. The rank of interests (economic, professional, career, group, corporate, territorial, and common civil) in the dependence of labor group type (shareholders, top managers, line managers, employees) is formed."
K00|Crime and Government Expenditure in Brazil: Estimating the Impact of Government Security Spending on Homicide Rates|Despite the widespread debate about crime in Brazil and the alarming increase in homicides in recent years, few studies have analyzed or exposed evidence of the impact of public security spending on deterring violence in the country. This may be due to issues of endogeneity when estimating the relationship between security spending and the rate of homicides. The primary innovation presented in this paper is the use of a Bartik-inspired instrument to address the simultaneity issue. It measures government security spending in a two-stage least squares estimation, obtaining outcomes that are not only statistically but also practically significant. Results indicate that an increase of R$10 per capita in annual security expenditure leads to a decrease of 0.6 per 100,000 people in the number of homicides.
K00|Positional goods and legal orderings|People consume because others consume, maintained Veblen in 1899. More recently, theoretical, empirical and experimental articles have argued that people constantly compare themselves to their environments and care greatly about their relative positions. Given that competition for positions may produce social costs, we adopt a Law and Economics approach (i) to suggest legal remedies for positional competition, and (ii) to argue that, because legal relations are characterized in turn by positional characteristics, such legal remedies do not represent ‘free lunches’
K00|The allocation of responsabilities between the central state and local authorities in the countries of the alpine area An empirical investigation based on PISA data from Italy|This work deals with the topic of the allocation of responsibilities between the central state and local authorities, with a specific territorial focus: it takes into consideration six European countries that are covered by the EUSALP Strategy (namely, the EU Strategy for the Alpine Region): Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Slovenia and Switzerland. Despite such a common EU Strategy, and a generalised need for defining a reference framework to compare policies supporting innovation in territorial ecosystems, some major differences characterise the forms of States and the regional authorities in the aforementioned countries. Thus, moving from some general indications on the regional territorial organization of national countries, this study aims to return the main characteristics of the allocation of the legislative (and partly the administrative) responsibilities in the six countries of the Alpine region.
K00|Termination Risk and Agency Problems: Evidence from the NBA|When agents with a significant risk of termination in the short term have discretion over project selection, they may have incentives to underinvest in projects whose results would be realized only in the long term, and owners may take this agency problem into account when deciding whether to grant those agents discretion in decision-making. Because NBA rookies who participate in games gain NBA experience that likely improves their long-term performance, decisions of NBA teams about whether to let rookies play provide a useful context for investigating this potential agency problem. We develop a model that identifies when owners will choose to leave coaches with discretion over rookie participation decisions and shows that, in the presence of such discretion, coaches facing a higher termination risk can be expected to use rookies less often. Testing our model using NBA data, we find evidence that is consistent with the predictions of our model.
K00|Fear and the Safety Net: Evidence from Secure Communities|This paper studies how changes in deportation fear induced by the roll-out of Secure Communities (SC), a far-reaching immigration enforcement program, affected the demand for safety net programs in the United States. We estimate the spillover effect of SC on the take-up of federal means-tested programs by Hispanic citizens, who are not themselves eligible for removal. We find significant declines in SNAP and SSI enrollment, particularly among mixed-citizenship status households. The response is muted for Hispanic households residing in sanctuary cities. Our results are most consistent with network effects that perpetuate fear rather than lack of benefit information, measurement error, or stigma.
K00|Resource curse in oil exporting countries|This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the “resource curse” phenomenon, i.e. the negative impact of oil abundance on long-term economic growth, for a set of oil exporting countries. It distinguishes between two potential drivers of resource courses: oil dependence and oil price volatility, and it investigates whether the resource curse depends on a country’s institutional and macroeconomic environment. The empirical analysis relies on a panel of 24 oil exporters between 1982 and 2012 and an error correction model. The paper provides robust evidence in favour of the resource curse hypothesis, and there is no evidence that higher quality institutions could mitigate the curse. Oil price shocks appear to have an asymmetric impact in the short run: the growth effect is positive when oil prices rise, while no statistically significant effect is observed when they fall. There is also indirect evidence that the impact of an oil price shock is partly offset by fiscal policies, particularly in countries with high oil dependence. In the long run, oil price volatility does not appear to have a statistically significant impact on GDP. Finally, exchange rate regimes seem to play a role: countries allowing their currencies to float seem to gain from positive oil price shocks in the short run, but in the long run a fixed exchange rate regime is associated with higher GDP, probably owing to active stabilisation by sovereign wealth funds.
K00| Dimensiones espaciales del crimen en Lima Metropolitana| En los últimos años, la sensación de convertirse en víctima era demasiado común y ha llevado a los hogares a pensar en la delincuencia como uno de los problemas más graves del país. Sin embargo, las tasas de victimización no son homogéneas en una misma región. Si se toma el caso de Perú, la disparidad espacial de la victimización sucede en diferentes niveles regionales: provincias, áreas interdistritales y distritos. A pesar de esta disparidad espacial, este aspecto ha sido incluido pocas veces en los trabajos sobre victimización o criminalidad de América Latina. Por ello, el objetivo de este trabajo es incorporar este aspecto para evaluar su importancia en la probabilidad de victimización de Lima Metropolitana. Normalmente los trabajos de criminalidad se enfocan en las características de las víctimas y tienen solo un marco teórico, pero esta investigación utiliza las características del distrito también por lo que habrá un marco teórico por cada tipo de característica: Rutinas Diarias y Desorganización Social. Esta investigación quiere responder dos preguntas secuenciales: (1) ¿La victimización se distribuye aleatoriamente en los distritos?; (2) Si no es aleatoria, ¿estas diferencias distritales se deben a características de desorganización social? La hipótesis es que la victimización no es aleatoria y las características de desorganización social explican este patrón no aleatorio de la victimización. Se tiene como fuente principal a la Encuesta Nacional de Programas Estratégicos (ENAPRES) de los años del 2010 al 2015 y las bases del CENACOM, CENEC, Censo Penitenciario, SISFOH y RENAMU. Debido a que la base de datos principal (ENAPRES) solo tiene información del distrito donde vive la persona, el número de crímenes posibles a investigar se reduce significativamente. En esta investigación solo se analiza dos de ellos; robo de vivienda y maltrato en el hogar. Se trata de los únicos tipos de delitos para los cuales se pueden atribuir características espaciales (la ENAPRES no precisa el lugar del crimen en los otros tipos de delitos). La metodología que se propone es un modelo jerárquico LOGIT que integra ambos tipos de características y además permite un error a nivel de distritos. Los resultados muestran que las características de desorganización social son igual de importantes para ambos tipos de crímenes; pero, en el caso de maltrato del hogar, existe un efecto multiplicador entre ambas características. Las conclusiones son que las características de desorganización social tienen un efecto mayor en el maltrato del hogar que las demográficas, pero las características de seguridad del hogar son igual de importante que las de desorganización social en el caso de robo de vivienda. Los aportes de la investigación son múltiples: el apilamiento de las bases ENAPRES, la incorporación del aspecto espacial al crimen, la evaluación de dos teorías simultáneamente y el uso de los modelos jerárquicos para corrección de los errores macro-distritales.

K00|New Trends in Kyrgyz Foreign Policy|Kyrgyzstan’s foreign policy is characterized to be multi-dimensional or multi vector concentrated on the consolidation of flexible and many-sided external relations with its neighboring states and regional players. In the historical perspective, international relations experts and scholars argue that “Kyrgyzstan’s first president Askar Akaev is considered to be the founder of the multi-vector foreign policy in the Kyrgyz Republic”(Dimensions, p.62). As a result, the new-born country started to participate in international foreign policy agendas through signing bilateral agreements with its allies and attracting intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations from various corners of the world. It is argued that there are several factors which cause multi-vector policy. If some political experts highlight that it is connected due to size and dependency of Kyrgyzstan from other countries, others also refer to poor economic situation and security concerns. In this regard Yasar Sari stated “Geopolitical and geo-economic situation of Kyrgyzstan complicated the development of an independent foreign policy. Therefore, Kyrgyzstan introduced a multi-vector foreign policy”(2017, p.137) One could agree with the fact that Kyrgyzstan, like Tadjikistan, is economically poor and has relatively less natural resources than other Central Asian countries. Indisputably, it was one of the main factors to strengthen cooperation and partnership in regional scope and beyond the region. The paper aims to investigate the new tendencies from the major three dimensions of external foreign policy which are regional, continental and global areas. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kyrgyz Republic, “The regional approach is implemented to strengthen good and friendly relations with neighboring states, continental approach is aimed at developing diplomatic relations with major powers like Russia, the USA the European Union, China, Turkey and the global approach prioritizes active engagement in UN system”(Dimensions, 2008, p.64). Therefore, this paper will strongly attempt to introduce with the main transformations under the governance of the president Soorobai Jeenbekov and will tackle recent political events in the formation of foreign policy objectives of the state nowadays. The paper focuses on question: What foreign policy actions and resolutions have been produced since the presidency of Sooronbai Jeenbekov in Kyrgyzstan?
K00|A Paradox of international (non)recognition: the relationship between de facto states and patron states|International system has been witnessing some jeopolitical mobilization after the second half of 20. century. These mobilities result in several conflicts which demand secession from their parent state. The conflicts which are caused by secessionist movements usually end with unilaterally secessions and these entities establish their own state without consent of parent state. After decolonization era, these secessionist movements are regarded as illegal by international community because they are not as part of decolonization movements. So these entities remain as unrecognized, in other words, de facto states. The violation of territorial integrity principle and threat to international peace and stability are main reasons that these states are regarded as illegal. But de facto states can’t achieve their statehood without a support from external sources. While external sources, in other words patron states support de facto states from several aspects, they also have a control on these entities. De facto states which are not recognized by international community also exprerience isolation politics. These isolationism make de facto state dependent on patron state’s support. But these dependences take de facto states away from international recognition. So in this study, it is aimed to analyze the relationship between de facto states and patron states and how this relationship evolves around a vicious circle.
K00|Law, Human Capital and the Emergence of Free City-States in Medieval Italy|In this paper, we study how the birth of the first universities in Italy affected the emergence of the Italian free cities-states (the commune) in the period 1000-1300 a.d. Exploiting a panel dataset of 121 cities, we show that after the foundation of a new university the distance between each city in the sample and the university negatively predicts the timing of the birth of communal institutions in the city. Our evidence is consistent with the idea that universities in the Middle Ages provided the necessary juridical knowledge and skills to build legal capacity and develop broader-based institutions.
K00|Organization and Information in the Fight against Crime: The Integration of Police Forces in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil|This paper analyzes the experience of information sharing, coordination, and inte- gration of actions of the civil and military police forces in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in the context of the IGESP program. The IGESP was based on the introduction of information management systems and organizational changes akin to those associated with the CompStat system originally developed in New York City. The evidence points to a causal effect of the IGESP on crime. The most conservative estimates indicate a reduction of 23 percent in violent property crimes due to the introduction of the program. There is also evidence that the IGESP is associated with improved police response, measured by apprehension of weapons and clearance rates. We present one of the few estimates available with a clear identi cation strategy of the impact of CompStat-like programs. The results suggest that coordination of actions and ef cient use of information may constitute rst-order factors in the ght against crime.
K00|The making of a national currency. Spatial transaction costs and money market integration in Spain (1825-1874)|This article analyses the integration of the Spanish money market in the 19th century. We use a Band-TAR model of prices in Madrid of bills of exchange on 9 Spanish cities to measure convergence and efficiency in the market between 1825 and 1875. While price gaps between cities were significantly reduced during the period, no progress took place in efficiency. We suggest that increasing convergence was associated to the reduction in transaction costs, which started before the railways through improvements in roads and postal services. By contrast, increases in efficiency were prevented by a very restrictive regulation of arbitrage.
K00|The certainty versus the severity of punishment, repeat offenders, and stigmatization|There is a widely held presumption among criminologists that the certainty of punishment p is a greater deterrent than the severity of punishment (s). This presumption is at odds with recent experimental work as well as the implications of simple law enforcement models. This article shows that when offenses may be committed repeatedly, p may have a greater deterrent effect than s, even when each individual offender is more responsive to sthan p. This resolves the discrepancy between experimental results and the common belief held among criminologists.
K00|Laws and authority|A law prohibiting a particular behavior does not directly change the payoff to an individual should he engage in the prohibited behavior. Rather, any change in the individual׳s payoff, should he engage in the prohibited behavior, is a consequence of changes in other peoples׳ behavior. If laws do not directly change payoffs, they are “cheap talk,” and can only affect behavior because people have coordinated beliefs about the effects of the law. Beginning from this point of view, we provide definitions of authority in a variety of problems, and investigate how and when individuals can have, gain, and lose authority.
K00|The Basic Principles of the European State and Dynamics of the Political and Legal Development within the Russian Federation|The aim of the article is to identify the basic principles of European State and its approval within modern Russia, as well as the specifics of political and legal development of the latter. The methodological basis of research work used the dialectical, phenomenological analysis and synergetic methods to reveal the essence of the basic principles of a European state and the specificity of their adoption in contemporary Russia. The study authors concluded that the implementation of the above principles in practice of political and legal development in Russia is associated with the activity of its civil society, in dialectical interaction with the state.
K00|Preordered Service in Contract Enforcement|We propose a procedural rule that we refer to as preordered service to replace sequential service of civil cases for breach of contract. The judiciary preannounces a list that ranks all entities that may enter contracts by some uniquely identifying information, such as taxpayer numbers. Courts use this list to enforce the contracts of the highest ranked entities that file a contract case. In theory, unlike sequential service, preordered service ensures efficiency in a population of investment games. Results from a laboratory experiment suggest that it may substantially reduce the caseload at courts and mitigate payoff inequality.
K00|The Firm and the self-enforcing dynamics of crime and protection|We model the symbiotic relationship between criminals and a partnership of protection providers - the Firm. In the absence of state authority, insecurity and crime generate a demand for protection. When the protection providers themselves are recruited among criminals, the prospect of graduating to the Firm magnifies the incentive for violent crime. More violence in turn increases the income of the protection providers. The result is a violence multiplier. Combining elements from tournament and rent-seeking theory, we derive results that contrast with standard results from the rent-seeking literature. For example, a decrease in the cost of violence increases violence more than pari passu and increases the value of being a criminal. The violence multiplier also generates an incentive for the protection providers to welcome new partners into the Firm. This is a crucial premise in explaining the viability of many violent structures. We confirm empirical relevance of key elements of our framework by exploring unique data on incarcerated youth in South Africa.

K00|Tullock on the common law: a loose-cannon iconoclast in action?|Abstract Gordon Tullock has been celebrated as an innovative thinker in many areas of public choice. He was also among the first to analyze the law based on the economic approach, yet, his contributions to Law and Economics have been met with skepticism or even outright ignorance. In this paper, I focus on Tullock’s papers dealing with the common law and argue that they contain important insights that have been ignored in the debate regarding legal origins.
K00|Does (better) regulation really matter? Examining public financial management legislation in Greece|Abstract Greece is thought to suffer from weak implementation of the law, including weak legislative monitoring and enforcement, a situation that undermines confidence in the rule of law. In recent years, increasing importance has been given to better regulation, namely the improvement of the quality of legislation with regards to state functioning. The purpose of this article is to examine the contribution of better regulation in the compliance of public entities with budgetary laws and regulations. The survey was the first such study to be conducted in Greece, and distributed questionnaires to auditors of the Hellenic Court of Audit, which is the Supreme Audit Institution charged with the authority to conduct external auditing of public entities and their executives. The survey results have confirmed the sense of weakness mentioned above, as most respondents considered the existing legislative framework of public financial management to be unclear, a situation that deterred compliance. Improved law design is expected to ameliorate compliance by public sector bodies, which apparently violate the law more due to its ambiguity and complexity rather than to any deliberate intention. Therefore, non-compliance should be better addressed through simplification of regulations rather than coercive enforcement.

K00|Empirical Methods for the Law|Normative legal argument based on empirical evidence is not necessarily best served by standards from the social sciences. Precautionary concern for false negatives may call for an adjustment of the significance level. That all legal choice is historically contingent, that legal problems tend to be ill-defined, and that strategic actors have an incentive to bias the generation of evidence create further challenges. Yet the law can capitalize on the adversarial principle. Competition among interested parties helps contain the strategic element and spurs the creative search for better evidence. This leads to suggestive, but institutionally contained, empirical evidence.
K00|Democracy by mistake|How does democracy emerge from authoritarian rule? Influential theories contend that incumbents deliberately choose to share or surrender power. They do so to prevent revolution, motivate citizens to fight wars, incentivize governments to provide public goods, outbid elite rivals, or limit factional violence. Examining the history of all democratizations since 1800, I show that such deliberate choice arguments may help explain up to one third of cases. In about two thirds, democratization occurred not because incumbent elites chose it but because, in trying to prevent it, they made mistakes that weakened their hold on power. Common mistakes include: calling elections or starting military conflicts, only to lose them; ignoring popular unrest and being overthrown; initiating limited reforms that get out of hand; and selecting a covert democrat as leader. These mistakes reflect well-known cognitive biases such as overconfidence and the illusion of control.
K00|Signing Statements and Presidentializing Legislative History|Presidents often attach statements to the bills they sign into law, purporting to celebrate, construe, or object to provisions in the statute. Though long a feature of U.S. lawmaking, the President has avowedly attempted to use these signing statements as tool of strategic influence over judicial decisionmaking since the 1980s—as a way of creating “presidential legislative history” to supplement and, at times, supplant the traditional congressional legislative history conventionally used by the courts to interpret statutes. In this Article, we examine a novel dataset of judicial opinion citations to presidential signing statements to conduct the most comprehensive empirical examination of how courts have received presidential legislative history to date. Three main findings emerge from this analysis. First, contrary to the pervasive (and legitimate) fears in the literature on signing statements, courts rarely cite signing statements in their decisions. Second, in the aggregate, when courts cite signing statements, they cite them in predictably partisan ways, with judges citing Presidents’ signing statements from their own political parties more often than those of the opposing parties. This effect, however, is driven entirely by the behavior of Republican-appointed appellate jurists. Third, courts predominately employ signing statements to buttress aligned statutory text and conventional sources of legislative history, and seemingly never rely on them to override contrary plain statutory text or even unified traditional legislative history. This suggests that signing statements have low rank among interpretative tools and courts primarily use them to complement rather than substitute for congressional legislative history. In this sense, Presidents have largely failed to establish an alternative corpus of valid interpretive material.
K00|Leçons Sur La Dimension Organisationnelle Du Droit Positif Roumain|Le droit positif est constitué de l’ensemble des normes juridiques effectivement en vigueur dans un État, dans un ensemble d’États (par exemple, L’Union Européenne), ou dans la Communauté internationale à un moment historico-politique donné. En parlant du but du droit positif roumain, il est vrai qu’il ne peut pas être que le but de tous les systèmes de droit positif, celui d’assurer impérativement l’équilibre social, la paix sociale et l’ordre juridique, dans une manière dont chaque législateur entend imposer ce fait, en tenant compte de ses objectifs qui sont réalisés par sa politique législative. Les actes normatifs en vigueur, sont des documents écrits, dont leur contenu est constitué par les normes juridiques, élaborées et approuvées par l’autorité sociale qui réglemente, émet et publie selon certaines règles d’émission et de publication. Les actes normatifs sont rédigés dans la langue du législateur et ensuite sont structurés, selon des règles techniques de structuration et toujours, la structure reçoit une organisation selon des règles spécifiques. Parce que le processus législatif, se déroule sous le signe de certains principes méthodologiques de législation, prévues par la loi et aussi consacré par la doctrine, ces principes ont été présentés et analyses dans ce papier. Un autre problème traité dans cet article, concernant les aspects sur la nécessité et l’importance de la systématisation des actes normatifs, qui naît tout le temps, des impératifs de perfectionnement du droit en vigueur, de sa connaissance plus facile, de son interprétation plus claire et de l’efficacité de son application aux cas concrets.
K00|Economic, Demographic, Deterrent Variables And Crime Rate In India|Crime has plagued society since time immortal. The crime rate in India has been on rise, therefore, it becomes important to study the factors that impact the crime rate. The purpose of the paper is to investigate the relationship between various economic, demographic and deterrent factors and the crime rate in India. The study focuses on the extent of effects of various factors like population density, sex ratio, minority population, poverty, per capita income, no of police personnel and literacy rate on crime registered under IPC1 in all Indian states and major union territories. The study covers the data of all the Indian states and major union territories of period 2011. The findings show that these factors are crucial determinants of the rate of the criminal cases registered in India.
K00|Ganga Action Plan(GAP): The Challenge of ‘Regulatory Quality’|The largest river basin of India, the Ganges (locally referred as Ganga) is one of the most important river systems in the world. It is home to almost one tenth of the world’s population. Billions of litres of sewage, industrial waste, thousands of animal and human corpses are also released into the river every day. Consequently, the Ganga Action Plan (GAP) was launched in 1985 for pollution abatement as a Federal and state sponsored scheme and till date, three phases have been implemented. Even after establishing numerous institutional arrangements under the GAP and investing billions of dollars there has been no major improvement in the Ganges river water quality, in fact it has further deteriorated. Clearly governmental intervention through pollution control policies, specifically regulation has failed miserably. Therefore, an attempt has been made to analyse empirically, the legal and institutional framework of the GAP using the transdisciplinary method ‘economic analysis of law’. The results reveal that the chief underlying reason for ineffective GAP regulations is lack of a well-defined legal basis.

It states the principles while the sunnah of the Prophet provides the details of their application. For example, the Qur'an says: establish salah, observe sawm, pay zakah, take decisions by consultation, do not earn or spend in wrong ways but it does not describe how to do these things. It is the sunnah of the Prophet which gives us the details. The Qur'an is the main book of guidance and the Prophet taught how to follow it. The Prophet not only told us how to follow the guidance, he also practiced it himself. The Qur’an has rules for every aspect of life. It is complete and perfect, and guarantees us success, welfare and peace in this life on earth and in the life after death. For example, arbitrate and et all.
K00|Measurement and Analysis of the Evolution of Institutions in Nigeria|â€œInstitutions matterâ€ has become a generally accepted premise in development economics. The growth and development problems in Nigeria are also common knowledge. To better understand these problems a proper characterization of institutions in Nigeria is essential. Conducting empirical test of the role of institutions in Nigeriaâ€™s growth and development can prove challenging due to lack of institutional data set that span over a long time. In the event that short span data set is available, Glaeser et al. (2004) highlight the many flaws implicit in such measures constructed by political scientists in literature. In this paper, we construct an index of institution quality for the period 1862 through to 2011 for Nigeria, in doing so, we adopt a new method of measuring institutions, which makes use of pre-existing (de jure) legislations, ordinances and constitutions in constructing three institutional indicators; civil and political liberties, freehold property rights, and non-freehold (customary) property rights. These constructed indicators provide a platform for characterization and comprehensive analysis of how institutions haveevolved in Nigeria.
K00|Path Dependence and Interdependence Between Institutions and Development|Path dependence theory, within the institutions context, means that the path of institutions promulgated within a system historically determines the nature of institutions that will ensue within the same system in the present and in the future. The paper makes use of a newly constructed index of institutions quality, and addresses three related questions; the existence of path dependence in institutions, the interdependence and causality between political and economic institutions, and lastly the interdependence between economic development and institutions. In addressing the first question, I use unit root tests to test the hypothesis that institutions promulgated during colonial times still influence institutions promulgated during the post colonial era. I also test for interdependence between institutions in Nigeria using an error correction model in analysing the extent of interdependence between political and economic institutions. Lastly, I test the critical juncture hypothesisâ€”which argues that better institutions lead to economic development and the modernisation hypothesesâ€”which argues that economic development leads to better institutions. The results show support for early path dependence in both political and economic institutions. I also find evidence in support of interdependence running from economic to political institutions. Lastly, there is evidence of a long-run association between institutions and economic development, with the evidence supporting the critical juncture hypothesis, more than the modernisation hypothesis.
K00|The scope of qualified law: comparative analysis|During the last decades, several countries have entrenched a special subcategory of law, which is adopted by stricter procedural rules, than the requirements of the ordinary legislative process. These laws are enacted by qualified majority, by the consent of the two chambers of the legislation, they are subject to mandatory constitutional review before their promulgation, or additional safeguards are implemented in the ordinary legislative process. In my article, I would compare the experiences of three legal systems, France, Spain, and Hungary, which provide three different frameworks of qualified law. Nevertheless, I would provide further examples from Europe , Africa and Latin America to demonstrate better the diversity of legal concepts. My aim is to identify the most contested issues from the legal nature of qualified laws, and to seek the proper solutions of these issues, as well as an ideal model of qualified law.-Firstly, on the ground of different national experiences, I would seek for a broadly acceptable definition of qualified law. -Secondly, I would briefly compare the historical background of the three emerges. An important common point would be the role of qualified laws during any process of democratic transition.-Thirdly, the scope of qualified law differs significantly from country to country, consequently, I would continue with this issue by arguing for a narrower scope of qualified law. -Fourthly, qualified law may have a special position in the hierarchy of norms, somewhere between statutory and the constitutional level, so I would cover this aspect. I would focus on the level of precision of constitutional articles in this regard.-Furthermore, the separation of powers perspective of qualified laws would be taken into consideration: the neglect of two-third majority, and the mandatory a priory review.-As the main outcome, certain points would be highlighted for a potential constitution-drafting process.
K00|Legal improvement on Public-Private Partnership for sustainable development of basic infrastructures in CLMV countries|According to Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity, the cooperation among the member countries leads ASEAN to Highly Competitive Economic Region. Therefore, development of basic infrastructures is one of the key factors for closing the gap and connecting the member countries together. In order to enhance people's quality of life, governments of member countries have a mission to improve basic infrastructures. Especially, the governments in CLMV region (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam), wherein the population of the member countries is almost 170 million people and economic growth rate is 6-8%. Nowadays, investment policies are focusing more on the foreign investors to develop the basic infrastructure, which has resulted in a significant increase in the number of foreign investors in the period of the economic crisis in Asia.The results revealed that to promote a policy significantly, private entities must be encouraged to invest in the government projects. Furthermore, promoting Public-Private Partnership can spur economic growth, resulting in a strong commitment between public and private sectors that will lead to the development in the country. However, the investment laws in the government projects and granting processes are different and constantly amended. Especially, investment patterns and requirements for each member state are vague and there is a lack of the laws for controlling investments of private entities. These problems as stated, thus, affect investors? confidence and incoming of investment funds from local and foreign investors.
K00|A comparative study on the law of remedy system for patent infringement in US and Korea|"The purpose of this presentation is to review the right of patentee put in a statutory form in Korea patent law compared with that of USA and Japan patent law. The focus is a regular patent protect system, especially in criminal suit regarding patent infringement. The IP (?Intellectual Property?) protection should be strengthened as much as possible, rather than impeded, if economies seek to move up the global innovation value chain. And the most effective remedy for damages of patent infringement is the criminal penalties and sanctions for IP rights infringement. That is the reason why the U.S. Chamber International IP Index includes the indicators of ?Criminal standards including minimum imprisonment and minimum fines.? Therefore, comparative analysis of remedy system of US and Korea for the patent infringement is performed. In US, as you see in the statement of ""Except as otherwise provided in this title, whoever without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented invention, within the United States, or imports into the United States any patented invention during the term of the patent therefore infringes the patent"", the definition of the patent infringement is only stated comprehensively and there is no criminal punishment for patent infringement. When the damages are not found by a jury, the court shall assess them. In either event the court may increase the damages up to three times the amount found or assessed. On contrast, in the case of Korean patent infringement claims, both civil and criminal remedies are available. Patent Law enacted in 1961 for patent infringement when penalties are explicitly stipulated increasingly so criminal remedies have been strengthened. In the Patent Act of Korea, Any person who infringes a patent right or exclusive license shall be punished by imprisonment not exceeding seven years or by a fine not exceeding 100 million won. Furthermore, If a representative of a juristic person, or an agent, an employee or any other employed person of a juristic person or individual has committed an offense under Articles 225 (1), 228 or 229 with respect to the duties of the juristic person or individual, not only shall the offender be punished, but also the juristic person shall be punished by a fine under any of the individual shall be punished by a fine referred to in the relevant provisions in Korea, which is named as ?Joint Penal Provisions.?"

K00|Priming Ideology: Why Presidential Elections Affect U.S. Judges|U.S. Presidential elections polarize U.S. Courts of Appeals judges, doubling their dissents, partisan voting, and lawmaking along partisan lines and increasing their reversal of District Court decisions (Berdejo and Chen 2016). Dissents are elevated for ten months before the Presidential elections. I develop a theoretical model showing that the salience of partisan identities drives these behavioral patterns. The polarizing effects are larger in close elections, non-existent in landslide elections, and reversed in wartime elections. I link judges to their states of residence and exploit variation in the timing and importance of a state during the electoral season. Dissents are elevated in swing states and in states that count heavily to winning the election, when these states are competitive. U.S. Senate elections, the timing of which also varies by state, further elevate dissents. I link administrative data on case progression and frequency of campaign advertisements in judges’ states of residence to proxy for a state’s importance during Presidential primaries. Dissents occur shortly before publication, increase with monthly increases in campaign ads, and appear for cases whose legal topic, economic activity, is most heavily covered by campaign ads. Finally, I link the cases to their potential resolution in the Supreme Court. Dissents before elections appear on more marginal cases that cite discretionary miscellaneous issues and procedural (rather than substantive) arguments, which the Supreme Court appears to recognize and only partly remedy. The behavioral changes of unelected Courts of Appeals judges are larger than the behavioral changes of elected judges running for re-election.
K00|Does Empathy Beget Guile? Experimental Evidence|Some theories about the positive impact of markets on morality suggest that competition increases empathy, not between competitors, but between them and third parties. However, empathy may be a necessary evolutionary antecedent to guile, which is when someone knows what the other person wants and intentionally deceives him or her, and deception may have evolved as a means of exploiting empathy. This paper examines how individuals primed for empathy behave towards third parties in a simple economic game of deception. It reports the results of a data entry experiment in an online labor market. Individuals enter data randomized to be a prime for empathy, for guile, or a control. Empathy is then measured using a Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and guile is measured using a simple economic game. Individuals primed for empathy become less deceptive towards third parties. Individuals primed for guile become less likely to perceive that deceiving an individual is unfair in a vignette. These results are robust to a variety of controls and to restricting to workers who entered the prime accurately. These findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis that empathy causes guile and suggests that empathy may cause those who are making judgements to become less deceptive.
K00|Markets, Morality, and Economic Growth: Competition Affects Utilitarian Judgment|Scholars since Hume and Smith have debated possible causal connections between market experiences and moral beliefs. Of particular interest today are questions related to incentive designs: for example, could the structure of employment affect moral attitudes? Here, I study the impact of employment structure on three normative issues: utilitarian versus deontological values, other-regarding preferences, and charitable donations. Through a labor market intermediary, I randomly assigned workers to competitive or piece-rate work conditions. The groups were given a moral question posing a conflict between utilitarian and deontological values, and offered a choice to make a charitable donation. The moral question was accompanied by an illustration that made salient outgroup considerations. Four results emerge: Competitively structured work experiences increased deontological value choices, deontological commitments towards outgroup members, and donations by productive workers relative to non-productive workers; and the effects on deontological value choices differ over economic development. I reconcile these results with a formal model based on experimental findings in affective moral psychology. When competition is perceived as unfair or unfamiliar, negative affect triggers deontological value choices, but when it is perceived as familiar or even fun, positive affect increases utilitarian attitudes. If utilitarian attitudes lead to market-oriented policies, multiple steady states arise where some countries sustain high utilitarianism, market-orientation, and economic growth, and vice versa. This perspective helps explain the intellectual history of the doux commerce thesis.
K00|Ideological Perfectionism|Studying a high-stakes field setting, we examine which individuals, on an ideological scale, conform more to the opinion of others. In the U.S. Courts of Appeals, legal precedents are set by ideologically diverse and randomly composed panels of judges. Using exogenous predictors of ideology and rich voting data we show that ideological disagreements drive dissents against the panel’s decision, but ideologically extreme judges are caving in: they are the least likely to dissent and their voting records are the least correlated with their predicted ideology. Meanwhile, moderately ideological judges are dissenting the most despite evidence that they are more often determining the opinion. Our theoretical analysis shows that these findings are most consistent with a model of decision making in the presence of peer pressure with a concave cost of deviating from one’s ideological convictions – perfectionism. This result presents a critique of a standard assumption in economics – that the cost of deviating from one’s bliss point is convex – with fundamental implications for decision making in social and political settings and for the empirical predictions of theoretical models in these domains.
K00|Priming Ideology: Why Presidential Elections Affect U.S. Judges|U.S. Presidential elections polarize U.S. Courts of Appeals judges, doubling their dissents, partisan voting, and lawmaking along partisan lines and increasing their reversal of District Court decisions (Berdejo and Chen 2016). Dissents are elevated for ten months before the Presidential elections. I develop a theoretical model showing that the salience of partisan identities drives these behavioral patterns. The polarizing effects are larger in close elections, non-existent in landslide elections, and reversed in wartime elections. I link judges to their states of residence and exploit variation in the timing and importance of a state during the electoral season. Dissents are elevated in swing states and in states that count heavily to winning the election, when these states are competitive. U.S. Senate elections, the timing of which also varies by state, further elevate dissents. I link administrative data on case progression and frequency of campaign advertisements in judges’ states of residence to proxy for a state’s importance during Presidential primaries. Dissents occur shortly before publication, increase with monthly increases in campaign ads, and appear for cases whose legal topic, economic activity, is most heavily covered by campaign ads. Finally, I link the cases to their potential resolution in the Supreme Court. Dissents before elections appear on more marginal cases that cite discretionary miscellaneous issues and procedural (rather than substantive) arguments, which the Supreme Court appears to recognize and only partly remedy. The behavioral changes of unelected Courts of Appeals judges are larger than the behavioral changes of elected judges running for re-election.
K00|Does Empathy Beget Guile? Experimental Evidence|Some theories about the positive impact of markets on morality suggest that competition increases empathy, not between competitors, but between them and third parties. However, empathy may be a necessary evolutionary antecedent to guile, which is when someone knows what the other person wants and intentionally deceives him or her, and deception may have evolved as a means of exploiting empathy. This paper examines how individuals primed for empathy behave towards third parties in a simple economic game of deception. It reports the results of a data entry experiment in an online labor market. Individuals enter data randomized to be a prime for empathy, for guile, or a control. Empathy is then measured using a Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and guile is measured using a simple economic game. Individuals primed for empathy become less deceptive towards third parties. Individuals primed for guile become less likely to perceive that deceiving an individual is unfair in a vignette. These results are robust to a variety of controls and to restricting to workers who entered the prime accurately. These findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis that empathy causes guile and suggests that empathy may cause those who are making judgements to become less deceptive.

K00|Sclerotization of the Judiciary: Judicial Exits from the U.S. Courts of Appeals are Politically Motivated|Using data from 1802 to 2004, I show that U.S. Courts of Appeals judges are less likely to retire in each of the three quarters preceding a Presidential election when the party of the President at the time the judge leaves is different from the party of the U.S. President who appointed the judge. Judges are more likely to resign in each of the four quarters after a Presidential election, when the party of the President at the time the judge leaves is the same as the party of the President that appointed the judge. My results suggest that 13% of retirements and 43% of resignations are politically motivated. Previous research has not found political cycles because they relied on judges’ self-reports or conducted yearly rather than quarter-to-election analysis. I also show that these political cycles have increased in recent years, which may raise concerns about the political evolution of the judiciary.
K00|The rule of law: Measurement and deep roots|We propose a new de facto indicator for the rule of law. It is the first such indicator to take the quality of legal norms explicitly into account and not only their enforcement. Using this indicator, we investigate the deep roots of the rule of law. Our findings suggest that, in line with the theoretical literature on long-run economic development, specific determinants of long-run development (such as colonization events and strategies) operate via the rule of law, whereas others (such as the timing of early state formation and the transition from hunter-gatherer to agrarian societies) are not related to the rule of law. We interpret this evidence as supportive of the established notion in the literature that institutions matter for development.
K00|Digitalisierung und europäischer Urheberschutz: Zwischen ökonomischen Herausforderungen und Stakeholder-Interessen|Die fortschreitende Digitalisierung macht Anpassungen des Urheberschutzes erforderlich. Sowohl das Europäische Parlament als auch die Europäische Kommission haben dazu inzwischen Vorschläge vorgelegt. Hintergrund ist, dass die Art, wie kreative Güter produziert und verbreitet werden, durch digitale Technologien und die Verbreitung des Internet stark verändert wurde. Eine Herausforderung, die sich dadurch ergibt, ist die Anwendung des Ursprungslandprinzips und die daraus resultierende Praxis des Geo-Blocking. Eine weitere Herausforderung besteht in Bezug auf die Frage der Weiterveräußerung digitaler Güter. Die einzelnen Stakeholder haben unterschiedliche Interessen bezüglich der Problemfelder. So zeigt sich beispielsweise, dass die Konsumenten (private oder institutionelle Nutzer) ein Interesse an der Weiterveräußerung digitaler Güter haben, die Anbieterseite (Autoren, Verwertungsgesellschaften, Verleger) dieses hingegen nicht hat. Der Parlamentsvorschlag zur Urheberrechtsreform entspricht eher den gewünschten politischen Maßnahmen der Anbieter als denen der Nachfrager. Bei zukünftigen Entscheidungen auf EU-Ebene sollte versucht werden, einen nachvollziehbaren Rechtsrahmen zu schaffen und somit Rechtssicherheit zu erzeugen.
K00|Digitisation and European copyright protection: Between economic challenges and stakeholder interests|The increasing digitisation necessitates amendments to copyright protection. Both the European Parliament and the European Commission have now presented proposals addressing this issue. This is necessary because the way in which creative goods are produced and distributed has been changed dramatically by digital technologies and the spread of the internet. One challenge that arises from this is the application of the Country of Origin principle and the resulting practice of geo-blocking. The resale of digital good represents another challenge in this context. Individual stakeholders have different interests with regard to copyright protection in a digital economy. For example, consumers (private or institutional users) have an interest in the resale of digital goods, whereas suppliers (authors, collecting societies, publishers) do not. The EU Parliament's proposal for copyright reform sides more with the suppliers than with the consumers. Future policy at EU level should attempt to create a clear, comprehensible legal framework and thus establish legal certainty.
K00|State and Development: The Need for a Reappraisal of the Current Literature|This essay tries to bring out some of the complexities that are overlooked in the usual treatment of the state in the institutional economics literature and supplement the latter with a discussion of some alternative approaches to looking at the possible developmental role of the state. It refers to a broader range of development goals (including the structural transformation of the economy) and focuses on problems like the resolution of coordination failures and collective-action problems, the conflicting issues of commitment and accountability and the need for balancing the trade-offs they generate, some ingredients of state capacity and political coalition building usually missed in the literature, the possible importance of rent sharing in a political equilibrium, the advantages and problems of political centralization and decentralization, and the multidimensionality of state functions that may not be addressed by markets or private firms.
K00|Law, Politics and the Quality of Government in Africa|This paper examines interconnections between law, politics and the quality of government in Africa. We investigate whether African democracies enjoy relatively better government quality compared to their counterparts with more autocratic inclinations. The empirical evidence is based on Instrumental variable Two-Stage-Least Squares and Fixed Effects with data from 38 African countries for the period 1994-2010. Political regimes of democracy, polity and autocracy are instrumented with income-levels, legal-origins, religious-dominations and press-freedom to account for government quality dynamics, of corruption-control, government-effectiveness, voice and accountability, political-stability, regulation quality and the rule of law. Findings show that democracy has an edge over autocracy while the latter and polity overlap. As a policy implication, democracy once initiated should be accelerated to edge the appeals of authoritarian regimes.
K00|Bridging the Divide: Measuring Party System Change and Classifying Party Systems|Party systems research has proceeded along two parallel lines of inquiry, one predominantly “qualitative” and the other “quantitative.” This article attempts to bridge this divide in two ways. First, by showing that qualitative information can be valuable in the construction of quantitative measures. Second, by showing that the results from applying theoretically- sensitive measurement tools can be useful for qualitative classification. These analyses are performed using an original dataset of party system changes in Sub-Saharan Africa.

K00|Patents and Innovation in Economic History|A strong tradition in economic history, which relies primarily on qualitative evidence and statistical correlations, has emphasized the importance of patents as a primary driver of innovation. Recent improvements in empirical methodology—through the creation of new datasets and advances in identification—have produced research that challenges this traditional view. The findings of this literature provide a more nuanced view of the effects of intellectual property and suggest that when patent rights have been too broad or too strong, they have actually discouraged innovation. This review summarizes the major results from this research and presents open questions.
K00|The Computerization Of Courts. Implications Of The Judicial Management In The Assessment Of The Transparency And Accesibility Of Legal Services|The modernization and streamlining of judicial management involves major changes in information technology as well, in agrement with the new type of society that has emerged, the information society. Implementation of information technology in the judicial sector should be treated with due importance and considered as a guarantee that such legal services become more effective and efficient, more transparent and more accessible to citizens. The study aims to examine the progress in the field and the changes in judicial management down with the computerization of courts. It is important to investigate whether computerization creates prerequisites only theoretically, or in practice, there is a growing perception of the litigants towards the transparency and accessibility of the judiciary. Meanwhile, the study aims at identifying other important matters, besides computerization of court, that could influence the accessibility and transparency of judicial services.

K00|The Emergence of the Global Fintech Market: Economic and Technological Determinants|We investigate the economic and technological determinants inducing entrepreneurs to establish ventures with the purpose of reinventing financial technology (fintech). We find that countries witness more fintech startup formations when the economy is well-developed and venture capital is readily available. Furthermore, the number of secure Internet servers, mobile telephone subscriptions, and the available labor force have a positive impact on the development of this new market segment. Finally, the more difficult it is for companies to access loans, the higher is the number of fintech startups in a country. Overall, the evidence suggests that fintech startup formation need not be left to chance, but active policies can influence the emergence of this new sector.
K00|Dial 911 for Murder: The Impact of Emergency Response Time on Homicides|Several theories have been offered to explain the recent declines in violent crime rates in the United States. We hypothesize that technological innovations, which improved information transmission and shortened the response time between an aggravated assault incident and treatment, reduced the cost of saving lives and caused much of the decline in homicide rates in recent decades. Using difference-in-differences and event studies, we show that improvements in emergency services (9-1-1) caused significant decreases in homicide rates. Various falsification tests support these findings.
K00|Habitantes de calle, seguridad y adicción: Opciones Jurídicas con sustento médico|Los habitantes de calle son, en su mayoría, consumidores de sustancias psicoactivas y enfrentan riesgo de salud excepcionalmente altos; muchos de ellos son víctimas frecuentes de varios delitos y algunos cometen delitos de manera regular. En este orden de ideas, es responsabilidad del Estado proveer servicios de salud e intervenir para reducir los delitos asociados con esta minoría. En este contexto, se plantean dos opciones de política: la interdicción e internación en centros especializados y la terapia de reducción de daños. A partir de la evidencia empírica proveniente de la medicina y la psicología y de acuerdo con la jurisprudencia de la Corte Constitucional, se concluye que la interdicción no es una alternativa jurídicamente viable y, de acuerdo con la evidencia disponible se deben implementar acciones de reducción de daños.
K00|¿Justicia territorial? Propuesta metodológica para abordar el desafío en materia de justicia, del gobierno nacional en el territorio colombiano|La coyuntura política colombiana; así como, algunos instrumentos tradicionales de política pública, han reivindicado el rol de la Justicia como eje fundamental para la construcción de un estado social de derecho y, han centrado la atención en la necesidad de conocer y reconocer las dinámicas de los territorios colombianos para la construcción de un país en Paz. A través de la revisión de diferentes aproximaciones conceptuales, teóricas y metodológicas, en este artículo se presenta una propuesta de método, cualitativo y cuantitativo, para empezar a abordar el desafío del gobierno nacional de acercar efectivamente la justicia a los territorios, no como una estrategia impuesta del nivel central, sino como un proceso constructivo entre la Nación y el territorio, comprendiendo este último no solo desde la mirada de sus administradores, sino desde las relaciones entre los diversos actores que lo habitan.
K00|Institutional and legal conditions for the German stabilization policy during the economic crisis 2008–2009|Motivation: The economic crisis of 2008–2009 and its consequences have raised a debate among economists concerning the effectiveness of methods stabilizing economy arising from the recommendations of economic theories forming the mainstream economy. Results: The necessity to take anti-crisis measures in the countries affected by it resumed the interest in the recommendations proposed within this realm by John Maynard Keynes. Keynesian solutions have been globally adopted as a basis for anti-crisis stabilization policy. In economic policy it has been manifested primarily as the increased government intervention in economy via the increase of costs and enlarged budget deficits. One of the countries that have applied such a solution was the Federal Republic of Germany. Aim: The aim of this article is presenting the institutional and legal means of German stabilization policy as well as attempting to evaluate their effectiveness in restoring macroeconomic balance in Germany. In this regard, Keynesian Act to Promote Economic Stability and Growth, passed in 1967, which enabled using the appropriate remedial measures was addressed in detail.
K00|Memorandum: On the Ethical and Legal Issues Arising from the Appointment of the Former President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso As Non-Executive Chairman and Director of Goldman Sachs International|This Memorandum to the European Commission presents our professional opinion on the legal and ethical issues arising from the appointment of the former President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso as non-executive chairman and director of Goldman Sachs. We identify a number of flaws of the Opinion of the Ad Hoc Ethical Committee which considered the issue and offer our own analysis of applicable law and the action the Commission is required to take. In our view, the Opinion represents a case of maladministration, on the ground of which it should have been set aside by the Commission in unequivocal terms. On our own analysis, Mr. Barroso’s acceptance of his new appointment was ethically inappropriate and, therefore, a violation of TFEU. Further we argue that the Commission has powers to take remedial action and is legally obliged to act to enforce the EU law and to protect the interests of the EU and its reputation. We show that, contrary to most comments in the media, the expiry of the eighteen months ‘cooling-off’ period does not put Mr. Barroso on the right side of the law, and does not preclude the obligation of the Commission to take remedial action.
K00|Evaluation of the Quality of Governance in African Countries using Aggregate Indicators|The paper focuses on evaluation of the quality of governance in 53 African countries. The quality of governance is evaluated using factors such as government effectiveness, control of corruption, rule of law, which are monitored in each African country individually for the period between 2004 and 2010. In order to assess the quality of governance as well as the relative position of each African country, the ratio aggregation method was used in its simple form. The results of the analysis show substantial disparities among African countries. Somalia, Zimbabwe and Equatorial Guinea reach the worst results, with considerably high levels of corruption. The results of the analysis of each country are presented using a coloured map of Africa.
K00|On the influence of Magna Carta and other cultural relics|Magna Carta’s status as a touchstone of modern thinking about the rule of law rests on several well-known myths. This article evaluates the influence of Magna Carta on modern constitutions, both in terms of formation as well as content. The analysis confirms that Magna Carta’s relevance is, if anything, on the rise, even if the causal chains linking it to current developments are weak-linked and distant. We speculate on the mysterious processes that produce influence among legal texts, arguing that champions and empire are crucial factors in the case of Magna Carta.
K00|The association between corporate general counsel and firm credit risk|This paper examines whether bond market participants alter their credit risk assessments of firms that appoint the corporate general counsel (GC) to senior management. GCs may place less emphasis on their gatekeeping responsibilities upon appointment to senior management, thus potentially resulting in increased firm credit risk. Using changes in firm-level credit ratings and credit default swap spreads to proxy for changes in credit risk, we find a positive association between GC promotions to senior management and increases in firm credit risk. Additionally, the increased personal liability for GCs under the Sarbanes–Oxley Act only partially mitigates this association.
K00|The visible hand: the role of government in China’s long-awaited industrial revolution| China is undergoing its long-awaited industrial revolution. There is no shortage of commentary and opinion on this dramatic period, but few have attempted to provide a coherent, in-depth, political-economic framework that explains the fundamental mechanisms behind China’s rapid industrialization. This article reviews the Embryonic Economic Development theory put forth by Wen (2016a). This article reviews the Embryonic Economic Development theory put forth by Wen . It illuminates the critical sequence of developmental stages since the reforms enacted by Deng Xiaoping in 1978: namely, small-scale commercialized agricultural production, proto-industrialization in the countryside, a formal industrial revolution based on mass production of labor-intensive light consumer goods, a sustainable ‘industrial trinity’ boom in energy/motive power/infrastructure, and a second industrial revolution involving the mass production of heavy industrial goods. This developmental sequence follows essentially the same pattern as Great Britain’s Industrial Revolution, despite sharp differences in political and institutional conditions. One of the key conclusions exemplified by China’s economic rise is that the extent of industrialization is limited by the extent of the market. One of the key strategies behind the creation and nurturing of a continually growing market in China is based on this premise: The free market is a public good that is very costly for nations to create and support. Market creation requires a powerful ‘mercantilist’ state and the correct sequence of developmental stages; China has been successfully accomplishing its industrialization through these stages, backed by measured, targeted reforms and direct participation from its central and local governments.

The federal form of the Russian government requires the analysis of regional experience for the further development of RIA procedure.
K00|Crime Concentration and Hot Spot Dynamics in Latin America|"Latin America and the Caribbean is the most violent region in the world, with an annual homicide rate of more than 20 per 100,000 population and with an increasing trend. Yet most evidence of crime concentration, geo-temporal patterns, and event dependence comes from cities in high-income countries. Understanding crime patterns in the region and how they compare to those in high-income countries is of first-order importance to formulate crime reduction policies. This paper is the first to analyze crime patterns of cities in five Latin American countries. Using micro-geographic units of analysis, the paper finds, first, that crime in Latin America is highly concentrated in a small proportion of blocks: 50 percent of crimes are concentrated in 3 to 7.5 percent of street segments, and 25 percent of crimes are concentrated in 0.5 to 2.9 percent of street segments. This validates Weisburd's ""law of crime concentration at place"" (Weisburd, 2105). These figures are fairly constant over time but sensitive to major police reforms. The second finding is that hot spots of crime are not always persistent. Crime is constantly prevalent in certain areas, but in other areas hot spots either appear or disappear, suggesting a possible rational adaptation from criminals to police actions that cause crime displacement in the medium run to other areas. Finally, the paper finds a significant pattern of repeated crime victimization in location and time for property crimes. There are striking similarities with the developed world in crime concentration, although crime levels are much higher and usually increasing. There are also some differences in terms of the persistence of hot spots that pose interesting policy implications and avenues for future research."

K00|Frisky business: race, gender and police activity during traffic stops|Since the United States Supreme Court laid the foundation for “stop-and-frisk” activity by police departments, a substantial amount of research has explored the behavior of police departments, particularly with respect to race. But previous work rarely focuses on the individual’s probability of receiving a frisk. By exploiting a traffic stop-level dataset from the Pittsburgh Police Department, the marginal effects of assorted driver characteristics are estimated. While the broad characterization of African-American drivers being more likely to receive a frisk remains accurate, several related factors are identified that create a more nuanced picture of a driver’s probability of being frisked. The interaction of the gender of the driver, the time of day of the traffic stop, and the existence of passengers in the stopped vehicle with the race of the driver all impact the probability of receiving a frisk.

K00|Aspects of Legal Translation in Contracts of Carriage|This article analyzes several aspects of the maritime law vocabulary, in order to overcome the problem of maritime inaccuracies in translation and to contribute to the better understanding and translation of texts and legislations within this field. The first section of this article deals with several key terms and issues in the field of legal translation and maritime language and highlights the fact that maritime language represents a functional variety of register. The second section presents the corpus analyzed within this paper in order to reveal the language variation in the two languages (i.e. Romanian and English) and to assess their lexical density. The third section is focused on corpus analysis, highlighting the language variation in the English and Romanian translation of the chosen texts from the field of contracts of carriage in maritime law.

Firstly, this paper briefly tackles severalgeneral elements related to the translation process, such as the definition of translation, thedifference between general and specialized translation, translation methods and techniques. Thesecond part of our study is focused on the difficulties triggered by the specialized translation fromthe field of textile manufacture and industry. For the purpose of our analysis, we tackled the issuesraised by the application of several direct translation techniques, such as, borrowing, calque, andliteral translation, described in the first part of the study.
K00|Nonprofit Organizations In The Italian Health System: Emerging Needs And Value Of Human Capital|In the Italian experience the nonprofit system represents a wide and diversified realm. Strongly rooted in the economic, social and political Italian eco-system, nonprofit organizations appear relevant mainly in the health sector, through innovative forms of partnership and co-production of essential and also new services. The growing need to limit public expenditure, dramatically present in hospitals and health institutions, leads to the extensive search for effective and innovative channels proving able to satisfy the emerging needs of patients. The aim of this study is to carry out an analytical and critical exploration of the state of the art of the Italian nonprofit system in the light of the outcomes of Ninth General Census of Industry reported by ISTAT- Italian National Institute of Statistics in 2014. The results obtained show that the major growth trends related to involvement of nonprofit in health system were recorded between 1991 and 2010. These are the years when the process of downsizing of the general system of public welfare started, along with the earliest attempts to reduce health spending. These organizations appear to be the effective response to problems which the public sector does not have a strong interest to act for, and they also provide suitable professional profiles for Healthcare.
K00|The Lawyer - Between The Statute Of Liberal Profession And The Normative Limitations|: It is too simplistic to say that, traditionally, the legal profession is placed within the “free” or “liberal” professions, exercised solely based on an inherent statute and without “a chief”. Normative, statutory or deontological limitations have been outlined even from the moment the lawyer started to impose as a law practitioner. In Romania, the legal profession enjoys a certain tradition, and acquired professional status starting with 1864. Currently, the core legislation consists of the Law no. 51/1995 on the organization and practice of the lawyer profession, with the subsequent amendments and supplements, the Statute of profession, approved by Decision no. 64 of 2011 of the National Association of Romanian Bars with the subsequent amendments and the Lawyers’ Code of Ethics in the European Union adopted in the plenary session on 28 October 1998 and subsequently amended in the plenary sessions of the Council of Bars and Law Societies of European (CCBE) on 28 November 1998, 6 December 2002 and 19 May 2006. The delineation of the current statute of the lawyers’ profession is circumscribed, whether we like it or not, by other regulatory texts such as the Fiscal Code and the Fiscal Procedure Code, the Civil Code and the Civil Procedure Code, even the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code etc. This article contains an overview of the current statute of the legal profession, the way it is outlined (or “influenced”) by regulations (statutory or normative), but also by the Constitutional Court of Romania case law.
K00|The Freedom of the Prices: Hayek's Road to Serfdom Reassessed|Recent debate has centered around the contemporary relevance and even the original validity of F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom. Was it directed against command socialism only or against welfare-state interventionism as well? Should the book even be read anymore? This essay takes a step back from the dichotomy between socialism and interventionism and explores two specific ideas of Hayek's which deserve renewed attention: first, his claim that economic liberty is the fundamental liberty and that political liberty is merely secondary in value. Second, Hayek's conception of the rule-of-law, which has implications for contemporary command-and-control regulation. Furthermore, that Hayek's philosophical conception of the rule-of-law in the Road to Serfdom is related to his economic theory of prices in “The Use of Knowledge in Society.” While Hayek's specific target in the Road to Serfdom was command socialism, his book embodied arguments which are more widely applicable and relevant today.
K00|Plague, Politics, and Pogroms: The Black Death, the Rule of Law, and the Persecution of Jews in the Holy Roman Empire|This paper explores the institutional determinants of persecution by studying the intensity of the Black Death pogroms in the Holy Roman Empire. We provide evidence that communities governed by archbishoprics, bishoprics, and imperial free cities experienced more intense and violent persecutions than did those governed by the emperor. We suggest that political fragmentation exacerbated competition for the rents generated by Jewish moneylending, which made Jews more vulnerable during periods of crisis.

Political regimes of democracy, polity and autocracy are instrumented with income-levels, legal-origins, religious-dominations and press-freedom to account for government quality dynamics, of corruption-control, government-effectiveness, voice and accountability, political-stability, regulation quality and the rule of law. Findings show that democracy has an edge over autocracy while the latter and polity overlap. As a policy implication, democracy once initiated should be accelerated to edge the appeals of authoritarian regimes.
K00|The Determinants of India’s Imports: A Gravity Model Approach|In order to understand the India’s import trade with its partners, this paper applies the generalized gravity model to analyse the import structure by employing the panel data estimation technique. The results portray that India’s imports are determined by the inflation rates, per capita income differentials and the overall openness of the countries involved in trade. It has been also found out that imports are influenced to a great degree by the common border, as the case is between India, China and Bangladesh. Furthermore, the country precise effects describe that the sway of neighbouring countries is more than that of distant countries on India’s imports.
K00|Universal Economic Plan Based Law Constitutions of Kingdom and Nations|In this work, touched on some social issues whatever the result, and a raising awareness was aimed by some new technological upgrades for vital infrastructures of states, social order and economic plan. The main aim is one world order which has no king and accepts nations as local governances as a requirement of hierarchical order. It is completely based on economic benefits of all nations as there is no alternative to establish a healthy economic order as economic management is directly related with laws. As the important is a law exists or not, or is just or not for justice, also it encourages to develop organic laws in state institutions as it recognizes any state institution as autonomous. This building is a building which is actually dependent of economy, counts states of the world as local governances as a requirement of one world order; does not stipulate working and military service; promises that no charge for houses, energy, education, judgment, security, health care, public transport, marriage; promises removing armies limited manner, removing nuclear weapons and establishing in space but the special conditions. Also there are many new technological upgrades for vital infrastructure of states, space technologies are included as well.
K00|Law, Coercion And Socioeconomic Equilibrium|This paper investigates the economic conditions under which the performance of a Judiciary does not impede non-coercive fair socioeconomic allocations under “Strotz-myopia” regarding the law variable, i.e. under a static view of it in an otherwise dynamic context. The law, here, is the positive factor by which consumption volume is multiplied as a result of law introduction in an otherwise fully private social economy. Lexicographic preferences regarding the law is the keyword in establishing non-coercive equilibria either in the static context of a stone-age economy or in the dynamic context of a jungle economy, given in the latter the presence of farsightedness. Nevertheless, such equilibria are found here to exist even under myopia and regardless the presence of lexicographic preferences. We first detect them within a fully private social economy, and we next qualify them by introducing the Judiciary as state officials. The optimality regarding state finances imposes additional restrictions in establishing myopic non-coercive equilibria. In any case, an equilibrium will be stable if it is not influenced by the homotheticity or not of the preferences, i.e. by income distribution considerations. So, any suboptimal behaviour of the Judiciary should be attributed exclusively to the suboptimality of state finances: Macroeconomics does affect law administration.
K00|Forms of Manifestation regarding Tax Evasion: New Approaches|Tax evasion has existed, exists and will exist as long as the state and the tax will continue to exist, but the forms and ways of achievement are perfectly in time. In terms of how can be committed, the ratio that exists between this phenomenon and the current legislation, tax evasion, there are two manifestations: the lawful tax avoidance (performed at the shelter law); unlawful tax evasion (fraudulent) or fraud. In terms of space can be identified: tax evasion and tax avoidance at national and international level. In recent years circumvention actions are transferred, increasingly more inside from national tax systems across state borders, action driven by trends economic globalization, political and social.
K00|The manager and the stress in subordinates view inside of criminal prosecution institutions|In the case of institutions we can talk about a specific type of stress – institutional stress. Inside the groups it reveals a kind of consequences of dysfunctional conflicts determinated by professional stress: changes within the group, increasing group unity, the risk of an authoritarian leader, focus on group work and tasks, loyalty amplification. The manager and the subordinate live and work together; that is why, they need to know their mutual needs and interests. Knowing each other is at the origin of working group existence. A permanent coordinated interpersonal manager – subordinate relationship, in the manager’s view, is the staff appreciation, establishing and directing prosecution authority professional perspective. To be effective, a manager needs to know as accurately as possible his own leading personality, especially the way it is percived by subordinates, to determine personality and expectations of all factors he interacts with, and thus, to use the appropriate leadership style situation. To obtain good results,it is necessary to know subordinates, which is a complex of actions initiated and carried out by managers designed to contribute to the scientific organization of the instructive – educational process, the efficient use of the full potential of subordinates. How to reduce stress - a healthy lifestyle,balanced food, relaxing in nature, more sports, recognition of limits, removing dark thoughts, group memberships must be optimistic. The displeasure of group members should not be interpreted as necessarily unfavorable. In the work group, the relationship between manager and subordinate should not rely on command and obedience, but on dialogue, which can sometimes mean reciprocal positions. This kind of dialogue is called request and answer relationship.
K00|Managerial communication within the institution of criminal prosecution|Management communication is a form of interpersonal communication, a management tool with which the manager may exercise specific tasks: planning, training, organization, coordination, control, evaluation. Communication management is an auxiliary of management, which puts into circulation information about the result of decisions, which return to the center of decision, making it possible to match the execution with the objectives and the results with planification. Communication management of the institution is subject to specific ethical rules, which is found in the institutional culture, in the institutional policy and in managers’ individual ethics. The purpose of managerial communication is that of achieving correct information, efficient and effective both vertically and horizontally, in order to achieve internal and external requirements consistent with established management and institutional objectives in optimal conditions. There are several types of roles that can be fulfilled by manager: interpersonal, informational and decisional roles. Understanding and knowing management functions through communication is a major premise for deciphering mechanisms of any institution structures. Due to the complementarity established between management functions, the existence of interdependencies among themselves and between them and communication, the latter occupies a central place in the management system of any institution. Any manager of a institution communicates aiming at achieving specific goals. At the level of internal organization of any institution, the information must reach the right destination (department, directorate, office, member of the group) and the most important thing, it should be transmitted in time. If the information is delayed, if it does not arrive at the right time it loses its value. Communication between manager and subordinate is a key element in vertical communication downward or ascending in institutions. Ideally, this exchange should give the manager the opportunity to direct subordinates to perform the tasks properly, to clarify the reward context and provide social and emotional support. At the same time, it should allow subordinates to ask questions about their work roles and make proposals to allow optimal realization of goals through plans and policies within that institution.
K00|Council Of Europe, European Council, Council Of The European Union -Conceptual And Institutional Distinctions|We shall analyse throughout this article the structure and mechanisms of the Council of Europe, European Council and Council of the European Union, the goal being identifying the characteristics and distinctions between these entities, given their statutes and different roles, without claiming we hereby exhaust this subject, not infrequently brought to public communication space. The first and most important distinction between the Council of Europe, on the one hand and the European Council and the Council of the European Union, on the other hand, is that, while the Council of Europe is an international organisation, the European Council and Council of the European Union are EU institutions in turn considered to be an international super-state organisation with a sui generis construction. As citizens of Romania, a member of both the Council of Europe and of the European Union, we have the right and duty to know the meaning of these terms, to understand correctly messages on the subject addressed to public opinion, but also to be able to adequately express ourselves in the internal, European or international public space, as appropriate.
K00|Writing-Down Debt with Heterogeneous Creditors: Lock Laws and Late Swaps|The presence of “holdouts” in recent sovereign debt swaps poses a challenge to bargaining models which assume all creditors to be homogeneous. We modify the Rubinstein “alternating offers” framework so as to accommodate exogenous creditor heterogeneity – specifically holdouts more patient than other bondholders. The “second best” equilibrium derived is an initial offer and an associated “lock-law” sufficient to tempt impatient creditors into a prompt bond exchange. This is followed by a delayed, but more generous, swap with the patient creditors, timed to take place when the lock-law expires. In practice, however, the presence of holdouts may be endogenous: they may be late-comers who buy distressed bonds with a view to litigating for the full face value plus their costs of waiting. Provisions for protecting other bond holders from the negative externality caused by such tactics are briefly discussed. However, where the judge has mandated good faith bargaining with holdout creditors, the bargaining outcome we derive may be useful to indicate a basis for compromise.
K00|Bad Boys: How Criminal Identity Salience Affects Rule Violation|We conducted an experiment with 182 inmates from a maximum security prison to analyze the impact of criminal identity salience on cheating. The results show that inmates cheat more when we exogenously render their criminal identity more salient. This effect is specific to individuals who have a criminal identity, because an additional placebo experiment shows that regular citizens do not become more dishonest in response to crime-related reminders. Moreover, our experimental measure of cheating correlates with inmates' offences against in-prison regulation. Together, these findings suggest that criminal identity salience plays a crucial role in rule violating behaviour.
K00|The L&E of Intellectual Property – Do we get maximum innovation with the current regime?|Innovation is crucial to economic growth – the essential path for lifting much of the world population out of dire poverty and for maintaining the living standard of those who already have. To stimulate innovation, the legal system has to support the means through which innovators seek to get rewarded for their efforts and risks taken. Amongst these means, some, such as the first mover advantage or 'lead time,' are not directly legal; but secrets and intellectual property rights are legal institutions supported for the specific purpose of stimulating innovation. Whilst the protection of secrets has not changed very much over recent years, intellectual property (or IP) has. IP borrows some features from ordinary property rights, but is also distinct, in that, unlike physical goods, information, the object of IP, is not inherently scarce; indeed as information and communication technologies expand, the creation and distribution of information is becoming ever cheaper and in many circumstances abundant, so that selection is of the essence ('on the internet, point of view is everything'). New information builds on already existing information. Where rights on information extend too far, their monopolising effect may hamper innovation. The paper investigates the underlying structure of IP rights and surveys what we know empirically about the incentive effects of IP as about industries that flourish without formal IP. L'innovation est essentielle à la croissance économique, elle-même la voie obligée pour faire sortir une grande partie de la population mondiale de la misère et pour maintenir le niveau de vie des personnes qui en sont déjà sorties. Pour stimuler l'innovation, le système juridique doit soutenir les moyens par lesquels les innovateurs cherchent rémunération de leurs efforts et des risques pris. Parmi ceux-ci, certains comme l'« avance de départ » ne sont pas directement juridiques; mais le secret commercial et la propriété intellectuelle sont des institutions juridiques soutenues dans le but précis de stimuler l'innovation. Alors que la protection des secrets n'a pas beaucoup évolué au cours des ans, la propriété intellectuelle (PI) l'a bien. La propriété intellectuelle emprunte certains traits de la propriété classique des biens matériels, mais est aussi distincte, en ce que, contrairement aux biens matériels, l'information – l'objet de la PI – n'est pas par nature rare ; en fait, à mesure que les technologies de l'information et des communications s'étendent, la création et la distribution de l'information devient toujours moins chère. Dans certains cas, l'information devient même abondante à telle enseigne que la sélection et essentielle ('on the internet, point of view is everything'). L'information nouvelle s'appuie sur de l'information déjà disponible. Là où les droits sur l'information, et notamment la PI, s'étendent trop loin, leurs effets monopolisateurs risquent d'interférer avec l'innovation. Le texte examine la structure sous-jacente des droits de propriété intellectuelle et fait un survol de ce que nous savons de manière « empirique » sur les effets incitatifs de la PI de même que des industries qui prospèrent sans droit de propriété intellectuelle formel.
K00|The importance of law and economics in the contemporary economic reality|The law and economics movement can improve the functioning of companies doing business in the contemporary, rapidly changing, reality. The tensions between the idea of efficiency and the idea of justice cause difficulties in the application of tools which are proposed by the representatives of the law and economics movement in legal solutions. Economics proposes a new, fresh look at the law, which makes it easier to assess and influence the growth of its transparency. Perspective can therefore be useful for subjects who create and use the existing regulations.
K00|Reelección Presidencial Inmediata Como Mecanismo De Rendición De Cuentas|Varios países latinoamericanos han experimentado recientemente cambios constitucionales con respecto a las posibilidades de reelección de sus presidentes. En este trabajo usamos un modeo de economomía política para investigar las condiciones bajo las cuales la reelección presidencial inmediata funciona como un mecanismo de rendición de cuentas en democracias caracteri- zadas por un fuerte presidencialismo. El modelo inluye la presencia de un juez constitucional como mecanismo de solución al problema de agencia entre los ciudadanos y el presidente a saber, que los ciudadanos no observan directamente las acciones del presidente. Encontramos como resultado que la e cacia de la reelección inmediata depende principalmente de la independencia que conserve el supervisor frente al presi- dente y la tasa de descuento por rentas futuras que este último tiene.
K00|The Emergence of Law and Behavioural Science: A European Perspective|Nudge and the Law explores the legal implications of the emergent phenomenon of behaviourally informed intervention. It focuses on the challenges and opportunities it may offer to the policymaking of the European Union. This dual focus on law and on Europe characterises our endeavour. This volume has been structured by taking as a point of the departure the current nudging debate, which mainly comprises two strands of enquiry: when is it legitimate for States to use psychology to inform policy? (the legitimacy debate) and, to the extent that it is legitimate, how can behavioural insights in practice be incorporated into the decision making processes? (the practicability debate). Against this backdrop we brought together scholars who could analyse what behavioural insights might bring to EU law, both at a horizontal level and at a sectoral level. This volume endeavours to present the results of their research in a manner that is accessible both to EU law specialists who are not yet familiar with behavioural sciences and to behavioural lawyers who are not specialists in EU law.
K00|Public Interest, Procedural and Discursive Limitations|"We discuss in this paper the ambiguity of the journalistic key-concept, ""public interest"". We present a few scientifically approaches and we analyse the very comfortable misunderstanding cultivated not only by the press, but also by politicians and other social actors. This theoretical concept is in relation with another key-concept, ""the state secret"" and this is the most frequent and abusive, answer that the politician use for reject the press questions. As case study, we analyse the relation between Romanian president and prime-minister with the media."
K00|Wrongful convictions and the punishment of attempts|This article presents economic models of law enforcement where the punishment of attempts leads to an increased risk of wrongful convictions. Consideration of these risks weakens the case for punishing attempts. Specifically, attempts ought to be punished less frequently than suggested in previous literature, and even when the punishment of attempts is desirable, they typically ought to be punished less severely than accomplished crimes. Purely deterrence related rationales as well as rationales based on costs associated with wrongful convictions support this conclusion. The presence of wrongful conviction costs also implies that a degree of under-deterrence is optimal and that incomplete attempts ought to typically be punished less severely than complete attempts.
K00|Factors underlying short sales|The short sale process has emerged as the most common alternative to the traditional foreclosure process in the recent mortgage crisis. This paper examines the factors that affect the liquidation outcome between these two ways of disposing the housing asset. We find that better quality borrowers such as those with higher credit scores and with full documentation status are more likely to prefer and obtain approval of short sales, involvement of mortgage insurance firms and second lien holders reduces short sales, and that state foreclosure laws such as longer foreclosure delay and the statutory right of redemption reduce short sales. The results have implications for ostensibly borrower-friendly measures promoted by governmental entities.
K00|Injustice: Revealing Human Rights Issues in Ali Akbar Navis's Short Fiction|Ali Akbar Navis was among satirical writers in Indonesian literature. He was concerned about what his nation had struggled with its democratization process. Navis's works are generally his responses to what was directly going on around him. They mostly represent his concerns about sociopolitical problems, which were significant at the time, he wrote them. They serve for Navis as a tool to protest against injustice and a way of communicating his disagreement with any elements that violate such rights, including the government. This study elucidates what sociopolitical events he disagrees and how he delivers his disagreement.
K00|Psycho Education Program for Prevention of Test Anxiety on 8th Grade Students to Reduce Anxiety and Indecisiveness|This study aims to investigate the effect of psycho-education program on reducing the test anxiety and personal indecisiveness. The study was carried out with a group of ten 8th class volunteer students whose test anxiety scores were high. The test anxiety which is one of the study's variables was tested with Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI) that is adapted to Turkish by Ã–ner (1990). Besides, Personal Indecisiveness Scale (PIS) that was developed by Bacanl? (2000) was applied. The Psyco-education Program to the group was applied in 7 sessions. The study is semi-experimental and depended on pre-test, last-test model. Wilcoxon's signed rank test was used to analyze data and . 05 significancy level was used as criteria in interpreting results. As a result, it was observed that psycho-education program to 8th class students is effective on reducing: the test anxiety scores of students; personal indecisiveness; (implicitly) social anxiety and increasing self-reliance.
K00|Doğrudan Etki Ve Öncelik İlkeleri Çerçevesinde Avrupa Birliği Adalet Divanı Kararları Ve İktisadi Liberalizm|Avrupa Birliği’nde iç pazarın kurumsal olarak tesisi, Avrupa Birliği Adalet Divanı’nın (ABAD) içtihadi kararlarıyla ilerlerken; Avrupa Birliği hukuku ve bununla ilişkili Avrupa bütünleşmesi de iç pazar bütünleşmesinde ortaya çıkan problemlerin çözümüyle mesafe kat etmiştir. Bugün Avrupa Birliği’ni benzer bütünleşme girişimlerinden ayrı bir seviyede başarılı kılan, onun kurumsal ve hatta düşünsel olarak “supranasyonel” bir niteliğe sahip olmasıdır. Supranasyonellik kavramının yerleştiği temel, asıl olarak AB hukukunun ulusal hukuklar karşısındaki “üstünlüğü”dür (supremacy). AB hukukunu birliğin kurumsal varlığı bakımından üstün, yani öncelikli (primacy) kılan ve böylece Avrupa ekonomik bütünleşmesinden hareketle Avrupa Birliği’ni kuran ilkeler, iç pazarın işleyişinde ortaya çıkan problemlerin hukuki yönden çözüme kavuşturulmasıyla doğmuştur. AB hukuku ve AB iç Pazar bütünleşmesi arasındaki karşılıklı etkileşimle beraber, bu çalışmaya gerekli bakış açısını sağlayan ikinci hareket noktası, Liberalizm ve onun Avrupa üzerinde kurduğu kalıcı iktidardır. İktisadi liberalizmin -felsefi bir yaklaşım olarak nitelendirilebilecek- varlığı ele alış biçimi ve siyasal, ekonomik, sosyal problemleri çözümleme yöntemi de aynı iktidara dahildir. Söz konusu metodolojik karakterin yansıması Avrupa Birliği içerisinde hemen her alanda görülebilir. Bu etkinin sonuçlarını AB hukukunun kaynaklarından olan ABAD kararları üzerinden de takip etmek mümkündür. Bireylerin temel haklarına ve bu hakların korunmasında bireylerin kuvvetli rolüne atıflar yapan ABAD’ın 1963 Van Gend en Loos ve 1964 Costa v E.N.E.L kararlarıyla AB hukuku içerisinde “doğrudan etki” ve “öncelik” ilkeleri ortaya çıkmıştır. Söz konusu iki ABAD kararının dayandığı içtihatlara dikkat edilirse, AB hukuku ve AB iç pazarını kuran liberal piyasa yaklaşımı arasındaki ilişkinin pratik boyutuyla beraber, felsefi ve teorik boyutta da mevcut olduğu görülecektir.
K00|Another “French paradox”: explaining why interest rates to microenterprises did not increase with the change in French usury legislation|Conventional wisdom indicates that the growth of credit may not materialize if credit rates remain capped by usury laws, as had long been the case in France. France therefore abolished usury ceilings on loans to microenterprise in an effort to increase financing for microentrepreneurs. This should have led to an increase in interest rates and increase in microcredit. However, we do not find any increase in interest rates and this is therefore a paradox. The paper provides a brief literature review and the salient features of the legislative changes in France. It follows this up with a presentation of interest rate movements. The discussion of possible explanations of the paradox includes classical market analysis (global interest rates, money supply, and competition), behavioral and institutional analysis (guarantees, Basel II and risk taking, legal concept of abusive support, protection for over-indebtedness, information asymmetry and limited liability) and softer institutional reasons (religion, risk-taking culture).

K00|The institutional determinants of private equity involvement in business groups—The case of Africa|This study examines the governance attributes of post-IPO (initial public offering) retained ownership of private equity in business group constituent firms in contrast to their unaffiliated counterparts, in 202 newly listed firms in 22 emerging African economies. We adopt an actor centered institutional-theoretic perspective in rationalizing institutional voids and the advantages of maintained governance by both business angels (BA) and venture capital (VC) private equity. Our findings reveal private equity retain higher post-IPO ownership in business group constituents compared to unaffiliated firms and that this is inversely moderated in the context of improving institutional quality – where this is particularly strong in case of foreign VC as opposed to domestic VC or BA. Our result adds to the literature on multifocal corporate governance mechanisms and the institutional determinants of private equity investment.
K00|Is Legal Pot Crippling Mexican Drug Trafficking Organizations? The Effect of Medical Marijuana Laws on US Crime|We examine the effect of medical marijuana laws (MML) on crime treating the introduction of MML as a quasi-experiment and using three different data sources. First, using data from the Uniform Crime Reports, we find that violent crimes such as homicides and robberies decrease in states that border Mexico after MML are introduced. Second, using Supplementary Homicide Reports' data we show that for homicides the decrease is the result of a drop in drug-law and juvenile-gang related homicides. Lastly, using STRIDE data, we show that the introduction of MML in Mexican border states decreases the amount of cocaine seized, while it increases the price of cocaine. Our results are consistent with the theory that decriminalization of small-scale production and distribution of marijuana harms Mexican drug trafficking organizations, whose revenues are highly reliant on marijuana sales. The drop in drug-related crimes suggests that the introduction of MML in Mexican border states lead to a decrease in their activity in those states. Our results survive a large variety of robustness checks. Extrapolating from our results, this indicates that decriminalization of the production and distribution of drugs may lead to a drop in violence in markets where organized crime is pushed out by licit competition.
K00|Investing in legal advice - What determines the costs of enforcing intellectual property rights?|This paper studies the determinants of investment in legal advice by plaintiffs in patent litigation. A hand-collected sample of US patent litigation cases is used to identify the empirical factors that determine the number of legal counsels employed by the plaintiffs. It turns out that more valuable patents lead to a higher investment in legal advice. Large firms, and plaintiffs with large patent portfolios employ more counsels, whereas individual litigants employ fewer. Software patents are related to a lower investment by the plaintiffs. These findings help not only to understand the cost drivers of litigation but have also important implications for the discussions on software patents, and the role of the litigant status for litigation success.
K00|DEONTOLOGICAL GUIDE MARKS IN THE COMMERCIAL COMPETITION? Challenges and perspectives concerning competition under economic crisis conditions?|"The competitiveness of products on the European State Members' market was and still is an issue for all the players involved in the good functioning of the single EU market. Any alteration of the competitiveness is rapidly sanctioned by the habilitated bodies applying the regulations in the matter, taking on the role of the guardian for the European consumer. The global nature of the current economic and financial crisis, has forced the new Member States to adopt a prudent behavior since small countries' economies are engaged in a process of economic catch?up. This feature creates a ""virtuous circle"" ... rather than ""vicious"", especially in times of general economic growth, but makes them more vulnerable to exogenous shocks. The crisis also represents the strongest shock that become apparent. Potential threats are magnified by the fact that their status as European Union Member States do not allow them to adopt protectionist measures. This would be considered a breach of European competition rules in the single market being penalized as such."
K00|Contributions to the Analysis of the Amendments to the Protection of New Varieties of Plants|The article brings into question the criminal protection of new varieties of plants. The author presents certain judicial norms, as previous issues, concerning the occurrence and protection of the rights over new varieties of plants through the granting of the variety patent. Furthermore, the study indicates the amendments made by Law no. 187/2012 on the enforcement of Law no. 286/2009 on the Criminal Code, concerning the counterfeiting crime incriminated in Law no. 255/1998 on the protection of new varieties of plants. Finally, the author underlines the specific elements of the contents of the investigated crime, thus providing the concerned parties with a table enabling, through the implementation thereof, the detection of the determining factors in the establishment and holding of the criminal liability of individuals infringing the rights of the plant variety patent holders, through counterfeiting..

K00|Discretionary freedom of choice and risk in alternative capital markets|The present paper studies the influence of one particular aspect of institutions, namely economic agents’ discretionary freedom of choice given by legal rules, upon the risk incurred in alternative capital markets, in the lines of the old institutional school of economics. A game-theoretic model is introduced, presenting the alternative capital markets as Harsanyi’s games with imperfect information, succeeding to each other in a Selten’s extensive game with imperfect recall. Market participants’ behaviour is made of strategies oriented on cash flows and indirect benefits, through the usage of discretionary freedom of choice offered by the applicable law. The overall level of risk in the market depends on whether these strategies reach, collectively, a state of Nash’s dynamic equilibrium, or not. The institution of nominated advisers, in two alternative capital markets, namely the British AIM and the Polish New Connect, is studied on the grounds of the model. The main finding is that, although the regulations of both markets create significant risk through the discretionary freedom of choice that the operators of these markets attribute to themselves, in terms of social games the markets seem to be quite stable. In conclusion, numerous hypotheses for further research are formulated, in particular that alternative capital markets are still institutionally young and experimental.

K00|Negligence and two-sided causation|We extend the economic analysis of negligence and intervening causation to “two-sided causation” scenarios. In the two-sided causation scenario the effectiveness of the injurer’s care depends on some intervention, and the risk of harm generated by the injurer’s failure to take care depends on some other intervention. We find that the distortion from socially optimal care is more severe in the two-sided causation scenario than in the one-sided causation scenario, and generally in the direction of excessive care. The practical lesson is that the likelihood that injurers will have optimal care incentives under the negligence test in the presence of intervening causal factors is low.

K00|The rule of law and constitutionalism in Muslim countries|Recently, several Muslim countries have ratified new constitutions. In this paper, we ask two questions: first, whether Muslim influence has a discernible impact on the content of such constitutions and, second, whether it has an impact on constitutional reality. More precisely, we are interested in the consequences of Islam for institutions securing the rule of law, while taking competing socioeconomic, geographic, and historical explanations explicitly into account. To this end, we construct a new Islamic State Index to measure the influence that Islam has on a society and its political and legal system. We find that Muslim influence is in conflict with the independence of the judiciary and nondiscriminatory legal institutions with respect to gender. Yet, parliamentary power as well as the protection of property rights and religious minorities are not significantly more constrained in Islamic states after we control for alternative explanations. Competing explanations such as the size of oil rents fare rather poorly in explaining differences in important aspects of the rule of law. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015

K00|Are entrepreneurship and cognitive skills related? Some international evidence|Do national differences in cognitive skills (CS) predict a nation’s likelihood of generating high-quality entrepreneurs who create and expand high-value businesses? We answer this question by estimating cross-country regressions that use the Acs and Szerb Global Entrepreneurship Development Index (GEDI) and a measure of national CS. After including conventional controls we find for a sample of 60 countries that our measure of CS robustly predicts the GEDI (unconditional correlation = 0.65, standardized beta = 0.42), an index that gives weight to both entrepreneurial attitudes within a nation and the institutional and economic prerequisites for creating high-value, high-growth firms. We find that this result also holds for an alternative measure of entrepreneurship. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015

K00|Randomizing ... What? A Field Experiment of Child Access Voting Laws|We explore randomizing legal information when it may be infeasible to randomize law per se. If citizens are underinformed about a legal entitlement, randomizing information about the entitlement may yield critical insight into its potential effect. We illustrate with a field experiment with the League of Women Voters of Georgia in the 2008 general election. We randomly informed roughly 10,000 of 20,000 recently registered mothers of young children about their statutory right to bring their child into the voting booth. We find the treatment had a moderate (but statistically insignificant) turnout effect, but caused a (statistically significant) shift toward early voting.
K00|Dead Poets’ Property - How Does Copyright Influence Price|This paper exploits a differential increase in copyright under the UK Copyright Act of 1814 - in favor of books by dead authors – to examine the influence of longer copyrights on price. Difference-in-differences analyses, which compare changes in the price of books by dead and living authors, indicate a substantial increase in price in response to an extension in copyright length. By comparison, placebo regressions for books by dead authors that did not benefit from the extension indicate no differential increase. Historical evidence suggests that longer copyrights increase price by improving publishers’ ability to practice intertemporal price discrimination.
K00|Brexit: The Economic And Political Impact Of A Possible Withdrawal Of Great Britain’S From The European Union|Great Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union would not only change the internal political climate, but it could have important political repercussions within the EU and also on its relations with other European Community’s countries. Also, it could stimulate the other EU Member States to re-evaluate the terms and conditions of their membership. The same applies if Great Britain fails to renegotiate these terms and conditions while keeping the status of EU member. A priority for the UK is to maintain close trade relations with the EU, even if politically it would opt for withdrawal. In the event of possible withdrawal from the EU, Great Britain could conclude an agreement with the EU following the example of a customs union (after Turkey’s model). In this case, it would not be obliged to contribute to the EU budget or accept immigration from the EU member states. Last but not least, from a geopolitical point of view, Great Britain's exit from the EU could be seen externally as a sign of decline, EU losing its financial, economic, political and military powerhouse. From this point of view, the European Union itself have a significant political and economic interest to conclude a mutually beneficial agreement with Great Britain considering that it could terminate its EU membership.
K00|Power to the People? An Experimental Analysis of Bottom-Up Accountability of Third-Party Institutions|This article provides an experimental investigation of third parties’ sanctioning behavior, in order to understand whether public officials (e.g., judges, politicians, or regulators), when deciding about top-down interventions aimed at punishing wrongdoers, are sensitive to bottom-up pressure on the part of ordinary citizens, who are the major victims of wrongdoers’ behavior. We set up a novel five-treatment design and compare situations where a wrongdoer acts under: (1) no third-party punishment; (2) nonaccountable third-party punishment; and (3) accountable third-party punishment. We show that when citizens are active and make their voice heard, public officials sanction wrongdoing significantly more. Our experimental finding complements previous empirical work based on field data and suggests that when third-party institutions are held accountable, their propensity to fight misconduct is higher, other things equal. We view this result as good news with regard to domains where it implies that pro-consumer policies will be more likely (e.g., regulatory policies). The risk of pandering by elected officials and the danger of poorly informed decisions by the citizens are the flip side of the argument. (JEL C91, D02, D63, D72, K00)
K00|A Model of Judicial Influence on Congressional Policy Making: Grove City College v. Bell|"Traditional law and economic analysis has focused on legal rules directly related to the allocation of resources. Today, economic analysis is being used to examine more traditional legal issues. This article explores one such traditional legal issue by applying economic methodology to the legislative-judicial interaction or ""bargaining game."" The purpose of this article is to determine the impact of judicial interpretation on regulatory legislation. Most studies of the political economy of regulation have focused on elected politicians (e.g., Congressmen), ignoring the role of the courts. Yet, judges interpret the law and may, in the extreme, reverse legislative decisions. Studying the influence of the judiciary on the legislature’s regulatory decisions remains an unexplored but important issue. The model allows us to address a variety of issues central to national policy making, for example, how the court influences legislative choices. We focus on an issue raised in the legal literature and in judicial opinions. Suppose a regulatory statute has been altered or reinterpreted by the courts, and we then observe that Congress does not act to change the court ruling. What can we infer from this lack of action? Many prominent political and legal scholars conclude that this inaction indicates acceptability by a majority of legislators. Because there exists no analytical foundation for assessing how judicial decisions affect legislative decision making over regulatory issues, however, such conclusions rest on questionable assumptions. The purpose of this article is to develop a formal economic model of legislative-judicial interaction. The model allows us to predict the circumstances in which Congress will and will not change judicial decisions. The model shows that congressional inaction is not a sign of acceptability by a majority of legislators. Instead, congressional inaction is a consequence of congressional structure and procedures: committees play an important role here, as does bicameralism. This model will be used to explore and explain the legislative events surrounding the Supreme Court decision Grove City College v. Bell (1984), a case involving statutory interpretation and the Department of Education’s regulatory provisions prohibiting sex discrimination. (JEL D72, D78, K00, K40, Z18)"
K00|Water Under the Bridge: Determinants of Franchise Renewal in Water Provision|"Williamson’s 1976 study of natural-monopoly franchise bidding launched extensive debate concerning the degree to which transaction-cost problems afflict government franchising. We propose that municipalities vary in ability to discipline franchisees, and that this heterogeneous ability affects franchise renewal patterns and the quasi-rents that franchisees extract. We study provision of municipal water services in France, a setting characterized by both direct public provision and franchised private providers. We find that small municipalities pay a significant price premium for franchisee-provided water when compared with publicly provided water; in contrast, large municipalities do not pay a premium on average. Further, large municipalities are less likely to renew an incumbent franchisee that charges an ""excessive"" price, while small municipalities’ renewal patterns are not influenced by franchisees’ excessive pricing. We interpret the results as evidence that although large municipalities can discipline franchisees and thus prevent extraction of quasi-rents, small municipalities are less able to do so due to weaker outside options.

K00|Financial Asset Holdings and Political Attitudes: Evidence from Revolutionary England|The English Parliament’s struggle for supremacy against monarchical dictatorship during the Civil War (1642–1648) was crucial for the establishment of representative government, yet its lessons continue to be debated. I exploit novel data on individual MPs drawn from 1,842 biographies to show that the conflict was over overseas interests and other factors over which the executive enjoyed broad constitutional discretion, rather than over domestic property rights. I further exploit the coincidence of individual MPs’ ability to sign legally binding share contracts with novel share offerings by overseas companies to measure the effect of overseas share investment on their political attitudes. I show that overseas shareholding pushed moderates lacking prior mercantile interests to support reform. I interpret the effect of financial assetholding as allowing new investors to exploit emerging economic opportunities overseas, aligning their interests with traders. By consolidating a broad parliamentary majority that favored reform, the introduction of financial assets also broadened support for the institutionalization of parliamentary supremacy over dictatorial rule.

K00|Comentario a: Los alcances de la seguridad ciudadana en Bolivia como bien público y tarea de todos<BR>[A comment on: The scope of citizen security in Bolivia as a public good and everyone's job]|Roncken & Chacin (2014) analyzed the correspondence between the communicative action and the orientation as well as scope of public policies implemented for citizens’ security by the administration of president Morales in Bolivia since 2006. Their research is relevant because it contributes with the analysis of carefully selected arguments helpful towards not only a better interpretation of the practical implementation but also to an eventual adjustment of the analyzed public policy. This revision does not pretend to discuss the theoretical and/or practical foundations of their research. From an economic perspective, the revision aims to analyze determined aspects of the article to contribute with additional points of view and to propose areas of interest for future interdisciplinary research in topics of citizens’ security.
K00|Law, Coercion, And Socioeconomic Equilibrium|This paper investigates the economic conditions under which the performance of a Judiciary does not impede non-coercive fair socioeconomic allocations under “Strotz-myopia” regarding the law variable, i.e. under a static view of it in an otherwise dynamic context. The law, here, is the positive factor by which consumption volume is multiplied as a result of law introduction in an otherwise fully private social economy. Lexicographic preferences regarding the law is the keyword in establishing non-coercive equilibria either in the static context of a stone-age economy or in the dynamic context of a jungle economy, given in the latter the presence of farsightedness. Nevertheless, such equilibria are found here to exist even under myopia and regardless the presence of lexicographic preferences. We first detect them within a fully private social economy, and we next qualify them by introducing the Judiciary as state officials. The optimality regarding state finances imposes additional restrictions in establishing myopic non-coercive equilibria. In any case, an equilibrium will be stable if it is not influenced by the homotheticity or not of the preferences, i.e. by income distribution considerations. So, any suboptimal behaviour of the Judiciary should be attributed exclusively to the suboptimality of state finances: Macroeconomics does affect law administration.
K00|Conventional Futures: Derivatives from Islamic Law of Contract Perspective|Islamic finance has emerged as a sustainable alternative of conventional finance for last two decades or so thanks to development of Islamic banking industry and more recently Islamic capital market. As Islamic finance industry is based on the principle of Islamic Law of Contract, there are certain rules that need to be followed in every financial transaction to be complaint with Shari’ah. As risk is inherent in business and finance, investors across the world use various risk mitigating tools or instruments including derivative instruments like futures contract. Although, the necessity of this kind of instrument is essential for development of Islamic finance industry but the permissibility of using them is still a debatable issue. In this research paper, a humble attempt has been made to explain the concept of conventional futures contract from Islamic Law of Contract perspectives. It is found in this study that there are arguments for and against the futures contract. On the one hand, majority scholars consider futures contracts are non-compliant with Islamic Law because of selling something that does not exist, deferment in the both counter values, excessive risk taking, uncertainty, pure speculation, and sale of one debt for another. In support of their argument they provided references from the Quran and Sunnah, also views of classical scholars and Jurists. On the other hand, many scholars argue that futures contracts are permissible while refuting the arguments provided against its impermissibility; while others argue that contemporary business environment demand to use them, so it is considered as custome (urf), while others argue it is permissible on the basis of Istihsan (juristic perference), maslaha (public benefits), dharurah (necessity). After analyzing the arguments for and against the futures contract, it can be concluded that contemporary scholars and Jurists in the field of Islamic Law are still divided on this issue as it is quite a new area of research from Islamic Law of Contract perspectives. However, it is safe to assume that conventional futures contracts in its current form do not comply with the Islamic Law.
K00|Taxing cross-border intercompany transactions: are financing activities fungible?|The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (‘OECD’) is currently considering best practice approaches to designing rules to prevent base erosion and profit shifting (‘BEPS’) by multinational enterprises (‘MNEs’). However, the OECD makes a distinction between combating BEPS and reducing distortions between the tax treatment of various methods of financing. Yet, an unequal tax treatment can create distortions, which incentivises tax planning behaviour. Accordingly, this paper aims to improve the tax design of anti-avoidance rules governing MNEs’ cross-border intercompany deductions by introducing the concept of the tax-induced cross-border funding bias. To date, the literature has focussed on the debt bias, which arises from the distortion in the tax treatment between debt and equity financing. On the other hand, the funding bias also includes licensing and leasing activities in addition to debt and equity financing. This presents a novel contribution to the literature. This paper examines the conceptual case for why is might be appropriate and feasible to restrict the tax deductibility of cross-border intercompany interest, dividends, royalties and lease payments given their mobility and fungibility. Specifically, it examines whether it is preferable for MNEs to be subject to economic rent taxation, as is attained through reform proposals such as the Allowance for Corporate Equity (‘ACE’), in this context. This presents a novel proposal for taxing cross-border intercompany economic rents which aligns with the main aim of corporate tax harmonisation; namely: to reduce, if not remove, distortions relating to the taxation of cross-border intercompany activities.
K00|Thin capitalisation rules: A second-best solution to the cross-border debt bias?|One of the most significant trends in the evolution of global tax systems has been the rise from relative obscurity of thin capitalisation rules, which are perceived as anti-avoidance rules which limit tax base erosion from cross-border interest deductions. However, over the same timeframe, innovations to financial instruments have challenged the traditional financial and legal distinctions between debt and equity, which in the cross-border setting has exposed the prevalence of economic inefficiencies in the design of the international tax system. This paper approaches the issue of thin capitalisation from a novel perspective by conceptualising the cross-border debt bias as the ‘disease’ and thin capitalisation as merely the ‘symptom’. Despite their prevalence, it is unclear whether thin capitalisation rules: (1) attain tax neutrality (specifically, do these rules mitigate the debt bias); (2) are effective in both theory and practice. This provides the basis to examine whether a cross-border manifestation of a fundamental reform could eliminate the need for existing thin capitalisation rules, which are presently a second-best solution to the tax-induced cross-border debt bias. Accordingly, this paper: (1) considers reforms traditionally designed to address the domestic debt bias; specifically, the allowance for corporate equity (ACE), comprehensive business income tax (CBIT), combined ACE-CBIT and allowance for corporate capital; (2) examines the literature and implementation experience of the ACE, the only one of these fundamental reforms which has been experimented with in practice, to consider whether it is effective in both theory and practice; (3) presents the possibility of extending the combined ACE-CBIT to the cross-border context as an alternative to thin capitalisation rules.
K00|Bitcoin Mission Statement. Or What does it mean Sharing Economy and Distributed Trust?|Technological advancements in the means of production are the driving force behind the changes in the prevailing system of socio-economic relations. Feudalism was transformed into capitalism as a result of such advancements. While man obtained physical freedom, the financial freedom remained under the control of the centralized authority. A deep level of collaboration is required to attain the next level of productivity provided by new technological advancements. However, the present system with a centralized control of governance and finance appears to constrain and restrain the value producing economy. This constriction becomes especially evident when the business environment requires collaboration to create, as it underlines the inherent conflict of centralized control. The most recent tech sector innovations, such as smart contracts and cryptocurrencies, are poised to disrupt the system of centralized control. The removal of a centralized authority from the position of control will change the fabric of the society to reflect the mesh network of shared resources. The society will transform to the new form of socio-economic relations – the era of Crypto-Socialism.

K00|Environmental human rights issues on international investment arbitration and economic development: perspectives and legal approach|English Abstract: This article explores the relationship between International Investment Arbitration and the international standards of Human Rights, including the ones related to the environment. We found that there is an opposition when applying the Human Rights to the International Investment Regimen. We argue that there are sufficient law foundations to make the investor, and specifically the corporations they own, responsible for their violations of other international standards, even though they are not expressly named in investments treaties. But, there is a problem reflected in the lack of enforceability of the International Human Rights Law in the International Investment Regimen. Spanish Abstract: Este artículo explora la relación entre el Arbitraje Internacional de Inversión y las normas internacionales de Derechos Humanos, incluyendo por tanto las relacionadas con el ambiente. Se encontró que existe una oposición para aplicar los Derechos Humanos en el Régimen Internacional de Inversiones. Consideramos que existen suficientes fundamentos de derecho para que el inversor, y específicamente las empresas que poseen, sea responsable de sus violaciones de los demás estándares internacionales, aunque no estén expresamente en los tratados de inversión. Sin embargo, hay un problema de falta de aplicabilidad de la legislación internacional de derechos humanos en el régimen internacional de inversiones.
K00|Theory of Gharar and its interpretation of Risk and Uncertainty from the perspectives of Authentic Hadith and the Holy Quran: A Qualitative Analysis|The inconclusive definition of Gharar as risk and uncertainty can be commonly found in the contemporary literatures. The difference in the meaning of Gharar is generally thought to be due to the difference in the jurisprudence point of views. The current practice is that there is no standard in defining the terms. Hence, this study introduces steps in defining terminology namely; dictionary definition, Arabic linguistic definition and jurisprudence definition. However, the philosophy of risk as stated in the Holy Quran and Hadith differs from the concept of risk in conventional finance. The finding reveals that risk in Islamic banking refers to a wider interpretation covering the concepts gharar. mysir, mukhatarah, al ghunm bil ghurm and al kharajbil daman than the element of uncertainty as in the conventional finance.

K00|Considerations Regarding The Impact Of Legislative Inflation On Economic Operators|This paper addresses the impact of legislative inflation upon the activities of the commercial agents. A clear and transparent legal framework is required in order for the economic system to be efficient and to grow. Unfortunately, the large amount of norms that come into force monthly, if not weekly and regulate the activities of the moral persons, and in particular, the activities of the economic agents determine a high grade of informational entropy at a systemic level. This study tackles the possibility of improving the legal communication of norms by reducing legislative inflation. Firstly, the communication stream is analysed, and then the possibilities for improving such communication are brought forward.

K00|Actual problems of product placement and embedded (surreptitious) advertising|This research paper covers examples and problems arising from product placement and surreptitious advertising. Product placement and surreptitious advertising are so similar but absolutely different types of advertising, while product placement may not be considered advertising at all. The point at issue arises when it is difficult to determine the real object of advertising. A separate cluster of marketing is a publishing of advertisement information in consumer products, which are not directly available for advertising: for example motion pictures and texts of books. There is a practice when authors include in products mentioning of specific trademarks and its characteristics for consideration. However, in some cases, it is very difficult to distinguish advertising and a describing or information naturally included in the text and is not advertising. The author focuses on the regulation of product placement and surreptitious advertising in Russia, legality of such advertising under the legislation of different countries, lawsuits, risks and academic conclusions. The choice of the research topic is due to different interpretations of these concepts and mixtures with other types of advertising in the research works and contradictory practices and terms found in the regulations of the Federal Antimonopoly service and the decisions of the courts. This research paper will be useful for lawyers dealing with cyber and digital law and all persons interested in legality of advertising materials in mass media and mass entertainment.
K00|Aiding innovation and entrepreneurship through migration policy: A view from Australia|In recent years, there has been significant interest internationally in the role that migration law and policies may play in aiding innovation, entrepreneurship and economic growth. Several countries, including Australia, Canada, the US and Singapore have established various investment and entrepreneur visas aimed at attracting foreign investment and human capital in return for permanent residency or citizenship. This paper analyses the effectiveness of Australia?s migration policies in strengthening its innovation system and provides suggestions for reform. It identifies shortages in venture capital and access to overseas entrepreneurial talent as two urgent areas for reform of the innovation system. Australia?s visa offerings under its Business Innovation and Investment Program - such as Significant Investment Visa (SIV) program and the Venture Capital Entrepreneur Visa - have so far failed to address these shortages. The paper draws on experiences from other jurisdictions to suggest avenues for reform of Business Innovation and Investment Program. These reforms could include: widening the ?complying investment? criterion for significant investor visa; mandatory investment in venture capital funds, with matching from the Government; and reducing onerous threshold criteria for entry into Australia as an entrepreneur. These proposals for reform, and Australia?s experiences, may provide lessons for other countries seeking to establish similar investment visa programs.
K00|European Quartet of Missed Opportunities for Internet Governance|Who controls the Internet? Conventionally, it is assumed that the hegemony, if not monopoly, of the U.S. Government over the Internet governance is a fait accompli generated by the historic evolution, as well as the economic and political power which the USA asserted in an almost aggressive manner. This assumption is the result of a set of myths and misinformation and deserves to be corrected while presenting both American and European perspectives, in the context of the real managerial and technical setting. This black-and-white perception is to be rejected and replaced by a colorful mosaic showing that a set of misunderstandings and aborted opportunities shaped the pathway to the status quo. An active and strong impact over the Internet governance was several times close to European hands, and it is highly instructive to analyze these situations where Europeans did not manage to get involved in the top Internet management. Four decades, four sets of opportunities and four failures for many business management and other reasons are detailed. Considering the global situation, Europeans cannot afford repeating such mistakes. Taking into account the current stage of the relationship between the EU and USA, especially Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a consensus, or at least a respected tolerance, of the management of the Internet and governance over it is critical.
K00|The Single-Member Board of Directors According to the New Turkish Commercial Code|The New Turkish Commercial Code was adopted on 13 January 2011 and entered into force with the exception of certain provisions on 1 July 2012. The New Turkish Commercial Code introduced many important innovations and changes, of which, those related to the law of corporations stand out. Especially, many obstacles encountered by foreign investors when they attempt to establish corporations in Turkey were eliminated by the New Turkish Commercial Code. Among the changes in question are many practical and functional innovations, such as the acceptance of independent auditing upon the abolishment of the board of auditors, which was previously a department of joint-stock companies, and the obligation for companies to set up a company web-site. The New Turkish Commercial Code has enabled the joint-stock companies to comprise one shareholder only, which, earlier, could have been founded by at least five shareholders. Another complementary regulation was also made in relation to the structure of the board of directors in joint-stock companies: The board of directors, previously required to comprise at least three members, could henceforth be formed by a single member. This situation is the result of and the obligation from regulations in Turkish Law decreeing the possibility to establish joint-stock companies by a single shareholder. However, the field of application for the single-member board of directors adopted to provide coherence with the single-shareholder joint-stock company is, in fact, not limited to only such companies; a single-member board of director can also be preferred in joint-stock companies with multiple shareholders. This memorandum was prepared to indicate the conditions and principles for the formation of the single-member board of directors in joint-stock companies. Some of the requirements for the membership in a multiple-member board of directors are not stipulated for single-member board of directors in Turkish law. In addition, principles for the representation, meetings, and decision-making of the single-member board of directors are different from those of multi-member board of directors in various cases. For this reason, this work aims to discuss the single-member board of directors in the New Turkish Commercial Code in general terms, insomuch as it differs from the multiple-member board of directors.
K00|Towards smarter regulation of innovation?|The paper assesses the scope of current regulation in the electronic communications sector in a period of rapid technological changes. It explores the network operator?s dilemma how to deal with investments in innovation in a time where fundamental innovation comes from outside; and the regulator?s dilemma how to improve the conditions for access to financial resources for research and innovation. The contention is to look whether different regulatory tools, such as proactively enhancing interoperability levels, subsidies and standardization measures could complement or supplement existing measures to safeguard competition. In terms of interoperability, two cases are discussed: IP connectivity and broadband access. The focus will be on measures proposed by the Commission in 2015 for the achievement of the Digital Single Market: what is the right track: does yardstick regulation imposing price-caps still work. The road to achieving more incentive regulation appears to be bumpy as well and reorganizing the level playing field does not appear to be a viable regulatory option. Some thought is given to how infrastructure sharing and other long-term contracts could form an alternative for regulation. A mix of regulation is proposed to move towards smarter electronic communications networks.
K00|Whistle blowing - is it sedition or public duty in emerging economies|This article reviews if the introduction of new laws to encourage and protect whistle blowers is sufficient to improve corporate governance in Malaysian public listed companies. It provides suggestions to formulate internal whistle blowing policies for companies. It concludes that due to the culture of the people and the taxonomy of Malaysian public listed companies and companies in other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, having laws to encourage and protect whistle blowers to get rid of corporate wrong-doings is not necessarily the only solution. The article defines whistle blowing and the benefits of encouraging whistle blowers. It proceeds to highlight the issues of concern on whistle blowing. It also deliberates particular issues of whistle blowing in Malaysia by discussing the taxonomy of Malaysian public listed companies, the strength of the regulators in enforcement, the Malaysian culture and the Malaysian corporate scandals. The article elaborates on the whistle blowing laws in Malaysia and concludes by providing alternate ways to encourage whistle blowing in Malaysian companies having in mind the taxonomy of Malaysian companies and enforcement by regulators.

The author points out that the current importance of Bitcoin is scarce in Poland and small in the world, despite the increasingly elaborate Bitcoin ecosystem, and that the Polish law is prepared for the adoption of this new phenomenon. However, there are still a lot of unresolved specific issues, particularly concerning tax, that make it difficult for financial institutions and users to take a stance on Bitcoin, which generates the need for an official arrangement on Bitcoin. The author also proposes an approach to enable the development of private exchange, which however would require extensive action on a global scale.

Specifically, they considered recent proposals to extend the law along various dimensions of sustainability. The unequivocal result of this review was that the ESGL should be retained without modification. The law is still useful to quickly implement fiscal measures that could mitigate the consequences of severe economic downturns. However, it would be a completely inappropriate basis for attempts to address aspects of sustainability in economic policy making. Copyright ZBW and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015

K00|'Two decades after the war' - the management of international commons|Memory is important, also for Economics. The ephemeris can be used not only as moments of who relives the past in a single-rewind-perspective but of those who use these occasions to reflect on the past and to project the future from it. 1995 was a special year for fisheries in Portugal. Never before and never again, was the sector so under the eye of the media. First pages every day journals, opening in the TV daily informative programs?, and that, for more than three months. A unique scenario. The cause was a fish war in the NAFO area, between Spain and Canada, about a species, the turbot, that put also the Portuguese in a big tension. Two decades after the war, our proposal goes through resume the so-called turbot war and, from it, to reflect on its causes, how the problems were solved and to outlook for the guidelines of future research. Our paper therefore has the following structure. In the first and second points, the original problems of High Sea fisheries management and how they reflected in practice in the turbot war, are presented. In section 3 we reflect on how the problem was solved. Theoretically we shortly review the basic results of the literature on this issue, in particular those arising from the usual combination of the basic model of fisheries management with Game Theory. In empirical terms we draw attention to the diplomatic efforts between the EU and Canada to overcome disagreements that led to war and to promote a cooperative agreement that would avoid the problem of overfishing on the High Sea. The rationale and substance of the 1995 UN Agreement on Transboundary Resources and Highly Migratory Species, its strengths and weaknesses, is presented and discussed. Finally, in Section 4, the paper reflects on the theoretical and practical issues that still pose important questions to this problematic and ask for some perspectives on future developments.
K00|Renewable Energy Consumption, Political And Institutional Factors: Evidence From A Group Of European, Asian And Latin American Countries|This paper explores the dynamic relationships between renewable energy consumption and a number of institutional and political factors for a group of countries from Europe, Asia and Latin America spanning the period 1995–2011. The paper employs the methodology of long and short-run panel causality approach as well as the methodology of the panel Error Correction model. The empirical findings provide strong evidence that, after controlling the economic environment, both political and institutional factors exert a strong and statistically significant effect on renewable energy consumption. These findings are expected to have serious implications for policies related to clean energy.

K00|XXI Century. The Age of Great Challenges. The Problem of “Us” and the “Others” - Il XXI secolo: l’era delle grandi sfide. Il problema di “noi” e gli “altri”|The aim of this paper is to discuss some of the great challenges that will characterize the XXI Century. In the background we consider the problem of the relationship between “Us” and the “Others”, that is how to reconcile the power of Western universalism with the multitudes of other identity groups based on values. We argue that the “Great Converge” which will characterize world economy the next decades represents one of the greatest challenges in human history. The management of economic, financial, monetary, demographic, cultural and environmental forces will need some form of global agreement or global constitution: which means finding some general principles agreed upon by all nations of the world if we want to have a peaceful and sustainable development of the planet. The changing concept of time will represent another of the great challenge which we will have to face. We are living a growing a-synchronicity between and among different categories of time: the time of history; the time of finance; the time of economic development; the internal time consciousness of individuals; the time of objects and the time of consumerism; the time of life and death; the time of generations; the time of institutions and institutional building; the time of property; and, finally and most important, the time of culture and the time of of nature. Together with a new conception and management of time, we also need to reconsider the very economic foundations of the institutions of capitalism. This is possible, we shall argue, if we introduce a new function to represent economic and non-economic behavior within societies. A function based not only on the calculation of the monetary return of individuals, but based also on values and tastes. This, we suggest, maybe achieved by combining cardinal and parametric functions in a single representation (an algebraic field) where values and tastes are considered not only as “means”, to achieve individual or collective welfare, but also as “ends” in themselves. This should allow us to reconcile the typical Western profit maximizing conception of individuals and society, against all other non-economic considerations, which differ across the world according to a great variety of existing and evolving value systems. - Obiettivo di questo contributo è quello di discutere alcune delle grandi sfide che caratterizzeranno il XXI Secolo. Terremo nel sottofondo il problema del rapporto tra “noi” e gli “altri”, ovvero come riconciliare il potere dell’universalismo Occidentale all’interno della moltitudine di altri gruppi identitari basati sui diversi insiemi di valori. Cercheremo di dimostrare che la c.d. “Grande Convergenza”, che caratterizzerà l’economia mondiale nelle prossime decadi, rappresenterà una delle maggiori sfide della storia dell’umanità. La gestione dell’evoluzione delle potenti forze economiche, finanziarie, monetarie, demografiche, culturali e ambientali che caratterizzano la nostra epoca, avrà bisogno di una qualche forma di accordo o costituzione globale. Ciò significa trovare alcuni principi generali da tutti condivisi per fare in modo che l’evoluzione della storia del pianeta sia sostenibile e pacifica. Le mutazioni in atto del concetto di tempo rappresentano una delle altre grandi sfide che dovremo affrontare. Assistiamo ad una crescente a-sincronia tra i diversi concetti di tempo: il tempo della storia; il tempo dello sviluppo economico; il tempo della finanza; il tempo della coscienza interna dell’individuo; il tempo degli oggetti e del loro consumo; il tempo della vita e della morte; il tempo delle generazioni; il tempo delle istituzioni e dell’institutional building; il tempo della proprietà; ed, infine, il tempo della cultura e della natura. L’a-sincronia potrebbe creare “punti di catastrofe” ed è quindi necessario studiare e capire cosa sia meglio fare per ridurre questi rischi. A fianco di un ripensamento sulla natura e la gestione del tempo della globalizzazione, crediamo sia necessario anche dare nuove fondamenta economiche alle istituzioni del capitalismo. Ciò è possibile, secondo noi, anche attraverso la costruzione di una nuova funzione per la rappresentazione dei comportamenti economici e sociali all’interno delle nostre società. Una funzione che non sia solo basata su ritorno economicopecuniario dell’individuo, ma basata anche sui valori e sui gusti. La proposta per la costruzione di una funzione del benessere collettivo fondata anche su valori e gusti si basa sulla combinazione di funzioni cardinali e funzioni parametriche in una rappresentazione singola (un campo algebrico) nella quale valori e gusti vengono considerati non solo come “mezzi” per ottenere il benessere individuale e collettivo, ma anche come “fini” in se stessi. Si tratta, a nostro avviso, di un tentativo di riconciliare la tipica concezione Occidentale della massimizzazione del profitto individuale e collettivo, con tutte le altre considerazioni non puramente economiche e/o “diversamente economiche”, che esistono nel mondo, all’interno di una varietà di sistemi di valori, alcuni rigidi e stabili e altri, la maggioranza, in grande evoluzione.
K00|Few Aspects Regarding Bribery As A Social And Economic Threat|It is a well-known fact that the so called “white collar crimes” now implies a wide variety of offenses (including bribery) that can affect the lives of more individuals than the “classic” crimes. An analysis of corruption necessarily implies an interdisciplinary approach, as it has multiple facets: social, political, economic and juridical. The New Criminal Code of Romania (NCC) has brought a series of important changes, compared to the previous regulation. All forms of corruption involve an abusive use of power (public or private), for a personal gain, occurring regardless of the form of government or historical period.
K00|Abgrenzung zweiseitiger Märkte am Beispiel von Internetsuchmaschinen|Google is supposed to be the dominant player in most search markets around the world. But what is a search market? To calculate a market share of 90% or more, it has to be clear what the denominator is: Does the search market also include product search and therefore Amazon and eBay or the search for private or personal contacts like on Facebook or LinkedIn? And is this relevant? Search engines do not charge users for their services, they earn money exclusively with advertisement. Hence, may the relevant market best be defined also through the advertisement market? In this paper we investigate those questions and find that the there is no general way to define “the search market”. The size of the market strongly depends on the question at hand. It may be very cumbersome to define the relevant market according to each problem. But the importance of search engines and the dynamics of the market leave no other choice. Claims against potentially strong players may be a popular way to generate attention but for a sound antitrust analysis, a detailed and rigorous market definition is essential.
K00|The Criticism Directed to the Case Preparation Panel in Economic Courts in Egypt|Law and economy are firmly connected. Adding to that the economic life has an effect on the judicial thinking. So, rules of law should characterized the care of existed economic attitude in the state in a way that law seems to be a mirror in which the existed economic attitudes in most branches of law are reflected even if they are not of direct shape. judiciary may be an attracting factor for investment through understanding and the speed of settling the disputes achieving quick justice. On the other hand, it may be a factor of dispelling of investment and development via prolonging the period of litigation and being not aware of the nature of such disputes.So, Egyptian legislator created special Economic Courts to deal with economic disputes, and to avoid its negative effects, by Law No. 120 of 2008. Which decide that this kind of litigation can be solved by judges specialized in this kind of litigation, to encourage investment, and to provide maximum protection for economic activity and help develop the plans and ensure justice. But, There are some Criticism Directed to the Case Preparation Panel in Economic Courts in Egypt. So, I will discuss it in my paper.
K00|Trade facilitation and country size|It is argued that compared with large countries, small countries rely more on trade and therefore are more likely to adopt liberal trading policies. The present paper extends this idea beyond the conventional trade openness measures by analyzing the relationship between country size and the number of documents required to export and import, a measure of trade facilitation. Three important results follow. First, trade facilitation does improve as country size becomes smaller; that is, small countries perform better than large countries in terms of trade facilitation. Second, the relationship between country size and trade facilitation is nonlinear, much stronger for the relatively small than the large countries. Third, contrary to what existing studies might suggest, the relationship between country size and trade facilitation does not appear to be driven by the fact that small countries trade more as a proportion of their gross domestic product than the large countries.

K00|Dynamic effects of institutions on firm-level exports|The gap between theoretically predicted trade patterns and actual trade suggests that our understanding of what shapes trade patterns is incomplete. Institutional barriers may be one factor behind this gap, and recent research suggests that institutions are a greater obstacle to trade than tariffs. Using detailed firm-level data, we analyze how institutional quality in recipient countries affects exports by Swedish firms. Our results suggest that weak institutions in recipient countries make exports to these countries less likely and that exports to countries with weak institutions are characterized by relatively short duration and small volume. Analyzing long-term trade flows, we identified a learning process where exporters become less dependent on institutional quality in the target economy over time. More specifically, in addition to previous research that emphasize learning related to knowledge about the contracting partner and rule of law, we extend this notion and show that there is also a learning process where firms acquire knowledge about the general business climate. When learning about the contractual partner and business institutions in recipients countries takes place, exports increase relatively quickly during the first 2 years of exports and thereafter levels out. Hence, firms that are initially sensitive to weak institutions, start small, and learn how to handle foreign institutions are likely to be most successful in maintaining long-term relationships with foreign markets.

K00|Desistance from crime. How much can be explained by life course transitions?|Objectives: Previous studies have argued that marriage, parenthood and employment are important factors that lead to desistance from crime. However, the effects of these events only apply to those experiencing them and do not necessarily explain why the majority of desisters stop offending. In this research note, we discuss how large a proportion of desisters experience these transitions. Methods: We describe changes in the lives of those who have stopped offending. We use data from a total population sample of all registered male offenders in Norway who committed at least five crimes in the past five years, and none thereafter (N=4963 persons). We report relevant life events from five years before until five years after the last recorded crime. Results: Of those who terminated their criminal career, 10 percent got married, 22 percent had a child, and 31 percent increased the number of months they were employed. In total, 47 percent experienced at least one of these events. Conclusions: While marriage, parenthood and employment are central to life course criminology, the majority of those who terminate a criminal career do so for other reasons.

El supuesto de las cooperativas de utilidad pública en la Comunidad Autónoma del País Vasco<BR>[The cooperative societies of participation in public services. The course of the public utility cooperative in the Autonomous Region of the Basque Country]|En el presente trabajo se aborda una de las manifestaciones más destacadas de la evolución del Derecho administrativo de nuestros días: su apuesta por la interacción con los ciudadanos que demandan, cada vez más, un papel activo y mayor participación en la planificación, la ejecución y la evaluación de las políticas públicas. En este sentido, se pone de manifiesto cómo el Movimiento Cooperativo, basado en los valores de solidaridad, democracia, equidad, igualdad, autoayuda y auto-responsabilidad, ha destacado desde su origen por su compromiso social y por su contribución a la promoción del desarrollo del interés general, de tal forma y manera que todas aquellas sociedades cooperativas que integren en su objeto social como fines prioritarios de su actuación la asistencia socio-sanitaria, la educación, la vivienda, la protección y defensa del medio ambiente, el fomento de la economía social y la promoción y protección de la paz social y la ciudadanía, entre otros, participan y trabajan activa y efectivamente por y para la prestación de servicios de interés general.
K00|Economic Models of Law|This essay discusses the use of economic models for understanding law. It begins by describing the nature of economic models in general, and then turns to the specific application of economic models to law. The discussion distinguishes between “economic analysis of law”— which concerns the use of economic theory for describing the incentive effects of legal rules (positive analysis) and for prescribing better rules (normative analysis); and “law and economics”—which concerns the relationship between law and markets as alternative institutions for organizing economic activity. The essay concludes with some comments on the actual process of building economic models of law.
K00|Effects Of Commercial Contract|The contract is a legal instrument used to organize economic and social life. International trade agreement has certain features in order to ensure the international exchange of goods and services between the Contracting Parties. In terms of commercial contract, there is a foreign origin element, that gives the parties the right to determine the law to govern the contract. A fundamental aspect of commercial contract, in addition to that of determining the law applicable to judicial report established between the parties, it is also the mechanism of interpretation of the contract in case of a conflict due to obscure or inaccurate contractual clauses. Effects of commercial contract are governed by two principles, namely the principle of the binding force of the contract and the principle of relativity of the contract.
K00|The New Pragmatism, or economics and policy for the future|Economics is not only a means of interpreting the past, but it must become an instrument for shaping the future, too. It should show inevitable future economic processes, with their links to culture, technology, and environment. With theoretical knowledge of this area, strategies of economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable development can be put in place. In the future, heterodoxy is bound to dominate, and economics will become increasingly interdisciplinary. Future generations need economics of moderation and a theory describing it, as opposed to the thus far prevailing economics of either deficiency or excess. We need the New Pragmatism.
K00|Contestation For Annulment Common In The Regulation Of The New Code Of Civil Procedure|Contestation for annulment whatever its form, is an extraordinary means of appeal that is exercised according to art.503-508 of the new code of civil procedure, only for the reasons and under the conditions laid down by the legislator. Contestation for annulment allows the party that is interested to challenge a final judgment given in violation of procedural rules. The paper addresses theoretical issues, of the common appeal for annulment, being analyzed aspects aimed at the parties, the object, the exercise period and settlement procedure, of this remedy available to the interested party.
K00|Considerations On The Procedure Of Reduced Value Application In The Regulation Of The New Code Of Civil Procedure|The reduced value application procedure is regulated by the New Code of Civil Procedure, in art. 1025-1032, and it purposes to settle the litigations presented for judgment with expediency. The procedure is enforced in the case of applications having a maximum value of 10,000 lei at the date of court notification, and this amount does not include interests, court expenses and other accessory revenues. In the enforcement of the procedure, both the value of the application, and its object shall be taken into account, as the legislator expressly provided in art. 1025 para. (2) and (3) the situations to which this procedure does not apply. The work approaches the aspects related to the reduced value application procedure, from the point of view of the provisions of art. 1025-1032 from the Code of civil procedure in force, and the aspects referring to the area of application, the competent law court, opening and settlement of the procedure.
K00|Les fonctions cognitives du droit dans la pensée de Cass Sunstein|Behavioral approach is nowadays one most prominent field within law and economics literature. Applying bias and heuristics to the law draws new insights and mechanisms on the role and functions of law in society. By studying Sunstein’s works on this topic, we argue that two different normative views emerge from behavioral analysis : debiasing and libertarian paternalism. We show these two conceptions of the law are not necessarily opposed : they rely on a broad conception of freedom as “cognitive freedom”. Classification JEL : B20 ; K00
K00|De la question coloniale chez les anciens et néo-institutionnalistes|This article examines how the colonial issue is considered in old and new institutionalism. In contrast with new institutionalism, old institutionalism examines colonialism in a racial framework. This article nevertheless reveals a conceptual convergence between both traditions around a culturalist explanation of institutional dynamics. Old and new institutionalism insists on the religious culture as an filter which led to the emergence of pro-growth institutions. This convergence illustrates the ambig?ous relationship between race and culture in the institutionalist tradition.
K00|Economics for Substantive Democracy|What is the scope of economics as a science, what is economics for? Real freedom or what we call substantive democracy has never been an objective of economics. In this perspective freedom, or the lack of it, would not be a purpose of a particular economic system, but at best one of its side effects. In this paper I sustain that economics’ discourse has become one the most substantial contributors to what could be called the erosion of democracy. The first argument used in this case against economics refers to its attempt to be considered a neo-naturalistic science; the second concerns the fact that economics considers democracy contradictory to the expression of its scientific rationality and; the third, that economics crowds out people from decision-making processes by pushing them into the hands of experts. What part should economics be called to play in this search for substantive democracy? This issue is all the more critical that economics has reached the status of a major political fact. Partisan political programs have essentially become economic programs, and economic variables have thereby become major global political issues. One of the ways for economics to contribute to substantive democracy is to propose an alternative discourse to mainstream economics. An economics favorable to substantive democracy should, thereby, be political rather than naturalistic, pluralist rather than monist and, instead of crowding out people from decisions processes, should aim at the co-production of economic knowledge with those concerned by the outcome of economic decisions.
K00|Does the European Marriage Pattern Explain Economic Growth?|This paper scrutinizes the recently postulated link between the European Marriage Pattern (EMP) and economic success. A metastudy of the historical demography literature shows that the EMP did not prevail throughout Europe, its three key components did not always coincide, and its more extreme manifestations were associated with economic stagnation rather than growth. There is no evidence that the EMP improved economic performance by empowering women, increasing human capital investment, adjusting population to economic trends, or sustaining beneficial cultural norms. European economic success was not caused by the EMP and its sources must therefore be sought in other factors.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K00|A Behavioural Approach to Health Promotion: Informing the Global NCD Agenda with Behavioural|At a time in which behavioural science has gained increasing attention for the design of population-wide health interventions, this chapter discusses its potential contributions to the prevention and control of Non-Communicable-Diseases (NCDs). Given the largely preventable nature of NCDs, any lifestyle intervention faces the challenge to induce behavioural change. By highlighting the role of social and physical environments in shaping our behaviour, applied behavioural science provides policymakers with a new understanding of human decision-making and, as a result, may support an innovative approach to the promotion of behaviour change leading to healthier lives. While only a combination of policy instruments, such as legislation, regulation, and even financial and fiscal incentives, may induce behaviour change to the scale required to reduce the burden of chronic disease at the population level, a behavioural informed approach may valuably complement the current regulatory mix. In particular, an analysis of the WHO NCD Action Plan and its accompanying strategies suggests an increased awareness of the roles played by environmental and social factors on behaviour change. Although the language employed falls short of operationalizing the major behavioural insights into the NCD agenda, it clearly highlights that their integration into the current regulatory mix appears fundamental today for the design of any lifestyle policy intervention. As behavioural change is progressively becoming the focus of health promotion efforts, the lesson learned is that there is more to behaviour change than merely empowering the targeted individuals, communities and populations with the necessary information.
K00|Tax farming and the origins of state capacity in England and France|How did modern and centralized fiscal institutions emerge? We develop a model that explains (i) why pre-industrial states relied on private individuals to collect taxes; (ii) why after 1600 both England and France moved from competitive methods for collecting revenues to allocating the right to collect taxes to a small group of financiers—an intermediate institution that we call cabal tax farming—and (iii) why this centralization led to investments in fiscal capacity and increased fiscal standardization. We provide detailed historical evidence that supports our prediction that rulers abandoned the competitive allocation of tax rights in favor of cabal tax farming in order to gain access to inside credit, and that this transition was accompanied by investments in standardization. Finally (iv) we show why this intermediate institution proved to be self-undermining in England, where it was quickly replaced by direct collection, but lasted in France until the French Revolution.
K00|A behavioral justification for escalating punishment schemes|The standard two-period law enforcement model is considered in a setting where individuals usually, but not exclusively, commit crimes only after comparing expected costs and benefits. Where escalating punishment schemes are present, there is an inherent value in keeping a clean criminal record; a person with a record may unintentionally become a repeat offender if he fails to exert self-control, and be punished more severely. If the punishment for repeat offenders is sufficiently high, one may rationally forgo the opportunity of committing a profitable crime today to avoid being sanctioned as a repeat offender in the future. Therefore, partial deterrence can be achieved at a very low cost through the use of escalating penalties, providing a behavioral justification for punishing repeat offenders more severely.
K00|State policy and the political economy of criminal enterprise: mass incarceration and persistent organized hyperviolence in the USA|Atomistic, individual-oriented economic models of criminal behavior fail to capture critical scale-dependent behaviors that characterize criminal enterprises as cultural artifacts. Public policies based on such models have contributed materially to the practice of mass incarceration in the USA. A survey of similar policing strategies in other venues suggests that such policies almost inevitably lead to exacerbation of organized violence. Adapting a Black–Scholes methodology, it is possible to characterize the ‘regulatory investment’ needed to manage criminal enterprise under conditions of uncertainty at a scale and level of organization that avoids an atomistic fallacy. The model illuminates how public policy that might seem rational on an individual scale can trigger ecosystem resilience transitions to long-lasting or permanent modes of institutionalized hyperviolence. The homicide waves associated with the planned shrinkage program in New York City that was directed at dispersing minority voting blocks carry implications for national patterns of social disruption in which mass incarceration is an ecological keystone. Continuing large-scale socioeconomic decay, in the specific context of that keystone, greatly increases the probability of persistent, large-scale, organized hyperviolence, as has been the experience in Naples, Sicily, Mexico, and elsewhere.
K00|Private takings|This paper examines the implications associated with a recent Supreme Court ruling, Kelo v. City of New London. Kelo can be interpreted as supporting eminent domain as a means of transferring property rights from one set of private agents — landowners — to another private agent — a developer. Under voluntary exchange, where the developer sequentially acquires property rights from landowners via bargaining, a holdout problem arises. Eminent domain gives all of the bargaining power to the developer and, as a result, eliminates the holdout problem. This is the benefit of Kelo. However, landowners lose all their bargaining power and, as a result, their property investments become more inefficient. This is the cost of Kelo. A policy of eminent domain increases social welfare compared to voluntary sequential exchange only when the holdout problem is severe, and this occurs only if the developer has very little bargaining power. We propose an alternative government policy that eliminates the holdout problem but does not affect the bargaining power of the various parties. This alternative policy strictly dominates a policy of eminent domain, which implies that eminent domain is an inefficient way to transfer property rights between private agents.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K00|Why bail-in? And how!|"All men are created equal, but all liabilities are not. Some liabilities are more equal than others. These ""financial liabilities"" are products of financial firms. These products shift risk (insurance or derivatives) or provide liquidity (bank deposits or repurchase agreements). Since these liabilities have an independent value as products, they are worth more than their net present value. The value of a financial firm, then, depends on its liability structure. These special liabilities therefore affect insolvency law. Most financial firms are governed by special insolvency law; those that are not receive special treatment in the Bankruptcy Code. These special laws work well for these special firms. However, they do not work for one subset of financial firms: large financial conglomerates. This article draws three major conclusions. First, no established law can succeed with these firms. Second, the ""bail-in"" process, which is currently under development, should succeed. Finally, policymakers and corporate finance theorists might want to rethink the meaning of capital for financial firms."
K00|The Interrelationship between Formal and Informal Decentralization and Its Impact on Subcentral Governance Performance: the Case of Vietnam|Formal and informal institutions are often viewed as complements or substitutes in empirical and theoretical studies. In this article, we find no evidence of complementary or substitutive relationships in our empirical analysis of the relationship between formal and informal decentralization across 64 provinces in Vietnam. Instead, the formally decentralized system of public goods and service provision accommodates the informal one, and informal decentralization in public order provision tends to compete with the existing and ineffective formal system. This implies that the central government needs to reorganize the decentralized provision of public order and public goods and services to make informal institutions complements to rather than competitors of or free-riders on formal institutions.(JEL codes: D73, H11, H73, H83, K00)
K00|Patent Trolls, Litigation, and the Market for Innovation|We examine the role of non-practicing entities (NPEs), often called patent trolls, in patent litigation. We present a theoretical model that predicts that cases with NPE patentees resolve faster. We test this prediction using a hand-collected data set of US patent litigation cases. We find that NPEs challenge larger and more technology intensive firms, and use more valuable patents from technology areas that have a less fragmented ownership base compared to the control group. Controlling for these factors, we find that NPE cases are indeed resolved faster. NPEs help to increase the speed of diffusion of technology into the economy; therefore, increasing the effectiveness of the market for innovation.
