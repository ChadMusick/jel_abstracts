K20|Money Laundering And Corruption: Birds Of A Feather Flock Together|This paper is the first to analyse the three-way relationship among money laundering, anti-money-laundering efforts and corruption. On the one hand, if we assume that the goal of criminals involved in corruption is to minimize the probability of being detected, then corruption represents a demand for money laundering (trigger effect), while money laundering can serve as an effective way to clean the revenue from corruption for re-investment (multiplier effect). On the other hand, criminals can try to maximize the likelihood that anti-money-laundering activities will be ineffective. Corruption can be an effective device for maximizing this likelihood, as organized crime may corrupt financial institutions – both regulators and regulated firms – in order to prevent crime detection (accelerator effect). The paper proposes a novel theoretical framework for these interconnections, which is then used to simulate the three effects in 101 countries for the period 1990 to 2040.

K20|Economic and regulatory aspects of crypto-assets|TIn this study, we investigate the economic characteristics of bitcoin and similar crypto-assets. Following an introduction to the blockchain protocol, the role of exchanges and of digital wallet providers, we consider the regulatory measures adopted in various jurisdictions. Lastly, we examine the accounting and prudential aspects related to crypto-assets, of which significant uncertainties still remain. The paper provides a taxonomy of crypto-assets, and describes the basic features of the initial coin offerings (ICOs) and related aspects. The literature shows that bitcoin, and similar crypto-assets, do not fully fall within the category of money and financial instruments. This class of digital tokens, based on a permissionless distributed ledger technology (DLT), is highly volatile and absent of intrinsic value. The instability of their price, which is often undetermined, must be considered when evaluating these instruments from an accounting and prudential standpoint.
K20|Regulated occupations in Italy: extent and labor market effects|This work provides a descriptive assessment of regulated occupations in Italy and examines the impact of regulation on the labor market. First, we construct, on the basis of law provisions, a set of novel indicators measuring both the extensive and the intensive margin of regulation. We then show that regulated occupations represent a significant and increasing fraction of total employment (24%), their incidence being significantly larger among workers with a college degree (52%). Moreover, these occupations are characterized by lower mobility and entry rates and by a wage premium of about 9%, which raises to 18% for the professioni ordinistiche. Finally, we provide causal evidence that the reduction of entry requirements and the repeal of tariff restrictions lead to an increase in entry into regulated occupations and to a reduction of the wages of the incumbents.

K20|Ten Facts on Declining Business Dynamism and Lessons from Endogenous Growth Theory|In this paper, we review the literature on declining business dynamism and its implications in the United States and propose a unifying theory to analyze the symptoms and the potential causes of this decline. We first highlight 10 pronounced stylized facts related to declining business dynamism documented in the literature and discuss some of the existing attempts to explain them. We then describe a theoretical framework of endogenous markups, innovation, and competition that can potentially speak to all of these facts jointly. We next explore some theoretical predictions of this framework, which are shaped by two interacting forces: a composition effect that determines the market concentration and an incentive effect that determines how firms respond to a given concentration in the economy. The results highlight that a decline in knowledge diffusion between frontier and laggard firms could be a significant driver of empirical trends observed in the data. This study emphasizes the potential of growth theory for the analysis of factors behind declining business dynamism and the need for further investigation in this direction.
K20|Equity Finance: Matching Liability to Power|There is widespread concern that the bonus culture for senior managers in limited liability companies is having adverse effects, e.g. on risk-taking, leverage and lower longer-term investment. The moral hazard of limited liability was appreciated in the 19th century, when unlimited or multiple liability, especially for bankers, was widely adopted. Whereas outside, notably retail, investors still need the protection of limited liability, we advocate moving towards a two-tier equity system, primarily for banks, with insiders, senior managers and others with influence over corporate decisions, becoming subject to multiple liability. But the transition costs of doing so suddenly would be great, so our proposal is to start by applying this initially just to Systemically Important Financial Intermediaries.

K20|De l’intérêt de créer un nouveau concept: la lucrativité limitée|The Interest in Creating a New Legal Concept: Limited Lucrativity The notion of non-profit is one of the foundations of the social economy. However, this reality is never accepted as a structuring criterion in Union law. Based on an analysis of European Union law rules and the case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the purpose of this article is first to show that the concept of non-profitmaking is not operational to distinguish profit-making enterprises from social economy enterprises. On this basis, the second question will be to determine what can be done to promote a better legal recognition of the social economy and its particularities in the European system. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union defines two categories of organisations: on the one hand, those organisations that do not seek profit and, on the other hand, civil or commercial law companies, which include cooperative companies. Under European Union law, certain associations, as well as all mutuals and cooperatives, are grouped together with profit-making companies. Wheter an entity is described, under its national law, as a non-profit or for-profit entity never has any beary on the application of Union’s law. It is therefore difficult to find examples in positive law where the absence of profit is valued per se and could be considered in the application of internal market and competition legislation. However, this reality has an impact on the way economic activity is carried out. Social economy enterprises therefore do not find their place in the current legal 6 frameworks. They are positioned in the same competitive perimeter as for-profit companies. How can the singularity of social economy enterprises in terms of limited profit distribution be reflected in the European Union laws? According to the binary classification currently used, neither their complete assimilation into the for-profit category nor their classification as non-profit enterprises reflect what social economy enterprises are and their needs. The first step of a useful response was taken by the ECJ in a decision concerning cooperatives. The ongoing work of the European Commission and the European Parliament to promote the concept of social enterprise in European Union law also offers interesting avenues for reflection. To go even further, we propose to introduce into EU law the notion of limited lucrativity, which would define all organisations (sometimes also called “not-for-profit entities”) which are likely to make profits but which are not intended to distribute them to their owners because their final purpose is different. This European concept would be operational because it could lead to the application of specific rules, for example on competition, public procurement or taxation. In any case, the aim would be to restore the conditions for free and undistorted competition with profit-making companies that are not subject to the same constraints on access to capital. The introduction of this concept into Union law would lead to better political recognition and legal translation at European level of one of the strong characteristics of social economy enterprises.

In a preliminary fashion, the paper skims the surface of â€˜socialâ€™ businesses, in the broadest sense, around the world, identifying some general trends and commonalities and some differences. The paper covers jurisdictions from North and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia and describes the organisations that can be used to carry out social business.
K20|Lawyers as Meddlers in the Mediation Process - A Malaysian Perspective|"Objective - The scope of a lawyer's role is common knowledge and is often construed as one who advises on the application of the law, especially in the area of litigation or conveyancing. Nevertheless, it is pertinent to consider the role of a lawyer in mediation and the link between lawyer and mediation. Methodology/Technique - Mediation as a form of dispute resolution is arguably still at its infancy in Malaysia. Judges in Malaysia do encourage people to use mediation to settle disputes, instead of settling disputes through the court. As such, lawyers play a significant role in mediation, especially when the society regards mediation to be one effective mechanism of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), compared to litigation. Findings - As such, the term 'mediation' refers to a process that generates structure negotiation, whereby a mediator (a neutral impartial third party that is acceptable to and independent of the parties) serves to facilitate agreement between the parties involved to resolve their disputes in a systematic manner by isolating the dispute issues, developing alternatives, and reaching a viable and acceptable resolution that satisfy the involved parties. Since the mediator plays the role in the mediation process, how does a lawyer play his role in the mediation process? Does he serve as a meddler in the mediation process? Novelty - A mediator claimed, ""…involvement of solicitors is significant. They comprehend the dynamics of positive engagement, apart from having the ability and being prepared for a constructive negotiation so as to look for resolutions, rather than reinforcing litigation. They possess the ability to offer advice and provide guidance to their clients as they seize the opportunity to bring matter to an end. This is an exceptional instance of professionalism at its best."" This statement has become, at present time, 'how does a lawyer apply his present skills in mediation settlement?"
K20|Legal form determination for the development of clusters' activities|In this study, the authors have investigated the determination of the most suitable legal form for the development of the cluster management activities. In each particular case the developers of the cluster have to assess the objectives of the cluster, the principal aspects of the mutual partnership, the risks that could be provoked, and in accordance with the derived decisions. The choice of the cluster legal activity form depends on the objectives and on the branch in which the cluster is operating, on the number of the cluster participants, on the type of the activities of the cluster, on the openness or closeness to new members, type of the contributions of the partners and the other factors. The most reliable solution regarding the choice of the model of the functioning and management of the cluster has to be derived as well legal regulation of the legal form of the activity discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of two models of the cluster formation discussed. During experimental evaluation, the significance of criteria was determined and the expert evaluation on legal form for the development of clusters activities was performed. Foundation and management of the clusters are determined firstly by the fact that in one case a new established legal person performs the functions of the cluster coordinator while in another case one of the cluster participants performs the functions and partners legal cooperation determined by Agreement on Partnership. Article analyses the multi-criteria decisions-making to establish the cluster with the certain type of juridical form of legal person or to develop cluster management activities by the Partnership Agreement. The recommendations presented by application of MCDM calculus methods with aspect of percentage.

K20|The determinants of Foreign Direct Investment: Do statutory restrictions matter?|Over the past two decades, governments worldwide have continued to liberalise restrictions on international investment with only occasional relapses. Yet, FDI liberalisation remains an unfinished agenda in various parts of the world and across sectors. This paper sheds light on their potential costs in terms of foregone investments. Applying an augmented gravity model, covering 60 advanced and emerging countries over the period 1997–2016, it estimates the elasticity of bilateral FDI positions and cross-border M&A activity to FDI restrictions as measured by the OECD FDI Regulatory Restrictiveness Index. Results suggest that reforms liberalising FDI restrictions by about 10% as measured by the Index could increase bilateral FDI in stocks by 2.1% on average. Effects are greater for FDI in the services sector, but even manufacturing sectors – which are typically open to FDI – are negatively affected by countries’ overall restrictiveness. Foreign equity limitations and FDI screening policies are also scrutinised.
K20|The role of institutions in private participation in infrastructure revisited|This paper aims to examine institutional effects on the private participation in infrastructure (PPI) projects during the recent period for 2002-2017 with 117 sample economies, by using the PPI and the Worldwide Governance Indicators database of the World Bank. The study contributes to enriching the evidence by updating the sample time-horizon and by widening the coverage of sample economies. The main findings of this study are summarized as follow: the institutional role in promoting the PPI projects are clearly identified in terms of government governance indicators such as government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law and control of corruption; in particular, the control of corruption, which is the controversial issue in the previous studies, is confirmed to be one of the important factors to boost the PPI projects; and the macroeconomic stability is also a significant contributor for the PPI projects.
K20|Is there a safety premium in the design of corporate bond contracts?|This study examines empirically whether there is a safety premium in the design of bond contracts by highlighting a safety attribute of general mortgage bonds in Japan, which can give especially strong protection to bondholders, who would have priority in the event of legal liquidation. The effects of a safety attribute were not prominent at first in difference-in-differences analysis. However, the methods for analyzing selectivity bias allow us to provide a safety premium in the design of bond contracts, such as lower spread, lower commission, and larger issue size. The resulting bias would depend on the reputation of the bookrunner. This study uncovers the underlying link for the connection between a safety attribute and the observed and unobserved issuer and bookrunner characteristics, to indicate that a safety premium is related to various terms of bond contracts, including the bookrunner-issuer match.
K20|Треба Ли Компанијама Управљати У Интересу Акционара?<BR>[Whether Companies Need to Be Managed in the Interests of the Shareholders?]|Serbian. Једна од основних и широко заступаних поставки корпоративног управљања јесте управљање предузећима у интересу акционара, односно власника предузећа. Овај концепт заснован је на аргументима да власници имају најјачи интерес у предузећу и да од тог интереса директно зависи ефикасност пословања, док су истовремено интереси акционара најмање заштићени међу интересима свих конституената. У неким земљама тај концепт уздигнут је до апсолута (у САД као једини интерес који треба штитити истиче се интерес акционара), али и тамо где то није случај, односно где се респектују и интереси других конституената, интерес акционара је неприкосновен и истиче се у први план. У раду се разматрају основи и модалитети којима се у различитим земљама и различитим условима мотивише такав облик корпоративног управљања, као и консеквенце које такви захтеви и њихово испуњавање производе. Посебно се указује на крах концепције максимизације тржишних вредности акција, која је била изузетно популарна у последњим деценијама 20. и почетком овог века. One of the basic and widely represented corporate governance settings is corporate governance in the interests of shareholders, or company owners. This concept is based on the arguments that the owners have the strongest interest in the company and that the efficiency of the business depends directly on this interest, while at the same time the interests of shareholders are at least protected among the interests of all constituents. In some countries, this concept has been elevated to the absolute (in the United States as the only interest to be protected, the interest of shareholders is emphasized), but where this is not the case, or where the interests of other constituents are respected, the interest of the shareholders is inviolable and stands out in the first plan. The paper discusses the basis and modalities that motivate different forms of corporate governance in different countries and different conditions, as well as the consequences that such requirements and their fulfillment produce. In particular, the crash of the concept of maximizing the market value of shares, which was extremely popular in the last decades of the 20th and the beginning of this century, is particularly indicative.
K20|Joint ventures|When the new Romanian Civil Code entered into force (in 2011), both legal regulations on partnerships and joint ventured were expressly abolished, as the two regulatory documents (meaning the Civil Code of 1864 and the Business Code of 1887) were repealed in full (express repealing according to art. 230 of Law no. 71/2011 for the application of the new Civil Code).However, by means of a similar regulation, the new Civil Code took over the two types of companies without legal personality in Chapter VII (Company Contracts) of Book V (On Obligations), Title IX (Various Special Contracts). The chapter concerning company contracts consists of three distinct sections of which we will hereby approach the 2nd Section (Partnerships) and the 3rd Section (Joint ventures).In fact, in the chapter on company contracts, the new Civil Code includes special provisions referring only to the two types of companies without legal personality. Therefore, the two sections of Chapter VII (the 2nd and the 3rd Section) are the legal framework for the companies without legal personality in Romania and, at the same time, they are a special legal regulation in the matter, that is no other law may govern in this field. As we have previously shown, the Tax Code may rule on various aspects concerning the organization of this type of companies, as a special legal regulation (which applies with preference against the provisions of the Civil Code); nevertheless, we believe that, in legal terms, the tax regulations should not be allowed to change significantly the legal requirements set by the Civil Code for the establishment and operation of the companies without legal personality. Unfortunately, the regulatory contradictions between the two legal instruments (the Civil Code and the Tax Code) are obvious and of essence in some cases, therefore they cannot be overlooked; this is why we have thought it appropriate to approach such matter, namely the interference of civil and tax regulations, as this interesting topic may give rise to many debates in practice.
K20|Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as Corporate Governance Model for State Owned Enterprises (SOE)|It is widely acknowledged that Corporate Social Responsibility is a modern trend among big corporations who are taking responsibility for supporting the environment and improving social wellbeing. Majority of the Big Corporations try to follow this trend and implement Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a corporate governance and business model in their corporate structures and activities. CSR underlines the social role of Corporations and promotes their involvement in improving the working conditions of employees, ensuring safety regulations and improving the environmental protection measures. At the same time, this corporate governance model does not discourage corporations from profitable economic conduct but advocates them to support the community with strengthening the vulnerable groups of society, supporting small businesses, providing trainings, coordinating activities with non-commercial entities, etc. Although, if the CSR is a free choice generally for commercial entities, it becomes somehow ?mandatory? for State Shareholding enterprises. These are enterprises where state is holding all or majority of shares. As these corporations are owned by the state, and therefore, indirectly by the society, corporate social responsibility should be a mandatory corporate governance model for such companies. This will enhance their role in serving public. However, in many countries State Owned Enterprises (SOE) lack transparency and openness which affects their accountability level as well. With low level of transparency, it is difficult to define the social and environmental benefits implemented by the SOE. The aim of this speech will be to highlight the importance of Corporate Social Responsibility for State Owned Enterprises. At the same time, the speech will provide new understanding of CSR, with characterizing CSR as a governance model which includes the transparency, openness and higher accountability of the corporations before community. Emphasizing, that state corporations should serve public not only in a social and environmentally safe way but also in a responsible, open and accountable manner.This speech will be presented as part of the findings of the Scientific Project. This work was supported by Shota Rustaveli National Science Foundation (SRNSF) [Grant Number: #217878; Project Title: Legal Regulation, Challenges and Recommendations for Effective Corporate Governance System in State Shareholding Enterprises]. The speech will be presented by the Head of the Project - Davit Maisuradze.
K20|International legal relations in troubled times and their impact on substantive elements of international trade|Trade between different countries forms a significant part of national economic development worldwide. The significance of the interdependence of countries is increasing with rising globalisation (Helpman, 2011). To facilitate cross-border cooperation, including trade, countries form associations and other cooperative units with established rules, often with economic advantages, amongst the Member States. The European Union (the ?EU?) and the European Economic Area (the ?EEA?) are relevant examples of the above cooperation. One of the main objectives of the EU is the establishment of an internal market without internal frontiers ensuring the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital (Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union 2012, Art. 26). The EEA unites the EU countries with Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, allowing the non-EU members to enjoy the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital without internal frontiers similarly (Agreement on the European Economic Area, 1994, Art. 1). The United Kingdom (the ?UK?) is a Member State of the EU (and therefore the EEA) allowing it to be part of the concept of an internal market. However, the situation for the UK might be changed in the future due to the UK?s EU membership referendum which took place on 23rd June 2016 resulting in the majority of voters expressing their desire for the UK to leave the EU (the UK leaving the EU also ?BREXIT?). BREXIT will inevitably impact various aspects of the existing legal establishment. The area of Private international law (the ?PIL?), encompassing the determination of applicable law, jurisdiction of courts and enforcement of foreign judgement, will be influenced to a significant extent. The paper will briefly examine the current legal establishment and the options the UK has concerning future arrangements of the PIL rules. Further, the paper will investigate future jurisdictional competence, enforceability of foreign judgements taking into consideration the development in a field of international arbitration, specifically the enforcement of arbitration awards and control of arbitration proceedings in the BREXIT context. The paper aims to identify the challenges brought by the potential removal of the current EU PIL regime which can be considered as a ?safety net?.
K20|Minimum Asset and Liability Insurance Requirements on Judgment-Proof Individuals When Harm is Endogenous|Minimum asset requirements are an increasingly common form of regulation intended to motivate better decision making by individuals who participate in potentially harmful ac- tivities. Shavell (2005) studied the optimality of this type of regulation within a framework in which an individual can influence the probability of an accident but not the magnitude of the resultant harm. We reinvestigate Shavell's model for the opposite accident scenario, in which an individual can influence the magnitude of harm but not the probability of an accident, and find policy implications different than Shavell's. In particular, we show that in certain situations it could be optimal to completely ban judgment-proof individuals from participating in a potentially harmful activity. We also examine the effect of liability insurance, and find that regulatory authorities should tighten standards relative to the pure asset requirement and that liability insurance increases social welfare.
K20|Insights into the Impact of Bankruptcy's Public Record on Entrepreneurial Activity: Evidence from Economic Experiments|Many Anglo-American jurisdictions aim to provide debtors with a ‘fresh start’ after a personal bankruptcy. However, we query the extent to which debtors can achieve a fresh start if records of individual bankruptcies are publicly available, with no restrictions on their use. To inform the legal policy question of whether bankruptcy records should be publicly available, we study the effect of the availability of bankruptcy records, compared to their non-existence, in an economic experiment. The experiment allows us to identify empirically the effect that the exposure of bankruptcy history has on the behaviour of investors and debtors. Our exploratory research shows that the availability of bankruptcy records increases investment. Availability also increases repayment behaviour by debtors, but only if the debtor has no history of bankruptcy (non-return of payments). If, however, a debtor failed to return payments in the past, and this information is available, debtors show lower instances of return behaviour.
K20|Does occupational deregulation affect in-company vocational training? – Evidence from the 2004 Reform of the German Trade and Crafts Code|The European Commission actively evaluates occupational entry restrictions in all member states. This has attracted a growing interest among scholars of the German crafts sector as it is governed by an idiosyncratic national set of rules. We estimate the effects of the deregulation of the German Trade and Crafts Code in 2004 on the overall vocational training levels in affected crafts trades. We employ Difference-in-Differences regressions as well as Synthetic Control Methods on data for the entire population of the German crafts sector. We show that the overall effect of the reform on vocational training levels was negative, and is largely driven by the additional costs of obtaining a training license in the deregulated sector.
K20|Institutional convergence in Europe|This paper applies the statistical concepts of σ-convergence and unconditional β-convergence to institutional development within several country groups hierarchized to the degree of European integration (e.g., euro area). Two sets of indicators are employed to measure institutional development: first, the Worldwide Governance Indicators, and second, the product market regulation indicator of the OECD and the Doing Business distance to frontier indicator of the World Bank. The authors can clearly confirm institutional β-convergence within the EU and its aspirants, which is mainly driven by the new Member States and acceding, candidate, and potential candidate countries. However, euro-area countries converge only in the area of product market and business regulation- not in the area of governance. In fact, the authors show evidence for β-divergence in rule of law within the first twelve euro-area members. Concerning σ-convergence, the results are less clear. Only the EU including the EU aspirants reduced the cross-country variance in all aspects of institutional development.
K20|Detecting the Fifty Shades of Grey: Local Crime, Suspicious Transaction Reporting and Anti-Money Laundering Regulation|This paper investigates the efficiency of the suspicious transaction reporting (STR) activity to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) as a means to deter money laundering. A baseline theoretical model is used as a framework to guide the empirical analysis of the relationship between STR and the vulnerability of Italian provinces to money laundering in the 2008-2013 period. Instrumental variables are used to limit the problems stemming from the endogenous nature of the number of reports to the FIU with respect to vulnerability. Results provide a positive assessment of the riskbased mechanism of reporting suspicious operations to the FIU.
K20|Bargaining tools for the resolution of distressed firms: judicial composition with creditors|The paper provides a large set of new evidence about the workings of judicial composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) procedures based on a new dataset, specifically compiled, which constitutes the richest source of information currently available on the functioning of these procedures. Judicial composition with creditors is mainly used for the piecemeal liquidation of firms (about 70 per cent of the cases). Less than a quarter of judicial compositions with creditors fulfill the provisions of the plans. The recovery rate for secured loans is almost 100 per cent for all types of compositions, while for unsecured loans, recovery rates vary considerably: from 18 per cent in the case of piecemeal liquidation to 37 per cent in the case of restructuring (23 per cent for judicial composition with creditors that provides for the sale of the entire firm or of a branch). Regression analysis shows that better performance of judicial compositions with creditors is associated with a less chronic crisis at the time the judicial composition with creditors is initiated, measured as the time that passes between the earliest persistent difficulties faced by the firm in fulfilling its obligations to bank creditors and the initiation of the procedure.
K20|Self-regulation and Meta-regulation – Regulating the Members or the SRO. A Theoretical and Experimental Study|"Regulatory investigations by Self-Regulatory organizations (SROs) are usually considered cheaper than investigations by a government. However, in practice, oversight by an SRO is mostly still supplemented by governmental oversight. The government may exert oversight over the SRO itself, a construction referred to as “meta-regulation"" or ""co-regulation"", or oversee members of the SRO. Indeed, the overall performance of SROs has been mixed, and theoretical models show that they have incentives to set lax standards or to cover up detected violations. Nonetheless, some research indicates that meta-regulation, oversight of the SRO itself, may not be necessary in some settings. Using a costly-state-verification model, DeMarzo et al. (2001; 2005) show that when the government implicitly threatens to conduct additional investigations of SRO members, a relatively ""good"" outcome can be established as an equilibrium. In this ""good"" outcome, the SRO chooses to follow high performance standards in order to pre-empt any (relatively costly) governmental investigation. As a result, no costly governmental investigations of the SRO members take place, and no meta-regulation of the SRO is necessary. I extend this model to include plausible settings in which the actual rigor of oversight by the SRO can be verified only ex-post. I show that in such settings, an SRO may have incentives to announce stricter regimes than it effectively implements and that, as a result, a ""bad"", Paretoinefficient outcome may be established as an equilibrium. In the ""bad"" outcome, the SRO relinquishes all oversight to the government. The predictions of this model are supported by experimental tests. The ""good"" equilibrium could be re-established with sufficient metaregulation of the SRO. The results thus suggest a continuing need for meta-regulation in these settings. This form of meta-regulation may be of a relatively light nature, limited to verifying and sanctioning that the SRO implements its announced policies."
K20|Myths and Numbers on Whistleblower Rewards|Whistleblower rewards have been used extensively in the US to limit procurement fraud and tax evasion, and their use has been extended to fight financial fraud after the recent financial crisis. In Europe there is currently a debate on their possible introduction, but authorities appear considerably less enthusiastic than their US counterparts. While it is important that these tools are scrutinized by a lively democratic debate, many things have been written, even by important institutional players, that have no empirical backing or that are in open contrast with the available evidence from independent research. In this paper we review some of the most debated issues regarding the potential benefits and costs of financial incentives whistleblowers trying to separate existing empirical evidence from conjectures with no empirical support, and myths in obvious contrast with available evidence.
K20|Is the EU Disinformation Review Compliant with EU Law? Complaint to the European Ombudsman About the EU Anti-Fake News Initiative|The EU’s approach to fake news, as epitomised by the European External Action (EEAS) Service East Stratcom Disinformation Review, violates the rights to freedom of expression and due process of those accused of distributing disinformation. The EU Disinformation Review is a publication of the European External Action Service (the European Union’s diplomatic service) to target fake news and online disinformation. Following our request for access to documents, EEAS conceded that the EU Disinformation Review uses an “ad hoc” methodology for conducting its fact-checks, which makes it an outlier in the international fact-checking community led by the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). Despite being a well-intentioned initiative to respond to the challenges posed by pro-Kremlin disinformation, the EU should ensure the respect of fundamental rights when engaging in fact-checking. The EU Disinformation Review seeks to control the right to freedom of expression by labelling publishers as “disinforming outlets” and their content as “disinformation,” creating a chilling effect on the work of journalists that is central to democracy. The right to freedom of expression is expressed in Article 11.1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2000/C 364/01) and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The labelling of publishers as “disinformation outlets” is contrary to principle of the freedom of press established by the European Court of Human Rights: “[a] general requirement for journalists systematically and formally to distance themselves from the content of a quotation that might insult or provoke others or damage their reputation is not reconcilable with the press’ role of providing information on current events, opinion and ideas.” In addition, the methodology used by EEAS in the EU Disinformation Review is “ad hoc,” which constitutes a violation of the fundamental right to good administration in Article 41 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. Specifically, the ad hoc design and operation of the EU Disinformation Review fails to ensure the review acts “impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time.” First, publications are not provided with the right to be heard or proper notice. The EU Disinformation Review’s homepage offers an opportunity to contact the Task Force report a suspected mistake in a fact-check but the page is only available in English, in violation of the principle of multilingualism, and no notice if given to outlets accused of being “disinforming outlets” before or after fact-checks of their content are published. Second, the EEAS does not fulfil its duty to motivate. EEAS is given a broad margin of discretion to identify disinformation, but fails to do so according to a consistent methodology. Therefore, EEAS cannot justify, on the basis of objective criteria, its choice of which content to review and how to determine its truth or falsehood. To comply with EU law and ensure the respect of fundamental rights, the EEAS should develop and make public (1) a methodology for selecting partnerships and reviewing fact-checks in line with international standards and (2) a notice and response mechanism for journalists, publishers and citizens whose content is being reviewed. If EEAS is unable to comply with the above, the EU Disinformation Review should be shut down.
K20|Corporate Investment Under the Cloud of Litigation|We study the effect of legal risk on firmsâ€™ investment. Using legal risk measures based on the number of litigious words in SEC 10-K filings, we find legal risk reduces investment. Underlying mechanisms include both i) a financing channel, whereby legal risk reduces credit ratings, increases bank loan costs, and decreases borrowing, and ii) an attention channel, whereby legal risk consumes top-managementâ€™s attention. Accordingly, we find legal risk has negative effects on firmsâ€™ investment efficiency and stock performance. We address endogeneity concerns through a DiD analysis utilizing staggered adoptions of universal demand laws across states.
K20|Corporate insolvency procedures in England: The uneasy case for liquidations|Our paper investigates a comprehensive sample of 574 English corporate insolvency cases, including direct liquidation cases. In contrast to other insolvency procedures, liquidations perform poorly on average and fail to produce satisfactory repayments to creditors. We run multinomial Logit regressions to explain the choice between liquidation and reorganization. We obtain three main results. First, we confirm that size matters: distressed firms owning low assets have higher chances of being liquidated immediately. Second, the presence of secured creditors decreases the risk of direct liquidation. This provides a clue that in England, the most-informed creditors adapt their strategies and turn away from the less-performing procedures. Third, we find that the likelihood of administration—which appears nowadays as the main alternative to direct liquidation—significantly depends on the proportion of fixed/current assets owned by the firms.
K20|Mapping the OECD Government Procurement Taxonomy with International Best Practices: An Implementation to ASEAN Countries|The OECD developed a taxonomy of measures affecting government procurement which provides a classification system for different GP measures, policies and procedures, which can impact cross-border government procurement. This project aims to further assist countries in assessing their procurement regimes by mapping the taxonomy against international good practices. The project maps the taxonomy against both the WTO Government Procurement Agreement and the UNCITRAL Model Law on Public Procurement (2011). It further tests this methodology with data collection in four ASEAN countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Viet Nam).
K20|Vulnerability to Money Laundering and Crime Deterrence: Evidence from Italy|This paper examines the economy's vulnerability to money laundering in a given region. Assuming that criminals are rational investors who take into account risks and returns of both legal and illegal investments, we define vulnerability as a function of well-identified drivers. Proxies of these variables are used to empirically investigate the relationship between the institutional/economic characteristics of Italian provinces and their vulnerability to money laundering in the 2008-2013 period. We focus on the impact of the reporting of suspicious transactions to the Financial Intelligence Unit, by using instrumental variables to address endogeneity in the relationship between the number of reports made and our measure of vulnerability. Results highlight positive effects of the institutional policies adopted to fight money laundering, especially as far as the reporting of suspicious transactions is concerned. Further dimensions of local vulnerability are outlined: time-invariant heterogeneity across provinces, showing that certain areas are more systematically vulnerable because of persistent local features that cannot be individually identified; and idiosyncratic vulnerability, which pinpoints the fact that some provinces have been periodically subject to abnormally intense money-laundering activity.
K20|End of 9-Endings and Price Perceptions|We take advantage of a natural experiment to document an emergence of a new price ending that has the same effects as 9-endings. In January 2014, the Israeli parliament has passed a law prohibiting the use of non 0-ending prices. We find that one year after 9-ending prices have disappeared, 90-ending prices acquired the same status as 9-ending prices had before the law was passed. 90-ending prices became the new psychological price points. The retailers and the shoppers both reacted to the regulatory intervention optimally, which has eliminated the regulation’s intended effect.
K20|Evaluating market consolidation in mobile communications|We study the dual relationship between market structure and prices and between market structure and investment in mobile telecommunications. Using a uniquely constructed panel of mobile operators’ prices and accounting information across 33 OECD countries between 2002 and 2014, we document that more concentrated markets lead to higher end user prices. Furthermore, they also lead to higher investment per mobile operator, though the impact on total investment is not conclusive. Our findings are not only relevant for the current consolidation wave in the telecommunications industry. More generally, they stress that competition and regulatory authorities should take seriously the potential trade-off between market power effects and efficiency gains stemming from agreements between firms.
K20|Whistleblower Rewards, False Reports, and Corporate Fraud|It is often claimed that rewards for whistleblowers lead to fraudulent reports, but for several US programs this has not been a major problem. We model the interaction be- tween rewards for whistleblowers, sanctions against fraudulent reporting, judicial errors and standards of proof in the court case on a whistleblower.s allegations and the pos- sible follow-up for fraudulent allegations. Balancing whistleblower rewards, sanctions against fraudulent reports, and courts.standards of proof is essential for these policies to succeed. When the risk of retaliation is severe, larger rewards are needed and so are tougher sanctions against fraudulent reports. The precision of the legal system must be su¢ ciently high, hence these programs are not viable in weak institution environ- ments, where protection is imperfect and court precision low, or where sanctions against false reporting are mild. Internal reporting channels may interfere with external ones in unexpected ways.
K20|"Neoliberalism and Regulatory Capitalism: Understanding the ""Freer Markets More Rules"" Puzzle"|"Over the past four decades, across the OECD countries and beyond, we observe a simultaneous increase (a) in the number, the budgets and the staffing of regulatory agencies, as well as the number of regulations, and (b) of economic liberalization, as measured by economic freedom and doing business indices. This is the ""freer markets, more rules"" or ""more capitalism, more regulations"" puzzle. This puzzle provides a window into the underlining mechanisms behind the complex regulatory developments in advanced democracies and transition economies, showcasing both some convergence trends and some diversity of the regulatory national patterns. Before the recent post-financial crisis backlash, the neoliberal agenda of privatization and deregulation seems to have happened in a roundabout manner as a side-effect of regulatory capitalism, rather than by implementing the policy and institutional recommendations of authors like Hayek, Friedman, and Buchanan. Three common hypotheses about ""neoliberalism"" don't work very well: pro-market ideology as a driver of policy, rent-seeking in favor of deregulation, and markets outpacing attempts at government regulation. Two other hypotheses provide better insight: a heterogeneous regulatory environment allows private firms to engage in regulatory arbitrage, and political entrepreneurs under public finance constraints look for novel ways of obtaining tax revenues. The emerging picture provides a serious challenge to both critics and supporters of neoliberalism."
K20|Quorum Rules and Shareholder Power|This paper characterizes the equilibria of a costly voting game in which shareholders heterogeneous in both size and preferences strategically vote for or against a proposed resolution or withhold. It is shown that a minimum quorum generates (1) equilibria in which one or several shareholders form voting coalitions in favor of the resolution that is adopted (2) an equilibrium in which shareholders strategically abstain from voting and the resolution is rejected. The size of blockholders and their preferences (in favor or against the resolution) play a crucial role in the existence of equilibria, their nature, the size and the number of voters in coalitions. We derive conditions under which the dominant shareholder controls the meeting. We also examine how large shareholders influence the result of the vote. In particular, we analyze the interaction between blockholders and discuss the situations in which large shareholders jointly control annual meetings or form coalitions to counter the dominant shareholder.
K20|Towards EU Legislation on Human Rights Due Diligence: Case Study of the Garment and Textile Sector|This study assesses the legal feasibility of a EU instrument that would impose mandatory human rights due diligence (“HRDD”) requirements on companies in the garment and textile sector. The proposal serves as an example of a sector-specific approach to HRDD requirements, and could be modified to develop similar proposals in other sectors. The study also illustrates the differences between a sector-specific and a cross-sectoral approach by highlighting the implications of each in the following areas: legal bases, personal scope, and requirements and enforcement.
K20|Determinants of Islamic Banks Acceptance in Oman|This paper discusses about the inception of Islamic banking in Oman. This paper would discuss the Islamic Banking Regulatory Framework (IBRF) under which the Islamic banking system is operating. The two full fledged banks which are working in Oman are Alizz Islamic Bank, Bank Nizwa and there are 6 Islamic windows which are working in Oman. The study would be related to the factors which influence the customers’ attraction towards Islamic banking in Oman
K20|Are international accounting standards more credit relevant than domestic standards?|We examine whether the credit relevance of financial statements, defined as the ability of accounting numbers to explain credit ratings, is higher after firms are required to report under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). We find an improvement in credit relevance for firms in 17 countries after mandatory IFRS reporting is introduced in 2005; this increase is higher than that reported for a matched sample of US firms. The increase in credit relevance is particularly pronounced for higher risk speculative-grade issuers, where accounting information is predicted to be more important; and for IFRS adopters with large first-time reconciliations, where the impact of IFRS is expected to be greater. These tests provide reassurance that the overall enhancement in estimated credit relevance is driven by accounting changes related to IFRS adoption. Our results suggest that credit rating analysts’ views of economic fundamentals are more closely aligned with IFRS numbers, and that analysts anticipate at least some of the effects of the IFRS transition.
K20|Analyzing the Influence of Occupational Licensing Duration and Grandfathering on Labor Market Outcomes|The length of time from the implementation of an occupational licensing statute (i.e., licensing duration) may matter in influencing labor market outcomes. Adding to or raising the entry barriers are likely easier once an occupation is established and has gained influence in a political jurisdiction. States often enact grandfather clauses and ratchet up requirements that protect existing workers and increase entry costs to new entrants. We analyze the labor market influence of the duration of occupational licensing statutes for 13 major universally licensed occupations over a 75-year period. These occupations comprise the vast majority of workers in these regulated occupations in the United States. We provide among the first estimates of potential economic rents to grandfathering. We find that duration years of occupational licensure are positively associated with wages for continuing and grandfathered workers. The estimates show a positive relationship of duration with hours worked, but we find moderately negative results for participation in the labor market. The universally licensed occupations, however, exhibit heterogeneity in outcomes. Consequently, unlike some other labor market public policies, such as minimum wages or direct unemployment insurance benefits, occupational licensing would likely influence labor market outcomes when measured over a longer period of time.
K20|The Position Of The Bank Indonesia As The Lender Of Last Resort After The Enactment Of Law No. 9 Of 2016 On Prevention And Mitigation Of Financial System Crisis|Objective – This paper explores the role of the Indonesian Central Bank as the Lender of the Last Resort. Methodology/Technique – This research uses normative juridical research and secondary data. Findings – The results indicate that the Bank of Indonesian, in coordination with the Financial Services Authority, still has the authority to grant short-term loans for banks with liquidity issues. Nevertheless, the Bank of Indonesia does not have authority to provide emergency finance facilities where the funding is granted at the government's expense. Novelty – This paper uses normative juridical research and qualitative data analysis.

Findings – The main finding that the framework Islamic business model in perspective Islam proposed previously can be well understanding and applied in BMT UGT Sidogiri. The result showed that there three main building in developing of an Islamic business model consist of the business foundation, business design, and business development. Novelty – The model can be used to optimize the potential business model of Islam in BMT UGT Sidogiri and other microfinance in Indonesia in the future."""
K20|Voluntary Bankruptcy as Preemptive Persuasion|This paper examines the phenomenon of management-initiated, court-supervised reorganization of companies in U.S. bankruptcy court. The proposed in-court persuasion mechanism reconciles excessive reorganizations of non-viable companies (and subsequent repeat failures) with management-initiated filings and a judge who aims to always take appropriate action. In the model, management makes a preemptive voluntary filing to retain control of the process, and thereby engage in a game of Bayesian Persuasion with asymmetric information vis-à-vis the judge. This mechanism endogenously results in the reorganization of some non-viable companies, and exclusively management-initiated (i.e., voluntary) bankruptcy filings. This paper, therefore, explains why non-viable companies could be permitted to reorganize and why there are repeat offender firms that enter bankruptcy multiple times.
K20|Compliance Programs, Signaling and Firms' Internal Coordination|Fines imposed on firms for corporate infringements such as cartels reduce these infringement's profitability. When a manager knows when a violation is unprofitable he can prevent violations committed by an uninformed employee by investing in compliance programs (CPs). Investments can be interpreted as signals. The paper shows that there exists a separating equilibrium where high investments in CPs induce the employee to obey the law. However, if CPs are too expensive the signal is not credible. The manager can also show personal commitment to compliance ('tone-at-the-top'). Coordination on an efficient outcome will then be achievable if commitment is costly. Imposing high, individual sanctions on the manager disturbs a firm's internal coordination because he is unable to credibly signal that an infringement does not pay off for the firm. However, imposing sanctions on the employee unambiguously deters violation.
K20|The Impact of Incentive Pay on Corporate Crime|This paper presents a moral hazard model analyzing the agent's incentive to commit corporate crime. The principal can only observe profits which the agent can increase by committing crime or exerting effort. It is shown how different incentive contracts, i.e., thresholdlinear, capped bonus and linear contracts, can be adjusted in order to promote agent's law abiding behavior. Any adjustment implies a loss in internal efficiency which decreases in individual sanctions imposed on the agent.
K20|Optimal Regulation with Exemptions|Despite decades of research on mechanism design and on many practical aspects of cost-benefit analysis, one of the most basic and ubiquitous features of regulation as actually implemented throughout the world has received little theoretical attention: exemptions for small firms. These firms may generate a disproportionate share of harm due to their being exempt and because exemption induces additional harmful activity to be channeled their way. This article analyzes optimal regulation with exemptions where firms have different productivities that are unobservable to the regulator, regulated and unregulated output each cause harm although at different levels, and the regulatory regime affects entry as well as the output choices of regulated and unregulated firms. In many settings, optimal schemes involve subtle effects and have counterintuitive features: for example, higher regulatory costs need not favor higher exemptions, and the incentives of firms to drop output to become exempt can be too weak as well as too strong. A final section examines the optimal use of output taxation alongside regulation, which illustrates the contrast with the mechanism design approach that analyzes the optimal use of instruments of a type that are not in widespread use.
K20|OECD taxonomy of measures affecting trade in government procurement processes|This paper develops a taxonomy of government procurement (GP) measures to provide a basis for further analysis. It aims to undertake a more comprehensive, albeit not exhaustive, collection of GP barriers across countries, and to develop a classification system of GP measures to facilitate further data collection and analysis. The output is a taxonomy of different GP measures, policies and procedures which can impact cross-border public procurement.

K20|End of 9-endings, price recall, and price perceptions|Prices that end with 9, also known as psychological price points, are common, comprising about 70% of the retail prices. They are also more rigid than other prices. We take advantage of a natural experiment to document an emergence of a new price ending that has the same effects as 9-endings. In January 2014, the Israeli government passed a new regulation prohibiting the use of non 0-ending prices, bringing an end to 9-ending prices. We find that seven months after 9-ending prices have disappeared, 90-ending prices acquired the same status as 9-ending prices had before the new regulation was adopted. Thus, 90-ending prices became the new psychological price points, partially eliminating the regulation’s intended effect.

K20|Does Corruption Ease the Burden of Regulation? National and Subnational Evidence|Does corruption ease the burden of regulation? We test this question using survey data on business managers’ experience of dealing with regulation and corruption. We find that there is substantial within-country variation in the burden of regulation and that corruption is associated with worse regulatory outcomes across a range of indicators at the country and subnational level. Our results, which hold over a number of specifications, are inconsistent with the hypothesis that corruption greases the wheels of commerce by easing the burden of regulation on the average firm in poor regulatory environments. Rather, our results suggest that corruption increases the burden and imposes large costs on businesses

K20|?By Failing To Prepare, You Are Preparing To Fail?: The Importance Of Teaching Legal Risk Management, Governance And Compliance To Law Students|High profile corporate scandals have not only taught us that the loss of reputation can have a significant, if not, fatal effect on a company but also ensured that the study and implementation of legal risk management is at the forefront of the UK?s business and legal sectors. The significance of the complex assortment of new and often contradictory laws and regulations with which companies are faced in today?s global business environment should not be underestimated. Many international companies recognise this and invest heavily in implementing internal mechanisms and controls to detect and prevent compliance breaches. However, such systems and controls cannot succeed without the development of a strong compliance culture that gets ?buy-in? from all levels of a business. At the heart of this compliance culture is a company?s legal and compliance manager(s). Effective legal risk management and compliance requires a company?s legal and compliance manager(s) to gain a substantive knowledge of business and societal risks, awareness and insight into regulation and regulatory changes as well as an understanding of the potential impact of regulation on their organisation. Once these risks have been identified, and appropriate regulatory challenges ascertained, a business must develop, implement and communicate internal policies and ensure that effective control systems are also in place.In order to prove both efficient and effective, a business? legal and compliance manager(s) must draw informed links between regulation and the formulation of sound internal policies related to risks and controls at all relevant levels of their organisation. They must also implementation appropriate procedures to support such policies. Consequently, in order to be effective, a company?s legal and compliance manager(s) must not just identify problems but, more importantly, draw upon proven solutions to ensure success. The legal risk management process relies on a business? ability to manage processes, implement change, track issues, screen potential clients, partners and employees and to implement appropriate remediation.The pressure on management to ensure that a business operates in a compliant way is considerable, and growing. Managers must be permanently on their guard against things going wrong and, as such, are reliant on their legal and compliance manager(s) being ever vigilant and seeking to reduce risk to a minimum. The authors argue that in order to gain a well-rounded, informed business-focused preparation for work within the legal sector, every law student should, at some stage, gain a grounding in Legal Risk Management, Governance & Compliance.
K20|Offshore Societies in ?Panama Papers? era. Latin American Dilemmas about tax evasion and foreign investment incentive|The research problem is: Should the Colombian State restrict the inflow of capital through the use of offshore companies and avoid tax evasion in this way? This problem contemplate two current scenes: Firstly, Colombian State should prevent the inflow of foreign investment based on offshore companies established in tax havens, because these are used as a strategy to avoid paying taxes. Secondly, Colombian State should not restrict access of foreign investment by means of offshore companies. However, to guarantee due taxation cooperation agreements with those countries considered by the OECD as tax havens, should be signed in order to achieve greater control and monitoring of financial movements.The presentation defines the legal nature of offshore companies, assessing their advantages and the relationship they have with tax havens. It describes the effect of Colombian law on the issue and the impact that these societies have on the system of taxation and the financing of social policies. It identifies the criminal consequences that arise when these types of societies are used as a mechanism of money laundering or tax avoidance and will analyze the implications for a developing country such as Colombia, to restrict or prevent their entry into the country.
K20|A Legal Effect of European Union's Business Law Policy: Single Member Companies in Turkish Law|The concept of single-member company has been studied in the doctrine by lawyers and economists for more than hundred years. Single-member companies have become widespread by virtue of the European Union?s legal instructions and mostly subsequent acceleration of states? legislation efforts in order to allow foundation of single-member companies pursuant to their national laws. The dangers which single-member companies may generate are matters of discussion as well as the possible benefits of single-member companies to the national and international markets. Authorization of a single-member company foundation is one of the most important changes that were brought by Turkish Commercial Code with its entry into force in 1 July 2012. It is understandable from analysis of company foundation statistics provided by official authorities that incorporation of a company by a single member is widely embraced by market players. Presently, the European Union labours with a directive proposal which aims formation of new and more practical single-member company type. The outcome of these economic policy borne legal efforts will have significant effects on Turkey as a current member of the European Customs Union and a candidate country for the European Union, and foreign investors who plan to invest in Turkey.
K20|Financial Inclusion: What And How? Evidence From Azerbaijani Economy|The main goal of the research is to study what financial inclusion is and analyse its current status in the Azerbaijani economy. To that end, the monography analyses infrastructural elements to be shaped to make financial resources and services available, and the potential to deepen financial inclusion, researches international practice with respect to elements of financial infrastructure affecting stronger financial inclusion and includes case studies. The study also analyses the status of financial inclusion in the Republic of Azerbaijan as part of measuring financial inclusion and issues proposals on the actions to be taken.
K20|Legal possibilities concerning restructuring of companies in business difficulties|Since difficulties during business are an integral part of entrepreneurship, the Croatian legislative offers several restructuring models for companies who have business issues. The pre-bankruptcy agreement is available in cases when the debtor is threatened by insolvency and during this procedure, the business of the company is still managed by the existing management board. However, it is necessary that the pre-bankruptcy procedure is finished within a short deadline. The bankruptcy procedure is commenced on grounds of over-indebtedness and when in a state of incapacity to make payments, Future business is managed by the insolvency practitioner. The extraordinary administration procedure in companies of systemic importance for the Republic of Croatia is initiated in cases where large enterprises are faced with bankruptcy or pre-bankruptcy reasons. During this procedure, the business of the parent-company is conducted by the extraordinary trustee. Each of the aforementioned procedures (models) has its specifications and legal consequences for all stakeholders involved (debtor, management board and creditors). This paper will use the comparative legal research methodology to analyze the differences between them: the grounds for commencing the procedures, continuing company’s business operations, deadlines and the aftermaths for the creditors and shareholders of the company. The focus of the paper will be to demonstrate that each procedure can preserve financially positive business of the companies in problems. Several legal models should enable timely restructuring of companies, which can secure the safety of sustainable businesses and help create and maintain employment, while also can reduce the risk in the finance sector connected with converting loans to poor credits. However, the success of the negotiations with relevant stakeholders, namely creditors, and the percentage of creditor’s payment returns largely depend on early detection of business problems and prompt opening of appropriate proceedings.
K20|The development of English company law before 1900|This article outlines the development of English company law in the four centuries before 1900. The main focus is on the evolution of the corporate form and the five key legal characteristics of the corporation - separate legal personality, limited liability, transferable joint stock, delegated management, and investor ownership. The article outlines how these features developed in guilds, regulated companies, and the great mercantilist and moneyed companies. I then move on to examine the State's control of incorporation and the attempts by the founders and lawyers of unincorporated business enterprises to craft the legal characteristics of the corporation. Finally, the article analyses the forces behind the liberalisation of incorporation law in the middle of the nineteenth century.
K20|Lobbyism in Germany: What do we know?|Based on the two main channels of influence seeking, contribution payments and informational lobbying, we survey empirical studies about lobbying in Germany and discusses the available data and research approaches. Based on two novel data sets, we provide first insights towards further steps of empirical lobbying research. Given the overall lack of available data on lobbying in Germany, we identify research gaps and discuss new methodological approaches which might lead to a better understanding of the lobbying process.
K20|How Islamic is the Diminishing Musharkah Model used for Home Financing?|For financing consumer durables like houses, cars or computers, conventional banks use what are called the equated monthly installment (EMI) models. EMI is the fixed payment a borrower makes to a lender to pay off both interest and principal each month so that over a specified number of years, the loan amount is cleared in full. Islamic banks have followed the practice using EMI on diminishing musharakah partnership basis. The model is popularly known as the MMP, an abbreviation of its Arabic nomenclature. The defining character of this model is increasing amortization of capital through a customer buy back provision in the agreement. We have shown more than once that models of the sort invariably involve compounding of return on capital and pass the ownership of property to the client at a slower rate than the rate of capital amortization until the contract is concluded. This paper provides additional evidence and documentation to reiterate that the MMP exhibits the same characteristics and is not, therefore, Shari’ah compliant. We propose an alternative model free of the indicated blemishes, having additional advantages as well.
K20|Nature and Significance of Islamic Economics|Islamic economics has of late landed in confusion and neglect and much concern is being voiced on this state of affairs. The divergence of views on various aspects of the subject tends to grow, cohesive efforts are missing. It is in this context that the present paper takes a look at the nature and significance of Islamic economics and examines the issues of its definition, nature and scope, the questions of methods and methodology, system approach, the problems that seems to hinder its growth, the challenges Islamic economics faces today and how the same can be faced. Since the differences between the Islamicand mainstream economic disciplines stem from the divergent worldviews that condition them, the discussion opens on the topic as background material. This paper is a part of draft Chapter of a book under preparation on Islamic economics and finance. Comments and suggestions are welcome but the paper or its parts cannot be put to any commercial or unfair use.
K20|The economic and legal significance of “full” deposit availability|Bank deposits have two characteristics: they are available on demand and at par value. Deposit redemptions face, at least given current technology, a lag between when they are requested and when they are delivered. This fact leads some to argue that as a deposit is not fully available, all deposits are, in fact, loans and that the legal obligation of the depository changes. We argue that this lag does not nullify the original economic intent of the deposit, and hence, does not alter the legal obligations that a depository faces. Deposits must be held safely to ensure that the depositor′s money will be available when an unforeseen event occurs. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2016

K20|Entgrenzung von Organisation und Arbeit? Interorganisationale Fragmentierung als Herausforderung für Arbeitsrecht, Management und Mitbestimmung. Einleitung zum Schwerpunktheft|Die Artikel des Schwerpunktheftes setzen an verschiedenen inhaltlichen Dimensionen und Ebenen dieser Fragmentierung an: Auf der Arbeitsebene ist der Beitrag von Gabriele Fassauer und Silke Geithner angesiedelt, der die inner-organisatorische Bewaeltigung von Co-Konfiguration durch Auftragsmanager behandelt. Auf Basis der Taetigkeitstheorie beleuchten die Autorinnen die Co-Konfiguration zwischen Kunden und Produzenten, indem sie die Grenzarbeit von Auftragsmanagern im Zentrum interorganisationaler Leistungserstellung sichtbar machen, um den Anforderungen von Kunden, Zulieferern und den unternehmensinternen Arbeitsgruppen gerecht zu werden. Die Mitbestimmungspraxis von Betriebsraeten im Umgang mit quasi-externalisierter Arbeit ist Gegenstand von gleich zwei Aufsaetzen mit je unterschiedlicher Blickrichtung. Der Artikel von Markus Hertwig, Johannes Kirsch und Carsten Wirth zielt auf die Erkundung des Umgangs des Betriebsrats mit Onsite-Werkvertraegen in strukturationstheoretischer Perspektive. Fuer die Ernaehrungs- und Getraenkeindustrie zeigen sie verschiedene Praktiken auf, die in verschiedenen Typen des Umgangs von Betriebsraeten mit Onsite-Werkvertraegen verdichtet werden, die zwischen Kooperation und Konfrontation, zwischen Ablehnung und Akzeptanz angesiedelt sind. Karina Becker thematisiert aus einer sozialkritischen Perspektive den Gesundheits- und Arbeitsschutz fuer Werkvertragsbeschaeftigte in der Pflege. Dabei interessiert sie sich insbesondere fuer die rechtlichen Sekundaermachtpotenziale der Betriebsraete sowie deren etwaige Verschiebungen innerhalb des Feldes des Arbeits- und Gesundheitsschutzes. Auf diese Weise wird die Reichweite staatlicher Mindestschutzvorschriften im Betrieb bzw. im Haushalt als Verhandlungsgegenstand der Mitbestimmung thematisiert. Auf der Mesoebene zwischen Organisationen und (arbeits-)rechtlichem Rahmen setzen Isabell Hensel, Jochen Koch, Eva Kocher und Anna Schwarz mit einer interdisziplinaeren Einordnung online vermittelter Arbeitsauftraege und Werke an. Sie deuten neue Formen der Arbeitserbringung („Crowdworking“) in ihrer Vielgestaltigkeit, d.h. auch und gerade hinsichtlich von Potenzialen, die jenseits einer allfaelligen Prekarisierung angesiedelt sein koennen. Hierbei greifen sie zum einen auf die Organisations- und Managementtheorie zurueck, zum anderen benutzen sie das Arbeitsrecht, um das Spektrum von Crowdworking in einem Regelkreis aus Autonomie und Kontrolle, Flexibilitaet und Stabilitaet zu ordnen. Auf der Makroebene diskutiert Andreas Buecker die Regulierung der multipolaren Arbeitsbeziehungen und insbesondere des sog. drittbezogenen Personaleinsatzes, indem er bestehende Quellen des Arbeitsrechts (AEntG, MiloG, ArbSchG, BetrVG) auf Anwendbarkeit prueft, um regulative Luecken zu praezisieren. Zugleich thematisiert er die Rolle von Leitbildern im Diskurs der Rechtsfortbildung. Im Ergebnis argumentiert er fuer eine Fortentwicklung des Arbeitsrechts, um ueber den klassischen bipolaren Arbeitnehmerbegriff hinaus auch mehrpolige Rechtsbeziehungen erfassen zu koennen und die Betroffenen nicht schutzlos zu stellen. Hieran knuepfen zwei Debattenbeitraege an, um die derzeitige Konstruktion des Arbeitsrechts auf den Pruefstand zu stellen. Ebenso wie Buecker setzen sowohl Christiane Brors als auch Wolfgang Daeubler am grundsaetzlich bestehenden sozialen Schutzbedarf in mehrpoligen Arbeitsbeziehungen an, blicken aber gleichsam etwas optimistischer in die Zukunft. Brors haelt das zweipolige Arbeitsverhaeltnis nach wie vor fuer den richtigen Anker, um den Schutz abhaengig Beschaeftigter zu gewaehrleisten und zeigt auf, dass bestehende Ansaetze, insbesondere im Rahmen des Rechts der Leiharbeit, ausbaufaehig sind. AEhnlich sieht es Daeubler, der gleichermassen im Arbeitsrecht wie im Recht der Selbststaendigen ausbaufaehige Konstruktionen sieht. Deutlich wird dabei aber, dass gerade im letzteren Bereich der Gesetzgeber gefragt sein koennte, ueber den Typus der arbeitnehmeraehnlichen Person den Schutz von Selbststaendigen zu verbessern. Darueber hinaus macht Daeubler deutlich, dass gerade beim Crowdsourcing ein Problem in der Internationalitaet der Rechtsbeziehung liegen koennte.
K20|Crowdworking als Phaenomen der Koordination digitaler Erwerbsarbeit – Eine interdisziplinaere Perspektive (Crowdworking as the coordination of digital employment – An interdisciplinary perspective)|Die Koordinationsformen von Erwerbsarbeit erfahren durch neue digitale Technologien grundlegende Veraenderungen, die allerdings erst ansatzweise und zumeist nur in einzeldisziplinaerer Perspektive betrachtet, analysiert und verstanden werden. So wird das Phaenomen des Crowdworking oft reduziert auf ein Sourcing- und Steuerungsproblem bzw. auf Prekarisierungsrisiken arbeitender Subjekte oder aber auf neue rechtliche Regulierungsbedarfe vor dem Hintergrund des Ideals eines Normalarbeitsvertrages. In dieser Weise laesst sich – so unsere UEberlegung – das potenziell Neue des Crowdworking kaum adaequat erfassen. In diesem Beitrag entwickeln wir einen komplexeren Begriff des Crowdworking, der organisations-, subjekt- und rechtstheoretische Perspektiven zusammenfuehrt und einen alternativen Analyse- und Deutungsrahmen fuer dieses neue Phaenomen anbietet. Dabei fragen wir nach den Moeglichkeiten und Grenzen wechselseitiger Steigerungsverhaeltnisse von Autonomie, Kontrolle, Flexibilitaet und Stabilitaet in Bezug auf das Verhaeltnis von Organisation, Subjekt und Recht und eroeffnen damit sowohl einen neuen analytischen Zugriff als auch eine normative Sicht auf Crowdworking, indem die Koordinationspraxis von digitalen Crowds als emergente Ordnungsformen in den Mittelpunkt gerueckt wird. (New digital technologies have brought about major changes in the forms of employment coordination. Yet, to date, this shift has been only partially studied and mostly from a single disciplinary perspective. That is why in analyses, the phenomenon of crowd working is often reduced to a sourcing problem for management, a precarity risk for workers or a judicial field in need of new legal regulation (on the basis of the ideal of the conventional labour contract). We argue that this does not enable the innovative character of crowd working to be fully captured. Consequently, in this paper we develop a more complex perspective on crowd working which combines organizational, subject-focused and legal-theoretical analyses. Thereby we focus on the potential reciprocal reinforcement of autonomy, control, flexibility and stability. Furthermore, we introduce both a new analytical and a new normative perspective by putting centre stage the coordination practices of digital crowds as emergent forms of order.)
K20|An Equilibrium Selection Theory of Monopolization|We develop a duopoly model in which firms compete for the market (e.g., investing in process innovation or product development) as well as in the market (e.g., setting quantities or prices). Competition for the market generates multiple equilibria that differ in the firms’ investment levels, relative size, and profitability. We show that monopolization that affects competition in the market can act as an equilibrium selection device in competition for the market. In particular, it eliminates equilibria that are undesirable for the monopolizing firm, while not generating new equilibria. This result complicates the task of determining whether a firm's dominance in a given market is the result of fair competition or unlawful monopolization. We discuss a number of implications for antitrust policy and litigation, and illustrate these by means of two well‐known antitrust cases.
K20|Delimiting The Outer Space|Though science fiction authors have dreamed of permanent space colonies for decades, humans have not walked the surface of another celestial body since Apollo 17 left the moon in December, 1972. Today, however, the possibility of leaving Earth?s orbit for long duration missions is looking brighter. With newcomers like China and India, established spacefarers like the United States and Russia, and a host of private corporations contemplating establishing habitats on the moon or Mars, it is important to consider the extent to which such celestial bodies may be used. In this paper, I examine the fine line between long-term use of outer space and appropriation. First, I consider the concept of ?appropriation? as it has been interpreted by scholars and commentators. Second, I argue that the geosynchronous orbit (?GSO?) provides an analogy for thinking about permissible occupancy and use of man-made structures on the surface of the moon or other celestial bodies, both with respect to the custom that has developed over the use of orbital slots and as a possible regulatory scheme for allocating real property in outer space. Third, I apply this analogy of the GSO to delimit the extent of allowed uses of such areas, both temporally and spatially.
K20|The Protection Of Creditors In Case Of The Fusion Of Companies-Aspects Of Comparative Law|Fusion, a complex operation, determines the reorganisation of the companies involved, so as, in addition to the associates, administrators or the employees, the third parties, as social creditors of the companies concerned, can be prejudiced. Through this article, we intend to analyse the means of protection provided by the national and European legislation, to identify the vulnerable aspects, and to submit solutions for the insurance of a real and adequate protection for the creditors of the companies involved in the fusion operation.
K20|A key-point comparison & the new challenges for the existent Administrative Burden Models (A.B.M’s)|As administrative burden’s reduction (AB) is of crucial importance in order to ensure competitive conditions for national economies, measurement standardization and objectivity is a key component for the implementation of good regulation principles and administrative cost reduction. International experience designates both the main challenges and the limitations in which existent models are subjected to. Moreover, a thorough comparison among the existent administrative burden models’ (ABM’s) stresses specific gaps mainly on data and sampling measurement methods, while the widespread need for a common comparison benchmark among different countries should be addressed.
K20|Protection of Intellectual Property and its Economic Aspects|Intellectual property as assets in intangible form is classified in most countries under the definitions of the TRIPS Agreement and PCT according to the manner of its protection. This article presents results of an analysis of relationship between the protection of intellectual property rights at certain globalization level and verification of their influence on economic indicators in the selected countries of the research sample â€“ 32 countries of a similar intellectual property protection system under the PCT. An examination of the level of globalization as a quantitative marker was enabled by the KOF Index of Globalization. The time and cross-sectional data enabled to test 352 objections by applying a non-parametric statistical method â€“ panel data regression with the effect of random cross-sectional variables. The conclusions show that there is a statistically significant probability of the relation between the quantity of registered patents and the level of gross domestic product, gross domestic product per capita and adjusted net national income.
K20|Islamic conscious capitalism: a ‘Third Way’ in light of classical scripture|"The economic paradigm and framework advocated for in Islam is one that entails a unique combination of various socio–economic philosophies. This article advances the notion that Islam promotes a capitalistic economic model wrapped in its own garment of understanding—fashioned with threads of equity and stitched in patterns of benevolence and justice. This article examines the Islamic theological framework relating to the profit incentive and its spiritually–conscious methodology of capital procurement. The Qur’an contains around 370 references in regard to commerce, from which much of Islamic law relating to lending, banking and trading originates (Heck in Muhammad and the Arab roots of capitalism (Studien zur Geschichte und Kultur des Islamichen Orients)—Band 18. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, p 5, 85, 2006 ). This article intends to explore the potential that these teachings have for an Islamic ‘Third Way’ (i.e. an Islamic contribution to economic philosophy and discourse that is in-between of, or an alternative to, both the purely individualistic primary concerns on prices, profits, and private property inherent in ""pure"" capitalism, and the purely communal command economics of communism, which often negates or discourages the promotion of self-interests). Part I of this paper intends to introduce the reader to the various sources of Islamic ‘law’ and its scope. In doing so, the philosophical nature and objectives of the Shariah will become evident, through the exploration of specific theological economic teachings. Part II intends to study Islam’s theological attitude toward entrepreneurship and the profit incentive, as well as the concept of the potential for salvation through ethical profits. Part III explores, in light of classical Islamic scripture, the various prohibitions within the Islamic concept of the economy. In doing so, the paper shall explore how values and theories found in classical Islamic scripture have found contemporary application within the growing modern Islamic finance industry, for example, through Shariah ‘screens’ applied on market indicies, such as the Dow Jones Islamic Market Index. Part III shall also explore Islamic edicts with regards to business practices, as well as environmental ethics. In doing so, Part IV concludes that there can indeed be such an Islamic ‘Third Way’, drawn along similar shared values found amongst other world religions.

K20|Suchmaschinen unter der Lupe: Informationsherrschaft und ihre Schranken<BR>[Search Engines Under Investigation: Informational Power and Its Limits]|Zusammenfassung Suchmaschinen ermöglichen Nutzern einen schnellen Zugang zu Informationen, die sie konkret suchen oder dort erst entdecken. Sie haben sich zu wichtigen Informationsintermediären entwickelt. In der breit geführten Debatte über eine mögliche Regulierung von Suchmaschinen sprechen sich die Autoren gegen eine Ex-ante-Regulierung aus. Das Wettbewerbsrecht reiche aus, um vor marktbezogenen Formen des Missbrauchs von „Informationsmacht“ zu schützen. Es sollte aber über neue Methoden zur Ermittlung des Missbrauchs von Marktmacht nachgedacht werden. Die regulierende Funktion, die Suchmaschinen mit Blick auf den Schutz des Allgemeinen Persönlichkeitsrechts auf ihrer Plattform wahrzunehmen haben, rechtfertigt es aus Sicht der Autoren nicht, Suchmaschinen zu einem neuen „regulierten Sektor“ zu erklären.
K20|Informality and Optimal Public Policy|This article explores optimal public policy, in terms of the level of tax enforcement and the supply of public goods, in an economy characterized by a huge informal sector. We define informality as the set of productive activities that do not comply (totally or partially) with government regulations. The government intervenes as a Stackelberg leader and has to decide how to allocate public expenditures, using funds collected through the tax system, between the provision of a public good, which can only be used for formal activities, and enforcement effort, aimed at detecting informal firms that evade taxes. Taking the public policy as given, a representative household, owner of a representative firm, decides how to divide a fixed supply of labor between formal and informal activities. Our results show that the greater the distortions in the tax collection process, the larger is the informal sector. Finally, we derive the properties of the optimal public policy. In particular, we show that the shadow cost of public funds represents the rationale of enforcement spending.
K20|El deber de lealtad y sus concreciones en la legislación cooperativa<BR>[The duty of loyalty in the cooperative law. A comparative study]|Entre los deberes de los miembros de los órganos de gobierno de las diferentes entidades, vinculados al buen gobierno de éstas, destaca el deber de lealtad, derivado del deber de buena fe, y consistente en la obligación de actuar en interés de la entidad en caso de conflicto de intereses con ésta, subordinando los propios a favor de aquélla, salvo que se autorice tal situación. Se trata de un deber predicable tanto respecto de los miembros del órgano de administración, que deben gestionar el interés de la sociedad, como de los socios, tomando en consideración el fin común que deriva del contrato de sociedad. Este deber, al mismo tiempo se concreta en una serie de normas más precisas, relativas a la transparencia, la remuneración, la prohibición de competencia, la autocontratación, etc. Partiendo de lo anterior, este estudio recoge una comparativa de la regulación del deber de lealtad y sus distintas concreciones en las Leyes de cooperativas en España, tanto en relación con los administradores sociales, como de los socios en general, comparando ésta al mismo tiempo con la regulación de estos aspectos en el Derecho de sociedades en general, y en la Ley de Sociedades en General en particular, con el objetivo de obtener una visión general de la cuestión, base necesaria para poder profundizar en ella, planteando una serie de conclusiones o valoraciones preliminares.
K20|A European Nevada? Bad Enforcement As an Edge in State Competition for Incorporations|Although now possible, no European state is competing for incorporations and this is unlikely to happen in a general fashion. In this paper I argue that, however, the possibility that one state competes for one specific segment of the market for incorporations should not be ruled out altogether. As has happened with Nevada in the U.S., a state could seek to attract companies that are looking for a very protective legal environment for their directors, officers and shareholders. Given the importance of enforcement, I argue that states could compete by capitalising on the inefficiency of their courts, rather than by changing the law on the books. The fact that no investment is necessary would change the perspective on incentives of states to compete: a very small incentive is needed, if the costs are negligible. I also take into account the possible drawbacks of such competition and the reaction other states could have.
K20|The Effect of Occupational Licensing Deregulation on Migrants in the German Skilled Crafts Sector|Occupational Licensing may reduce the entry of minorities, such as migrants, into a profession if the likelihood of fulfilling the licensing requirements is lower in this group. While policy makers typically justify occupational licensing on the grounds of quality control it, thus, also has the potential to adversely affect the labor market integration of foreign‐born citizens. Before the backdrop of increased levels of migration into Germany, and the general discussion about the free movement of labor in Europe, this paper empirically examines the effects of the deregulation of occupational licensing in the German crafts sector on the proportion of migrants working in this sector. The results suggest that the reform has increased the proportion of migrants by about 5 percentage points among self‐employed professionals and 6 percentage points among employed craftsmen.
K20|"Nudging as a new ""soft"" policy tool: An assessment of the definitional scope of nudges, practical implementation possibilities and their effectiveness"|The idea of nudging has become increasingly popular in both academic and political circles. There are, however, many different interpretations of the term 'nudge' which blurs its scope. In this paper, the authors focus on the conceptualization of nudges and its functionality in reference to the Dual Process models. Further, they discuss the potential applications of nudging as an important extension of the current policy toolkit. In particular, the authors assess the potential of nudges to support habit formation and enhance the performance of the 'classical' economic instruments when used in the so-called instrument mix.

K20|Freedom of contract and financial stability through the lens of the Legal Theory of Finance (LTF): LTF approaches to ABS, Pari Passu-Clauses, CCPs, and Basel III|This paper is the outcome of a related broader project, exploring the explanatory power of the Legal Theory of Finance, which proposes a new institution-based analytical framework for the analysis of phenomena of financial markets. One of its most important theoretical assumptions, the legal construction of financial markets, is highlighted by the example of the private creation of money by structured finance products in this paper. Further implications can then be shown referring to pari passu clauses and collective action clauses, which are both exhibit a differential application of these legal rules according to the hierarchical status of the respective market participant, and can therefore endanger sovereign debt restructurings. Legal instruments to avoid this are briefly explored. An example of another key role of the law in crisis that is the task to resolve the tension between market discipline and financial stability is exemplified by the regulation of the OTC derivatives market and proposals of effective loss-sharing among CCPs. Related questions about the significance of legal rules to ensure financial stability are raised in the analysis of minimum capital requirements under Basel III.
K20|Shareholder wealth vs. stakeholder interests? Evidence from code compliance under the German corporate governance code|In order to better differentiate the drivers of corporations' actions, in particular shareholder wealth and stakeholder interests, the paper explores the significance of the comply or explain-principle and its underlying enforcement mechanisms more generally. Against this background, compliance rates with specific provisions may shed a light on companies' reasons for following the code. An analysis of these rates at the example of distinct provisions of the German Corporate Governance Code is therefore entered into. In light of the current corporate governance debate and the legitimacy problems that are raised, among the code provisions that exemplify these questions very well are those regulating incentive pay, severance pay caps, and age limits for supervisory board members. Their analysis will lay a basis for an answer to the question about what motivates companies to comply with the code. The motivation then paves the way to arrive at a further specification of the determinants of the regulatory evolution of the Code and the range of stakeholders and their concerns that enter into it.
K20|Global Commercial Law between Unity, Pluralism, and Competition: The Case of the CISG|The global legal system consists of a multitude of legal regimes of various origin, thus constituting a regulatory framework which is significantly different from the one of a nation state. In the absence of a world state, international and supranational law regimes, various domestic legal systems, and transnational law regimes such as the lex mercatoria each claim normative authority in the global sphere, which inevitably overlap and interfere in some issue areas. Not surprisingly, this messy state has attracted some attention among legal theory scholars, stimulating various different lines of thought on how global law is actually structured and which organizing principles ought to be in operation. In this paper we identify unity, pluralism, and competition as three paradigms, which qualify in particular to guide our discourse on the structure and the organizing principles of global law. Since theoretical debates tend to remain quite abstract and vague, if not opaque, we decided to flesh out the differences and commonalities between the approaches by applying the three paradigms to the concrete field of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) as a cornerstone of global commercial law. This brings together up to now more or less separate theoretical and dogmatic discourses in a fruitful cross-disciplinary way. As a result, we plea for a paradigmatic pluralism, meaning that global law should not be constructed according to one single organizing principle only. This paper serves as an introduction to three in-depth papers, which each explore the issue from the perspective of one paradigm. Altogether they will publish in a focus issue of the Uniform Law Review in 2016.
K20|Family Business as Source of Municipality Development in the Czech Republic|The article is focused on the family businesses in the Czech Republic. The main aim is to answer the question of whether the family entrepreneurship can be seen as an instrument of municipality development. First, the term family entrepreneurship based on foreign and domestic sources is defined. The sources are complemented by a legal viewpoint under the new Civil Code of the Czech Republic. Furthermore, a regional definition of a municipality and the country is specified. Then, a result of the research investigation focused on the link between the family entrepreneurship and economic development of communities is presented. Finally, the next steps of the team at the Faculty of Economics, Technical University of Liberec in the given area are unveiled. The novel idea is to use such a tool that allows its residents to find the meaning of life in the country and accept a certain level of inequality associated with it. Just at this moment, regional disparities can be removed and support for the development of rural areas can be successfully implemented. Also, family businesses can be a source of developing business environment, especially in small municipalities in rural areas.
K20|Age of politicians and Regulatory Reform|This article discusses the relationship between the identity of the rulers of the executive and reform. Thus, we enrich the literature on the determinants of reform and the result of the executive. This is a new and very important literature, as these are the reforms that allow progress. We use a sample of 141 countries over the period 2003-2013 to investigate the link between the age of politicians and regulatory reforms. We created an ad hoc database for the age of politicians and for reform, we use micro-reform data. An econometric model is used to discover if the age of a political leader in office can be a driving force that is more or less likely to bring about regulatory reforms. Our results suggest that the age of politicians has a positive incidence on the reform that they bring about. The results are robust for the reform measures and techniques used. The results also indicate that older politicians implement more reforms than the young ones. More precisely, the paper found that older politicians who are in their sixties bring about the most regulatory reforms than politicians of any other age ranges.

K20|International arbitration and its exclusion from the Brussels regime|The Brussels regime, which regulates the matters of transnational litigation excludes arbitration from its scope. Upon formation of the Brussels regime the existing instruments concerning arbitration - the United Nations Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and the 1961 European Convention on International Commercial Arbitration - were believed to be sufficient. The original Brussels Convention 1968 on recognition and enforcement of judgments delivered in the courts of the EU Member States expressly provided for the exclusion of arbitration. The following Brussels I Regulation followed the trend and reinforced the exclusion of arbitration from their material scopes. The rationale for doing so was primarily the prevention of parallel proceedings and irreconcilable judgments. The arbitration exclusion from the Brussels regime has caused a fair amount of confusion, especially regarding the extent and limits of the exclusion. That is, whether the arbitration agreement, the arbitral award and its consequences are covered by the exclusion or they may fall under the scope of the Brussels regulation if they constitute only an incidental question to the main cause of action? The confusion was illustrated in the ECJ judgment West Tankers, which generated negative feedback from the arbitration community and indicated the need for reform. The recently adopted Recast Regulation took it upon itself to clarify the relationship between arbitration and the EU regime of transnational litigation. The exclusion is reinforced yet again and its boundaries are specified in the Preamble. However, whether or not the concerns about the extent and objectives of arbitration exclusion have been at present eliminated, remains to be seen.
K20|Corporate governance in state-owned companies in Hungary|At the development and to the comprehension of the regulation it is necessary to ascertain that in our view, the subject of the regulation is the operation of the company. The regulation regulates the problems arising specifically during the course of the operation of the company, as an „ex ante” tool and by the avoidance of that upon the cessation of the public company, any unjustified or inconcievable costs (social costs) should rise. As an example, there are the infamous earlier corporate scandals (Enron, Parmalat, Vivendi Universal), the infringements of which drew critical social (budget) costs, as they left behind unsettled creditors’ claims, plenty of workplaces got terminated, etc. To prevent this, one of the techniques is corporate governance, as it focuses on such mechanisms during the course of the operation of the company as direction and control. With this, the cessation of the company can presumably be avoided, as it is publicly acknowledged that the majority of corporate scandals descend from the faults of leadership, direction and control. Based on the above, we may ascertain that in our perception, under ’corporate governance’ it’s the legal facts or interests relevant in the course of the operation of the company what become regulated in terms of corporate law.
K20|The “Concordato preventivo” in Italian corporate bankruptcy law: a policy evaluation|From 2005 to 2013 Italian corporate bankruptcy law underwent a series of reforms. One of the goals was to improve the in-court restructuring proceedings (concordato preventivo), mainly as a way to promote the continuity of distressed but still viable companies. The reforms have succeeded in broadening the use of restructuring proceedings, even taking into account the effects of the economic crisis. The increase has been particularly large since the introduction of the concordato in bianco, which allows the firms to postpone the presentation of their recovery plan. The reforms have thus improved the likelihood of survival of distressed but still viable companies. Nevertheless, only a small proportion of companies (approximately 4.5 per cent) is still active after restructuring, the main purpose of which remains to provide an alternative form of liquidation, entailing a reduced role for courts, with respect to bankruptcy. The use of restructuring procedures is due to the length of bankruptcy proceedings in the courts, as well as to the structural characteristics of companies (larger proportion of fixed assets) and their credit relations (smaller proportion of collateralized loans).
K20|Firms that went out of business during the crisis|This paper analyzes the Italian companies that filed for bankruptcy or underwent voluntary liquidation between 2008 and 2012 and identifies the main characteristics of this phenomenon. The econometric analysis based on firms’ balance sheet data suggests that the probability of going out of business was greater for smaller and younger companies. Other characteristics being equal, such as size, sector and geographical location, the likelihood of a firm initiating bankruptcy proceedings was more strongly correlated with imbalances in its financial structure such as a high leverage ratio, while a firm’s likelihood of opting for voluntary liquidation was influenced to a greater extent by low profitability.

This relation is intermediated through the firm’s mark up and is stronger in the long than in the short run.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K20|Some Considerations On The Work Of The Authorized Natural Person|In the current socioeconomic situation in Romania, the best way of efficient functioning of a small business is the authorized natural person. The authorized natural person is a natural person who meets the conditions provided by law to carry out any form of economic activity permitted by law, using mainly its workforce. The economic activities provided by an authorized natural person may be carried out in all areas, trades, occupations or professions that law does not expressly prohibit for free initiative. The authorized natural person may conduct its activity according to the purpose for which it was established or may employ, as an employer, third parties with an individual employment contract concluded under the law. A person can cumulate the status of authorized natural person with that of employee of a third party that works both in the same field, and in another area of economic activity than that for which it is authorized. The authorized natural person shall not be considered an employee of third parties with whom they collaborate, even if collaboration is exclusive.

K20|Different forms of decentralization and their impact on government performance: Micro-level evidence from 113 countries|This study of the effect of decentralization on government performance differs from the vast literature on the topic in three major ways. First, we compare the effects of four different forms of decentralization, namely, fiscal decentralization, administrative decentralization, federalism, and aggregate decentralization. Second, we study the effect on three dimensions of government performance, namely, tax administration, business licensing and permits, and corruption. Third, the effects are judged in terms of the perceptions of nearly 100,000 business leaders located in 113 countries. Seven statements summarize our findings. First, fiscal and administrative decentralization improve perceptions of government performance. Second, federalism is associated with worse perceptions. Third, the effect of aggregate decentralization is ambiguous. Fourth, service industries tend to perceive decentralization more favorably than others. Fifth, large firms perceive decentralization less favorably than other firms. Sixth, the effect of the same form of decentralization varies in magnitude across the three government activities. Seventh, therefore, decentralization may not be oversold as a policy prescription to improve government performance; the form of decentralization and its contextualization in terms of the targeted area of government activity need careful consideration.
K20|The Emergence of the Global Fintech Market: Economic and Technological Determinants|We investigate the economic and technological determinants inducing entrepreneurs to establish ventures with the purpose of reinventing financial technology (fintech). We find that countries witness more fintech startup formations when the economy is well-developed and venture capital is readily available. Furthermore, the number of secure Internet servers, mobile telephone subscriptions, and the available labor force have a positive impact on the development of this new market segment. Finally, the more difficult it is for companies to access loans, the higher is the number of fintech startups in a country. Overall, the evidence suggests that fintech startup formation need not be left to chance, but active policies can influence the emergence of this new sector.
K20|Legal uncertainty as a welfare enhancing screen|Consider legal uncertainty as uncertainty about the legality of a specific action. In particular, suppose that the threshold of legality is uncertain. I show that this legal uncertainty raises welfare. Legal uncertainty changes deterrence in opposite directions. The probability of conviction increases for firms below the threshold, while the probability of conviction decreases for firms above the threshold. Hence, legal uncertainty acts as a welfare enhancing screen and increases welfare. Legal uncertainty discourages some actions with low private benefits, while it encourages other actions with high private benefits.

Die Effekte verteilten sich allerdings jeweils auf mehrere Jahre und wurden von anderen Entwicklungen überlagert. Einzelne Branchen des Verarbeitenden Gewerbes sowie des Baugewerbes dürften von den neuen Energieauflagen profitiert haben. Der Wohnungsneubau dürfte dadurch jedoch insgesamt etwas gedämpft worden sein.
K20|On The Sources Of Heterogeneity In Banking Efficiency Literature|This study reviews the empirical literature on banking efficiency by conducting a metaâ€ regression analysis. The metaâ€ dataset consists of 1661 observations retrieved from 120 papers published over the period 2000â€“2014. While the role of study design and methodâ€ specific characteristics of primary studies is evaluated, the focus concerns regulation in banking. The results are fourfold. First, parametric methods always yield lower levels of banking efficiency than nonâ€ parametric studies. Second, banking efficiency is higher in studies using the valueâ€ added approach rather than the intermediation method. Third, efficiency scores also depend on the journal's ranking and on the number of observations and variables used in the primary papers. Finally, regulation matters: primary papers focusing on countries with a liberalized banking industry provide higher values for efficiency scores.
K20|Modelling effective legal aid system|Aim: This article presents a theoretical model that enables achievement of macroeconomic efficiency of the legal aid system by means of adjusting supply to the pre-determined demand. Results: Main deterministic components of aggregate demand for legal aid are defined using a shift-share type framework. The knowledge of its parameters makes it possible to estimate expected demand for legal aid in response to various formulae of possible reforms of the system. Motivation: Estimates of demand serve to compute legal aid supply that minimizes social costs of legal aid provision. This task is accomplished by means of the so called assignment problem originating the field of operational research. Providers are divided in line with their average productivities in solving appropriate legal cases and the aggregate personal costs of legal aid provision are subject to minimization.
K20|State aid and the functioning of the Single European Market — the crisis perspective|Motivation: The financial crisis and the collapsing of the financial market as a result of bankruptcy in 2008 of Lehman Brothers bank became the justification for the need for State intervention in order to prevent the bankruptcy of other financial institutions and related consequences for the real economy. Results: Essential in this range was the position of the European Commission, whose task is to exercise control over compliance with European rules relating to the Member States intervention in the economy. A special role is played here by rules on granting State aid because their violation can lead to distortions of competition in the Single European Market. Aim: The aim of the article is to analyze the conditions of admissibility of State aid in the European Union, taking into account the rules applicable to the aid for undertakings during the crisis.

Dispersing myths and addressing suspicion and deep misunderstandings held by communities of practice, such as the community of faculty researchers, is of paramount importance in order to develop a sense of comfort and build trust among faculty and the TCO. This is particularly true for non-entrepreneurial universities. Lack of shared understandings can make the job of the TCO arduous; equally, not addressing the cultural and moral aspects of technology transfer reproduces suspicion and mistrust. In support of this proposition, the article focuses on the relationship between TCOs and research staff in a non entrepreneurial research environment, the Agricultural University of Athens, to offer qualitative evidence showing the key importance of addressing the lack of trust and cultural gaps via education and training tailored to the needs of individual research teams.
K20|Barriers to Entry and Economic Growth in Transition Economies|Some believe that temporary governmental policies are likely to have no permanent consequences. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model of crime and corruption. We show that even temporary imposition of the barriers to entry to a competitive industry may lead to permanent extortion development and substantial slow-down in the economic growth. Entry restrictions, if binding, lead to the excess profits, which create an incentive to extort. Emergence of the extorters reduces the expected profit from production, making the producers expect to get extorted in the future. If, after this adaptation of expectations, the government removes the barriers to entry, only few new firms enter the market. Hence, the total number of firms on the market is lower that it would have been under no barriers to entry. The low number of firms on the market allows each producer to earn relatively high pre-extortion profits which reinforces the desire of racketeers to take part on their wealth. Consequently, the part of the population is permanently diverted from the production to rent-seeking activities, which is likely slow down economic growth even in the long run.
K20|Post-reorganization survival: a semi-parametric and non-parametric analysis of firm characteristics|This paper aims at bringing evidence on firm survival after bankruptcy. Instead of considering survival as a binary variable we take into account the duration of the reorganization procedure. We follow a sample of French firms throughout their restructuring process and document factors influencing the reorganization outcome. Based on the existing theoretical and empirical literature on the link between firm ownership structure and performance, we particularly focus on the influence of firm affiliation to a business group and business groups characteristics. Using a Cox proportional hazards model and a Random Forests model, we find that firm structural and financial characteristics have a strong power to explain survival at different time horizons, however, very few of firm financial characteristics used previously for bankruptcy prediction are useful for predicting the final outcome of reorganization once a reorganization plan is voted. In addition, we show that firm ownership structure proxied by firm affiliation to a business group and business group characteristics has no significant influence on the outcome and duration of reorganization.
K20|Political Connections and the Informativeness of Insider Trades|This paper examines the relation between political connections and informed trading by corporate insiders in the context of the Financial Crisis. The unprecedented magnitude of government intervention, the substantial impact of this intervention on firm value, and the political nature of the intervention provide a powerful setting to examine the relation between political connections and informed trading. Consistent with political connections providing corporate insiders with an information advantage, we find strong evidence of a relation between political connections and the informativeness of their trades. Consistent with this relation stemming from private information related to government intervention, we find the relation is strongest during the period in which TARP funds were dispersed, and strongest among politically connected insiders at banks that received TARP funds. Examining insider trades around the announcements of TARP infusions, we find evidence of significant trading thirty days in advance of the announcement, and that these trades predict the market reaction to the announcement. Notably, we find these relations are present only for the trades of politically connected insiders. Overall, our results suggest that politically connected insiders had an information advantage during the Crisis and traded to exploit this advantage.
K20|An unreliable canary: Insider trading, the cash flow hypothesis and the financial crisis|This paper investigates whether measures of aggregated insider trading could have predicted the wider economic change that occurred in the UK around the time of the financial crisis. Seyhun's (1988, 1992) cash flow hypothesis is the underpinning rationale driving the investigation. Within a vector auto-regressive framework, this study disentangles the relationship between returns and the activities of insiders in UK listed firms in order to validate Seyhun's assertions in this context. Findings suggest that, unlike the US, the relationship is not present. Instead, aggregate measures of trading decisions show that insiders are more likely driven by public perception than by private information.
K20|Foreign bank presence and business regulations|We examine the impact of foreign bank presence on a host countries’ business regulatory environment. We employ a panel dataset of 87 developing economies for the 1995–2013 period and measure the efficiency of business regulations using the indices from the Heritage and the Fraser datasets. Our results show that foreign bank presence exerts a positive impact on the efficiency of business regulations; however, we find no evidence in favor of a more pronounced positive effect when foreign banks originate from countries that have a more efficient business regulatory environment. Moreover, host countries’ administrative requirements and, particularly, bureaucracy costs benefit from a foreign bank presence; however, cost and time procedures to start a business do not.
K20|Institutional arrangements and debt financing|I find that institutional arrangements have an impact on the real economy by affecting firms’ choice between private and public debt and the subsequent financing costs. Using new debt issued by firms in 26 non-US countries, I find, after controlling for firm characteristics predicted by debt agency and information asymmetry theories, that the level of financial market development, the efficiency of bankruptcy procedure, the integrity and enforceability of laws, and the transparency of financial information have significant impacts not only on firms’ debt choice and yield to maturity in domestic debt market, but also their issuance choice in the international debt market.
K20|Short selling and the development of anti-shorting laws in the UK|Purpose - – The aim of this paper is to provide a review of the literature on short selling. In particular, it seeks to describe the history of short selling and anti-shorting laws. With respect to short-selling regulation, the main emphasis will be placed on the UK FSA’s regulatory action. Design/methodology/approach - – This paper reviews the history of short selling and the development of anti-shorting laws, particularly with regard to the UK market. It also analyses the distinct literature on short selling. Findings - – The paper argues that the development of anti-shorting laws shows that regulators are instituting a policy unfavourable to short sellers. The opposers of short selling may be seen as lacking ideas and having the tendency to ban anything they do not like. Short sellers, on the other hand, may be seen as the elite bodyguards of the financial market whose job is to get rid of overvalued stocks, and ultimately keep the market safe and efficient. For this reason, short sellers deserve our praise and thanks, not our hatred and opprobrium. Originality/value - – To the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first to review the history of short selling and the development of anti-shorting laws, particularly with regard to the UK market.
K20|Regulatory Coherence: The Case of the Republic of Korea|The Government of the Republic of Korea has made great efforts to improve its regulatory management system and to realise regulatory reform since the economic crisis of the late 1990s. Section 1 of this paper explores the evolution of regulatory reform and reviews the coherence of the regulatory management system in the Republic of Korea. Sections 2 and 3 explore how this system was applied in two case studies of regulatory change: Section 2 on golf course regulation and Section 3 on the restriction of opening hours of food services businesses.
K20|Towards a Requisite Regulatory Management System: Philippines|Part One of this paper explores the evolution of regulation in the Philippines since the post-martial rule regime. This paper tracks the macroeconomic and regulatory reforms, and the political and economic history. It explores the existence of a regulatory management system in the Philippines, identifying that the Philippines does not have a coherent regulatory management system, but does has some of the parts of such a system. Parts Two explores how some aspects of a regulatory management system were applied in the successful case study of regulatory change in the establishment of the National Competitiveness Council, a public private partnership, while Part Three looks at another successful case in the regulatory reforms of Quezon City’s Business Permit and Licensing System.
K20|Towards Responsive Regulatory Management Systems: Country Report for Viet Nam|This paper reviews the experiences of Viet Nam in improving its approach to regulatory management. Since 1986, Viet Nam promulgated and amended a number of laws and regulations to regulate economic activities in line with market-oriented reforms. A side effect of more laws and regulations has been the increasing compliance costs of the business community. Viet Nam then gradually introduced good regulatory practices, including regulatory impact assessment, online publication of draft, regulatory planning, etc. Numerous efforts were also sought to simplify and control administrative procedures, the most notable of which were under Project 30 since 2007 and Resolution 19 since 2014. Both Project 30 and Resolution 19 produced quick and material outcomes. Further meaningful reforms of administrative procedures depend on whether Viet Nam can build up sufficient confidence of stakeholders in the process. As the key lessons from Project 30 and Resolution 19, further improvement of regulatory management requires strong political will, involvement of relevant stakeholders, and enactment of separate bodies with a clear mandate and sufficient capacity.
K20|Constitutional Issues of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)|European history has always been characterized by a strong link between banks and States and, more generally, between banks and politics. National banking systems, therefore, have always been one of the forms of expression of sovereignty. This setting is seriously called into question by the Banking Union project, which has been recently implemented in Europe. Given the importance of the issue, this should be studied not only from the perspective of economics and regulatory studies, but also from the perspective of constitutional law. The paper, after a reconstruction of the historical and economic conditions that have led to design a project of Banking Union, analyzes several constitutional issues. In particular, te paper focuses on the friction points between the European Banking Union and the democratic principle, the rule of law and the justiciability principle.
K20|Section 6. Institutional Changes|According to the Federal Property Register, the movement, over the period 2013–2015, of the number of organizations registered as holders of ownership rights and economic societies with state stakes appears to be as follows
K20|Раздел 6. Институциональные Изменения|Основными событиями минувшего года в рамках рассматриваемой проблематики стали старт второй трехлетней приватизационной программы на 2014–2016 гг., утверждение новой государственной программы по управлению федеральным имуществом до 2018 г., возврат под контроль государства компании «Башнефть» по судебным основаниям, продолжение активного строительства интегрированных структур в оборонной промышленности и смежных отраслях, отсутствие значимых сделок на рынке корпоративного контроля с участием госкомпаний, а также расширение инструментария управления субъектами государственного сектора экономики на уровне типовых документов прикладного характера.
K20|Régulation par contrat|La régulation par contrat est souvent présentée comme une alternative à une régulation externe passant par une autorité sectorielle indépendante. Le propos de ce texte est de présenter les avantages et les inconvénients de ces deux modes de régulation et d’insister sur leur complémentarité.
K20|Business Transaction Invalidity In the Context of the Principle of Legality|This paper explores business transactions in the context of the principle of legality. It will be argued that Article 168 of the Russian Civil Code, as a meta-rule, contains three types of rules: 1) rules dealing with the priority of special rule and exceptions (exclusive rules); 2) rules dealing with the interpretation of general, special and exclusive rules as well as with the requirements of statutes or other legal acts violated by a transaction and established outside Article 168 of the Civil Code; 3) rules dealing with the admissibility of special rule and exceptions, as well as with the conditions of admissibility of these rules. With regard to the first group of the rules, the legislature and commercial courts consider Article 168 of the Civil Code a common base with respect to other grounds in the Civil Code and in certain other statutes for declaring transactions invalid. According to the second group of rules, the subject-matter (object) of legal interpretation consists of two elements: à) the text of Article 168 of the Civil Code; and b) the texts of legal acts, described by the generic term “statute or other legal act.” Article 168 of the Civil Code provides instructions not only for rules as objects of application of the article, but also for the methods of interpreting violated requirements. The rules of admissibility for special rule and exceptions, as well as the conditions of admissibility for these standards, are aimed at the numerous cases in which the legislature, in the Civil Code or in other legal acts, expressly establishes nullity (voidness), voidability and other legal consequences for illegal transactions. The paper also answers questions regarding the impact of recent amendments to the Russian Civil Code on using rules for business transaction invalidity in commercial courts
K20|Key Person Insurance Essential In The Family Business, Seguro Del Hombre Clave Indispensable En La Empresa Familiar|This research is fiscal examination. The paper aims to demonstrate with scientific methods the deductibility of the expense for key man insurance. The problem is insecurity in the country, and the need in some family businesses to count and deduct as expenses key man insurance. This figure is considered a key part or main gear for the continuity of the family business. The phenomenon arises when this figure disappears unexpectedly, due to illness, temporary or permanent disability, even death. Of the 42 medium-sized Monclova, Coahuila, Mexico, businesses featuring figures with key man characteristics, we surveyed twenty for the sample. It resulted in lacking an insurance plan to compensate the taxpayer for the decrease in productivity the loss of a key man could cause. In the event that the key man disappears, the family company receives income from the insurance. This income is considered taxable.
K20|The Influence of the European Union Consumer Protection Policy on Croatian Consumers|The European Union Consumer Protection Policy (EU CPP) focuses on the awareness and active participation of consumers in the internal market and therefore counts on consumers’ knowledge of their own conferred rights. Since it is not yet clear what Croatian consumers’ attitudes towards the EU Consumer Protection Policy are, this paper attempts to analyze the impact of the EU Consumer Protection Policy on Croatian consumers’ interest, knowledge, their source of information and their perceived security as consumers. Quantitative (survey) data collection among consumers within the entire Croatia has been used for the analysis. The collected data has been analyzed by using descriptive statistics, correlation and regression analysis, and the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The paper eventually finds significant correlations between Croatian consumers’ degrees of interest, actual knowledge, preferred information sources and perceived security. It furthermore shows that the attitude of Croatian consumers towards the European Union’s system of consumer protection currently shows a significant lack of interest and knowledge. The paper concludes with a premise which states that the attempts to increase interest and knowledge among Croatian consumers require the use of information provided via visible Internet sources.
K20|In Europe We Trust?|The decrease in the rule of law and in control of corruption in several EU countries is a threat to the cohesion in the EU. Brexit has reinforced the centrifugal forces in the EU. To counter this threat the EU needs to engage in unpopular measures as they infringe on the Member States' sovereignty. We propose to introduce new measures in treaty revisions like the possibility of individuals to appeal to European courts to counter negative developments in governance in EU Member States.
K20|Hayek on corporate social responsibility|Hayek published a piece in 1960 that criticized corporate social responsibility as a norm for economic organizations, although he regarded corporate actions to be subject to essentially the same moral rules as individual action. This article identifies and reorganizes Hayek’s criticisms of social justice, the rule of law and morality, his comparison of the open society and the closed society, and his treatment of charity and altruism. The aim is to clarify the Hayekian perspective on CSR. These considerations explain why the ‘social’ perspective on responsibility is considered dangerous in a free society, how to separate legal compliance and morality from concerns about social justice.

K20|Exclusive contracts with private information in successive differentiated oligopolies|Abstract The purpose of this article is to analyze the incentives of manufacturers to deal exclusively with retailers in bilaterally duopolistic industries with brand differentiation by manufacturers. In contrast with the previous literature, exclusive contracts are shown to generate higher profits for manufacturers and retailers selling highly differentiated products, who thus have an incentive to insist on exclusive contracting. However, if the products are close substitutes no exclusivity will emerge in equilibrium. Furthermore, we show that exclusive contracts decrease both consumer and social welfare.
K20|Collateral Registries for Movable Assets: Does Their Introduction Spur Firms’ Access to Bank Financing?|We use firm-level data to explore the impact of the introduction of collateral registries for movable assets on firms’ access to bank financing. We compare the firms’ access to financing in seven countries before and after they introduce these registries to the firms in three control groups: the countries that do not introduce registries, the countries matched by location and income to those that establish these registries, and the countries that undertake reforms to their legal frameworks for collateral. Overall, we find that the introduction of these registries increases the firms’ access to financing, particularly for smaller and younger firms.

K20|Some Considerations Regarding the European Banking Union|Union Bank is a surveillance system and an EU bank resolution, which operates on the basis of EU wide rules. It aims to ensure that the banking sector in the euro area and the EU in general is safe and reliable and viable banks benefiting from resolution without recourse to taxpayer funds and with minimal impact on the real economy. Banking union members are all euro-zone countries and EU Member States that have chosen to participate. All countries will adopt the euro in the future will automatically become members of the banking union. Countries that are not part of the euro area can join by establishing a close cooperation agreement.
K20|Some Considerations Regarding the Implementation of Basel III|Basel III represents a basic revision of the banking industry regulatory and supervisory framework for the future, the objective being the stability consolidation of the financial system. The objective of this article is to analyze the impact of the Basel III implementation upon the banking system at the European level, and respectively, upon the banking system of Romania. Basel III standards have been elaborated as a response of the 2008 financial crisis and are considered as vital for the assurance of financial institution capitalization against future financial shocks. The new standards have as an object the improvement of risk management, increased requirements of transparency and publication of credit institutions, as well as solving the banks problems of systemical importance. The measures that the credit institutions could adopt in order to mitigate the impact of alignment to the new standards are adjusting the business model and restructuring bank balance sheets.
K20|Islamic finance for SMES|Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) make up the bulk of the economic tissue of the economy. In developing countries, they represent the majority of employment, including female employment. Investing in SMEs is a long-term and smart strategy, with sustainable returns that multiply across regions, countries and societies. SMEs constitute the overwhelming majority of firms. Globally, SMEs make up over 95% of all firms, account for approximately 50% of GDP and 60%–70% of total employment, when both formal and informal SMEs are taken into account. This amounts to between 420 million and 510 million SMEs, 310 million of which are in emerging markets. Promoting access to finance for SMEs has been on the global reform agenda since the global financial crisis. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the opportunities of development and growth as well as the main challenges to Islamic finance for SMEs. This paper will help to deepen understanding of the concepts of Islamic finance as well as SMEs. In addition to evaluate how Islamic financial institutions can support SMEs.
K20|A Note On Services In The European Union Regulations: Is Online Digital Content A Service?|The first section analyses European Union legal texts on the goods-services distinction. They view the former as tangible entities, while the latter covers all intangible ones. The writing of the key article on services in the EU main Treaty may also be confusing. The second section explains the new approach of the service that the economic analysis has developed, especially relevant in the context of the knowledge economy. The third section shows that the Single Market Digital Strategy of the European Commission faces difficulties caused by the outdated service definition it uses. The problems affect the VAT rate applicable to intangible goods, regarded as services (e.g. e-books vs. tangible books), and the Directives or Communications handling the provision of Digital Content. This concept, coined among other things to bypass the outdated definition, induces a contorted law treatment of intangible goods and, at least, undue contractual idiosyncrasies. Adopting the new economic approach of the serv ce would solve the problems underlined and help fostering the digital economy.
K20|Net Neutrality and the Incentives (Not) to Exclude Competitors|This paper analyses the incentives of a vertical integrated Internet service provider (ISP) to block competitors from content markets. Using a simple model we find that the ISP does not block competing content providers as long as the contents are differentiated sufficiently. Exclusion only takes place when the competitor offers perfect homogeneous content and the ISP has a local monopoly over its Internet access customers or if network effects are strong. In this case, however, the abuse of market power can at least in Europe be prohibited by competition authorities. That is, according to our model there is no need for a regulation of net neutrality.
K20|Exhaustion of Digital Goods: An Economic Perspective|"The ""UsedSoft"" decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) about the right of a buyer of a downloaded copy of a software to resell this copy triggered a controversial discussion about the applicability of the ""exhaustion"" rule (US: first-sale doctrine) to copyright-protected digital goods (as, e.g., also e-books). This paper offers, in a first step, a systematic analysis and assessment of economic reasonings that have been discussed in the literature about exhaustion, and applies this framework, in a second step, to downloaded digital creative works. An important result is that digitalisation, on one hand, changes considerably the benefits and costs of exhaustion, esp. in regard to the danger of jeopardizing the incentives for copyright owners. On the other hand, however, also the costs of imposing restrictions might be high and even increase in a digital economy. This leads to the conclusion that it is necessary to think seriously about the legal limits for the restrictions that copyright owners should be allowed to impose on their customers. However, these limits might be drawn also by other legal instruments than copyright exhaustion."
K20|Effect of the Service Directive on Wholesale and Retail Companies: Diff in Diff in Diff Evidence|The Service Directive puts into motion the free movement of service, one of the milestones of the Single Market of the European Union. Though very ambitious at its draft, several adjustments have been made and it is argued whether the final Directive is helpful at all. This article aims to answer the question by focusing on productivity of affected companies with use of two distinct control groups and employing Difference-in-difference-in-difference design on firm-level data. The article finds that the Service Directive significantly increased productivity of companies though the results cannot be labelled as profoundly causal as is further discussed in the article.
K20|Harmonised Standards and Firm Productivity: Difference-in-Differences Evidence|One of the main objectives of the European Union is to enhance the competitiveness of companies within its Member States and that may be supported by further development of the Single Market. Introduction of harmonized standards for production of goods and services encourages companies to take advantage of the Single Market by reducing transaction costs. In other words, the EU is adjusting the economic and legal framework in which companies operate in order to remove existing barriers to its vision of a well-functioning Single Market. This paper researches the relationship between these changes and productivity of microeconomic agents â€“ firms. The analysis uses a panel data regression model with difference-in-differences research design built on a sample of affected and unaffected firms as control groups to be able to extract effect caused by the regulation. The article provides evaluation of individual standards and states the direction of effect at each of those. It can be said that while some standards (mostly those with wide applicability) have a positive relation with productivity and some are insignificant. There can be found also one that has a robust significant negative correlation with productivity.
K20|Implementation of the Mortgage Credit Directive – the scope of changes, issues of concern and their potential impact on the Polish mortgage sector|In February 2014, the European Parliament approved the text of a new Mortgage Credit Directive, ending more than two years of work on the unification of the mortgage market in Europe. EU Member States have had two years to adapt their national legislations to the new requirements – the deadline for implementation of the Directive expires in March 2016. Although the final version of the Directive, whose aim is to harmonize and raise the standards of offering mortgage loans in the EU, was made significantly more relaxed relative to the original assumptions, this does not mean that implementation of the new regulations will be easy for the financial sector. The purpose of this article is to present the main provisions of the Mortgage Credit Directive, its planned implementation into Polish law and the major challenges related to the process.
K20|Empirical Evidence on Conditional Pricing Practices|Conditional pricing practices allow the terms of sale between a producer and a downstream distributor to vary with the ability of the downstream firm to meet a set of conditions put forward by the producer. The conditions may require a downstream firm to accept minimum quantities or multiple products, to adhere to minimum market-share requirements, or even to deal exclusively with one producer. The form of payment from the producer to the downstream firm may take the form of a rebate, marketing support, or simply the willingness to supply inventory. The use of conditional pricing practices is widespread throughout many industries, and the variety of contractual forms used in these arrangements is nearly as extensive as the number of contracts.
K20|Boosting Productivity in Finland|Boosting productivity growth is necessary to raise living standards and well-being for all. Aggregate productivity has fallen, mainly driven by manufacturing, although service industries have also tended to underperform. Reviving productivity requires improving framework conditions further so labour and capital can more easily move to the most dynamic sectors and firms, making the tax system more growth-friendly, and supporting innovation, basic research and young firms’ financing. This working paper relates to the 2016 OECD Economic Survey of Finland (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-finland.htm). Stimuler la productivité en Finlande Il faut stimuler la croissance de la productivité pour améliorer le niveau de vie et de bien-être de tous. La productivité globale a reculé, principalement sous l’influence du secteur manufacturier, même si les services ont eu tendance à faire de moins bon résultats. Pour gagner en productivité, il faut améliorer encore les conditions générales de telle façon que le travail et le capital puissent être redéployés plus facilement vers les secteurs et les entreprises les plus dynamiques, rendre le système fiscal plus propice à la croissance et soutenir le financement de l’innovation, de la recherche fondamentale et des jeunes entreprises. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE de la Finlande 2016 (www.oecd.org/fr/eco/etudes/etude-economique-finlande.htm).
K20|Congressional Assertions of the Spending Power: Institutional Conflict and Regulatory Authority|This study seeks to answer a crucial and unexplored question about American regulatory law and policy: How do majority coalitions in Congress use the spending power to circumvent intra-branch conflict and judicial constraints against regulating by finding alternate avenues to regulate states and private actors? This study provides the first large-scale empirical evidence of congressional use of the spending power to assert implementation authority in the face of constraints against more direct legislating. It is through this process of conditioning funds upon regulatory compliance that Congress works toward ideal policy outcomes without inciting institutional conflict with the other branches or from the opposing party. I base my conditional spending analysis on data on statutory specificity and congressional delegation from the 80th to the 110th Congresses provided by Farhang, and include additional measures of institutional conflict. The above argument is supported by the empirical analysis. (JEL K20, K23)
K20|“Fettered” And “Unfettered” Capitalism In J.A. Schumpeter’S Concept Of Tax State And Economic Development – Issues In Banking Perspective|Economic development and transformation processes have become much more intense in economic reality in the last years than they have ever been before. At this time a lot of questions were raised about the causes of the actual Global Crisis, future crises, the factors affecting the modern economy, about the essence of contemporary capitalism, demographic problems and overgrown bureaucracy. The most spectacular threat to capitalism, (based on private entrepreneurship) according to Schumpeter, stems from the high, growing and progressive taxation. Schumpeter saw clearly that the financing of public goods and services (requiring taxes, maybe even relatively high) is something other than a clerical control of the economic system that violates the natural economic mechanism. Moreover, Schumpeter says explicitly that an entrepreneur does not have to be one person, he even states that the country (state) itself, or its agenda, can act as an entrepreneur. Therefore, it can be concluded that we may have to deal with “Tax State”, which is typical for “fettered capitalism”, and with “entrepreneurial state”, which is typical for “unfettered capitalism”. The main goal of this paper is to present two different approaches to the economic development concept: Schumpeter’s “fettered” and “unfettered” capitalism in the context of “Tax State” and interventionism. The Author analyzes presented concept in contemporary issues from the banking perspective. In the paper, the Author used critical analysis as a research method. This allowed to identify gaps in the current state of knowledge and the scientific discussion focused on J.A. Schumpeter’s theoretical concept. Analysis was performed in 2015.
K20|New Wine in Old Flasks: the Just Price and Price-Controls in Jewish Law|The halakhah (Jewish law) includes legislation aiming at might be called “social justice.” These halakhot (pl.) include the laws of ona'ah and hafka'at she'arim / hayyei nefesh – roughly analogous to the famous Medieval “just price” laws – as well as legal restrictions on middlemen and speculators. In the light of modern economics, these Jewish laws, like all attempts at price-fixing, are shown to be self-defeating; the means conflict with the ends sought. The conflict between religion and science is not limited to cosmology and biology, but may include economics as well. It is proposed that the halakhah be modified in such a way as to preserve – as much as possible – the integrity of both the halakhah and economic science alike; when an ethical system makes certain scientific presuppositions, it is sometimes possible to preserve the ethical system by disentangling it from its non-essential scientific presuppositions.
K20|Legal or business personality of the commercial companies according to business law in Kosovo|Companies are founded by two or more physic persons or entities that are awarded for the achievement of common objectives in business, making contributions to society, as defined in its charter that in essence is a general term that means a society - society trading. As such the company has an identity apart from the legal authentic it is clearly separate from its members or shareholders. In this segment Kosovo has an interesting and intense legislative history. The transformation of the Company Law, from the time former social system to the establishment of UNMIK - Regulation in 1999 mark the greatest progress towards a modern economy - market. Two recent laws on commercial companies are based on the German model. It what is important has to do with the provision of legal guarantees for the provision of basic modalities for an early business organization in which local and foreign investors are familiar. The dilemma which now arises in the field of theory of business law is that it has been reasonable choice lawmakers two business formations to legal subjectivity removed and replaced with business subjectivity. It what is evident has to do with the fact that, at least so far, there is no comment, justification, debate, etc., that this setting expressed above, at least in terms of the science, to handle in terms of advantages or its disadvantages. The paper aims to provide a view of why partnerships society, despite the lack of legal personality has strong and stable position in life legal practice of doing business in our country.
K20|Insurance and reinsurance risk management in Albania|Risk management in insurance and reinsurance companies is a very important element, which enables the organization to meet its obligations to customers and to survive in the market place. In order to be managed properly, the risk must be first identified correctly. The damage must be assessed carefully and using efficient methods, for the evaluation to be more realistic. This paper is the result of the use of several methods. Besides the theoretical and narration aspects, the paper also relies on the comparative method, as it addresses the practices followed by the Member States as well as Albania, a country that has recently adopted a new law, aiming to align its legislation with the acquis communautaire. The study shows that the Albanian legislation provides the necessary guarantees to ensure that companies will manage risk in the best way possible and will create all the necessary structures for this purpose. In this regard, we can say that the alignment with the acquis communautaire has been successfully accomplished.
K20|“Corporate Scene Investigation”: A Praxeological Attempt to Sketch the Profile of the Entrepreneur in Modern Business|Mature capitalism and market economy realities become intelligible also by scrutinizing their “prodigal children”: modern business corporations. But these are not some undivided entities. Beyond the place in the global division of labour, they are fiefs of in-built specialization among the corporate governance stakeholders, each of them representing individual-based aggregations of pure catallactic functions. With an atomized, anonymous, asymmetrical and amalgamated ownership in a globalized capital market, with the multi-level directorship, delegated to harmonize profit-orientated investment interests, with creditors, but also with other suppliers of factors of production, modern corporations seem to have overshadowed both the real entrepreneurs-actors as well as the pure corresponding function. Our article is a (praxeo)logical exercise to pinpoint and reveal the realistic field of definition of the “entrepreneurship function” within the modern corporate spectrum, delimiting and portraying the entrepreneurial aspect out of the real characters that inhabit the corporate entourage (precisely said, of shareholders, managers, creditors). It seems that the modern literature on the law and economics of the firm has lost sight of the entrepreneur(ship), whose presence is felt but rarely positively identified. The endeavour to locate and isolate this, along with the associated incentives and logic of action is a task with some analytical merits. A thorough discrimination of the entrepreneurs’ position inside the corporate field and, respectively, of the “natural” vs. “allowed” decision spheres can generate sounder judgments about the wellstructured and poorly-structured companies (good vs. poor corporate governance) or about institutions found to be business (un)friendly (good vs. poor corporate law-making). We define “good governance” at the level of the corporate form the situation when incentives are aligned with rights and obligations, and the “good law” the norm which does not alter the common sense of property rights and freedom of contracting. Without knowing them, any legal organization of the corporate form will be fraught with problems.
K20|Marketing and Business Development between Idea, Scientific Discovery and Innovation|Starting from the emergence of the basic ideas, scientific development of them to successive innovations derived from, the paper develops around the way in which marketing science contributes to the business development. It is presented the vision of marketing from a historical perspective that characterized feudalism, communism, capitalism and knowledge based society. Based on documentary research is discussed the necessity of adopting innovations and the multidisciplinary nature of innovation as a process. European policies are presented for the development of innovation and regional development programs already implemented. The paper concludes by highlighting new facets of the innovation concept in economic theory, the legal framework for the marketing of innovative technologies and the limits of intellectual property rights of those who innovate.
K20|Choice of Enterprise Form: Spain, 1886–1936|Every new firm selects a legal form. Organizing as a corporation, a limited company, or a partnership shapes the firm’s access to capital markets, its governance arrangements and tax liabilities, and its treatment in bankruptcy. We use multinomial choice models to estimate the determinants of enterprise form using firm-level data on Spain for the period 1886–1936. Our results support hypotheses drawn from the corporate-finance and ownership literatures; entrepreneurs preferred the corporation for the largest firms and for firms vulnerable to holdup. In 1919, Spain introduced a new legal form, a limited company combining attributes of the corporation and the partnership. This Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (SRL) displaced both corporations and partnerships, and was especially popular for small and medium-sized firms whose owners were unrelated. Counterfactual calculations suggest that few enterprises created prior to 1919 would have chosen the SRL even if it had been available.
K20|Causes, Factors And Ways Of Combat Tax Evasion|Tax evasion is a complex phenomenon faced by all member economies, regardless of geographic position. Committing this crime and related crimes they attract undesirable economic consequences. The temptation circumvention of the law is becoming bigger for taxpayers whose taxes are imposed increasingly higher. Fiscal bodies faced a growing phenomenon as a snowball.
K20|Normative contents of Constitution in the context of constitutional reform|The modification of the fundamental law of a state represents a very special political and juridical act with major significances and implications in the political social system as in the state’s one, but also at each individual level. That’s why such an approach needs to be well justified, to answer to some juridical and political social needs well defined, but mainly to correspond to the principles and rules specific to a constitutional and state’s democratic system providing to the state the stability and functionality it needs. In this study we analyze the necessity of such a constitutional reform in Romania, and also some provisions from the report of the Presidential Commission for the analysis of the political and constitutional regime in our country. We formulate our opinions in relation to the justifying some constitutional regulations. In this context, we consider that there are arguments for the maintaining of the bicameral parliamentary system and an eventual revising of the fundamental law needs to consider the measures needed to guarantee the political and constitutional institutions specific to the lawful state.
K20|The Procedure of Guilt Recognition in Romania, a Real Negotiation or just a Formal Institution also for the Minor Offenders? The Common Law System|Common law adversarialism is generally contrasted with West European inquisitorialism, which is said to be characterized by an active role for the fact-finder, by decisions based on full judicial inquiry and by truth-seeking rather than proof-making. The main differences lie in the role of examining or investigating judges or magistrates, at least in relation to serious offences. European systems do not have jury trials in exactly the same form as common law systems, although lay persons sit on the bench in some cases and jury trials that are more akin to common law trials are exceptional and reserved for the most serious crimes. Inquisitorial systems have not generally recognized guilty pleas, and plea-bargaining is only a recent innovation in some jurisdictions. There is a traditional, but gradually shrinking, divided between jurisdictions that adhere to the principle of legality, whereby the prosecutor is required by law to prosecute where there is sufficient evidence that a crime has been committed. The actual regulations concerning plea barganing (an addmisssion of guilt in Romania) is, if we may say so, totally different from the common law system, mostly because that was not a tradition in our country, and now, somehow, its seems odd to have in our juridical penal system such an institution.
K20|Principle of proportionality, criterion of legitimacy in the public law|In this study we propose to analyze the concept of discretionary power, respectively the power excess, having as a guidance the legislation, jurisprudence and doctrine in the matter. The proportionality is a legal principle of the law, but at the same time it is a principle of the constitutional law and of other law branches. It expresses clearly the idea of balance, reasonability but also of adjusting the measures ordered by the state’s authorities to the situation in fact, respectively to the purpose for which they have been conceived. In our study we choose theoretical and jurisprudence arguments according to which the principle of proportionality can procedurally be determined and used to delimit the discretionary power and power abuse.
K20|Crecer no es Suficiente para Reducir la Informalidad|En este documento se estudia la relación de la informalidad laboral y el crecimiento económico en el Perú a nivel regional. Se utiliza la tasa de desempleo urbano y al consumo de electricidad por regiones y provincias como indicadores de la actividad económica en el contexto de un modelo de elección discreta de informalidad a nivel de trabajadores. Se encuentra que la elasticidad informalidad-crecimiento es estadísticamente significativa y pequeña, con lo cual, la contribución de la mayor actividad económica en la reducción de la informalidad laboral es también pequeña. Se sugiere que el crecimiento económico repercute en la informalidad mediante la creación neta de empleos mayormente formales y de mayor productividad respecto a los empleos informales. Además, se muestra que los empleos formales tienen un retorno mayor en términos de salario respecto al sector informal, aunque esta brecha se estaría reduciendo desde inicios de la década del 2010; lo cual estaría debilitando los incentivos hacia la formalización de los empleos.
K20|The business judgement rule – approach and application|The business judgment rule represents a central doctrine of corporate governance, due to its major implications on corporate directors' liability and to its infl uence on the relationship between shareholders and the board of directors. The interpretation of the Rule as a behavioral standard or as an „abstention doctrine” can determinatively influence the liability proceedings against directors who acted in consideration of their fiduciary duties. This paper aims at analyzing the national legal provisions of the Business Judgement Rule and the compatibility of the legal provisions with the established interpretations of the Rule that can be found in the foreign literature. Absent a case law that clarifies de approaches of the Business Judgement Rule by the national courts, the research analyzes the traditional Common Law approaches of the Rule and the obstacles which hinder a faithful transfer of the Rule in Romania. The objective of these identifications is to draw de lege ferenda proposals for anefficient application of the legal provisions in the future. Considering that this Rule is the natural consequence of trust and of the powers granted to corporate directors, the conclusions of the research suggest solutions for the stabilization of the continuous tension of the supreme values of the corporate world: authority and liability.
K20|A Humanising Economic Approach On Competition Policy Or How The Behavioral Economics Blends With “Traditional Economics”|Behavioral are crucial for understanding both the consumer’s attitude and firms’ attitude as well as for understanding the market outcomes. The past ten years brought a lot of attention from researchers and policy-makers on the behavioral economics issue. Classical, traditional economic models rely on the assumptions of rationality and ordered preferences. Behavioral economics explores interactions between demand and supply including information framing, the use of heuristics in decision-making and time-inconsistent preferences. The research on behavioral economics has led to an extensive debate about the relative merits of both traditional and behavioral economics. First of all we propose to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of behavioral economics versus traditional economics on a very sensitive issue: the competition policy. Then we address market issues that can be solved by means of behavioral economics afterwards turning out attention to the remedies of behavioral economics and ,last but not least, the United Kingdom successful model on the matter of competition policy.
K20|Institutional distance and foreign direct investment|This paper studies the link between foreign direct investment (FDI) and institutional distance. Using a heterogeneous firms framework, we develop a theoretical model to explain how institutional distance influences FDI, and it is shown that institutional distance reduces both the likelihood that a firm will invest in a foreign country and the volume of investment it will undertake. We test our model using inward and outward FDI data on OECD countries. The empirical results confirm the theory and indicate that FDI activity declines with institutional distance. In addition, we find that firms from developed economies adapt more easily to institutional distance than firms from developing economies. Copyright Kiel Institute 2015
K20|Regulation in Swiss Cantons: Data for one Century|We present and illustrate novel data on more than a century of regulation in Switzerland. We provide quantitative measures for Swiss cantons on the annual stock of legally binding rules from 2006-2013 and on regulatory activity as reflected in the annual changes to such regulation from 1908-2013. We measure the stock of regulation by the number of enactments and characters, and the regulatory activity by the number of changed enactments and pages. We break down the measures by the level in the hierarchy of legal norms and by the issuing authority. The data reveal substantial cantonal heterogeneity in the stock of regulation and the extent and development of regulatory activity. Regulatory activity generally increased over the century, though in a non-monotonic and volatile manner. Quantitatively, regulation at the level of decrees and regulation by the executive dominate. We also construct our measures for the federal level from 2006-2013 (stock) and 1848-2013 (activity).
K20|What factors influence firm perceptions of labour market constraints to growth in the MENA region?|Purpose - – Labour market constraints constitute prominent obstacles to firm development and economic growth of countries located in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The purpose of this paper is to examine the implications of firm characteristics, national locations, and sectoral associations for the perceptions of firms concerning two basic labour market constraints: labour regulations and labour skill shortages. Design/methodology/approach - – The empirical analysis is carried out using firm-level data set sourced from the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys database. A bivariate probit estimator is used to account for potential correlations between the errors in the two labour market constraints’ equations. The authors implement overall estimations and comparative cross-country and cross-sector analyses, and use alternative estimation models. Findings - – The empirical results reveal some important implications of firm characteristics (e.g. firm size, labour compositions) for firm perceptions of labour regulations and labour skill shortages. They also delineate important cross-country and cross-sector variations. The authors also find significant heterogeneity in the factors’ implications for the perceptions of firms belonging to different sectors and located in different MENA countries. Originality/value - – Reforms in labour regulations and investment in human capital are important governmental policy interventions for promoting firm development and economic growth in the MENA region. This paper contributes to the empirical literature by analysing the factors influencing the perceptions of firms located in the MENA region concerning labour regulations and labour skill shortages. It provides policy-makers with information needed in the design of labour policies that attenuate the impacts of labour market constraints and enhance the performance of firms and the long-run economic growth.
K20|Prevention And Control Of The Tax Evasion Impact On Romanian Economy|"Time of occurrence of tax evasion is closely linked even to social developments, this social phenomenon has emerged and evolved at the same time with the company. Since tax evasion is a phenomenon particularly harmful and despicable paradoxically, it has unfortunately been a negative and unintended consequence, with directions of development and different incidents in any country, regardless of size, level of development or form power organization. In Romania, the underground economy is strong because it is determined by the size of the phenomenon of crime in the economic and financial (dirty money), a phenomenon characterized by a very high level of ""financial engineering"" made in the privatization, investment, financial institutions - banks and the use of public funds. Thus, effective tools are triggered by conversion and diversion of capital flows in order to remove it from licit financial circuit."
K20|Reputation and regulations as market and non-market mechanisms to reduce bifurcated risk|This paper presents a new concept of bifurcated risk and market and non-market mechanisms reducing the risk. Bifurcated risk occurs in different situations, and it is characterized by a disruption of the relationship between decision-making and the resulting consequences. The bifurcated risk is followed by a number of very negative consequences in the form of disturbances of institutional order and a decrease in the level of generalized trust which leads to an increase in transaction costs. Therefore, it is important to reduce this risk, by means of using various market and non-market mechanisms. This article presents two such mechanisms — reputation and regulations. Reputation reduces the bifurcated risk, because on one hand, it creates stimuli which discourage decision-makers from taking this risk, on the other hand helps to reduce information asymmetry, allowing entities susceptible to the effects of risks to avoid entering into relationships with entities which are the source of this risk. Regulations in turn play a greater role not in preventing the emergence of the bifurcated risk, but in mitigating the negative consequences associated with the risk. Reputation and regulations are complementary and as mechanisms to reduce the bifurcated risk can occur together.
K20|The importance of law and economics in the contemporary economic reality|The law and economics movement can improve the functioning of companies doing business in the contemporary, rapidly changing, reality. The tensions between the idea of efficiency and the idea of justice cause difficulties in the application of tools which are proposed by the representatives of the law and economics movement in legal solutions. Economics proposes a new, fresh look at the law, which makes it easier to assess and influence the growth of its transparency. Perspective can therefore be useful for subjects who create and use the existing regulations.
K20|European Unification Based on Flexibility and Diversity|European unification has a noble aim but is endangered by encompassing egalitarianism and bureaucratization, and is moreover subject to a major democracy deficit. This paper argues that flexible and dynamic entities whose territoriality is determined by issues are appropriate for a Europe of the 21st century. The first step must be to constitutionally allow the emergence and existence of corresponding political entities with taxing and spending power. Over time these flexible, democratic, and diverse political units will take over those activities national states and the EU do not fulfill well.
K20|The Emergence of Law and Behavioural Science: A European Perspective|Nudge and the Law explores the legal implications of the emergent phenomenon of behaviourally informed intervention. It focuses on the challenges and opportunities it may offer to the policymaking of the European Union. This dual focus on law and on Europe characterises our endeavour. This volume has been structured by taking as a point of the departure the current nudging debate, which mainly comprises two strands of enquiry: when is it legitimate for States to use psychology to inform policy? (the legitimacy debate) and, to the extent that it is legitimate, how can behavioural insights in practice be incorporated into the decision making processes? (the practicability debate). Against this backdrop we brought together scholars who could analyse what behavioural insights might bring to EU law, both at a horizontal level and at a sectoral level. This volume endeavours to present the results of their research in a manner that is accessible both to EU law specialists who are not yet familiar with behavioural sciences and to behavioural lawyers who are not specialists in EU law.

K20|The role of the chief legal officer in corporate governance|The CLO shapes and enforces corporate governance, but is faced with a dual-role paradox that requires her to act as both monitor of corporate governance and executive of the firm. We study the role of the CLO under environments that are most likely to impact governance and pressure the firm to either emphasize or marginalize the CLO's role as monitor or facilitator. Using the financial shock of a securities class action lawsuit on large corporations, we measure changes in CLO value through the metrics of total and relative compensation of the CLO and other C-suite members. After controlling for relevant variables such as growth and total assets, we find that when firms have more insiders on their board of directors, the CLO's compensation declines when the preceding year's Tobin's Q is high. CLO compensation increases under conditions of high opacity, but that compensation partially erodes in high Tobin's Q environments. We also find that a lawsuit increases CFO and CEO turnover but not the CLO's. Our results have implications for corporate governance, the dual and potentially conflicting role of CLO as gatekeeper and monitor, executive compensation, and agency costs.
K20|The wealth effects of premium subsidies on moral hazard in insurance markets|Insurance premium subsidies are present in many insurance markets. The Swiss government, for example, paid out CHF 4.26 billion or 0.72% of the Swiss GDP for health insurance premium subsidies in 2011. Analyses of premium subsidies have often highlighted that the increased insurance demand due to premium subsidies increases the effects of moral hazard in the market. Other consequences of premium subsidies, however, have mostly been neglected by the literature. We show in our theoretical model that the wealth effects of premium subsidies decrease the sensitivity of the insured towards the monetary consequences of losses. This leads to less prevention efforts by the insured and thus increases moral hazard in the market. The effect is preserved if the subsidy is financed through proportional taxation. Using two alternative models, we show that providing state-dependent subsidies can either increase or reverse this effect, depending on which state subsidies are paid. We argue that whether demand effects or wealth effects of premium subsidies will dominate the insured׳s behavior depends on the market structure.
K20|Discussion of “Textual analysis and international financial reporting: Large sample evidence”|Lang and Stice-Lawrence (2015) find that firms which have adopted IFRS exhibit higher quality textual characteristics in their annual reports. In addition, they find that the textual characteristics of these annual reports are associated with firm economic outcomes. In this discussion, we first examine different explanations for each of these findings. We then examine the association between the length of U.S. 10-K filings and institutional ownership in U.S. firms. In addition, we use a case study to illustrate the challenges in establishing a causal relation between textual characteristics and economic outcomes. Lastly, we provide suggestions for areas of future research.
K20|Assessing the distributional effects of regulation in developing countries|The paper examines the effect of regulation on income inequality for 72 developing countries over the 1970–2012 period using General Method of Moment estimation technique. The results show that regulation is positive and significantly related to income inequality. The results indicate that regulation has differential effects in developing countries, with the most detrimental effect in Latin America. After controlling for types of regulation, it emerges that labor and general business regulations have a positive effect, while credit market regulations have no effect on the distribution of income.
K20|The Economic Impact of Rescue and Recovery Frameworks in the EU|This paper provides empirical support to the important role of efficient pre-insolvency frameworks in fostering a culture of early restructuring and second chances in EU Member States and the positive impact that this has on entrepreneurship, as well as the timeliness and cost of corporate and household deleveraging. The analysis is based on a set of composite indicators measuring specific efficiency aspects of rescue and recovery frameworks. These were built using principal component analysis applied on a comparison of the legal provisions they encompass. Econometric analysis carried out on the basis of these indicators suggests that, across the EU, efficient pre-insolvency frameworks are positively associated with relatively higher levels of entrepreneurship and deleveraging episodes with a relatively milder impact on financial stability and economic activity.
K20|Cross-border banking on the two sides of the Atlantic: Does it have an impact on bank crisis management?|Abstract In the USA and the EU, political incentives to oppose cross-border banking have been strong in spite of the measurable benefits to the real economy from breaking down geographic barriers. Even a federal-level supervisor and safety net is not by itself sufficient to incentivize cross-border banking although differences in the institutional set up are reflected in the way the two areas responded to the crisis. The US response was a coordinated response, and the cost of resolving banks was borne at the national level. Moreover, the FDIC could market failed banks to other banks irrespective of state boundaries reducing the cost of the crisis to the US economy and the sovereign finances. In the EU, the crisis resulted in financial market fragmentation and unbearable costs to some sovereigns.

K20|Section 6-7. Military Economy and Military Reform in Russia|The accession of the Republic of Crimea to the Russian Federation in March 2014 was not favored by the global community and resulted in Western economic sanctions against Russia, getting even tougher throughout the entire year. The sanctions were focused chiefly on Russia’s defense sector, having a strong adverse impact on the fulfillment of the state armaments program and the military-industrial complex (MIC) development program planned by the Russian leadership. The key tit-for-tat measures included the development of import substitution plans in the military-industrial complex and the placement of the Military Industrial Commission under the supervision of President Vladimir Putin in September. The international sanctions in 2014 had no effect whatsoever on the performance of the plans of professionalization and combat training of Russia’s Armed Forces.
K20|Section 6. Institutional Changes|The main developments over the past year in the sphere under consideration were the launch of the second three-year privatization program for the years 2014–2016; the approval of the new government program Federal Property Management until 2018; the transfer, by a court ruling, of JSC Bashneft back to Russian Federation ownership; the continuation of the active process of creation of integrated structures in the defense industry and related sectors; absence of any significant deals completed on the corporate control market with the participation of state companies; and the expansion, at the level of approved model documents, of the set of available instruments to be applied in the management of entities belonging to the public sector of the national economy.

K20|A remuneração dos administradores nas sociedades cotadas: determinantes e enquadramento jurídico|Este artigo revisita um tópico que ganhou novo interesse com vários acontecimentos ocorridos nos últimos anos: a remuneração dos administradores das sociedades cotadas. O estudo da literatura levou-nos a indagar quais seriam as determinantes e o enquadramento jurídico da remuneração. Analisamos a legislação comunitária e nacional que regia esta temática no período em análise. A remuneração dos administradores é regulada por hard law e soft law. Foi também analisado o efeito do desempenho e dimensão da sociedade na remuneração dos administradores. Encontramos indícios de que o desempenho anterior da sociedade influencia a remuneração dos administradores executivos, e que a dimensão da empresa tem impacto significativo na remuneração dos administradores.
K20|Economic Duress and Significant Imbalance: Two Different Approaches of Contractual Imbalances|In France, the draft order of February 25th 2015 devotes two new tools permitting the control of contractual imbalance: economic duress on the one hand, and significant imbalance on the other hand. These two mechanisms attest to the interest given to this issue and to the renewal of traditional tools in favour of mechanisms which are inspired by consumer and competition laws. While economic duress sanctions the abuse of economic dependence, significant imbalance shows a broad scope for its implementation, which raises many interrogations. The challenge is to determine the goals of such tools and to ensure the consistency and readability of general contract law.
K20|Law, Stock Markets, and Innovation|We study a broad sample of firms across 32 countries and find that strong shareholder protections and better access to stock market financing lead to substantially higher long-run rates of R&D investment, particularly in small firms, but are unimportant for fixed capital investment. Credit market development has a modest impact on fixed investment but no impact on R&D. These findings connect law and stock markets with innovative activities key to economic growth, and show that legal rules and financial developments affecting the availability of external equity financing are particularly important for risky, intangible investments not easily financed with debt.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K20|Regulation, firm dynamics and entrepreneurship|Entrepreneurship can have important positive effects linked to job creation, wealth and income generation, innovation and industry competitiveness. Scholars and policy-makers around the world have turned to the regulatory environment as a mechanism through which entrepreneurship can be encouraged, grown and its economic benefits harnessed. The effect of regulatory conditions on entrepreneurship however is not well understood, and can be nuanced given the wide range of regulatory tools and possible areas of impact. This paper serves as the introduction to a special issue, which seeks to shed some light on the relationship between regulation, firm dynamics and entrepreneurship. We identify some foundational considerations relevant to this relationship and discuss key questions, followed by a brief overview of each of the papers contained in the special issue.

K20|Legal Risk Premia During the Euro-Crisis: The Role of Credit and Redenomination Risk|Using several new datasets, I document the role of legal risk premia in bond yields during the Euro-crisis. I find evidence of a rising premium especially in late 2011 and mid-2012 on bonds with foreign governing law relative to those with local governing law (and otherwise similar characteristics). The results illustrate that legal risk premia spiked at the height of the crisis in the Eurozone, when investors were willing to pay a premium for the additional protection offered by foreign law bonds. I show that this governing law premium can be linked to both credit risk (expected haircuts) and redenomination risk (expected currency depreciation). This paper is the first to empirically link the governing law premium to redenomination risk. I find evidence that redenomination risk is an independent driving force of governing law spreads over and above credit risk, although it is analytically challenging to separate the two risk factors. My findings, while not conclusive, are consistent with the consensus in the literature on contract law, which argues that local law financial instruments should be more susceptible to redenomination in a scenario of a country exiting the Eurozone.
K20|Policy Options for a Revised EU Access and Interconnection Regime|The formulation of a next generation regulatory model for access and interconnection by 2020 needs to respond to the many pressure points to which the existing regulatory framework for electronic communications has been subject since 2002. These factors range from the analytical elements of the system of market analysis and remedy selection, commercial and technological developments, the adoption of new policy orientations by the European Commission, and the institutional framework for decision-making. The Paper explores the value of maintaining fundamental elements of the present regulatory regime, while adopting a more “hybridized” approach which seeks to bridge the twin disciplines of regulation and competition law.
K20|A New Approach To Financial Regulation At The European Level|With the recent financial and economic crisis onset, a fragility of the financial system became apparent, under the form of a series of vulnerabilities and failures with a strong destabilizing impact on the economy. In this context, a new approach to financial stability has outlined itself, pleading for a more extensive financial regulation and macro-prudential supervision, complementary to the micro-prudential one. The objectives of this article are to highlight the context and need for a new financial regulatory framework and underline the main problems of the banking system the new European regulations addresses.
K20|Optimal safety standards when accident prevention depends upon both firm and worker effort|This paper develops a model to analyze safety regulation when decisions made by both the firm and the firm’s employees (workers) have effect on the risk of accidents. In the model, the safety investments by the firm are contractible (perfect enforcement) while the safety efforts of workers can be contractible or non-contractible. We show that in the absence of regulation, a first-best outcome is unattainable unless third-party accident costs are zero and worker effort is contractible. The optimal standard produces suboptimal solutions and depends on factors such as safety effort costs, accident technology, the distribution of accident costs across firms, workers, and third parties, and whether or not worker effort is contractible. Under specific assumptions the optimal standard is more lenient than the safety investment level chosen by the firm in the absence of regulation.

K20|Earnings management and government restrictions on outward foreign direct investment: evidence from Taiwanese firms|This study examines whether firms engage in earnings management to overcome government policies on limiting outward foreign direct investment (FDI), and whether their earnings-management behavior is aligned with shareholders’ interests. Using the regulatory setting in Taiwan, where the government has placed a cap on FDI in China for listed firms, we find that firms with FDI ratios near the limit (near-limit firms) are more likely to engage in income-increasing earnings management to shore up their shareholders’ equity, thus reducing their propensity to breach government policy. In addition, near-limit Taiwanese firms engaged in income-increasing earnings management show greater increases in FDI in China and better performance in the years following their earnings-management activities. We also find that the positive effects of earnings management on the future performance of these firms are driven by incremental FDI in China. The effects are more pronounced in firms with strong corporate governance. The results suggest that when the government’s restrictions on outward FDI are inconsistent with an individual firm’s objective of maximizing shareholder value, managers are motivated to use earnings-management strategies to circumvent governmental constraints on outward FDI.

K20|Geographical Factors in Determining IFDI Policy|With the initiative of the West China Development policy, the flow of Inward Foreign Direct Investment (IFDI) gradually increased in western China. This paper investigates and tests the determinants of IFDI for western China’s11 provincesduring2002 – 2008. By compiling a pool data set and employing General Least Squares (GLS) with fixed effects model in natural logarithmic form, we explorethe IFDI in western China thoroughly. The proposed model illustrates reliable estimates of determinants of IFDI for the region. The market size, laborcosts, education level, imports and highway length are found to have a significant relationship with IFDI in western China, hence, they may be considered as determinants. On the other hand, research and development (R&D), length of railways, and postal and telecommunication services have a statistically insignificant effect on IFDI.
K20|Regulating Internalities|This paper offers a framework for regulating internalities. Using a simple economic model, we provide four principles for designing and evaluating behaviorally-motivated policy. We then outline rules for determining which contexts reliably reflect true preferences and discuss empirical strategies for measuring internalities. As a case study, we focus on energy efficiency policy, including Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards and appliance and lighting energy efficiency standards.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K20|The Economics of the Right to be Forgotten| We offer an economic analysis of the right to be forgotten (RTBF)-- the right to remove links from the search results --through a legal dispute game between a petitioner and a search engine. Our analysis suggests that the global expansion of the RTBF does not necessarily increase the likelihood of link removals. We also find that the RTBF expansion can either improve or reduce welfare from a social perspective. Therefore, the ongoing debate should be guided by the perspective of achieving a socially optimal level of link removals rather than of a conflict between privacy rights and free speech.

K20|Implicit Regulatory Barriers in the EU Single Market: New Empirical Evidence from Gravity Models|Gravity models are used to explore the determinants of trade, making use of fixed effect linear estimators and a Poisson estimator (as in Santos Silva and Tenreyro, 2006) with fixed effects. Beyond usual determinants of trade such as GDP, distance, contiguity, free trade areas and language, this analysis mainly focuses on the role of product market regulation stringency and heterogeneity, and on the role of employment protection. The Single Market has a large positive impact on trade. A broad reform package that would align Product Market Regulation (PMR) indicators to the average of the top half of the best performers and would cut regulatory heterogeneity by one fifth could increase trade intensity within the EU by more than 10%. This analysis also makes use of subcomponents of the PMR indicator (by field of regulation) and the OECD Energy, Transport and Communications Regulation (ETCR) indicator (by sector) to focus on elements on the regulatory issues that matter most for trade. In particular, the stringency of airline and telecom regulations has an adverse effect on trade intensity. Empirical findings on the impact of employment protection legislation on trade intensity are somewhat mixed. This Working Paper relates to the 2014 OECD Economic Survey of the European Union (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-european-union.htm). Barrières réglementaires implicites dans le marché unique de l'UE : Nouveaux résultats de modèles de gravité Les modèles de gravité sont utilisés pour explorer les déterminants du commerce, avec des estimateurs linéaires avec effets fixes et un estimateur de Poisson (comme dans Santos Silva et Tenreyro, 2006) avec des effets fixes. Au-delà des déterminants habituels du commerce tels que le PIB, la distance, la contiguïté, les zones de libre-échange et la langue, cette analyse se concentre principalement sur le rôle de la réglementation des marchés de produits et de son hétérogénéité, et sur le rôle de la protection de l'emploi. Le marché unique a un impact positif important sur le commerce. Un ensemble large de réformes qui alignerait les indicateurs de réglementation des marchés de produits (RMP) à la moyenne de la moitié des pays les plus performants et qui réduirait l'hétérogénéité des réglementations par un cinquième pourrait augmenter l'intensité des échanges au sein de l'UE de plus de 10%. Cette analyse utilise également des sous-composantes de l’indicateur RMP (par domaines de réglementation) et de l’indicateur OCDE de la réglementation dans les secteurs de l'énergie, des transports et des communications (ETCR) (par secteur) pour se concentrer sur les éléments de réglementation qui comptent le plus pour le commerce. En particulier, la rigueur de la réglementation aérienne et des télécommunications a un effet négatif sur l'intensité des échanges. Les résultats empiriques sur l'impact de la législation de protection de l'emploi sur l'intensité des échanges sont quelque peu mitigés.

K20|The Heterogeneity of Product Market Regulations|This paper is making use of the OECD product market regulation (PMR) database to measure the heterogeneity of product market regulation across countries for the whole economy, for the main subcomponents of the PMR indicator and for the internet economy. The heterogeneity within EU countries is quite close to the heterogeneity between EU and non-EU countries. Reforms are associated in a majority of cases with a reduction of heterogeneity, and heterogeneity in countries has diminished more the farther they were from common practices. This Working Paper relates to the 2014 OECD Economic Survey of the European Union (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-european-union.htm ). L'hétérogénéité de la réglementation des marchés de produits Ce document utilise la base de données de la réglementation des marchés de produits de l'OCDE (RMP) pour mesurer l'hétérogénéité entre pays de la réglementation des marchés de produits pour l'ensemble de l'économie, pour les principales sous-composantes de l'indicateur RMP et pour l'économie de l'internet. L'hétérogénéité entre pays de l'UE est assez proche de l'hétérogénéité entre les pays de l'UE et les pays hors de l’UE. Les réformes sont associées dans la majorité des cas à une réduction de l'hétérogénéité, et l'hétérogénéité dans les pays a diminué davantage lorsque qu’ils étaient plus loin des pratiques courantes.

K20|Russia: Progress in Structural Reform and Framework Conditions 2011-13|Since 1995 when OECD began conducting Economic Surveys of the Russian Federation many policy recommendations relating to structural reform and framework conditions have been made. This paper is an update of an earlier paper that described actions taken up to October 2011 (Vaziakova et al., 2011). It expands the Annex A.1 of the 2013 OECD Economic Survey of the Russian Federation and provides a summary table of the policies implemented. This Working Paper relates to the 2014 Economic Survey of the Russian Federation www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-russian-federation.htm Russie : Progrès des réformes structurelles et des conditions-cadres 2011-13 Depuis 1995, date à laquelle l'OCDE a commencé à mener des Études économiques de la Fédération de Russie, un grand nombre de recommandations politiques relatives aux réformes structurelles et aux conditions-cadres ont été mises en oeuvre en Russie. Ce document est une mise à jour d'un document de travail antérieur qui décrit les mesures prises jusqu'en Octobre 2011 (Vaziakova et al., 2011). Il élargit l'annexe 1.A1 de l’Étude économique de la Fédération de Russie 2013 et fournit un tableau récapitulatif des politiques adoptées. Ce document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE 2014 sur la Fédération de Russie www.oecd.org/fr/eco/etudes/etude-economique-russie.htm.
K20|The negative effect of regulatory divergence on foreign direct investment|The determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI) are explored with gravity models, using a Poisson estimator and a linear estimator, both with fixed effects. The heterogeneity of product market regulations has a large and robust impact on cross-border investment: a reduction of regulatory divergence by one fifth could increase FDI by about 15%. In particular, the divergence of command and control regulations and of protection of incumbents (antitrust exemptions, entry barriers in networks and services) reduce cross-border investment. In addition, countries with higher employment protection have both less inward and less outward FDI, and there is some evidence that more complex regulatory procedures reduce inward FDI. L'effet négatif de l'hétérogénéité des réglementations sur l'investissement direct étranger Les déterminants de l’investissement direct étranger (IDE) sont analysés au moyen de modèles de gravité, en utilisant un estimateur de Poisson et un estimateur linéaire à effets fixes. L’hétérogénéité des réglementations des marchés de produits a un impact significatif et durable sur l’investissement international : une réduction d’un cinquième des différences entre les réglementations nationales pourrait accroître l’IDE d’environ 15 %. En particulier, les divergences entre les réglementations du type injonction et contrôle et entre les protections des acteurs en place (en termes de dérogations au droit de la concurrence, d’obstacles à l’entrée dans les industries de réseau et les secteurs de services) sont un frein à l’investissement international. En outre, les pays dotés d’une législation plus rigoureuse sur la protection de l’emploi enregistrent à la fois moins d’IDE entrant et moins d’IDE sortant, et des éléments montrent que des procédures réglementaires plus complexes réduisent l’IDE entrant.
K20|Citizens United, Independent Expenditures, and Agency Costs: Reexamining the Political Economy of State Antitakeover Statutes|We test the agency theory of corporate political activity by examining the association between the legality of independent expenditures and antitakeover lawmaking in the US states. Exploiting changes in state law regarding the use of corporate independent expenditures in the pre-Citizens United era, we estimate that a state is more likely to pass antitakeover statutes that entrench management when firms are allowed to make independent expenditures. We also find that this relationship is conditional on the competitiveness of a state’s electoral environment, suggesting that the threat of independent expenditures may move vulnerable legislators’ votes on less salient issues, such as corporate governance. These findings are robust to competing public interest and political economy explanations for antitakeover lawmaking, and they reveal that allowing independent expenditures may create additional agency costs for owners through public policy. Finally, these results strongly challenge the claim that state-level antitakeover laws are exogenous to firms’ activities. (JEL D72, G38, K20)
K20|Bonding Through Investments: Evidence from Franchising|This article studies whether producers’ up-front investments can help sustain relations with business partners. The initial investment combined with the business partner’s threat to terminate the contract before it expires can generate a bonding mechanism that precludes the producer from behaving opportunistically. I test this view using franchise contract data and a natural experiment. In practice, the franchisor (business partner) determines how much a franchisee (producer) needs to invest up-front. I show that franchisors affected by the passing of a law that restricts their ability to terminate misbehaving franchisees ask their franchisees for higher up-front investments. This result is particularly large for small franchise systems, as franchisees’ investments are less redeployable in case of contract termination. The data suggest that contractual up-front investments can be used to sustain business relations (JEL L14, K20, M21).
K20|The Economic Impact of the Collective Dismissal Procedure Performed at the Level of an Insolvent Employer|In the context of frequent legislative changes occurring in business and especially in the regulating state of economic difficulty that might find a company, this study deals with the impact of the economic changes which an insolvent employer goes through on its employees, the measures that can be taken and regulations pertaining to this matter in terms of attracting new domestic legislative changes to align Romanian legislation with the European one.
K20|“Fettered” and “unfettered” capitalism in J.A. Schumpeter’s concept of Tax State and economic development|Economic development and transformation processes, have become much more intense in economic reality in the last years than they have ever been before. At this time has raised a lot of questions about the causes of the actual Global Crisis, future crises, the factors affecting the modern economy, about the essence of contemporary capitalism, demographic problems and overgrown bureaucracy. The most spectacular threat to capitalism, (based on private entrepreneurship) according to Schumpeter, stems from the high, growing and progressive taxation. Schumpeter saw clearly that the financing of public goods and services (requiring taxes, maybe even relatively high) is something other than a clerical control of the economic system that violates the natural economic mechanism. Moreover Schumpeter says explicitly, that entrepreneur does not have to be one person, he even states that the country (state) itself, or its agenda, can act as an entrepreneur. Therefore can be concluded that we may have to deal with “Tax State” which is typical for “fettered capitalism” and with “entrepreneurial state” which is typical for “unfettered capitalism”. The main goal of this paper is to present two different approaches to economic development concept: Schumpeter’s “fettered” and “unfettered” capitalism in the context of “Tax State” and interventionism.
K20|The question of State aid for rescuing and restructuring undertakings in difficulty in the context of the general government sector debt of EU Member States|"The subject of the article is an analysis of the rules of state aid admissibility on the basis of the implementing regulations, adopted by the European Commission in 2004 and 2014 on rescue and restructuring aid. This should lead to verify the thesis that due to the taken up at EU level - in response to the effects of the financial and economic crisis – economic recovery plan, the support of the public authorities directed at rescuing and restructuring undertakings in difficulty has become the most broadly used form of State aid due to the value among all the forms of aid granted by Member States of the European Union. The adoption of such a thesis raises the question of the influence of State aid on the size of the general government sector debt in the EU Member States, which have provided State aid for undertakings in difficulty. This analysis was carried out based on the linear regression model. The response variable (dependent variable Y) is the size of the general government sector debt, and explanatory variable (independent variable X) is the expenditure on State aid. The research shows that between expenditures of the EU Member States on aid for rescuing and restructuring undertakings in difficulty and the condition of the public finances of these countries there is no substantial statistical relationship. Taking this into consideration the most important question arises. Does the State aid ""to prevent the bankruptcy of undertakings” follow the condition of art. 107 par. 2 point c of Treaty on the functioning of the European Union?"
K20|Gouvernance, Capital humain et Croissance économique dans la zone OCDE: Application sur les données de panel dynamique (GMM)<BR>[Governance, Human Capital and Economic Growth in OECD countries: Applying the dynamic panel data (GMM)]|"The interest of this paper is to show that ""good governance"" was one of the main success factors of OECD countries. Indeed, the good governance has direct and indirect influences on economic growth of these countries. Our empirical attempt, dynamic panel data (GMM) and during the period 1998 to 2006, trying to clarify the direct and indirect effects of good governance on economic growth through human capital. Our sample consists of twenty OECD countries on which we test the impact of good governance on economic growth through human capital. We investigate how the concept of ""good governance"" provides the human capital, the framework of the fight against the corruption of the institution of nations."
