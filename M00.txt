M00|Scientific Knowledge in Management and its Praxeology|"Objective - The praxeology recognized by some theorists as the relevance of the results of the research process for managerial and academic practice, is evidenced by others as absent. The purpose of this paper is to propose an evaluation of the results of the research process in management, particularly in the ""doctoral theses"" in management in Colombia over the last 9 years, from a reflexive approach as the epistemology of human sciences and critical performativity that allows us to answer the question: What is the level of knowledge praxeology generated in doctoral theses in management in Colombia? Methodology/Technique - The work proposes to start with an exploratory sequential approach to identify the categories of praxeological focus in the literature and theses. Then, a strategy of quantitative evaluation of the observable aspects in the theses is designed. Finally, the strategy is applied to the theses and the results are documented. Findings & Novelty - The current scope of this proposal is limited to the information that will be collected in the observation of doctoral theses. The results should be interpreted considering this restriction. This proposal presents an approach to interpret the praxeological focus from the functionalist explanation to the comprehensive in doctoral research in management where the traditional scheme has been positivism."
M00|Editorial: Enhancing Quantitative Exploratory Entrepreneurship Research|The purpose of this editorial is to discuss ways to enhance exploratory quantitative studies in entrepreneurship. We use examples from entrepreneurship research and other scientific fields to illustrate the advantages of graphical data display for both exploratory purposes and post hoc tests. We provide suggestions for authors, reviewers, and editors on ways to enhance the transparency, accuracy, and pedagogical presentation of quantitative data in papers with the explicit purpose of illuminating emerging and important entrepreneurship phenomena. Our hope is that we spark a conversation among entrepreneurship scholars about the state of our empirical work and the possibilities that lie ahead to enhance exploratory entrepreneurship research.
M00|2 Editorial: Enhancing Quantitative Theory-Testing Entrepreneurship Research|The purpose of this editorial is to discuss methodological advancements to enhance quantitative theory-testing entrepreneurship research. As the impact of entrepreneurship scholarship accelerates and deepens, our methods must keep pace to continue shaping theory, policy, and practice. Like our sister fields in business, entrepreneurship is coming to terms with the replication and credibility crisis in the social sciences, forcing the field to revisit commonly-held assumptions that limit the promise and prospect of our scholarship. Thus, we provide suggestions for reviewers and editors to identify concerns in empirical work, and to guide authors in improving their analyses and research designs. We hope that our editorial provides useful and actionable guidance for entrepreneurship researchers submitting theory-testing papers to Journal of Business Venturing.

M00|Analysis of Higher Education in Indian National Education Policy Proposal 2019 and its Implementation Challenges|Systematic education policy is essential for offering school and college education in a country due to the reason that education leads to progress in society. Different countries use different education systems with different stages during its life cycle of school and College education levels. Recently, the Government of India received a draft Education policy suggested by an expert committee headed by Dr. K. Kasturirangan, former chairman of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). The committee suggested both incremental and drastically changes in existing Indian education policy and give guidelines to effective implementation in the country by 2030. This is also in line with the Objectives of fourth Sustainable Development Goals to provide quality education for all citizens through fourth Educational Industry Revolution (EIR 4.0) in the country. This paper reviews the related literature during last few years on Indian Higher Education Policies and their consequences, Salient features and their focuses on the present draft of National Education policy 2019 through content analysis. The paper highlights on various policies proposed in the draft with the special emphasis on higher education section and compare them with the previous policies. The analysis also compares the possible effects of NEP 2019 proposal on private and public HEIs in terms of facilities & restrictions.

Appropriate suggestions are made to realize the policy and make it defect free and effective from a public point of reference and for the prosperity of the country.
M00|The Effect of Working Capital Management on Dividend Policy: An Empirical Analysis of Listed Firms in Ghana|Relying on more recent data spanning 2007-2016, this paper investigates the impact of working capital management (WCM) on dividend policy of listed non-financial firms in Ghana. Specifically, the study assesses the effect of cash conversion cycle (CCC), days inventory outstanding (DIO), profitability, and firm growth on dividend policy. Employing the ordinary least squares (OLS) analytical technique, the findings reported that working capital management (in terms of cash conversion cycle and days inventory outstanding) and dividend policy are positively related, with DIO having a significant effect on dividend policy. The results also established a positive association between the control variables (profitability and firm growth) and dividend policy albeit insignificantly. Based on the findings, the study concludes that working capital management in terms of days inventory outstanding (DIO) is a critical factor influencing firms’ dividend policy decisions. The study extends the inconclusive empirical evidence on the determinants of dividend policy and fills the lacuna in existing literature by focusing on how working capital management practices influence dividend policy of firms in Ghana. The findings are also useful to the board of directors of non-financial firms in deciding an appropriate dividend policy, and to the shareholders in making investment decisions.
M00|Eco-funds based on a Portfolio Considering Corporate Carbon Productivity|Socially responsible investment (SRI) involves investors selecting companies based on their level of social responsibility. An eco-fund is an SRI-type investment trust that invests in environment-friendly companies, also known as ?eco-excellent? companies. In many cases, the process of choosing the companies to be included in the trust is not transparent and, due to subjective decisions by fund managers, it is not clear how the investment rate is determined.In this study, we propose four eco-funds and evaluate their performance. Since the risk of the eco-fund should be distributed, the investment rate will be determined so that the percentage of the top brands is low. The portfolio should consist of brands with high efficiency in environmental investment.First, we evaluate a company?s environmental management capability and profitability using quantitative data such as the amount of sales, greenhouse gas emissions, and ROE (return on equity). We then determine a set of brands for the eco-funds to invest in. To determine the investment rate for each stock or portfolio, an environmental minimum variance frontier is calculated.The proposed eco-funds are (1) EEC fund, (2) Beta fund, (3) Expanded beta fund, and (4) Environmental index fund. (1) The EEC fund invests in brands that perform well both in terms of environmental management based on carbon productivity and profitability based on ROE. (2) The Beta fund invests in brands that perform well both in environmental management based on carbon productivity beta values and earnings efficiency based on ROE. (3) The Expanded beta fund invests in brands that perform well only in environmental management based on carbon productivity beta values; it includes more brands than the Beta fund. (4) The Environmental index fund invests in all the brands considered and is a benchmark to measure the performance of the other eco-funds.
M00|The role of recruitment in the financial performance of the Banking System|Among the HR processes, recruitment has been considered to be one of the most important ones. Many theories nowadays emphasize the importance of recruitment practices in the welfare of an organization, stressing that its impact is crucial even in the business financial performance.The study has been focused on the impact of the recruitment practices in the financial results of 6 banks in the banking market in Albania! A deep analysis has been done, with the data gathered on the recruitment method for the involved banks, through the use of both SPSS and Econometric methods. The sources used for collecting the data has been both primary through surveys conducted and secondary through the information gathered from different online sources. This study has been conducted to evaluate the impact of the selection method of two categories of employees, experienced once and the recently graduated, on the overall performance and financial results of the business.The study is concluded with the analysis of the results showing a clear distinction on the costs of the business for recruitment of both categories, meaning that the recently graduated are less costly for the business. However there is not a clear distinction weather the recently graduates are performing better in comparison to the experienced recruited employees.
M00|Business Value Created By Management Accounting|Porter stated in his value chain concept that business support activities are contributing to the value creation process of a business organization. In the “classical view” business support activities are considered as indirect productive and not having a clear and direct contribution to the business organization value chain. The information age has enabled and leveraged business support activities to become decisive contributors to the value creation process of any business. Can this value contribution be somehow determined or quantified? Management accounting is a classical business support activity that contributes to the business organization value chain. Through usage of value management and value driven performance indicators, the value contribution can be determined and quantified. The present paper is highlighting one possible alternative to determine the value contribution by using indicators like economic value added and economic profit. The value-based approach is putting indirect productive business activities into a new position, the one of a clear and important business value creator that cannot be ignored in the 21st century, a century driven by data, a nd information and knowledge that can sustain a decisive sustainable competitive advantage.
M00|Managing Strategic Change and ERP Implementation under Distinctive Learning Styles: Quantitative case of Burberry PLC|This paper examines the effective strategic change management and Enterprise Resource Planning implementation under distinctive learning styles namely; diverging, converging, assembling, and accommodating learning styles through case of Burberry brand at Bicester Village, Cheshire Oaks, and Chatham Place. Additionally, paper investigates the strategic changes and organizational factors in relation with the ability to adopt change and successful ERP implementation. Total 87 respondents were approached through snowball, purposive, and convenience sampling. Findings revealed that accommodating learning style is the most influential learning style that significant positively affects the ERP implementation process. Interestingly, all learning styles (diverging, converging, assimilating, and accommodating) have statistically significant correlation with organizational change process. Additionally, complexity is the most critical organizational component affecting employees' ability to accept changes.
M00|The effectiveness of Feminine and Masculine Leadership styles in relation to contrasting gender's performances|This paper focuses on the impact and effectiveness of feminine and masculine styles of leadership on contrasting genders in four different economies namely; India, Canada, Pakistan, and United Kingdom's IT Sector. By combining probability and non-probability sampling techniques, the data has been gathered from 248 respondents via semi-structured 5-points scale survey questionnaire. The findings have shown that employees irrespective gender are significant positively affected by feminine leadership style. Additionally, in developing countries; Pakistan and India there is significant use of feminine leadership while developed economies namely; Canada and the UK have higher preference for masculine leadership style. Nevertheless, overall male workers do not have higher preference to work under masculine leadership style while females have higher preference for both masculine and feminine leadership styles. Interestingly, feminine style of leadership is highly demonstrated by males in Pakistan while in other three economies, it is exhibited by female line-managers. Moreover, female line-managers in the UK have shown higher masculine style of leadership in contrast to other economies. There is significant positive relationship between style of leadership and contrasting genders in distinctive economies. Additionally, feminine leadership style is more effective than the masculine leadership style. Feminine leaders demonstrate higher people-orientation and participative style of management whereas masculine leaders rely on task-orientation and autocratic style.
M00|Entrepreneurial Opportunity Recognition: A Review of Literature|Economic theory is the major theoretical perspective in entrepreneurship. Since entrepreneurial opportunity recognition is rooted in the entrepreneurship literature, it is necessary to understand the nature of entrepreneurial opportunity recognition from the economic theoretical perspective. Among the economic theory, entrepreneurship literature falls into two school of thoughts, neoclassical equilibrium theory and Austrian theory. The neoclassical equilibrium theory assumes that everyone can recognize all entrepreneurial opportunities, and it is individual?s risk-propensity that determines who become the entrepreneurs (Khilstrom & Laffont, 1979). However, the traditional neoclassical equilibrium theory fails to explain the framework of entrepreneurship and the existence of entrepreneurial opportunities (Eckhardt & Shane, 2003).Austrian theory assumes that people cannot recognize all opportunities. Austrian theory emphasizes that it is the imperfect market with information asymmetry that generates the information gap. In other words, opportunities do not appear in a well-packaged informational form (Venkataraman, 1997). Kirzner (1997) has indicated that the distribution of information in society influences the discovery of entrepreneurial opportunities, and only a small subset of individuals are able to identify and recognize particular opportunity in the market. In addition, the process of discovering opportunities depends on people?s ability and willingness to discover them. For example, people might not be able or may be unwilling to pay attention to external environment changes, which may lead to loss of the opportunity (Stevenson & Gumpert, 1985). Only those who recognize the existence of opportunities and value them can then earn profits from these new opportunities (Ardichvili, Cardozo, & Ray, 2003; Shane, 2000; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). That is, under the asymmetry of information circumstances, individuals with special insights and knowledge to discover and recognize entrepreneurial opportunities tend to be successful while others not able to recognize the opportunities or only see the risk for failure (Ulhøi, 2005). Since economic theory cannot fully explain the entrepreneurial opportunity recognition, scholars have shifted the focus to two different social science disciplines, psychology and sociology, to create theoretical frameworks to explain the process of opportunity recognition. In other words, the entrepreneurial opportunity recognition process can be investigated from personal cognitive framework and social context. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to review the literature and investigate the antecedents of entrepreneurial opportunity recognition.
M00|Is India Ready For Digital Content Marketing Advertisement: A Study Of Consumers In National Capital Region Of India|In a country where the trailer of a movie?s sequel can receive more than 65 million views in 24 hours, a digital content marketing advertisement is not able to receive even 1/6th of the views in 3 months of its launch. This raises a big question, as a country, Are our consumers viewing digital content marketing advertisements? Are the efforts and investments of companies in such advertisement generating desired results? Have these companies been able to increase their sales through these advertisements? Or the investments made in this effort are not very productive? This study attempts to find answers to all these questions raised with respect to the growing investments by organizations in digital content marketing yet seemingly poor awareness and conversion of customers. An empirical study is conducted on a sample of 178 respondents wherein they were shown ten digital content marketing advertisements and were asked questions on familiarity, perception, keenness, sensibility, recognition and realization of digital content marketing. The present study summarizes the results found and discussions thereof in the context of Indian customer.
M00|Effect Of Select Cognitive Biases On Financial And General Decision Making|People, everday are inumdated with making decisions whether they are big or small. Cognitive psychology plays a major role in how people make their choices. Cognitive bias is known to have an effect on decision making. These biases are based on memory which create a systematic deviation in thinking and processing information. This paper aims to identify the effect of select cognitive biases i.e., Overconfidence bias, Endowment bias, Ambiguity Aversion bias and Recency bias on General Decision Making of a person as well as Financial Decision Making. The study also explores the differences and similarities in cognitive biases working during general decision making and financial decision making. For this, a self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 416 people and analysis and conclusions were drawn based on it.
M00|What Will Drive Consumers To Buy Green Products: A Study Of Reinforcement Schedules To Be Applied In Marketing|Worldwide consumer?s consumption patterns are one of the prime cause of environmental deterioration. It is a threat to social and economic stability and sustainable human existence. As the environment continues to worsen, it has become a crucial concern across the globe for environmentalists, organizations, governments and people in general to encourage and adopt green behavior. Much has been done in this direction starting from national level policies to organizations making green products. Eco-conscious business leaves no stone unturned in providing eco-information to the prospective customers through ad-campaigns, usage of various eco-labels. Yet literature suggests that it seems to hardly affect consumer?s purchase decision. Eco-information is considered to be a definite concern but purchase is guided by personal interest. This situation is a call for now applying behavior modification techniques to pull customer towards purchase of environment friendly products. This study is an attempt to understand how reinforcement schedules can be used by marketers to modify consumer behavior towards green products. The study aims at using empirical methodology in identifying pull factors to motivate green behavior through reinforcement schedules.
M00|An Empirical Study On Role Of Consumer?S Need Hierarchy In Choice Of Cognitive Biases To Be Used In Marketing|The human mind is very sensitive to what information it receives and how it interprets this information. We like to think that we are logical, objective, rational and reasonable in our decision making even when we are strongly affected by our own personal feelings. Cognitive biases represent the methodical way a person justifies an illogical way of thinking. Individual cognitive biases influence decision making. Clever marketers use their understanding of cognitive biases to convince people to make purchases. Understanding cognitive biases can help marketers impact how we buy, sell, feel, think and interact. There are numerous articles, research papers, and white papers discussing how marketers make use of cognitive biases, but there are no studies to demonstrate, which cognitive bias which is guided by individual need that may further result in the purchase decision. The present study is based on the presumption that purchase decisions for the products satisfying needs at various levels of Maslow?s need hierarchy will be guided by different cognitive biases. To check this presumption the present study is conducted to map which cognitive biases used by marketers in advertisements of products satisfying various needs of an individual got converted in purchase of the product. The results of the study suggest which cognitive biases should be used for products at various need hierarchy levels for effective marketing.
M00|The Business Intelligence Model Validation|Due the lack of relevant frameworks into Business Intelligence (BI) research there is need for building new theoretical frameworks for intelligence activities to enable more effective information management and decision making. This presentation shall illustrate the part of survey results related for multi-scale Ph.D. Research study to define and measure the constructs to validate a model for the Connection of the Business Intelligence to Corporate Strategy and Corporate Value. The maximization strategy generally involves making sound financial investment decisions by taking into consideration any risk factors that would compromise or out-weight the anticipated benefits. The survey covers non-financial indicators influence for corporate wealth maximization. The purpose is to analyze the model that investigates Business Intelligence Systems by covering factors of system quality and information quality to attain success in Business Intelligence implementation and Corporate Value. The presented part of survey was implemented in Germany (2018) and scientific analyzes (PLS) covers empirically test of the critical value factors. Presentation summarizes the results of the authors' research on Business Intelligence System Quality and Information Quality and their use in context of Corporate?s strategy and Value.
M00|Customer-oriented reverse logistics and customer satisfaction on product returns|Most reverse logistics researches have not incorporated marketing concept or customer orientation into their frameworks. This study proposes that it is imperative to take customer point of view in reverse logistics process to improve customer satisfaction. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to conceptualize and operationalize customer- oriented reverse logistics. It also examines the relationship between the developed construct and its impact on customer satisfaction. In this regard, a literature review was carried out to identify customer- oriented reverse logistics. Based on customer orientation, service quality and service recovery literature, the new construct was developed. A pilot study was subsequently conducted using the questionnaire survey with managers and employees of a particular company in the mobile telecommunications industry and its customers who have experience in product returns. The findings showed that the dimensions of the proposed construct comprised tangibility, reliability, assurance, empathy, responsiveness, information availability and employee?s empowerment. Path analysis indicated that customer-oriented reverse logistics perceived by both employees and customers positively related to customer satisfaction of product returns service. The developed construct based upon cross disciplinary in marketing and logistics could facilitate future empirical studies in reverse logistics area. The proposed framework will also be useful for practitioners to implement their product returns strategies accordingly.
M00|Understanding Customer Relationship Management Process in the Nigerian Retail banking context|The basis for relationship marketing is to maximize benefit and long-term bonding between the firm and a customer. Based on these premises, scholars explore how relationship is implemented across business and national context. In one of such studies, Reinarzt and Kumar (2004) explore relationship management implementation based on the premises that relationship follows three stages: relationship initiation, relationship management, and termination. However, at every stage certain processes do occur. These processes that occur at every stage remain unexplored at country level. Countries possess heterogeneous social as well economic conditions that define business operation in a specific country. Thus this paper investigates relationship implementation in Nigeria based on two premises: 1) what are the factors that affect relationship initiation, management, and termination in Nigerian retail banking context? How external factors affect relationship effectiveness and performance? Based on 27 semi-structured interviews, this study therefore provides empirical investigation that addresses two main issues. One, the paper shows interpersonal relationship, a technique employed for both relationship initiation and management, remains one of the important factor even at retail banking context. Due to environmental challenge, the positive implication on technology deployment on relationship management in retail context of Nigerian banks is small, social connections have significant influence on retail banking relationship.
M00|Lean Practices in some Divisions of the Hungarian SME Sector|A strong economy does not exist without an internationally competitive SME sector. But the resources of the SME sector and its management skills are often also limited. By developing this skills, the limited resources available can be utilized more efficiently, so the competitiveness of the companies could be improved.The lean approach as an attitude, common sense, does not require excessive resources, so they can be useful in the SME sector.This study analyses, how deeply the lean thinking are present in some division of the Hungarian SME sector, and make some comparisons between the divisions. A structured questionnaire was used for data collection. SMEs? representatives, mostly CEOs and managers from some divisions of the Hungarian manufacturing industry participated in the survey.Out of the results it shows that the level of the lean usage is low among the Hungarian SMEs, so there are development reserves in the usage of lean practices. Strengthening thinking in processes beyond the factory, employee involvement and related leadership development can lead to efficiency gains, but it is important to note that without external experts a wider improvement is not expected. This requires a change of leadership, and state incentives are needed to accelerate thisThe background of the research method was created to fit the available literature so that to be able to be used in other countries. With that, the available information basis can be expanded with a regional dimension, in case further studies are made.
M00|Corporate Governance Score and Earnings Quality of Companies Listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand|The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between corporate governance score and earnings quality of companies listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand. This study used secondary data of companies in the Stock Exchange of Thailand in all industrial groups excluding companies in the market for alternative investment, business financial group, as well as the rehabilitation companies. The sample included companies with corporate governance score which corresponding to ?Excellent? and ?Very Good? recognition level in the year 2014 and 2015. The data was analyzed using regression analysis.In this study, the earnings quality is measured in terms of discretionary accruals and standard deviation of net income. The results suggested that corporate governance score was negatively related to discretionary accruals indicating positive relationship between corporate governance score and earnings quality. Corporate governance score was also found positively related to cash flows return to total assets. However, corporate governance score was not found to be significantly related to standard deviation of net income.The results of this study implied that corporate governance scores, based on the recognition level of the National Committee on Corporate Governance, are likely to represent earnings quality of listed companies in the Stock Exchange of Thailand in the context of discretionary accruals and cash flows return to total assets.
M00|Managing commitment in the personal care service industry: the special case of hairdressing services|Since its inception, the concept of customer commitment has been extensively researched, especially in the field of relationship marketing. It is therefore not surprising to find that the concept of commitment has been applied to various industries, both on an academic and practical level. However, the same cannot be said about the personal care service industry, which refers to industries that are characterised by high levels of customer interaction during the service delivery process. These industries include the hairdressing, legal services and medical services industries. This study focuses on the management of customer commitment from a personal care service perspective. The specific context of the study is the hairdressing industry. The study applies Meyer and Allen?s well-documented three-component model of commitment, and investigates the management of affective, calculative and normative commitment in the hairdressing industry. A quantitative approach was used to analyse the perceptions of 270 Generation Y respondents. Generation Y, also known as the millennials, refers to people who were born in the 1980s and 1990s. The data were analysed in SPSS version 25, and a regression analysis was used to assess the statistical significance of the hypothesised relationships. The results of the study indicate that satisfaction, social bonds, attractiveness of alternatives, relationship benefits and communication are significant antecedents of customer commitment in the hairdressing industry. The primary contribution of the study lies in the fact that it provides both theoretical insights and practical recommendations on how customer commitment in this relatively under-researched context should be managed.
M00|On the Quest for Value in the Public Sector Management and its Implications|This paper seeks to draw the attention to a peculiar, complex and interesting issue: the search for value in the public organizations? management. Thus, after a brief reference to the classical theme of creation and measurement of the general economic-financial value for (Business / Private) firms, it focuses on the more insidious and much less quantitative argument of the generation and management of Public value. Public value is the equivalent (though modified) of shareholder value (SHV) in public management with special features. A first model internationally diffused in public sector studies is representable by means of the Strategic Triangle; whose angles are: 1) Vision (value); 2) Legitimacy & support; 3) Operational capability of the public organization. A second model concerns more directly the first, highest, angle (that is now zoomed and founded upon resources and competencies): the value created for citizens through public services above all as mission. The building blocks and the outcomes & metrics developments are the elements that constitute a PSV (Public Service Value) scheme. A comparative analysis per stages is essential for our purpose: starting firstly from Public Administration (1: traditional model), secondly to New Public Management (2: NPM, denoting policies aimed to modernize and render more effective the public sector), we may arrive finally to the New Public Service stage (3: NPS, which is coherent with a networked public governance vision). Such an evolution implies a transition from a technical government to a wider and flexible governance philosophy in the ambit of a renewed value&performance-oriented public sector, which is willing to adopt qualitative principles and where individual employees are free and stimulated to pursue and propose new ideas about how to improve the working of the organization, in terms of efficiency or services. In sum, the quest for public value is the next and urgent challenge for public sector at its various levels: consequently, it will deserve more attention by both policy-makers (central and local public administrators) and researchers. For this purpose, it would be appropriate to come to a kind of public value scorecard aimed at the rational estimate of the expected, or realized, public value created time after time.At a more analytical-quantitative level, interesting would appear the inter-institutional search for a correlation between the public management value (ie, the value of public administrations) and the value of private institutions that ultimately benefit, with the individuals, from public goods and services.
M00|Le caratteristiche imprenditoriali delle farmacie di comunitÃ : unâ€™indagine esplorativa|In the last ten years, community pharmacies have undergone relevant normative interventions which have led from one side, to an increase in the number of competitors for dispensing activities, and from the other, to a pharmacistsâ€™ eventual role in the implementation of new care services. Faced with a transforming scenario, community pharmacists are expected to develop managerial and professional competences in order to respond to environmental challenges and safeguard both their profitability and their ability to fulfil the goals posed by the national health and pharmaceutical policies. The present study seeks to investigate to what extent community pharmacists perceive environmental turbulence and to what extent they believe to possesses entrepreneurial and managerial orientation, and self-efficacy, to build their pharmaciesâ€™ competitive advantage. A survey was prepared and a questionnaire have been sent to the pharmacists belonging to the provincial Association of Young Pharmacists of Agrigento, Italy. The results of the exploratory analysis are discussed along the paper in the light of the major changes community pharmacies are currently experiencing.

M00|The Poking Effect: Price Changes, Information, and Inertia in the Market for Mobile Subscriptions|We study consumer inertia in the mobile subscription market, focusing on the decision of whether to switch to a competing provider. To identify the extent of inertia, we exploit price changes faced by 270,000 consumers of a large telecom provider. We document that the propensity to switch provider after the price change increases among consumers whose costs decrease with the new prices. Furthermore, we find that the increase is largest right after consumers are informed of the upcoming change—during the two months prior to the tariff change—as opposed to when the price change is implemented. From these findings, we infer what we call a poking effect; the information of an upcoming price change causes consumers to engage in searches for alternative offers, leading to increased switching. We supplement the analysis with a survey and find indications that the poking effect is due to consumer inattention. To separate the effect on attention from the reaction to the actual price change, we estimate a model of consumer choice with limited attention. We find that when consumers are poked, it increases the share of consumers becoming attentive to competing offers. This leads many consumers to switch providers earlier than they would otherwise, explaining why they leave even though their terms with their current company improve.
M00|Factors Influencing E-district Adoption: An Empirical Assessment in Indian Context|The purpose of this confirmatory study is to explore the factors influencing the acceptance of e-district services by the citizens inAssam, a North-East state of India. Taking unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), technology acceptance model (TAM) and TAM 3 as the basis, a conceptual framework is developed. The study uses semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and a questionnaire based survey through 166 valid data points to validate the conceptual framework. Moreover, the internal consistency of the scale items is checked with Cronbach’s alpha coefficient while the convergent and discriminant validities are checked with multitrait-multimethod matrix. This study confirms the positive relationship of “Perceived Usefulness” and “Facilitating Conditions” with “Behavioral Intention (BI)” while the expected positive relationship of “Effort Expectancy” and “Social Influence” with “BI” are found to be insignificant. Also, the study cannot find a significant negative relationship between “ComputerAnxiety” and “BI.”

M00|The Values of Virtual Brand Community Engagement of Facebook Brand Page|Findings from both virtual brand community (VBC) behaviors provided a good reference, which informs a strategic direction to boost brand performance. The results examined different motives, which were likely to promote VBC participation, and were extended to the degree of VBC engagement. Both passive and active engagement results varied across community types, yet they both created significant brand loyalty and satisfaction providing theoretical and managerial implication into branding literature. The findings from this study offered interesting attention toward the two adopted online engagement behaviors. Passive participation is partially contributed to providing marketing managers a general overview about the nature of lurkers, while active participants have the potential power to convert passive members into the active ones.
M00|New Insights of Profile Oriented Marketing and Adaption Management for a Future-Oriented City Development|The world is changing fast, and cities are facing complex transitions in economic, social and environmental areas. Therefore, the design of city systems will play an essential role in shaping a sustainable, innovative and livable future. Adaptive urban profiling was recently presented as a useful tool for municipals to enhance sustainable city development. It builds upon profile oriented marketing while including elements of adaption management. Thus, city managers can increase their cities attractiveness by providing it with a clear profile that is recognized around the world on the one hand, while flexibly adapting to change if necessary. Only an integrated approach that puts people first can hope to succeed on a global scale. In this paper, an action-oriented model for strengthening and accelerating futureoriented city development is designed in the light of current and future challenges of urbanization. Already existing successful marketing, i.e. profile-oriented marketing, and management models, i.e. adaptive management are adapted from organizations and are sharpened and enriched in their application to cities. The focus lies on the usability of these marketing concepts to increase the sustainability and development quality of urban spaces within city structures. This work addresses city planners and public managers and shall help them prioritize and tackle next innovative and future steps to establish and foster a clearly structured future vision and profile to guarantee a high quality of living and sustainable urban development. A new dynamic profiling model, i.e. the adaptive urban profiling model, shall increase the visibility and uniqueness of competitive sustainable and future-oriented urban structures and provide solutions to optimize the urban living environment.
M00|Government Spending and Economic Growth in Ghana: Evidence from Granger Causality Analysis|In spite of the diverse major issues affecting the economy of Ghana over the years, the economy continues to experience a downward spiral in its economic growth. Taking into account three opining views regarding government spending and economic growth, this study sets to investigate the causal nexus fractious and economic growth in Ghana. We apply the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach to co-integration and the vector error correction model (VECM)-Granger causality test to evaluate both long- and short-run parameters including the direction of causation with data spanning from 1980 and 2015.The empirical results show evidence of co-integration for the existence of a long-run relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The Granger causality tests, in addition, indicated causal independence between government spending and economic growth within the time framework of the study in the economy of Ghana. Government spending has a cause effect on economic growth in Ghana. However, government spending channeled into a more fractious use with the building of resilience and infrastructural development that are self-liquidating if encouraged will enhance economic activities in the short run and also propel growth in the long run in the Ghana.
M00|Monotonic Correlation Diagnostics of share price volatility for Shariah-compliant Islamic Bank: A New Insight of Islamic Financial Engineering|The objective of this paper is to analyze the relationship between volatility rates and return rates for a share price of Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad (BIMB) from the year 2010 until 2016. The maximum volatility rate is 3.96 in July 2011, while the minimum volatility rate is 0.46 in April 2014. Next, the nonparametric analysis calculated the monotonic relationship between volatility rates and return rate for a share price of BIMB. From the analysis, the significant value is 0.000. Hence, the result rejects the null hypothesis for a Spearman correlation analysis. The numerical result shows there is a monotonic association between volatility rate and return rate for a share price of BIMB. The Spearman correlation coefficient, rs in this analysis is 0.403 indicated that there is a moderate positive correlation between volatility rate and return rate for BIMB share price.
M00|Hires and Separations in Equilibrium|Hiring occurs primarily to fill vacant slots that occur when workers separate. Equivalently, separation occurs to move workers to better alternatives. A model of efficient separations yields several specific predictions. Labor market churn is most likely when mean wages are low and the variance in wages is high. Additionally, over the business cycle, churn decreases during recessions, with hires falling at the beginning of recessions and separations declining later to match hiring. Furthermore, the young disproportionately bear the brunt of employment declines. More generally, hires and separations are positively correlated over time as well as across industry and firm. These predictions are borne out in the LEHD microdata at the economy and firm level.
M00|Indicators on global value chains: A guide for empirical work|Traditionally, the main source of data used to measure countries’ participation in international production networks or global value chains (GVCs) has been conventional international trade statistics. However, international fragmentation of production has weakened the analytic interpretability of these data as intermediate goods but also services cross borders many times on the way to their final destination. This is often referred to as the double (or multiple)-counting problem of international trade Statistics. This, in turn, has led to the development of a new branch of trade statistics, referred to as Trade in Value-Added (TiVA) providing new insights on GVCs, and corresponding databases, notably the OECD-WTO TiVA database, which provide a measure of international interdependencies through the construction of global input-output tables that show how producers in one country provide goods and/or services to producers and consumers in others. But with the field still relatively new, many users are struggling to fully understand how these new indicators should be used and indeed how they have been constructed. This document is designed to address those difficulties, providing, where appropriate guidance on “dos” and “don’ts”. It also reviews many other typical GVC indicators derived outside of input-output frameworks; recognising that gross measures of trade, and indicators derived from them, remain important and relevant for policy making.
M00|Effectiveness and Challenges of Recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) in the Indian Hotel Sector|The present study tries of evaluate the effectiveness and challenges faced by adopting RPO practice in the India Hotel sector. The research objectives are driven from the purpose of the research which deals with distinct issues related to RPO and various perspectives of utilizing RPO. These objectives guided in identifying factors influencing the rationale for outsourcing the recruitment processes. The need for RPO has gained significance with the impact of organizational structure, stringent project deadlines, insufficient time for internal HR department for recruiting personnel, inefficiencies in integrating all stages of recruitment and expansion of geographies. The study is developed on building a theoretical framework which is prepared through analysing previous literature about outsourcing, and their utilization and efficiency in organizations. Mixed method approach has been followed to analyse with better validity and exploration of the context related to the effectiveness of RPO in the Indian hotel sector. The key findings indicated that the culture was positive influence on the usage of RPO in the organizations, in terms of adopting RPO during expansion of geographies and globalization. Also, the organizational structure was the major challenge in adopting these practices along with monitoring the outsourcing activities, lack of communication and inefficient HR practices.

The regression analysis and correlation shows only one factor is significant to ROA which is liquidity.
M00|Activity Based Costing (ABC) as a tool for Lean Transformation: The Case of the Greek Power Public Corporation (PPC)|This research highlights the malfunctions and the inaccurate information of the conventional cost methods that are used nowadays in most Greek public companies. It poses as a research topic the resolution of the above mentioned problem with the development of a reliable and accurately informative cost system based on the ABC method, which will offer support to those companies concerning the amelioration of their total performance and function. This paper also shows the ability of the ABC costing method as a tool which contributes to the transition from a traditional public corporation to a lean corporation after the fulfillment of three fundamental points. First prevents distortions of the cost of activities of a company with the provision of exact measure of the cost of those activities then defines the non value added activities so it limits the wastefulness in a corporation and final introduces the mentality of lean thinking to the employees of the corporation, since each employee knows the flow of the action he performs, its cost and value. This paper includes a contrast on a theoretical basis of the traditional cost systems and the ABC method, presents an application of ABC and a case study of applying ABC to a Greek Public Company investigating its use as a lean tool that helps the saving of resources and the transition to a lean production model.
M00|Organisational structure in the progress of integration|The iron and steel industry, like the entire economy, was undergoing transformation processes in the 1990s. An inspiration for these changes was signing by Poland of the Association Agreement with the European Union in December 1991. This document sets directions for functioning of the ironworks in Poland. It resulted in the development of the ironworks restructuring processes in the years 1992, 1998, 2001–2003, aimed at the improvement of their economic efficiency. It meant seeking economic efficiency of metallurgical enterprises, also known as fundamental changes in their organisational structures. A number of literature sources, both Polish and English recognise the issue of reforms by means of restructuring employment, finances, and resources. In the 1990s and in the first decade of the 21st century, the influence of the organisational structure on the efficiency of iron and steelworks was studied more and more frequently. Their theoretical justification is found in, i.a. the works of M. Weber, H. Fayol, Zb. Zakrzewski, A. Krupski, A. Stabryła, A. Nalepka, A. Kozina and others. Scientific suggestions in publications have given rise to the discourse that organisational structures should be dealt within a social and technical aspects, as processes, sets, and events. They are one of the most important tools for the management, a factor binding the enterprise with the environment.
M00|Industry Transition - Challenges for Value Capture|The transition period in the industry life cycle induces a profound reconfiguration in the competitive landscape. A shift from an early, fluid state to a mature stage generates both strategic threats and opportunities for capturing value by incumbents as well as new entrants. Thus the challenge is to identify early harbingers of that transition in order to formulate an appropriate strategic response allowing for protecting and strengthening captured value streams. Existing gaps regarding causal explanations of industry transformation and the processual nature of value appropriation ignited the discussion presented in the article. The aim of this study is to enhance the understanding of the dynamics of the value capture process by examining the features of industry transition. A thorough review of the theoretical and empirical studies on the subject matter enabled formulation of propositions that refer to the problem of identification of transition signals and relate the competitive dynamics of the transition period with the value capture practices.
M00|Effect of Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) on the performance of Small business in Karachi|This paper examines the impact of employee stock ownership plans on the overall performance of the organizations. From the five decades literature, the conceptual underpinning formed includes variables of interest namely; employees' motivation, job commitment, employees' turnover, and productivity/profitability of the firms. The paper follows positivist philosophy with deductive approach to gain numerical significance. Total 280 respondents targeted using combination of probability (random) sampling and non-probability (convenience and snowball) sampling techniques. The statistical tests, which are used to test the hypotheses, are regression and correlation. Results showed that they exists statistically significant correlation between ESOPs and overall performance of the organization. Interestingly, the nature of relationship is positive but the strength is moderate to weaker. Employees' turnover has moderate positive significant correlation (r=. 541, p
M00|Changing Views on Organizational Control in the Countries of the Eastern Bloc|Control is the terminal sequential function of management and its importance has risen during the last economic crisis. In the Eastern approach of organizational control, a manager can be either the subject of control, when he oversees an object or the object of control, when another subject oversees him. The subject and object do not need to be necessary from the same system, which means that this is a case of external control. There are several differences between the Eastern and Western approach to control. These differences are conditioned more by political development (the Communist regime) than the geographic location, when China has a similar theoretical base and Japan or India not at all. Aim of this paper is to examine the changing views of managers on being controlled by another subject, as the number of executives who did not experienced the era of communism is increasing.
M00|Managing Change and Strategic Thinking: Evidences from Hospitality and Tourism Sector of the UK|This qualitative paper examines the strategic thinking and managing change in complex business environment in the hospitality and tourism sector of the UK through the cases of Hilton London Canary Wharf and Hilton London Tower Bridge. For the purpose of analysis, researchers explored the research phenomenon under different models including TALC model and IBTEE Model. Using convenience sampling, researchers interviewed face-to-face 12 Line Managers and 30 employees through open-ended semi-structured interview questions regarding change management process and obstacles interlinked with it. Findings revealed that although Hilton hotels have adapted changes to some extent but there is still more room for further improvement. The management of the selected hotels highly relies on the training purpose for the effective change adaption whereas coaching and research is lagging behind. The biggest constraint during effective change adaption is the diverse background of the workforce as most are from the multicultural backgrounds. Moreover, the communication, ritual, and cultural barriers are causing issues in the change process. Lastly, the recommendations are given for consolidating effective change management at workplace.

M00|Integrated vs. add-on: A multidimensional conceptualisation of technology obsolescence|In the past two decades, technology obsolescence has become an increasingly common feature of the global economy, often precipitated by new technological breakthroughs and innovations. Although a number of companies persist with obsolete technologies until disaster strikes, our understanding of the dynamics of technology obsolescence and why some firms persist with obsolete technologies remains largely underexplored. This conceptual paper seeks to fills these gaps in our understanding by developing a four-domain framework to explicate the dynamics of technologies’ obsolescence, which takes into account the components in determining different types of obsolescence. The framework articulates two types of life-cycle match and two types of life-cycle mismatch. The article also contributes to the literature by delineating an integrated framework of firm-specific and market-based factors which account for some firms’ persistence with obsolete technologies. Amassing and utilising the latest information to update their technologies can help firms enhance their competitiveness. The wider implications of the analysis for public policy and directions for future research are examined.
M00|The Impact of Working Capital Management on Corporate Performance: Evidence from Listed Non-Financial Firms in Ghana|Working Capital Management (WCM) plays a significant role in the successful operation of businesses due to its significant effect on corporate profitability and liquidity. This study empirically examines the impact of working capital management on the performance of non-financial firms in Ghana. Using secondary data of five listed non-financial firms for the period 2010-2015, the Random effect model was employed to establish the relationship that exists between the various components of working capital management and firm performance and whether these WCM components impact significantly on firm performance. The results show that average payment period and current ratio have a positive relationship with firm performance. Average collection period, inventory turnover, cash conversion cycle, and firm size on the other hand have a negative relationship with firm performance. However, only average collection period, average payment period, cash conversion cycle, and current ratio are found to have a significant impact on firm performance. The study recommends that managers of non-financial firms in Ghana should formulate sound working capital management policies that will enable firms to deal with liquidity challenges and enhance their performance.
M00|Economic Evaluation of Maintenance Strategies for Offshore Wind Turbines Based on Condition Monitoring Systems|An offshore wind farm’s cost of energy is, to a large extent, driven by operation and maintenance costs. Through the optimization of the maintenance strategies for offshore wind farms, the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) will be further reduced, which will ceteris paribus lead to a higher competitiveness of offshore wind farms with other energy sources. This study pro-poses an event-based simulation of an offshore wind farm comprising 400 MW. The aim of the model is to minimize the total cost, and thus to maximize the revenues from the wind farm. Therefore, corrective, condition-based, and scheduled maintenance strategies are compared, and constraints, such as weather conditions and service team shifts, are taken into consideration. When hourly electricity spot prices are applied instead of feed-in tariffs, results show that weekly scheduled maintenance on a Saturday dayshift (starting at 8 am) is the most cost-efficient scenario. Condition monitoring systems have been found to be advantageous and are set as a standard application regarding the turbines. The impact of scheduled maintenance fre-quency, the distance between the offshore site and the coast, the interest rate, and altering reli-ability data are further analyzed.
M00|Political Marketing: Role Of Socialization Process In The Evelopment Of Voting Intentions|In political realm, the political-specific brand equity is gaining growing attention. This effort is to develop a political-specific measurement model to get insight regarding the voter?s behavior, voter choices, voting intentions and to generate more valid and reliable results. The literature from the relevant domains including Marketing, Politics, and Behavioral sciences has been reviewed to develop a good understanding and insight into relevant published material and the trends that have emerged there from to review the types of measures. Based on the reviewed measures and their literally proven chronological cause-effect relationships, a conceptual model of voter based brand equity has been proposed. Following questions are hypothesized: (1) what is the contribution of political socialization process in the development of social identity and emotional response? (2) Do the social identity and emotional response positively influence the party trust and party commitment? (3) Do the party trust and party commitment positively influence the voting intentions of the voters? (4) Does the party loyalty have moderating role among the structural relationships of the model constructs? The results indicate that to improve the voting intentions political parties have to engage themselves in the political socialization process.

In addition, proper governance of the region, its effective positioning or re-positioning, creates new conditions for its investment attractiveness and long-term development.
M00|Vision: A Missing Key Dimension in the 5V Big Data Framework|If Big Data is to deliver on its big promises, a well-articulated vision must be developed in a collaborative way and effectively communicated to all key stakeholders. Without a guiding technology vision, the promise and benefits of Big Data will become elusive and lost to many organizations. The literature on Big Data frequently refers to the 5Vs of Big Data (Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity and Value). Based on a strategic framework, this paper adds another dimension to this important and widely used framework, namely Vision, and elaborates on the critical role of vision and its relationship and impact on the remaining Vs. Research shows that vision has a positive impact on organizational performance. Organizations that link vision with strategic information systems, such as Big Data applications, ga5in a sustainable competitive advantage in the marketplace. The importance of carefully defining, establishing and communicating the vision of Big Data to the entire organization and to key stakeholders in order to leverage Big Data for growth, profits, and sustainable competitive advantage is discussed.
M00|Effect of Economic Factors on Tax Compliance in Kenya: A Survey of Limited Liability Companies within Eldoret Municipality|The problem of tax compliance is as old as taxes themselves. Characterizing and explaining the observed patterns of tax noncompliance and ultimately finding ways to reduce it are of obvious importance to nations around the world. As a public finance topic, tax compliance spans the notions of equity, efficiency and incidence. Low tax compliance is one of the internal factors affecting the ability of the Kenyan government to raise direct tax revenues and thus meet its recurrent and development expenditure. Therefore, this study assessed the economic factors affecting tax compliance among various limited liability companies within the municipality of Eldoret. The general objective of the study was to assess the economic factors affecting tax compliance among various limited Liability Companies within Eldoret Municipality. The study specifically sought to determine the effect of tax rates, tax audits, and level of actual income, fines and penalties on tax compliance. The study adopted survey design. Stratified random sampling was used to select a sample of 320 companies drawn from the target population of 1,470 limited companies. Data was collected using structured questionnaire, coded, keyed and analyzed quantitatively using both descriptive and inferential statistics. The study findings showed that tax audits had the highest positive effect on level of tax compliance followed by tax rate, fines and penalties. Tax incentives and level of actual income had the least positive effect on tax compliance .Based on these findings, the study concludes that reducing tax rate, ensuring Kenya Revenue Authority tax auditors to educate taxpayers; enforcing fines and penalties, provision of tax incentives and considering the level of actual income of the taxpayers will improve tax compliance. The study recommends that Kenya Revenue Authority management can improve the level of tax compliance by ensuring favorable and fair tax rates. Tax audits findings should be made available to the taxpayers, while fines and penalties need to be enforced effectively. The authority should also improve tax incentives and consider level of income of the taxpayers in its policy formulation. All these can be achieved through an elaborate taxpayer’s education.
M00|Comparison of leadership style of male and female managers in Kuwait: An empirical investigation|Several studies have investigated differences in leadership styles between male and female leaders. This paper analyzes weather Kuwaiti male and female leaders differ in their leadership behavior. Explorative approach is applied for this research study. This study is based on a small sample in Kuwait and based on a self-rating of managers in Kuwait. In our study, we used similar approach as Eagly and Johannesen-Schmidt (2001) – rating was done through subordinates, peers and superiors – this would help to have more in-depth analyses. The quantitative analysis involves 62 leaders (38 male, 24 female) from different industries in private and governmental sector in Kuwait. Results indicated no major differences in leadership behavior by gender in Kuwait, which is similar to outcome of some studies conducted in western countries. It should be highlighted that the percentage of male and female respondents varied between different organizations. Future research should emphasis on equal sampling. It would be also interesting to analyze the difference in male or female dominated industries. This study offers knowledge for developing leadership skills in Kuwait. Very few studies have concentrated on difference in leadership styles outside Europe and North America, this study provides a new perspective in a different cultural context.
M00|Impact of a Fashion fTRACE App on the Perception of Sustainability|The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the consumers’ perception of sustainability and the application of a QR-code in stores with the focus on the information searching behavior regarding sustainable aspects. An online questionnaire was conducted with fashion students at Reutlingen University: in total, 65 students participated in the survey. Paired samples t-test and other statistical analyses were applied to test research questions. Apart from this, the research paper is based on a literature review. Furthermore, the decision was taken to use a projective method in the form of a dummy fashion fTRACE website. Key findings of the survey are that participants give sustainable aspects a higher importance with a QR-code than without one. Participants who prefer a product with detailed information experience a “positive shopping feeling” when provided with transparency via a QR-code. “Origin”, “production” and “quality” were rated of higher importance by those participants. These findings suggest that, transparency provided through the application of a QR-Code in stores influences the consumers’ perception of sustainability. Due to the small sample size of participants (65) in the study, findings of this research not generalizable to a larger population. This paper focused on the consumers’ information searching behavior regarding sustainable aspects, limiting its findings to impacts on perception of sustainability. Further research is therefore recommended.

The objective of this study is to understand the relevance of cultural intelligence and communication effectiveness for leadership preparedness in a multicultural environment. The present century is seeing accelerated transformation of businesses into truly global entities. As organizations operate in a boundary-less world, multicultural teams are the order of the day. Business leaders, who are able to understand, accept, and effectively respond to cultural differences are therefore in great demand.
M00|HRM in Relation To Employee Motivation and Job Performance in the Hospitality Industry|The hospitality industry refers to organisations that provide accommodation and food services for people when they travel. The hospitality industry is also known as a people business. The hotels and catering organisations underperform, still deliver inadequate services, and provide limited facilities compared to similar businesses in the same region. This can have a negative impact on the tourism industry in Laos. HRM potentially contributes to employee work performance in the organisation. The performance of employees in hotel organisations can be judged or measured by their attentiveness, their friendliness, their appearances, their attitudes, and the way they carry out and perform their assigned tasks. Most of the respondents feel that their organisations create the conditions whereby they are motivated to work harder. The hotel industry recognises the importance of training in relation to their work performed. The main factor that brings about high level of job satisfaction and motivation is salary.

M00|Using Commercial Marketing Techniques to Introduce New Contraceptive Products in Zambia and Malawi|In early 2014, the EECO project began planning for pilot introduction of the SILCS Diaphragm, Amphora Lubricating Gel and Womanâ€™s Condom in Malawi and Zambia. The project is designed to support the introduction of five new woman-initiated contraceptive methods aiming to increase overall use of modern contraceptive methods by introducing new methods and expanding method choice. There some clear lessons learned that will form part of the systematic planning when other EECO products are introduced: advocacy work to gain the support of key media; cultural leaders are necessary to counter prevailing cultural norms, which discourage the use of lubrication during sex; and different approach in promotion considering negative cultural norms towards the use of lubrication.
M00|Eating as Doing or Doing the Right Thing? The Influence of Locomotion and Assessment on Food Consumption Quantity|As overweight is becoming a serious worldwide health issue, a great amount of commercial books, programs and blogs are offering help in establishing healthy eating patterns. A factor that has commonly been blamed for overweight is the growth of portion sizes. This phenomenon of supersizing portions has created a distortion of portion sizes throughout the food industry and has been suggested to lead to overeating. The present study investigates the influence of locomotion and assessment orientations on food consumption quantities in conditions of distorted portion sizes. A survey was conducted in which participants (N = 75) watched a short movie whilst being presented with a distorted food portion. The results of this study show that when controlling for an individualâ€™s level of hunger and movie engagement, locomotion decreases food consumption quantities. To conclude, it is suggested that when food portions are distorted locomotion assists in limiting an individualâ€™s food intake.

M00|Psychological Empowerment and Employee Behaviors: Employee Engagement As Mediator and Leader-Member Exchange as Moderator|The objective of this study is to determine the association between psychological empowerment and two behavioral outcomes of employee (i.e. organizational citizenship behavior and knowledge sharing behavior) by examining the mediating role of employee engagement and the moderating role of leader-member exchange. A survey was completed by employees working in different corporations and jobs. The data were collected by self- administered questionnaire and analyzed by using correlation and regression analysis. Results indicate that psychological empowerment positively influences organizational citizenship behavior and knowledge sharing behavior. In addition, employee engagement partially mediates the relationship between psychological empowerment and organizational citizenship behavior and fully mediates between psychological empowerment and knowledge sharing behavior. Psychological empowerment has a positive significant relationship with the employee engagement whereas leader-member exchange does not moderate the relationship between psychological empowerment and employee engagement. The implications of these findings are discussed.
M00|The Impact of Entrepreneurial Alertness on Entrepreneurial Intentions|The emergence of opportunity is based on the intentions which are the result of peopleâ€™s belief and the way of thinking. Entrepreneurial alertness is considered vital for identifying the opportunity which can have an impact on mindset for exploiting the opportunities. The objective of this study was to analyze the connection between opportunity identification and intentions formation through entrepreneurial alertness based on the theory of planned behavior.

The results of this study revealed that entrepreneurial alertness has positive and significant effect on attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and entrepreneurial intentions. The findings of this study contributed to the theory of planned behavior by taking entrepreneurial alertness as a predictor of entrepreneurial intentions. The findings also have implication for increasing the supply of entrepreneurial capital into the society.
M00|Change Implementation and Competative Positioning|Implementing complex organizational changes involve collective action by many people, each of whom contributes something. Implementation of change may face a big problem if the required environment, technique, and technologies are lacking. Descriptive survey research design was adopted. The population of this study comprised 43,820 management employees of the telecommunication industry (NCC 2012). Based on proportional stratified sampling technique, the survey sample size calculator software was used to select 2312 employees. A six-point likert scale type questionnaire used to collect data was validated by experts and a 0.81 Cronbach alpha coefficient confirmed its reliability. Of the 2312 questionnaire copies administered, 1435 were returned duly filled out. Change implementation had a significant relationship with competitive positioning (R2=0.251, p-value=0.0000
M00|Convergence between Marketing Approaches and the Aims of the Public Administrations: Towards an Optimization of the Citizen Relationship Management (CiRM) in Morocco|Traditionally, there is a tendency to think that administration and marketing are two antagonistic notions. Marketing is the science of designing the supply of a product according to the analysis of consumer expectations and taking into account the capacities of the organization as well as all the constraints of the socio-demographic, competitive environment, legal, cultural in which it evolves. For Butler and Collins (1994) marketing has shifted from transactional marketing, rather product-oriented to relational marketing, more client-oriented, which corresponds more to the expectations of public administrations regarding their relations with the citizen, especially the user. But in Morocco, there is a marketing myopia in the public sector. Indeed, this industry often complains about the lack of citizens' interest in their services and products. These citizens become more demanding and must be satisfied. This article thus has a twofold objective: first, to show wherein the marketing myopia in Moroccan Public Administrations lies, in order to define the heart of their business, and second, to propose a marketing mix for these administrations to optimize their Citizen Relationship Management (CiRM) and see how e-administration responds to a marketing approach.
M00|International brand strategy: Case analysis according to the Moroccan Market|Consumers today are not looking for a simple consumption, but they are looking for sense. The brand strategy is situated at a higher level of closeness to the consumer. Indeed, the brand acts as a communication interface between the company and the market. The present article will discuss the topic of a brand as a principal communication interface between the company and the consumer. First, we will analyze the brand position in the marketing mix approach through a comparative study of strong international brands strategies that have retained their positions despite different trends and generations. The result shows that the coherence between the corporate, product and brand strategy leads to build strong international brands.
M00|Socio-economic Disparity problems and Convergence Policy in the EU States|The purpose of this paper is to investigate socio-economic development condition and convergence evaluation in the EU-28 states in the context of the EU policy goals. The arm of this research is to estimate socioeconomic disparities and convergence problems in the European states by applying real valuations of well-being situations and economic development challenges in the EU member states. The research methodology is based on the European Commission legitimate documents application and socio-economic strategies, on the convergence theory and convergence scenario calculations and the socioeconomic forecasts analysis in the EU states. This research presents information about different socioeconomic indicators, indexes, and scheme of information`s flows for convergence level estimation. This study contains objectives and general outlines of period 2014-2020 in the framework of Europe as a whole, as well its impact on the EU member states economies and living conditions. Changes in the main socioeconomic concepts impact on EU convergence policy and rapidity of convergence depends on the initial discrepancy of the development level in the EU states. The efficiency of European convergence policy can also be improved by significant economic growth and by a clever choice of the country-specific social activities. This research investigates above information for social situations estimations in EU states as well as GDP growth, unemployment, population's income level and different welfare indicators. The main results reflect the overall economic situation valuation in the EU countries and present European convergence policy's impact on social development in the European states. The conclusions contain socio-economic situations appreciation in the context of European strategy goals and social inequality problems clarification in the EU states.
M00|Virtual Community Engagement on Facebook Brand Page|The behavior of consumers in virtual community varies according to the types of the community they feel belonged to. The study may not only be conducted to understand what drives consumers to participate in the virtual brand community but may also seek to understand how members could get themselves with the community. The finding indicates that hedonic benefit is the strongest stimulus, which links to higher engagement. Though economic motive and product learning are not found to have a significant effect on sharing and commenting behavior; they are considered inherent. From theoretical contribution, the papers also provide strategic marketing directions to promote virtual community engagement.

The review also finds that decision makers could enhance their decision-making performance and prevent potential decision failures by means of adapting certain coping strategies.
M00|The Impact of Management Control on Sustainability Reports|Nowadays sustainable development is no longer seen only as a way to reduce costs or increase efficiency, but also as a tool for competitiveness and development through product placement, services related to the preferences of the entityâ€™s stakeholders. Sustainability reports are designed to justify and present public policy actions of each entity. The holistic approach to the structure and content of sustainability reports lead us to notice their various features. Examining the content of sustainability reports of various national and international entities was based on the theory of corporate governance, agency theory and the theory of positive stakeholders. In order to ensure a full study we have examined various international bodies and position with respect to sustainable development.

M00|The State of Supply Chain Management Practices within SMEs in Ghana: A Case Study of Selected Agrochemical Companies in Kumasi|The study seeks to find out the state of supply chain management within SME’s in Ghana by investigating the extent of Supply Chain Management (SCM) practices, its benefits and challenges using some selected agrochemical companies in the Kumasi Metropolis. The study was a descriptive study. Primary data was obtained from the selected respondents using postal questionnaires. Convenience sampling technique was employed to obtain information from both the management staff and the consumers (farmers). Two hundred and fifty (250) questionnaires were distributed to the respondents. However, a total number of 200 could be retrieved for discussion and analysis. The obtained data was then analysed by the usage of descriptive method which employed tools like charts and tables. The study revealed that foreign and domestic suppliers, distributors and consumers together with Agrochemical Companies forms the supply chain; and an indication of weak supply chain management practices within the supply chain of Agrochemical companies. The study however was limited by difficulty in obtaining data and respondents’ unwillingness to give information can affect reliability of the study. However, all academicians and practitioners who are active in SCM will find value in this research
M00|Leadership Style and Organization Performance|Organizations face many challenges, but one of the greatest ones is ensuring the wellbeing of its employees. Understanding association between job satisfaction, employee organizational commitment, organizational culture, and leadership is important because it assists in creating an efficient and motivated workforce and allows for an organization to achieve overall goals & objectives (Amburgey, 2005). Effective Leadership, employee job satisfaction, and organizational commitment are the three important facets for organizational success. The effective leader provides guidance to employees, gives them direction towards the achievement of desired goals, as a result employee with high job satisfaction exert more effort in the completion of work [or achieving success and thus are more committed towards organization (Voong, Lo, Ngui, & Ayob, 2010). Many aspects of leadership style and organizational commitment have been studied in the paper

M00|Relationship of financial stability and risk with market structure and competition: evidence from Indian banking sector|Academic debate over the ‘competition-fragility view’ and ‘competition-stability view’, in context of the risk shift and franchise value paradigms has lead to study the concept and relationship of competition and riskiness of banks in detail. In this respect, Martinez-Miera Repullo 2010 (MMR model) has even propagated the existence of a non-linear relationship between stability and competition. We test these hypotheses on a sample of Indian banks using measures for stability and riskiness of banks. The paper investigates the impact of bank competition and impact of bank concentration on stability, as well as on the riskiness of their loan portfolios .We find evidence for the presence of non-linear relationship between stability index and competition. It may be pointed out that in case of Indian banks, both concentration and competition work simultaneously to support the competition-fragility view. Both increased concentration and decreased competition may lead to greater riskiness with greater instability. The study suggests that it is important to understand the tradeoff between competition and concentration, and their impact on riskiness of loan portfolios and stability of banks for formulating steps to foster competition within the industry.
M00|A Model of Business Innovation in the Context of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises in Davao Del Sur|This study determined the factors that affect business innovation of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Davao del Sur. Data were gathered from owners and proprietors of 88 microenterprises, 61 small enterprises and 52 medium enterprises registered and are operational within the municipalities and component city of the Province of Davao del Sur. Results revealed that the respective mean scores of the management factors have the interpretations: articulation of vision, mission and goals was found to be good, organizational structure was found to be good, while human resource management was found to be very good. In addition, the mean scores for marketing mix have the following interpretations: Product was found to be very good, while price, place and promotion were found to be good. MSMEs were found to be financially-capable. More so, politico-legal, economic, socio-cultural and technological factors were found to be influential in the activities and decision-making of the owners and proprietors. They also posed high regard in adopting business innovation. Stepwise regression analysis was used to derive a model for business innovation of micro, small and medium enterprises in Davao del Sur. The final model revealed that a combination of organizational structure, human resource management, politico-legal forces and socio-cultural forces significantly determine the business innovation of micro, small and medium enterprises, holding other variables constant.
M00|Effect of Power Supply on the performance of Small and Medium Size Enterprises: A comparative analysis between SMEs in Tema and the Northern part of Ghana|Electricity provision in Ghana has been marred by low generation, poor supply and frequent power outages. The situation compel firms to adopt strategies to cope with this poor public supply of power for their business. To this end, this study analysed the effect of power supply on the performance of SMEs: a comparative analysis between two regions in Ghana where Small and Medium firms are located. The study uses the current World Bank 2013 Enterprise Survey on Ghana which consist of 710 firms. The study employs both chi-square and t-test to do pattern analysis. In addition, ordinary regression analysis (OLS) was employed to regress firm performance variable on electricity supply variable and other covariates. The results show that, the presence of power outages, thus, the number of times power outages experienced and hours of power outages negatively affected firms performance (profitability). In addition, it was further realized that power outages (power interruptions) severely affects SMEs located in the Northern part of Ghana than SMEs located elsewhere. The study therefore recommends that government should implement policies and programs such as power mix approach and renewable energy and bring in private sector participation to install competition and efficiency. This is in the interest to mitigate the unreliable electricity supply. Also, SMEs should consider alternative sources of power such as solar power, inverter, biogas, generators, which would help curb the cost power outage brings to their production and to boost output.
M00|Impact of health and recreation on work-life balance: A case study of expatriates|Factors influencing work-life balance are evolving at a very fast pace, thus creating a fecund ground for innovative work-life balance tools and techniques. The increasing significance of expatriates in the global workforce necessitates a targeted set of work-life balance initiatives to help expatriate workers contribute more effectively in the competitive work environment. Health and recreation are the two important life spheres which play a very important role in success or failure of an expatriate assignment. While work-life balance researches are being conducted globally in plenty, yet research on expatriate adjustment and expatriate work-life balance is still in its nascent stage especially in an expatriate dominated work environment in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. This research paper investigates the health and recreation spheres of expatriate academicians working in private higher education institutes in Bahrain, Oman and the UAE. The research paper illustrates and evaluates the health and recreation spheres in relation to the demographic factors of the respondents and suggests ways to improve work-life balance of expatriate employees.
M00|Technological innovations in museums as a source of competitive advantage|In an economic environment characterised by permanent and rapid technological evolution, successful organisations are the ones that are able to adapt their processes and activities to change. This article starts from the assumption that museums can use various modern technologies in order to raise their market competitiveness. Technological innovation allows museums to become more attractive and fulfil their functions better while also using their resources more efficiently. The first part of this paper presents a series of technological innovations specific to museums and the way in which these innovations can lead to an increased museum performance. The study case in the second part of the paper presents the results of an analysis of the technologies used by the museums in Baia Mare in comparison with other Romanian museums. The improvement solutions proposed based on this analysis can prove useful not just for the museums studied, but also for other museums in similar situations. Another, indirect, purpose of this research is to help raise the tourist attractiveness of Baia Mare by bettering the competitiveness of its museums.
M00|Folosirea inovaţiilor tehnologice pentru creşterea accesibilității şi atractivităţii patrimoniului muzeal|Technological development and changes in consumer desires and preferences are external factors uncontrollable by a museum but which have a great influence on its public success. Depending on the attitude and measures taken by a museum, these factors may represent an opportunity or, conversely, a threat, and finally they can become either a strength or a weakness of the museum. Based on these considerations, the purpose of this article is to highlight some practical ways in which museums can use technological innovation in order to gain a competitive advantage. In the first part, the paper presents a series of modern technologies applied in museums that allow them to become more attractive and to better fulfill their functions of storage, conservation, research, and exploitation of the heritage. The second part presents a study conducted at County Museum of Art «Baia Mare Artistic Centre» regarding the measures taken for heritage digitization and, starting from this, for increasing the public access to the museum’s collections.

M00|Planned Obsolescence and Product-Service Systems: Linking Two Contradictory Business Models|Planned obsolescence and product-service systems are two business models which have evolved as popular strategies for technology oriented companies. Interestingly they appear to be contradictory. While planned obsolescence refers to the policy of planning or designing a product with a limited life span, product-service systems are integrated combinations of products and services, designed to jointly meet and fulfill specific customer needs. We present examples that illustrate both approaches and reveal and discuss interdependencies and linkages between the two business models. Based on additional illustrative cases, we discuss possible combinations of both approaches and develop a conceptual framework for evaluating the applicability of hybrid combinations of planned obsolescence and product-service systems with respect to different industries and corporate resources and competencies. Although there is no connection at first sight, our conceptual framework suggests that planned obsolescence and product-service systems are not mutually exclusive, but rather describe two ends of a business model or strategy continuum. Moreover, our framework provides some straightforward managerial implications and paves the way for further research.
M00|Reflective professional development|The exorbitant growth of internet and social media has not only contributed to an immense expansion of virtual markets but also to the growth of availability of different knowledge resources for the users (Rice- Lively/ Racine, 2002). From the beginning of mankind until the initiation of the Web 2.0 specialized knowledge was restricted to an inner circle of privileged individuals. Accordingly, growth of knowledge was limited. Today though, knowledge has become an infinite resource available in abundance to virtually anybody disposing of an internet connection (Gruber, 2007). Information pools, as a result, are growing exponentially. The challenge of raising the treasure of knowledge has shifted from getting access to information to selecting adequate, topical and relevant information (Webber, 2000). According to multichannel communication output, relevant input given by adequate insights becomes more necessary.
M00|Entstehung und Entwicklung der Vertriebsformen im Lebensmitteleinzelhandel Erster Teil einer Tetralogie|In the first part of this tetralogy the topic is the general illustration of the German retail food industry. The following part shows how discount­ sales have been able to continuously establish themselves since the early 50s. First, this market configuration only established itself in Germany, while in other European countries the traditional supermarket was the norm. Almost without any sales dips, discount sales increased year-over-year and attained a preliminary peak market share of approx. 45%. The reasons for this development can be found in German buyer behavior, namely that the typical German character is very rational and is fundamentally characterized by the optimization of all parameters. For this reason, the extreme creative urge i.e. willingness to work hard and the desire for the appearance of prosperity and proof of prosperity was presumably borne out of scarcity during and after WWII. Cost-effectivefood shopping focused on decent food quality created leeway to satisfy additional needs such as e.g. owning one's own home, vacation etc. This might have been another reason for the enormous economic growth during this period. Of course, an additional essential aspect wasthequalified store brand policy.
M00|Aktueller Stand der Vertriebsformen im Lebensmittel- Einzelhandel Zweiter Teil einer Tetralogie|"The food market distribution in Germany is relatively set. While in the supermarket sector with EDEKA, REWE, Kaufland and METRO there are practically only four nationwide chains, there are five chains remaining in the discount sector, namely ALDI, LIDL, Netto (EDEKA), Penny (REWE) and NORMA. However, the four ""major"" chains together won a market shareinexcess of 80%. The discount retail sector was able to establish itself as such a stable market, because of its targeted store brand policies and as such was able to offer products at a much lower price at comparable quality. In addition, the discount sector was well versed in making a good name for itself by offering sale products, specifically in the non-food sector. Furthermore, the highest guiding maxim was ""targeted restraint"" i.e. to consequently cut costs and not the issue of providing the consumer with additional services. To implement this very straight forward strategy successfully, great value was placed on well trained personnel with the strict willingness to implement and maintain theset procedures withexactitude."
M00|Approaches to Knowledge-Based Strategies|Companies face an increasing number of challenges, driven by market pressures, changes in the nature of labour or customers’ needs. In this context, one of the solutions to address these challenges is to develop and implement knowledge based strategies. To be successful, such approaches must identify critical needs and problems of the company and provide a framework for solving them. For decision makers, one question, once the decision to use such a strategy is taken, is what type of approach should be followed. This article addresses the topic of knowledge based strategies approaches, concerning the prescriptive and emergent ones, in the context of their increasing importance in the strategic development of companies.
M00|Implications of Managerial Reengineering on Change Management|Nowadays, due to competition focused on price, delivery times and quality, companies increasingly emphasize added value through fulfillment of customer requirements and expectations and increased organizational flexibility. Generating added value requires fulfillment of market demands, and a structure based on processes. Accordingly, the company has to focus on these processes. Not all organizational processes are value related, but only those whose results the clients are ready to pay accordingly. As a result of changes in business environment (such as increasing globalization, changes in economic structure due to ascendence of services and developments in information technology) companies requires new ways to do business. One way is to develop human resources. In this case, well trained employees are needed, capable of performing a wide range of tasks. Another way is to adapt or transform to a knowledge sesitive organization, implementing knowledge based management. Finally, another way is to develop company’s capability to redesign added value processes, independent of current objectives and products or services. In this case, managerial reengineering is the logical step. This article details relationship between managerial reengineering and change management in several of the most well known reengineering approaches in literature.
M00|An Exploratory Study on Social Media Activities of NGOs|Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are aware of the potential that internet provides them to reach out to their stakeholders and they are trying to make use of this potential. Most of the literature concerning NGOs and their social media activities shows that NGOs are having a hard time adapting to social media and they are not making full use of the potential that social media offers them (Waters, Burnett, Lamm and Lucas 2009, p. 105; Bortree and Seltzer, 2009, p. 318; Lovejoy, Waters and Saxton, 2009, p. 313; Waters and Jamal, 2011, p. 323; Muralidharan, Rasmussen, Patterson and Shin, 2011, p. 177; Miller, 2011, p. 46).The purpose of this study is to examine the social media activities of the NGOs located in the City of Çanakkale in Turkey. Data were collected through interviews with people in key positions in the NGOs and also content of social media pages of NGOs were analyzed. Facebook and Twitter are selected as social media websites examined in the study, since they are well-known and widely used sites. The goals of and expectations from NGOs? social media usage are questioned in interviews. The study also tries to determine whether NGOs are using different social media websites for different aims and in which way they are using them. Additionally the study explores with whom they interact on social media, how are they choosing to interact and how efficiently the NGOs are using the feedback they get. The challenges and shortcomings regarding NGOs? social media usage are explored as well. At the end, findings of the study are discussed, and recommendation for practitioners and possible future research implications are presented.
M00|Factors Contributing To Supply Chain Performance In Small To Medium Scale Enterprises|Many small to medium scale enterprises (SMEs) in emerging economies are yet to adopt supply chain management practices. However, they have realised the strategic importance of supply chain management as a tool for optimum business performance. This paper examined the importance of service quality, dynamic capabilities and relationship continuity as mechanisms for the enhancement of supply chain performance in SMEs. Participants in the study included a total of 348 SME managers who were based in South Africa. Data were analysed using the Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 23.0). Spearman correlations were used to determine the strength of the relationship between constructs. Regression analysis was used to test for prediction between the dependant and independent constructs. The results of the correlation tests showed significant positive correlations between supply chain performance and two constructs; service quality and dynamic capabilities. Regression analysis showed that service quality and dynamic capabilities significantly predicted supply chain performance. A comparison of the betas showed that service quality exerts greater influence on supply chain performance than the other two constructs. The study is significant in that it facilitates improved diagnosis of supply chain performance challenges amongst SMEs in emerging economies.

The results of the correlation tests showed significant positive correlations between supply chain performance and all three predictor constructs (dynamic capabilities, service quality and relationship continuity). In the regression analyses, the three predictor constructs were statistically significant. A comparison of the betas showed that service quality exerts greater influence on supply chain performance than the other two constructs. The study is significant in that it facilitates improved diagnosis of supply chain performance challenges amongst SMEs in emerging economies.
M00|Research On Usage Of New Marketing Tool Social Media In Hotel Firms: Rixos Hotel Chain|The more and more people tend to use the Internet and web tools because of the developing technology and Internet. One of the most important of these tools is social media, a new virtual media that users express themselves and connected with other users. This new media results in the new marketing approach that called as social media marketing and based on interactive participation of consumers. Social media content created by the user or firm has impact on the purchasing decisions of consumers. Therefore, the quantity of spoken and what is spoken about product/service in social media becomes important for firms as well as consumers. Since tourism sector offered the intangible services to consumer, in tourism sector it is important to have social media with quality of visual contents for traveler to have a positive impact before their trip. For that reason, the key objectives of the paper are to examine the application of hotel firms in Instagram that photo-based social media tool and to analyze whether is there any difference or not in photo preferences of a chain hotel operating in different regions. The official Instagram accounts and postings of International Chain Hotels Rixos Group between 20-30 April 2016 was examined by using visual content analysis technique. In this context, chi-square test was performed to reveal the relationship between posting numbers, follower number, followed user number, average number of like and average number of comment of hotels operating under Rixos Hotel Chain and operating in Turkey and abroad. There is a statistically significant difference between F&B and hotel services themed photos according to Mann-Whitney U test that performed to reveal the differences between posted photos? themes that posted by Rixos Hotels operating in Turkey and abroad.
M00|Perceptual Maps: An Empirical Research on Hospitals|Competition has increased among all health care providers in the provision of health care services in Turkey with the increasing role of the private sector. Perception management of health care consumers has gained importance. In order to be preferred by health care consumers, it is necessary for managers to determine how the perception of health care organizations. This study aims to determine the perception of health care consumers related to public, university and private hospitals. For this purpose, survey was applied to 283 patients who got health care services in outpatient services in a public hospital in Giresun in Turkey. The study shows that there is a statistically significant relationship between hospital preference of consumers and gender, age, income, health insurance and number of hospital visit last one year. The research demonstrates that consumers perceive private hospitals operating in the city center of Giresun on the first rank at the five dimensions (staff behavior, service quality, physical facilities, reputation and cost to consumer).
M00|The Effect of Corporate Reputation on Commitment, Trust, and Loyalty and Its Impact on Customer Behavior of Garuda Indonesia Airline Passengers in Banda Aceh, Indonesia|The objective of this research is to investigate the influence of corporate reputation on commitment, trust and loyalty and its impact on customer behavior of Garuda Indonesian Airline?s passengers in Banda Aceh, Indonesia. The respondents are the Garuda passengers which are selected by using non-probability sampling procedures. SEM analytical model is employed with Amos as its statistical software. The results showed that corporate reputation has a positive effect on commitment, trust, and loyalty; and commitment, trust and loyalty have a positive affect on customer behavior; commitment, trust, and loyalty mediate the relationship between the company's reputation and customer behavior. The originality of this study is the combined using of three intervening variables of commitment, trust, and loyalty to investigate the relationship between corporate reputation and consumer behavior in the context of airline industry as a conceptual research as far as the researcher?s concerned. This would contribute to the development of consumer behavior knowledge. The limitations of this research are that it does not capture a deep picture of the consumer behavior in the designated airline industry in Indonesia and varied education of pasengers which may have led to a biased response of questionnaire?s items.
M00|The Relation of Cultural Values and CSR: A study in Portugal and Greece|This study aims to examine the relationship between individual cultural values and consumers? perceptions about practices of social responsibility in Portugal and Greece. Data collection was undertaken using a structured questionnaire both in Portugal and Greece. Two theoretical models of structural equations that establish the relationship between cultural values and perceptions of consumers about practices of social responsibility were estimated. The results suggest that individual cultural values of Portuguese consumers influencing the perception of CSR practices are masculinity (MAS), tradition (TRD) and prudence (PRU). In the case of Greece consumers, individual cultural values influencing perception of CSR practices are interdependence (INT), independence (IND), gender equality (GEQ) and prudence (PRU). This paper demonstrates the importance of the subject, since consumers assume different perspectives and value different aspects of CSR practices, and companies must be aware of these differences if they want to effectively reach consumers.
M00|Factors Affecting Loan Default In Microfinance Institutions In Kirinyaga County|Many rural credit schemes and especially women groups, have sustained heavy losses because of loan Default. This has been in the public domain but little has been done because women groups are registered as social welfare groups which are not regarded as financial institutions or not registered at all and therefore not under the control of Central Bank of Kenya, or the Micro finance regulatory body. The main objective of this study was to find out the factors affecting of loan default in micro finance institutions in Kirinyaga County.It was also worth noting that Microfinance institutions are of two categories i.e. Formal and informal. Formal are those MFI?s which are registered as under the legal and regulatory frameworks, while the informal MFI?s are unregistered and operate like shylocks. This study concentrated on the formal MFI?s in investigating the factors affecting loan default among MFI?s in Kirinyaga County as a dependent variable, whereas the independent variables under this study were: Loan collection procedures, Loan diversion, financial management practices and the amount of loan borrowed by members of women groups affiliated to MFI?S under this study. A target population of 300 employees was used in the study. A sample of 30% was estimated to be picked using simple random sampling for each stratum, which enabled every member of the population have an equal and independent chance of being selected as respondents and also simplest, most convenient and bias free selection method. The data was collected by use of structured and semi-structured questionnaire. The data was then analyzed from questionnaires using both quantitative and qualitative techniques and tabulated by use of frequency tables. The study was intended to find out the factors affecting loan default in MFIs in Kirinyaga County. From the findings, the researcher recommends that strong policies should be implemented in micro-finance institutions for them to do away with the problem of loan default by borrowers. The institutions should put up efficient loan collection procedures which are easy to follow for both the employees and the borrower, also there should be avoidance of loan diversions, efficiency in financial management and the amount of loan borrowed should be strictly monitored and evaluated by the micro finance institutions from time to time.

It was demonstrated that as a result of new tendencies of consumer behaviour, companies, adapting their methods of reaching and servicing the customer to the market, had started to use brand communities in order to manage their own brands. That is why, the article uses a description of research conducted by an international team on the virtual Nutella brand community and indicates the potential advantages ensuing from such cooperation with the customer for the company.
M00|Consumer 3.0: Specificity and Implications for Marketing in the Opinions of Managers (Konsument 3.0 – specyfika i implikacje dla marketingu w swietle opinii menedzerow)|The primary objectives of the paper are to identify how managers interpret the meaning of consumer 3.0 and why they see it as an opportunity or threat to the market position of the company. Moreover, the author tries to find out what is maketers’ opinion on the role that a company operating today should play to meet the challenge of consumer 3.0. The basis for the empirical part of the presented paper are the results of qualitative research. On the one hand, it enables understanding how managers approach the phenomenon of consumer 3.0. On the other hand, it can provide a basis for constructing a research tool for gathering quantitative data.

M00|The Role of the Customer in the Value Creation Process Based on the 5Rs Rule (Rola konsumenta w procesie kreowania wartosci opartej na zasadzie 5R)|The purpose of this paper is to identify different motives that drive the customer and methods of practical implementation of the 5Rs rule. The author’s considerations start with the concept of customer value. Then, the author describes threats of overconsumption as well as the concept of de-consumption. De-consumption is defined as voluntary, it is not considered as the result of poverty. In the next part of the paper, different types of motivation are identified (e.g. proactive vs. reactive, egocentric vs. altruistic). The core part of the paper consists of the analysis of 5Rs and their interrelations. Finally, the author has identified the main challenges created by de-consumption for marketers. The paper is conceptual, and it is based on an extensive literature review.
M00|Corporate Social Responsibility of Chinese SMEs: Implementation and Challenges (Spoleczna odpowiedzialnosc chinskich MSP: wdrozenie, realizacja i wyzwania)|The research scope of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has been growing increasingly popular in emerging economies, whereas the knowledge relating to CSR in the case of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is still limited. This study starts with the definition of CSR and an explanation regarding the relation between CSR and marketing. Descriptions of CSR in China and Chinese SMEs are presented as well. This research aims to identify the situation of CSR as adopted by Chinese SMEs in the current economic environment as well as to analyze the challenges of their implementation. To achieve these research objectives, twenty different SMEs in Guangdong Province were investigated through in-depth semi-structured interviews. This study shows that CSR is still in an infant stage for the majority of Chinese SMEs due to the incomplete legal system, weak CSR awareness, and deficient financial resources. Moreover, several appropriate suggestions for policy makers and the enterprises themselves are recommended in order to improve the future CSR performance of Chinese SMEs.
M00|Business model innovativeness: designing a formative measure for business model innovation|Abstract Business model innovation is attracting increasing attention in corporate practice and academia. Despite strong interest in the phenomenon, no common understanding of the concept’s meaning has yet been established, hindering dialogue and progress in this research field. This study seeks to build a definition of business model innovation, and to provide a measurement index for the extent of innovativeness of a firm’s changed business model. Based on the business model, business model innovation and product innovation literatures, conceptualise business model innovation as a ‘new-to-the firm’ change that affects at least one out of three business model dimensions: value offering, value creation architecture and revenue model logic. Based on a study among 200 German firms, this study further offers an empirically validated measurement model for business model innovativeness comprising three dimensions and nine indicators. We also emphasise the opportunity-centric potentials of business model innovation as well as the potentials of integrating findings from related research streams into business model innovation research.
M00|Foreign Language Anxiety in Professional Contexts|Abstract While increasing globalization of the business world and rising numbers of people working in foreign language contexts are undoubted facts of modern work life, there are surprisingly few studies on individuals’ emotional reactions to working in a foreign language. Facilitating further research, we introduce a short scale for foreign language anxiety that is applicable in business and other professional contexts. Additionally, we investigate its relationship with gender and general personality traits. Our analysis of survey data from 320 adult bilinguals with Dutch as their mother tongue and English as foreign language demonstrates the reliability of the short scale. Furthermore, we find that females experience higher levels of FLA, but that this association is mediated by differences in personality. Our study contributes to the emerging literature on individuals’ (emotional) responses to using foreign languages in business contexts.
M00|No country for neoliberalism: a topic modeling approach to protean discourses to resist privatizations in Italy|This paper analyzes the resistance to the neoliberal discourse supporting privatizations in the Italian sociopolitical field: we address the change from a state control over economy to a situation where most of the state owned enterprises are sold and neoliberal principles are widely adopted and accepted. We focus on resistance, which builds on two frames that differ according to the period when they arise, the words they are composed of, the meanings they bear upon. The first one, which is more prevalent in the period 1984-2000, and that we called Òvalues of developmental stateÓ, opposes privatizations from a technical point of view: it is used in quotes that rationally support state intervention in economy. The second frame, that we called Òstigma privatizationsÓ, becomes prevalent starting in 2000 and appears mainly in articles that deal with societal issues, literature, movies and the wider sociocultural debate. Here influential speakers blame privatizations as something that eroded societal cohesion. To explain the transformation, we mobilize the concept of capital as described by Bourdieu: as economic capital attached to delegitimized institutions erode, discourse on resistance does not disappear but is framed within the fields that are less dependent on economic capital. As a connected contribution, the key role played by cultural capital in preserving areas of resistances revives the debate on the role of intellectuals within power dynamics as described by Antonio Gramsci. From a technical point of view, we study the evolution of the vocabulary of privatizations by analyzing almost 70.000 articles in the period 1984-2014. we use Topic Modeling, that is an automated text analysis technique that elicits topics, which are the sets of words that constitute discourses. We then reconstruct frames starting from these topics.
M00|Quantifying Audit Expectation Gap: A New approach to Measuring Expectation Gap|The main objective of the study is at first identifying the expectation gap about audit responsibility and the second quantifying the expectation gap in Iran. In order to collecting data, a questionnaire designed and developed between auditors and investors. Collected data analyzed by employing non-parametric statistics test. The results show that there is expectation gap between auditors and investors in Iran. The current study employed a new approach in the world in order to quantifying the expectation gap. It gives the more strength to other researchers in order to measuring audit expectation gap in the world. JEL Classification: M; M00
M00|Boundaryless Career and Career Outcomes: The Mediating Role of Individual Career Management Behaviours|The main objective of this paper is to study individuals’ attitude towards mobility both psychological and physical and the behavioural paths that people may use to experience career success. In a structural equation model, we consider boundaryless career attitudes and the mediating role of career management behaviours to career outcomes. Psychological mobility appears to be a better predictor of career satisfaction and career advancement than physical mobility. All career strategies have a positive effect on career advancement, except for extended work involvement. Relationships oriented career strategies are not linked with career satisfaction. Physically mobile people adopt to a lesser extent relationship- oriented career strategies. Our results showed that people with a psychological mobility attitude are more likely to achieve career satisfaction through remaining flexible in their career. This knowledge is very important for practitioners and managers working with psychologically mobile personnel, as it underlines the need for employers to provide opportunities for training, skill development and challenging work. The study adds to the existing literature in that it provides empirical evidence regarding the career behavioural paths individuals with a boundaryless career attitude may use when they expect to advance their careers. Our findings help us understand better the psychological mobility attitude which has been examined less in the literature. JEL Classification: M, M00
M00|A comprehensive conceptual profile on control|The paper starts from the persisting uncertainties regarding the use of the term “control”. In order to mitigate such ambiguities, after a brief subject exposure, a range of questions are proposed, whose adapted answers may help us to refine a correct understanding and perception of control, of course in relation with a plethora of similar concepts. Our argumentation includes the elaboration and presentation of a range of conceptual pillars or vectors regarding the control in its widest meaning, in contrast with other more restricted forms, equivocal or even altered explanations. The text is enriched with some assertions of the authors regarding the assurance of the appropriate control, with its meaning of a state of harmony, which can successfully meet honest expectations. At the end, we conclude that, in the current conditions, control can only be defined in a holistic style and we proposed a conceptual profile, through which we can easily explain what the control actually includes.
M00|The importance of professional judgement applied in the context of the International Financial Reporting Standards|Guidance has always been welcome in terms of applying professional judgement in the context of the principles-based accounting standards – International Financial Reporting Standards. This fact is the result of the complexity and diversity of some situations, which might give rise to difficulties in terms of choosing the appropriate accounting policies and methods (depreciation, inventory valuation on hand at the end of an accounting period, the recognition of revenues and expenses from a construction contract, accounting for lease contracts by the proper determination of the type of lease: financing or operating), and respectively the need to verify if the criteria set by the principles-based accounting standards are met. This “freedom” of choice and disclosure might create problems in terms of accounting information quality. The possibility to select accounting methods based on the Standards’ provisions is meant to generate a true and fair view of the company’s financial position and financial performance. In these cases it is recommended to use professional judgement in order to reach a conclusion which is in accordance with the accounting principles and is not enforced by any accounting rules, since the exercise of individual professional judgement is preferred against the “pure” compliance with prescriptive legal requirements.
M00|Corporate Social Responsibility And Marketing Communication|The purpose of this research study is to investigate different issues regarding CSR and marketing communication: use of CSR as a marketing tool; CSR activities and customer loyalty; fairness of product price ratio; undergoing awareness campaigns regarding social and environmental issues; promotion of ethical values and CSR principle in marketing communication, and so on. Unfortunately, results have shown that in the surveyed organizations CSR communication is not understood well enough and used. We provide some recommendations, based on the research results. The findings could provide valuable insights to managers in order to improve their implication and actions in this domain.

M00|Corporate Sustainability Practices and Reporting: A Case of Malaysian Real Estate Investment Trusts and Property Listed Companies|This paper investigated the quality of reporting regarding different dimensions (economic, environmental, social) of corporate sustainability (CS) in Malaysia. The paper examined the quality of CS disclosure on the basis of global reporting initiative in a sample of 113 listed companies from real estate investment trusts and property sectors for 4 years i.e., from 2010 to 2013. The data collected from websites and annual reports of these companies exhibit variations in quality and disclosure of different CS dimensions. The paper found that environmental dimension was less while social dimension was a highly focused aspect of CS. Moreover, most of the companies report sustainability for the sake of mere compliance to the relevant regulations. This paper is unique in terms to focus all the dimensions of CS as most of the previous literature addressed these separately. Moreover, being a first comprehensive study, particularly after 10th Malaysian Plan (2011-2015), the paper has important findings for regulators, academia, researchers and other stakeholders

M00|Nation Branding in the XXI century – A Conceptual Approach|In a more and more globalized world, countries must make high efforts to differentiate between them and to create a competitive advantage. Given the economic development at present, no country can afford to remain isolated from the world economy and should make consistent efforts to adapt quickly. The market became almost homogenous and that’s why nations must explore every niche they find. But in order to be successful they need to make those niches relevant to the consumers. And one of the ways to do this is through nation branding. The aim of this paper is to analyze the steps which led to nation branding and to explain the concept by making a review of one of the most important authors who studied this phenomenon. What is nation branding? How this concept appeared and why countries should brand themselves instead of allowing the stereotypes to define them completely are the questions that this article tries to answer.
M00|Choosing A Bachelor-Level Business Program: Factors Impacting The Decision|In the increasingly competitive environment in which colleges and universities are striving to attract students, understanding why and how prospective students make their choices is becoming more critical. Understanding the choices of programs within a college or university is also increasingly important. The review of the literature revealed that most studies were about choosing undergraduate business programs in on-site environments, not a mix of on-site and online. At a major private, non-profit universityâ€™s business school, questions were raised about prospective students choosing among three bachelor-level business programs. What led them to choose their particular program? Which sources of information were most influential in their choices? What role did Advisers play in their choices? In a sample of 182 out of 1985 students enrolled in the three programs, study participants were asked about the purpose of their enrollment, their enrollment process, and their perceptions of the similarities and differences in the programs. Possibly because the participants in this study were mid-career students, the results had great alignment to the studies in the literature examining choosing graduate schools. Participants were seeking the keys to better opportunities for promotion, a sense of accomplishment, and better ability to change careers
M00|Innovation Model For Smes Using Guided Practice , Modelo De Innovacion Para Las Pymes A Partir De La Practica Guiada|Innovation should be a priority for a government that wants an economic development mechanism. Small and medium businesses require innovative models that enable them to modernize and offer products and services according to changing consumer markets. In this study, the different models of innovation management are discussed and what researchers have concluded as to which organization will be capable of adopting them. This research aims to show a model of innovation, including the monitoring (guided practice) that allows small and medium businesses to increase their responsiveness to the changing environment and to develop culture innovation within organizations. We conducted an extensive review of the existing literature about innovation, model for innovation and learning methods. As a result, a model of innovation for SMEs that includes, among others, the element guided practice (monitoring) was designed. The model is a dynamic spiral steadily protruding guide track and applied to each of the elements. It is concluded that the areas of innovation model are the same as those proposed for decades. However, how a model is implemented varies and support networks are vital to a successful model of innovation
M00|Model To Profesionalize And Improve The Competitiveness Of Business In The Mexicali Valley, Modelo De Profesionalizacion Para Mejorar La Competitividad De Las Empresas Del Sector Comercial En El Valle De Mexicali|The study examines family businesses (EF) and non-family businesses (ENF); starting from the question, can a model of Professionalism improve the competitiveness of companies in the commercial sector of the Mexicali Valley. We developed an instrument to measure the internal capacities of MIPYMES, with the objective to identify and develop a model of professionalization that allow businesses to improve their competitiveness and promote local development. This is a descriptive study, whose field work was carried out in the months of May and June 2012. We examine possible existence of a linear relationship between competitiveness and its dimensions: strategic planning, Human Resources, Accounting and Finance. To validate this claim we conducted a hypothesis test of the Spearman correlation coefficient Rho, showing results that there is no linear relationship between the variables. Finally to make a comparative analysis of existing competition between the EF and ENF, the analysis of variance (ANOVA of a factor), was used to identify if the average competitiveness of EOF is equal to the average competitiveness of the ENF. The results showed that the level of significance for competitiveness is higher than the established level of significance (Î± = 0.05). Thus, the average competitiveness of the EF equals the average competitiveness of ENF, i.e. There is no significant difference between both with respect to competitiveness and other variables.
M00|Models of Social Responsibility under the Impact of the Global Financial Crisis. Case Study: the Romanian Banking System|The Romanian banking system has begun development on modern bases only after 1990, with the passing from the monobank system to the two-tier system. Other important steps in modernizing the banking system were: privatization of large state banks and the European Union accession. These mutations have also marked the application of the concept of social responsibility in the Romanian banking system that is still in the early stages of development. The dominant presence of foreign banking capital and the European Union accession had a positive impact in the social responsibility area. Some banks in Romania have adopted the practice of non-financial reporting according to international standards in the field. The negative consequences of the global financial crisis determined banks to step up efforts to adopt new business models based on responsible practices and responsible financing. A post-crisis direction of action for improving the relationship between banks and customers and avoid possible problems in the payment of loans was the intensification of implementation by banks of financial education programs. However there are still a number of actions to be undertaken to strengthen the concept of social responsibility in the Romanian banking system.

M00|Relationship between Social Network Credibility and Online Purchase Intention for Automobile Market in Egypt|The wide popularity of the internet has influenced people to use it on regular basis in order to gain information about cars for purchasing purposes. It is hoped that this research will promote car sales in Egypt by studying the impact of trusting internet social networks such as Facebook on the car brand image to users. It also aims to advise the automobile market industry to better shape its internet online marketing strategies by determining the characteristics of the Egyptian online car buyers, which would be helpful in developing better online marketing strategies. The leading Egyptian automobile websites are studied also for comparison, especially regarding usage of internet social networks in car business. A customized questionnaire, with a total sample of 274 and 5 interviews have been made for this purpose. The research paper performs empirical analysis and uses hypothesis testing to obtain the required results. Validity analysis was used for the credibility factor (Reputed credibility) and reliability analysis with a score of 0.5.
M00|Student Response Systems (SRS) and the Performance of First-Generation Students Majoring in Business|Traditionally, first-generation college students (students whose parents didn’t attend college) are at a distinct disadvantage in regards to academic performance and outcomes at post-secondary institutions; and according to the literature, the most commonly declared major of first-generation students is business. Student response systems (SRS) are an in-class student polling technology that is designed to create an engaging and inviting learning environment that maximizes active learning. This study seeks to determine if SRS causes a significant improvement in the exam scores for first-generation college students majoring in business exposed to SRS compared to first-generation college students majoring in business not exposed to SRS.
M00|The Role of Charismatic World Trade Organization and the expansion of Free International Trade|One of the most significant occurrences over the last two decades in the area of economic desegregation was the sharp increase in bilateral, multilateral and regional trading arrangements since the end of the Uruguay Round in 1994. It is extensively believed that the international trade organization, WTO, increases trading systems and encourages trade. Pursuing free trade by WTO has numerous attractions. It is clear that free trade enhanced among WTO member countries but seems most favorable for rich countries and little bit glitch for developing nations. Countries bind themselves and their trading collaborators to transparent and non-discriminatory trade regulations and rules, which the WTO then implements even handedly. As a consequence, much consideration is paid to the exceptional needs and tribulations of developing and transition economies.
M00|The Stock Investment Strategy at Company Acquisition|Recent studies in Accounting, Industrial Organizations and Finance often incorporate efficient market hypothesis in event studies. Event studies can be used to examine how changes in company environment affect corporate finance. However, using short-term stock prices to examine mean reversion may face a problem. Specifically, there is no evidence that changes in market values are unbiased estimates of changes in fundamentals. This study adopts program trading to test the mean reversion of an acquisition event (SPIL and ASE Group) between 2015 and 2016 in Taiwan. The results show that investors can use RSI spread and stock price deviation to make abnormal returns. In other words, investors can make profits based on technical analyses. Therefore, the evidence suggests that between 2015 and 2016, the security market in Taiwan did not fully meet the condition of a semi-strong form efficient market.
M00|The impact of strategic learning orientation, entrepreneurial orientation and reconfiguring capabilities on export performance of SMEs in Nigeria|The objectives of this study are to investigate the relationship between learning orientation (LO), entrepreneurial orientation (EO), reconfiguring capability (RC) and export performance (EP) as well as determine the mediating effect of entrepreneurial orientation on the relationship between LO, RC and EP of SMEs in Nigeria. Having employed PLS-SEM on 201 data from SMEs in Nigeria, the findings of the study revealed significant relationship between LO and EP, between RC and EP, and between EO and EP, while the mediating effect of EO on the relationship between LO and EP, and between RC and EP are less statistically significant
M00|Effective Business Strategy for International Strategic Performance: An Empirical Study of Chinese Construction Firms|To build on the research of strategic management we conducted an empirical study in the context of international performance. Three principal strategies, according to Porters generic strategy theory: cost leadership cost-focus and differentiation respectively, were tested in our research model. Quantitative empirical analysis of international strategy on a sample of 58 Chinese firms was conducted to determine strategies that lead to enhanced strategic performance. We utilized survey strategy encompassing questionnaire data collection. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS statistical package. Inference statistics consisting of correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis were performed. Findings of the study suggest that cost leadership and differentiation strategies impact strategic performance significantly, whereas cost-focus does not. A value of appropriate international business strategy is illustrated by supporting a relationship between strategy and international performance. The originality of contributions of the study lies in the fact that the generic business strategies’ impact on strategic performance is tested on an international market on the sample of Chinese firms. These notions enrich existing body of knowledge on strategic management. Therefore, companies conducting their business operations internationally should consider forming and implementing strategies of differentiation and cost leadership to achieve optimal business results.
M00|Corporate Governance and Financial Reporting Quality in Selected Nigerian Company|This paper evaluated the level of performance of some selected companies ranging from commodities, brewery, banking, oil and gas and beverages in terms of corporate governance measure indictors on the firm quality of financial reporting in Nigeria. The data were collected from 2006 to 2015. Econometric analysis were conducted and the result suggests that the correlation among corporate governance indicators of board structure (size-BRDSZ and independence-BRDID), audit quality (audit committee size (ADCMZ), the quality of external audit (EADTQ) as measured by the presence of an auditor among the big-4), board experience (i.e. experience-BRDEX) and financial reporting quality is 93.47%. The independent variables can explain the variation in the FRQDA by 54.29%. There is overall significance among the parameters measuring financial reporting quality as discretionary accruals of firm (FRQDA). Board structure (size-BRDSZ), board experience (experience-BRDEX) and the quality of external audit (EADTQ) have positive impact on the financial reporting quality measured by the discretionary accruals of firm (FRQDA) by 16.01, 0.05 and 2.75. However, independent directors on the board of firm (independence-BRDID) and audit quality (audit committee size (ADCMZ) negatively affect financial reporting quality measured by the discretionary accruals of firm (FRQDA) as much as 0.99 and 20.01. Guarantee Trust Bank Plc. among the five selected companies of study in Nigeria has better performance of financial reporting based on board structure (size-BRDSZ) and audit committee size (ADCMZ). This revealed that there is short run relationship among Audit quality (audit committee size (ADCMZ), and the quality of external audit (EADTQ) as measured by the presence of an auditor among the big-4) and board experience (i.e. experience-BRDEX) have not granger cause FRQDA. It further recommended that greater focus on corporate governance indicators so as to bring about global standard financial reporting in the Nigerian emerging market for investment opportunity.
M00|A Cross-National Study of the Relationships between Cultural Determinants, Sustainable Governance and Sustainable Development|The study investigates the drivers of Sustainable Development presented by Hofstede cultural dimensions and Sustainable Governance in OECD and EU countries. The relationships between predictors and Sustainable Development were tested by multiple regression analysis, which confirmed that Sustainability-oriented Governance leads to Sustainable Development, emphasizing the importance of Sustainable Governance. The impact of cultural variables on Sustainable Development was sensitive to the existence of Sustainable governance, confirming the hypothesized role of the Sustainable governance in the relationship among the national cultural differences and Sustainable Development as a moderator. Sustainable governance contributes to the growth of positive influence of Masculinity, decreasing, at the same time, the importance of Power distance in the relationship with Sustainable Development, presented by Sustainability-adjusted Global Competitiveness Index.
M00|Local Dilemma about Liberalisation or Intervention|Public sector economics describes algorithms of public authorities’ decisions about liberalization of their tasks or intervention in the private issues. Such theory mainly concerns national or supra-national level decisions. Aim is to propose algorithm of similar decisions locally, taking into account individual specific of local situation. Methods of policy analysis for this aim are applied. Local governments have dual nature – they are executors of national policy as well as autonomous policy-makers and executors of own policy. General principles, formally recognized by all members of the Council of Europe (this concerns 100% of the EU countries) are: 1) for dividing of competences among national and local authorities – the principle of subsidiarity; 2) for scope and content of intervention – principle of proportionality. The same principles could be applied for decisions about liberalization or intervention of local issues, which concerns obligatory or voluntary local governments’ competences. Factors, which have to be taken into account to decide about intervention, are presence or absence of several types of local market failure and several types of government failure. Proposed algorithm of decision includes testing of sustainability of private activities, testing of main types of market failures, EU failure, national government failure, local government failure. That first cycle of procedure is practical implementation of the principle of subsidiarity. If intervention is necessary, then there are several options, how to impact on situation. The choice could be done among 1) regulation of private activities with corresponding administration; 2) supplying of public services for free; 3) supplying services or goods for partial payments of beneficiaries; 4) direct entrepreneurship; 5) facilitating private entrepreneurs or organized civil society organizations; 6) outsourcing of corresponding local government activities. That second cycle of procedure is practical implementation of the principle of proportionality to ensure as minimal intervention, as possible.
M00|Workflow of the Management in Printing Production in Condition of Print on-Demand|Print-on-demand technology allows printing single book up to 200 copies. Correct use of digital printing and binding equipment effectively addresses the economics of this process as well. A process of storing the books is ignored as the number of printed copies is directly related to the number of orders. Publishing house owning the printed version of PDF publication chooses the file from the database and sends it to the printing company with the on-demand printer. This process is highly efficient for printing companies and also for bookstores as well. Bookstores should be no exception in being Print-on-demand printer owners.
M00|Unique approach to Family Business: Uzbekistan case|The new law of “Family Entrepreneurship” was introduced in the Republic of Uzbekistan on the 26th April, 2012. Enforcement of this law has caused so many changes in the domain of entrepreneurship. As a result of these changes, the main aim of this article is to inform of the opportunities created by this new law and also to point out differences of this law in relation to the norms practiced in foreign countries. In order to achieve this goal, we have used the method of comparison in our experiment. The results of these experiments show that newly-introduced laws have had a huge positive impact on the activities of entrepreneurs and that they differ with their distinct positive features.
M00|Consumers’ Demographic Differences and the Country-of-Origin Effects on Evaluations of Product Categories: An International Study|The aim of this study is to fill in a gap in Country-of-Origin (COO) studies by assessing the relationship between COO and consumer decision-making processes in Morocco, an emerging market, and non-Western Mediterranean country and culture. Specifically, this research study demonstrates that the consumer demographic characteristic of age does make a difference in the COO influence for product categories within Morocco. Age was shown to interact with the impact of COO with regard to purchasing decisions regarding products from more industrialized/economically advanced nations, compared to products from less economically advanced/industrialized nations. These results have managerial implications in assisting multinational organizations in their market segmentations and positioning strategies.
M00|Contradictions of Formation of the Global Economic Governance System|The reasons and the factors of the global economic governance formation became the urgent issues of modern economic theory and practice. Emerging mechanisms of global governance reflect the transitional nature of the present stage of civilization. Under modern conditions, global ownership only begins to form, which inevitably involves the use of the socio-economic shell of previous historical types of economic relations. This particularly reflected in the utilization of the worldwide ownership in private-sector interests and in the application of the mechanisms of global governance to achieve the goals of individual states, corporations, financial-oligarchic clans and other private entities. A contradiction of genesis and evolution of the global ownership and control mechanisms of the world economic system become the essential problem of the international political economy.
M00|General Management Principles in the Project Management Context|In order that the projects can become the tools by which organizations can realize their strategic objectives it is necessary to define a culture of project management that involves the whole organization. This type of culture could be started through the definition of the main principles of General Management that govern the management of projects in an organizational context. This work is aimed to analyze the ISO norm 10006 Â«Quality Management Systems â€“ Guidelines for quality management in projectsÂ» not by the quality point of view in a project management context but by the contribute to the growth of organizations through the definition implicit or explicit of principles on which it must base an organization that works for projects. The results of this study revealed that implicit and explicit principles of general management help to involve all parts of an organization and improve the management of organizational projects successfully. It will be also taken in comparison the most important project management standards such as ISO21500, PMBOK, IPMA, PRINCE2.
M00|Human Values and Reaction to CSR Announcements: A Cross-National Comparison with Emphasis on U.S.â€“Global Differences|Studies have been conducted in five countries concerning the human values of management students, and their opinions about corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. While the results suggest that CSR announcements have a significant influence on the opinion about company CSR initiatives, we observe a difference between students in the U.S. and students in other countries. The highest negative response to CSR announcements was in the group of self-transcendent students in the USA, and in the group of conservative students in Europe and Asia. On the basis of these studies results, it is possible to say that there are differences in reactions to CSR announcements depending on cultural (local) circumstances and that companies should not employ direct communication concerning their CSR initiatives.
M00|A Comparative Study of Tastes and Preferences for Local and Foreign Wines in Bulgaria|On the base of semantic differential instrument we assess the main factors in wine demand attitudes of Bulgarian customers. We aim to find out whether specific marketing techniques could alter the demand for such a traditional product as wine in Bulgaria. Given the fact that Bulgarian customers only recently received the possibility to taste imported wines, we find that foreign wines are evaluated mainly through the prejudice of past knowledge, not linked to the actual product. Most likely the demand for wine in Bulgaria will continue to be focused on local products. Furthermore we examine how the region of origin determines tastes and preferences for consuming a specific type of wine and the price the consumer is ready to pay.
M00|Towards Optimal Cooperation and Job Performance: The Impact of Leadership on Role Ambiguity and Role Conflict|The paper explores the ways to achieve superior job performance and cooperation among employees. The conceptual study suggests that leadership styles have influence on role conflict and role ambiguity, which in turn impact job performance and cooperation. The research paper builds on the theory of leadership and contributes to the leadership-performance body of work. The importance of role stressors which include role ambiguity and role stressors is considered to be critical since understanding these role stressors enables policymakers and leaders to take necessary measures which can be used to increase the job performance and cooperation among employees. The current research proposes the conceptual framework which can be used to analyse the influence of different types of leaders in response to role stressors, such as role conflict and role ambiguity which are directly related to job performance and cooperation.
M00|How Engineering and Business Schools can benefit from Using Regionalization in a Globalized World-Insights from Kant and Chaos Theory|The purpose of the article is to show how Chinese engineering schools and business schools can benefit from using a regional approach in a globalized world. The objective is to achieve economic growth. In order to tailor make services to the needs of the students and the business community research can be the main activity of engineering schools and business schools, focusing on undergraduate programs, building the reasoning on insights from Kant and chaos theory. Graduate programs can to a greater extent use applied approaches suited to the needs of the business world and the world of science. It is suggested that a regional model is used building on technology, leadership and value creation in order to meet expected economic growth. The sample of schools is from Asia, Europe and America (USA).
M00|Supporting the Competent Practitioner: Trans-disciplinary Coaching with a Knowledge-Based Expert System|The purpose of this paper is to describe the roles of the coach and the coachee from the perspective of their respective competences and a particular type of the coaching process that we call Â«competent coachingÂ». We also show how this process can be supported with a knowledge-based expert system (KBS); to illustrate this, we introduce a particular knowledge-based expert system shell, Doctus, that can assist the coaching process. We also offer a set of concepts, organised into a conceptual framework, in order to help both coach and coachee to (re-)shape the coaching process and thus achieve greater contextual sensitivity. Our contribution is a multi-personal account, rooted in some 100 years of combined coaching experience and around four decades of researching and teaching coaching to business school students at the undergraduate, MBA and doctoral level, including executive education.
M00|Supporting the Competent Practitioner: Transdisciplinary Coaching with Knowledge-Based Expert System|By today disciplines, both hard sciences and softer areas that often fight for the ‘scientific’ status, grew so large that they became impossible to master. This statement perhaps re-quires some explanation. By hard sciences we mean disciplines, such as physics or biology, that are around for a long time, focus on discovering universally and infinitely (both in time and space) valid laws of nature and are in a position where the ‘truth’ of their statements can be demonstrated, enabling prediction and control. In turn, soft disciplines, including not only arts but also any knowledge domains that aim at understanding human and social phenomena, are in comparison limited. This means, that the laws of nature in these areas do not seem to be universally and infinitely valid (there are variations both in time and space), ‘truth’ allows for multiple interpretations, and prediction and control, if attempted, usually fail. These soft knowledge domains thus cannot meet the requirements of hard scientific disciplines. There are three ways to battle this situation: (1) giving up the claim of the scientific status, (2) redefine what science means in such knowledge domains, and (3) trying to squeeze the discipline into the traditional ‘science’ box. Most researchers in the human-social arena are unhappy with (1), cannot make (2) happen and thus attempt (3). We believe that this is not only dangerous but outright harmful. When squeezing the human-social disciplines into the ‘science’ box, the discipline is truncated. Instead of becoming scientific they become ‘scientistic’ (Dörfler & Eden, 2014). We do not attempt to resolve this problem in this paper but we wanted to clarify our departure point in order to outline the playing field. What is common for both hard and soft disciplines is that there is such amount of knowledge accumulated in each of them that it is impossible to master any of them completely. This means that nobody today knows physics or biology – and, equally, nobody knows psychology or economics. However, it is possible to get a taster from the various disciplines at every level of education. Education starts with a liberal arts phase. Elementary school pupils learn reading, calculating, somersaulting, painting and singing. In higher school years they may learn solving integrals, burning sulphur, the directions and timing of Napoleon’s quests or that the antagonist is a necessary component of a story. Here pupils start to specialise, shifting more towards hard or soft. At university level students of engineering become familiar with the deep secrets of the Carnot-cycle and the Nash equilibrium but are not longer able to understand anything a sociology professors says, and vice versa. The outcome of the university is then a semi-specialised cultivated mind. By semi-specialised we mean that it is not a balanced knowledge any more, such as it was in the liberal arts phase, but engineers can still read, know some history, and some of them will appreciate paintings, others music. Some are more narrowly focused than others, but all of them will have knowledge limited to the part of their respective disciplines that can be taught and learned. This part is easy to accept. However we also want to make an assertion that is somewhat more difficult to accept: the knowledge acquired in formal education is both necessary and useless. The semi-specialised cultivated mind is familiar with the main concepts of the discipline(s) they specialised in. In the formal education these concepts are developed from scratch, which is a time-consuming process, and they are validated in an intellectual context, through thinking. This means that the cultivated mind sees the world through the lens of their respective disciplines and can think about it using the disciplinary context. Then, however, the cultivated mind leaves the school and finds itself in the context of praxis. To their horror the school-leavers find themselves in a place that seems familiar, i.e. they recognise the concepts – but these concepts seem to make a completely different sense than what they ‘sup-pose’ to mean. The knowledge of the textbooks is useless. At this point it does not help if further and further disciplinary concepts are added to the cultivated mind. Instead, in the context of praxis the same disciplinary concepts are re-developed, they gradually acquire a new meaning validated through application. However, it would not be possible to re-develop the concepts, if the school-leaver did not have them in the first place. Therefore the formal education is also indispensable. From time to time the practitioner may go back to the for-mal education for knowledge refreshment, acquire new concepts of the discipline, and then bring these back to praxis. Thus going back and forth between the formal education and the praxis competence emerges. We expect the competent practitioner to be able to solve the problems of praxis. However, as they are becoming competent, the practitioners quickly discover that the real world of praxis does not fit within the boundaries of any discipline. In order to solve any real-life problem in praxis, we need to borrow tools, models, insights sometimes from one other times from another discipline. This will partly lead to the competent practitioners expanding their horizons, and partly to working together with other competent practitioners (semi )specialised in different disciplines. These processes of problem solving we call trans-disciplinary. Without attempting detailed delineation from inter-, cross- and multidisciplinary, we conceptualise the transdisciplinary problem solving process as one in which we borrow what and when needed from various disciplines in order to solve the problem at hand. In a sense it can be regarded as a superior stage of interdisciplinarity, ‘which will not be limited to recognize the interactions and/or reciprocities between the specialized researches, but which will locate these links inside a total system without stable boundaries between the disciplines’ (Piaget, 1972). Together with Nicolescu (2010) we argue that such transdisciplinarity must not be reduced to the ‘hard sciences’. In our presentation we will address the possibility of supporting transdisciplinary problem solving process through a particular form of coaching called knowledge engineering and knowledge based expert systems.
M00|Procedural justice and Employees Commitment to Supervisor in Nigerian Health Sector|In this research, we investigated the relationship between procedural justice and employees commitment to supervisor in Rivers State of Nigeria. A survey questionnaire was sent out to a sample size of 103 employees, resulting in 99 responses out of which 13 copies of the questionnaire were not statistically usable. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used for data analysis. This study found a significantly positive relationship between procedural justice and employees commitment to supervisor. We found that employees tend to easily identify with supervisors that implement fair procedures than those that do not and employees do study or evaluate their organizations justice climate to identify procedural injustice by comparing policies of different organizations. We concluded that fairness of procedures could reinforce a healthy justice climate and employees commitment to supervisor in turn. The justices of outcome and interaction depend mainly on the justice of procedures, as unjust procedures may not turn out a just outcome. We, therefore, recommended that organizations should commission enquiries into the justice climate of the industries they operate, ascertain the best practice, beat such a practice or at least align procedures, policies and programmes with the principles of fairness.
M00|Best Practice of Benchmarking of Worlds Top Universities: Lessons for Higher Educational Institutions of Uzbekistan|The significance of the higher education can be seen in terms of assisting the economy with skillful specialists who are considered to be the key force for the development of the country. Higher education is considered to be crucial in modern market-based economies. Particularly, the higher education enables the development and maintenance of the knowledge acquired by the youth. Higher education contributes to the development of the human capital, which can later act as crucial aspect of growth. This paper takes a broad perspective on the importance of higher education, precisely to the structure of Masters degree programs, in many developed countries of the world including USA, UK and Germany. The paper uses the benchmarking method in order to analyze and apply practices of higher education systems in Uzbekistan. It is important to note that current state of higher education institutions in Uzbekistan reflects the practice of former Soviet Union institutions and needs to adopt strategies that are followed by worlds top universities. The main purpose of this paper is to critically examine the practices and evaluating the higher education system of these countries. The outcomes of the analysis are used to offer a framework for the development of higher education systems precisely in the context of masters programs, in Uzbekistan.
M00|A Support of Independent Processes Outside of Information System, Using an Ontology Driven Application|The purpose of the article is to analyze support of the independent processes, using any tool of information technology (IT) outside of the information system (IS) in the enterprise environment. The useful tool of IT could be the software (SW) ATOM, an ontology-driven web based application. Changes in IS are very expensive, complicated and risky, but it should be suggested solution omitted. The extensive literature review of the current state of the topic is added. The chosen process is innovation; the life cycle of innovation is explained: suggestion of innovation, demand for the solution of innovation, the final solution of innovation, and project for implementation of innovation. The methodology of an ontology preparation for the SW application includes design scheme of classes and associations between classes, preparation table of assignment characteristics to classes, and implementation of an ontology design in SW ATOM. The real possibility to support independent processes outside of IS using an ontology-driven application was experimentally verified and confirmed, and the result of research work could be used for any process outside of IS. Limits of the proposed solution consist of only experimental laboratory verification. For the practical use, it should be necessary first to prepare a prototype for the corporation IS in an enterprise environment.
M00|An Overview of Demand Management through Demand Supply Chain in Fashion Industry|Accomplishing veritable demand in a timely manner is a true challenge in present business circumstances especially for the fashion products where the demand is to get more varieties in short interval. Managing demand and supply is not that naÃ¯ve as the supply chain is complicated by the outsourcing trend. This study aims to assess how brands in the fashion industry are managing their demand-supply chains (DSCs) by considering both trendy and regular product. This paper is based on the literature review of demand chain management (DCM) and also supply chain management (SCM) of the fashion industry. Also the research on demand-supply chain management (DSCM) is studied as a scope of demand-supply management in fashion industry. Textile and apparel processing stages are also studied to understand the manufacturing and supply chain complexity. The review identified that the degree of fashion sensitivity adopted by the retail brands influences their supply chain strategy. Fast fashion retailers urge to respond quickly and they need a flexible and responsive supply chain and contrariwise, others do need fast response but more efficiency focus with economy of scale. chains. The demand side aspects and supply side alignment will contribute insights on DSC organization in textile-apparel supply chain. Also textile and apparel manufacturers may have a clearer picture regarding the structure of retailers DSCs. The findings may also prove useful for them who are not aligned with the fast track concept, but yet supplying product in timely manner is their top priority. The co-ordination of complex and multidimensional textile-apparel supply chain with individual interest is still a concern and yet to be resolved. The objective of the study is to add knowledge for perceiving the importance of the co-ordination for mutual benefit.
M00|Achieving Service innovation Through Market Orientation: The Role of Relationship Marketing and Knowledge Management|Market orientation is a widely discussed concept in marketing literature while relationship marketing has emerged as an important paradigm over the past decade. Research has shown the significance of relationship marketing for increased sales and enhanced organizational performance. On the other hand, knowledge management is also an important agenda for organizations. Prevalent approach of service dominant logic has raised the interest of researchers in studying service as science. Both manufacturing industry and service industry rely on service innovations for success and competitive advantage. This paper theoretically analyzes the role of market orientation, relationship marketing and knowledge management and proposes a theoretical framework for their combined effect on service innovation. The framework is proposed for researchers to conduct further empirical studies in order to test its validity in practical work environment.
M00|Study on Optimum Peripheral Business Model in Pengerang, Johor|The study discloses potential numbers of business models that could be instigated by the Pengerang people who keen to venture as peripheral traders. Secondary sources of data have been used due to the limitation and obstacles in collecting primary data. This paper indicates the optimum peripheral business model that can be potentially executed.
M00|The Moderating Effect of Technology Acceptance Perspectives on the Formation of e-SQ and Service Satisfaction in Low Cost Carrier Airline|As there is an increasing demand in public transportation and electronic transaction, the service quality of website determines the success of the service provider. Therefore, electronic service quality (e-SQ) plays an important role for any business involved in online transaction to attract customers. Customer’s assessment of e-SQ is usually based on their actual experiences of interaction with the website. According to previous research, there exists relationship between e-SQ and service satisfaction. The moderating effect of technology acceptance model (TAM) shows positive result. As e-SQ and TAM improve, this will, in turn, improve service satisfaction. However, the relationship between “e-SQ-TAM service satisfactions” has been found to be not consistent in the case of low cost carrier airline in Malaysia. With concern to further understanding of this area, the present study explores dimensions of e-SQ in low cost carrier airline context and their relationship with service satisfaction. Furthermore, the moderating effect of perceived ease-of-use and perceived usefulness (TAM) was explored. This study employed convenience sampling and questionnaire method to gain data; 392 completed questionnaires were gathered from Malaysia Airline Industry (low cost carrier) website users. The result indicated that e-SQ dimensions: customization, site privacy and aesthetic, efficiency, system availability and fulfillment constitute e-SQ for low cost carrier airline. Moreover, the result also illustrates that perceived ease-of-use and perceived usefulness (TAM) positively moderate the relationship between e-SQ and service satisfaction.
M00|Valuation of Shares and Fair Value of the Companies Listed on the Wig20: Quoted On the Warsaw Stock Exchange in Poland within 2011-2015|This paper examines share price of the companies listed on the WIG-20 and their fair value between 2005 and 2015. Data from 2005 to 2015 were collected from the Stooq.pl (Polish portal of shares). Two hypotheses are tested: (1) value of the shares based on the market price; (2) value of the shares as the fair value of shares.
M00|Neuromarketing – research and prediction of the future|The paper deals with neuromarketing, its techniques, the current status of research and the future prediction in this field of marketing. The first chapter brings the general overview about neuromarketing and briefly points out the history. It also represents six areas of practice which are branding, product design and innovation, advertising effectiveness, shopper decision making, online experiences and entertainment effectiveness. The paper further describes particular techniques which can measure different kinds of activity. The most common techniques are electroencephalography, magneto encephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and eye tracking. The last chapter deals with prediction and the future of neuromarketing. The aim of the article is to bring the attention and highlight its actuality and the importance of its understanding.
M00|Exploring the Value and Process of Marketing Strategy: Review of Literature|Marketing strategy represents a key element of success for organizations. Executing an effective marketing strategy is just as important as conceptualizing and creating it. Through marketing strategy implementation firms employ scarce resources through marketing capabilities in order to attain the set goals and targets. In order to illustrate the value of marketing strategy and the process of implementation a detailed literature review was performed. A total of (Number of Studies Depending On the References Count, After Employee Deletion) studies on the topic of marketing strategy have been examined. The meta-analysis uncovers two distinct but related features to marketing strategy content: marketing strategy decisions and marketing strategy decision implementation. The literature also suggests there is a relationship of marketing strategy, and marketing mix elements on organizational performance, and emphasizes a further need to perform conceptual and empirical studies. The originality and value of the review lies in the fact that marketing strategy has been analyzed both in terms of its outcomes and as a process that does not yield satisfactory results without effective implementation.
M00|Innovation and Economic Growth in Emerging Latin American Countries: The Case of Mexico, Brazil and Chile|Over recent years, several theoretical and empirical research projects (from developed countries) have studied innovation as a complex process involving participation, interaction and interrelationship of actors (organizations, individuals, businesses) and institutions (government, education, research centres) as elements of a collective system that contribute and influence the innovation process. In addition, such research shows how innovation has impacted positively on the economic growth of nations.In order to understand the functioning of the National Innovation Systems in emerging countries (Mexico, Brazil and Chile), we performed a critical analysis of the approach, examining their application limitations and recognising the characteristics and interests of Latin American countries. Furthermore, we analysed the impact of innovation on economic growth in these countries. The aim of this paper is to analyse whether the differences in economic growth among Mexico, Chile and Brazil, are explained by gaps in levels of innovation.
M00|Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Trade and Its Contribution to the Proposed Logistics Hub in Jamaica|In order to objectively analyze contribution of logistic operations to Jamaica’s Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), we perform the Granger causality test. This test was used to determine the relationship among Gross Domestic Product (as a dependent variable) and Government Income, Trade, FDI inflow and the Exchange rate (as independent variables). The Granger causality test produced evidence of a bidirectional causality relationship which suggests that FDI’s influence on efficiency lies in the government relaxing its dependency on the mining industry for economic growth.
M00|Language Proficiency Capabilities among International Students in an International University Setting|In this current day and age, language proficiency and enthusiasm to learn new languages have risen because of several reasons entailing like study, work and business. This phenomenon is even more obvious in international universities where more than half the population of students schooling in that country is foreigners. In many cases, like in the case used for this study; North Cyprus universities, the language used to teach and learn is English language. This therefore entails that on average, almost all students already speak at least 2 languages wherein they speak their own dialects, or cultural languages, while using English language proficiently to communicate with others, learn, study, and write examinations. Thus, in researching this, the aim is to see the extent to which the students are bilingual, or multilingual. Our findings confirm that individual must live, or should have lived in a country in order to proficiently speak that country’s language and second, third, or fourth languages are learned during teenage years rather than in one’s childhood.
M00|Bank’s Regulatory Capital Buffer and Counter-cyclical Behavior – Empirical Analysis Based on China’s 18 Commercial Banks|This paper estimates the relationship between the Chinese business cycle and the regulatory capital buffers of China’s commercial banks, conducts empirical tests by using an unbalanced panel of 18 listed Chinese banks for the period 2005–2014. The results show that in China there is a robustly significant negative relationship between the economic cycle and bank capital buffers. Insignificance of coefficient of the total amount of loans shows that China’s commercial banks holding more capital buffer do not necessarily lead to a “credit crunch” phenomenon. Positive significant asset coefficient indicates the larger the size of the assets, the more inclined for China banks to hold more capital buffers, which is incompatible with “too big to fall” theory. The relationship between the loan loss provisions and capital buffers is not significant and this caused by Chinese commercial bank’s balance between the profit and cost perspective.
M00|Interconnection between Achieved Level of Return on Equity and Evaluation Scale of the Kralicek´S Model|A large number of diagnostic and predictive models exists using different or no statistical methodology. Often, diagnostic and predictive models differ in focus on branch of company, size of company, tradability of shares, country of usage, and focus on maturity of the market environment. Many of the models are widely used, however, their explanatory power is not known. Good examples of these models are those used in banks in the process of credit worthiness assessment. Some of them are created based on the Q-Test model. However, not only banks need to check the financial situation of companies but also basic users like suppliers, customers and other business partners. This article deals with Kralicek´s Q-Test which is one of the well-known financial diagnostic models in Europe including the Czech Republic. Its five grade rating scale reveals little about the level of prosperity of analysed companies. An assumption exists that grade 1 means excellent financial health. However what exactly does it mean? Can it be assumed that this means a negligible to zero probability of bankruptcy and simultaneously a sufficient or a high profitability? The question is what is the level of prosperity connected with the grades achieved on the Q-Test evaluation scale from1to 5. The prosperity of the company is uniquely linked to the return on equity. Another question is whether the QTest is able to express a level of prosperity and not only a level of creditworthiness of companies. That is why the research based on analysis of dataset of 1504 Czech companies was carried out. Following the research a scale was made of achieved return on equity (ROE). ROE levels are expressed by the following: implicit cost of equity (re), riskfree rate (rf), positive ROE, negative ROE and negative equity (or insolvency). The researched found that the Q-Test’s informative value is comparable to the predictive models based on statistic techniques.

M00|The Impact Of National Environment Of A Company On Its Financial Policy|Current business world is a subject of constant changes, which are caused by the growing instability of business environment, both in national and global scale. The paper deals with one of these two parts, namely with the national environment. It consists of factors and conditions that arise independently from the will of the company. The company can not influence the conditions; it can only adjust to them that means to use potential opportunities or avoid threats. The aim of the paper is to present those parts of the social surroundings, which have the most significant influence on the financial decisions of a company. Regarding this, we analyze the development of the basic macroeconomic indicators of the Slovak Republic.
M00|Financing Model Optimization of Lanzhou Yatai Group Real Estate Project|Lanzhou Yatai Group, as the first listed real estate companies, occupies absolute advantage in the competition of the industry. Especially because of Lanzhou National Economic Development District, Yaitai Group focuses Lanzhou new area asthe target of the advantages and great location. With the business development and planning, the company will also create Lanzhou Yaitai Group Technology Headquarters before 2016, and also will be followed by the huge business opportunities in the real estate industry driven by the financial industry, service industry, catering industry, and the education industry as well. At the same time, the asset number of investment companies in the new district has reached about 0.45 billion, so the vast number of these channels also makes traditional financing be in danger. Banking loans, equity financing, debt financing gradually are difficult to enable the company's rapid development growing so fast. Large-scale funding and financing inefficiencies of some large-scale projects also make the company's financial operations meeting some obstacles. In this paper, the author will analyze Yatai Group real estate financing process and the traditional financing channels to predict its financing risk prevention and the Group's real estate funds operating characteristics of the project. At the same time, we put forward the concept and characteristics of the real estate project financing. After financing inefficiencies of Lanzhou Yatai Group from 2011 to 2014, we make the analysis for real estate projects for the company and make a selection and optimization models. But also for the smooth development of real estate projects in Yatai Group, we provided a positive recommendation, which will become healthy and stable developments of the real estate industry in Gansu Province, and the development and construction of new district will be made as a good expectation.
M00|A Scenario Based Stochastic Time-Cost-Quality Trade-Off Model for Project Scheduling Problem|This paper formulates a new time–cost trade-off problem under some uncertainties for a multi-phase project. To do this, a new approach is proposed based on goal programming in compliance with scenario-based stochastic optimization formulation. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been extensively treated in the literature. Computational results show the applicability and usefulness of the proposed method.
M00|Banking Competition and Stability: Comprehensive Literature Review|The main aim of this paper is to define and propose the determining variables of banking competition by reviewing the literature on bank competition. Extensive review of the literature led to the identification of main variables that can be used to measure banking competition. They include market structure variables, contestability variables; inter industry variables, institutional variables and macro-economic condition variables. The exploration of these important variables began by reviewing and analysing two main schools of thought on bank competition. They include competition fragility and competition stability theories. The analysis of schools of though is followed by measures of competition such as HHI, Lerner index, Boone indicator and Z-score. The implications of this study are targeted for bank executives and government officials who are mainly concerned with improving the social well-fare of stakeholders.
M00|Predictors of Financial Distress and Bankruptcy Model Construction|The aim of this paper is to prepare the bankruptcy model construction. In the first part, multivariate discriminant analysis and its possibilities in deriving predictive models are characterized. The second part defines the possible indicators/predictors of financial distress of companies, which could be included in the new bankruptcy model. The model itself compares different views of factors that affect the companyâ€™s financial situation and contrasts the indicators that were constructed in the model in previous works (with special regard to the models in the transition economics). The result is the collection of 39 indicators to be verified in the next stage of the research project employing the multiple discriminant analysis methods to specify which of them to be included in the new model.
M00|Virtual World â€“ Physical World: What is the Real World?|The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential growth and use of Virtual World Technology. It is also concerned with the prospects for the routine use of Virtual Worlds in the workplace, the key aspects being the areas in which businesses are using Virtual World. The research design of this paper is descriptive. This research employs the multi-method data collection approach using surveys, where participants answered questions executed through interviews and questionnaires. The study is built on the combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis. All the respondents were familiar with the term Virtual World; and some with long tenures at their organisations, varying from 5 months to more than 22 years in the same field, provided valuable information. Virtual Worlds have created a new social and creative environment where new product development and virtual brands may be created. This paper points out directions, trends and provides indications that would form a sound basis for the necessary future research in Virtual Worlds. The findings of the study affirm that educational systems need to further progress and advance. Further value is that technologies that facilitate resources can be used effectively to promote lifelong learning, and support learner-centred approaches by being vastly available.
M00|Long Term Performance of Islamic Share Price for Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) in Malaysia: Evidence from Sharia-Compliant Companies Listed on the Malaysian Stock Exchange (2006-2010)|The objective of this study is to investigate the long-term (one to three year) performance of initial public offerings (IPOs) for sharia-compliant companies listed on the Malaysian Stock Exchange (MSE) for the period from 2006 till 2010. This study examines why some IPOs companies have a positive, and some IPOs companies have a negative long-term cumulative abnormal return (CAR). KLCI index is used as a benchmark for measuring long-term performance of IPOs for sharia-compliant companies. The empirical results show that the long-term performances for sharia-compliant companies are performed better (16.81 percent) than their benchmark for CAR equal-weight and the result for CAR value-weight show a slightly outperformed their benchmark (-0.07 percent). The results also indicate that CAR for equal-weight and value-weight of IPOs for sharia-compliant companies are significantly higher over performing by 14.58 percent and 4.11 percent respectively in the year 2006. While the results in 2007 (-1.34 percent) and 2008 (-3.43 percent) for valueâ€“weight are underperformed. This study also found that the underpricing, offer price, offer size, market type, trading/service industry, consumer product industry, property industry and REIT industry were statistically significant.
M00|The Labor Market in Romania and Interregional Disparities|The decrease of regional disparities represents one of the fundamental objectives of the regional development policy promoted by the EU; furthermore, the waves of enlargement of the EU deepened these differences even more. As a member state of the EU, Romania is actively involved in reducing the economic gaps by applying some regional development strategies and policies. The aim of this paper is to present the results of the labor market analysis from the perspective of the regional gaps, carried out based on some of its specific indicators. The sinuous evolution of the standard deviation for the analyzed indicators (except for the net average salary the standard deviation of which was permanently growing) revealed increase or decrease of the regional disparities for the entire period. However, in comparison to 1998, the regional gaps increased in 2013. The regional poles on the labor market have been as following: Bucharest-Ilfov region for the best values of the studied indicators, and Northeast region and Southwest Oltenia region for the lowest values.
M00|Extension to Brand Category, An Exploratory Investigation on Brand Extension Attitude|The purpose of this research study is to identify the impact of the brand category on brand extension attitude. The concept of brand extension is used for the marketing of any brand which is associated with the firm. Most of the large industries are using well-known names to launch a new product range to earn more profile for the organization as well as to make new position rather than other brands. This study especially identified that those brand who want to extend the product range of brands. Data was collected from a convenience sample of different brand buyers in the Faisalabad via surveys. The final sample consisted of 200 responses. Correlation, Linear regressions and ANOVA were used to test the hypotheses Results revealed that initial parent brand image has a positive relationship toward the brand extension attitude. Parent brand quality has a positive effect on brand extension attitude. Brand extension information toward the brand extension attitude is significantly impacted. The results provide some suggestion to marketers who want to expand their parent brand or launch fashion extension products.
M00|Dimensionalizing the Information and Communication Technology Adoption Construct|This study was conducted to determine the principal components of the information and communication technology (ICT) adoption practices in a developing country. A nineteen- item instrument was developed from extant current literature. Eight hundred and fifty copies of the structured questionnaire were administered to teaching and non-teaching staff of two faculties from the University of Port Harcourt and Rivers State University of Science and Technology, both located in Rivers State. Out of the number distributed, 435 were completed and returned. To determine the dimensions of ICT adoption, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted through the application of principal component analysis (PCA). From the analysis, three factors were extracted which account for 68.8% of the total variance. Thus, the researchers named the factors: virtual learning, e-learning and networking practices.
M00|Mathematical Techniques Employed in Planning a Construction Project: Case Study on the Construction of Retaining Walls|The importance of planning and designing in construction projects is most apparent during the implementation of the respective activities; whereas the implications that normally arise from poorly controlled activities often result in overspending, delays, substandard products or complete failure of the project. There is the need for a comprehensive plan during the execution and control of construction activities; this is more so when the project is considered to be complicated by a variety of objectives. By employing mathematical techniques to the planning and designing of a project, it is theorized that this will enhance the administration of those matters influencing the project parameters of cost, time, quality and scope. The idea is applied to the study of a real project that involves the construction of retaining walls, so to justify the key steps in planning, moreover to integrate the parameters via mathematical techniques so to define the project baseline plan: inferential statistics applied in quality assurance, linear programming applied in the work breakdown structure, and decision theory applied in the networking/scheduling.
M00|Exchange Rate Fluctuation and Tourism Sector Output in Nigeria|It has been a major source of contention among economics scholars, that tourism is a major driver of socio-economic development in the world and serves as a major source of revenue across countries. Hence, this paper examines the effects of exchange rate fluctuation on tourism sector output in Nigeria for the period of 1995 to 2015, using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), granger causality test and co-integration approach to ascertain this relationship. Results revealed that exchange rate fluctuation indeed has a significantly negative effect on tourism sector output in Nigeria, and that an increased fluctuation reduces the contribution of the tourism sector to GDP. The granger Causality test result showed that there is a unidirectional causality and long run relationship between contribution of tourism sector to GDP and the contribution of the Tourism sector to employment, real effective exchange rate, and the international number of tourist arrival. Among various recommendations in the study is for the government of Nigeria to review existing economic policies that affect the exchange rate fluctuation, as these some of this policies may be responsible for the consistent increase in exchange rate fluctuation , as these could substantially reduce the number of tourist arrival and tourism sector output.
M00|The Culture of Accountability in Italian Universities: Strengths and Weaknesses|This research work aims to highlight social reporting and accountability system in Italian universities. After cases analysis and content analysis, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of accountability in academic research and education. In this perspective, a brief analysis of the most relevant literature regarding the topic is finalized to address and to compare Italian experiences of social reporting. Effective accountability systems can indeed turn from tools into goals in public administrations, and in doing so reporting takes on a completely different meaning: it is a contribution to the social added value created by the university, an extra obligation to take towards stakeholders, a further service to engage in to strengthen democracy. The culture of accountability should be introduced and guided mainly by law, with legal requirements about deadlines, tools and goals, and supervised by third-party authorities. Further work is still needed to fully grasp measurement complexities and the potential lying in the evaluation of academic performance – especially with relation to sociality and sustainability – that plays an important role in national and international ranking systems.
M00|Econometric Study of Loan Classification of Commercial Banks in Bangladesh|This research intends to exemplify the loan classification of commercial banks in Bangladesh. The study area is selected on commercial banks of Bangladesh. After liberation, our banking business had been performing well but very recent time most of the banks face a problem of loan classification. So they loss some profit and fall under trouble for the loan run. We know that there are 56 commercial banks in Bangladesh. Deposit collection and lending are the main function of these banks. The study is conducted on only five commercial banks of Bangladesh. Last 10 years data of the selected banks are considered to accomplish the study. This research focuses on the major challenges of good loan that obstruct smooth development of Bangladesh. This study conveys the message that if the loan classification is reduced and good loan culture is created, the banking sector will flourish very fast way.
M00|Sectorial Performance and Inclusive Growth in Nigeria (1990 – 2013): An Assessment|This work assessed sectorial performance on inclusive growth in Nigeria for the period 1990 – 2013. The study was necessitated by the fact that the economy is often said to be growing but such growth is not inclusive in the real sense of it. Many Nigerians are still living below the poverty line. The study made use of secondary data in its analysis. Six explanatory variables (Agricultural Sector GDP, Oil and Gas GDP, Telecommunication sector GDP, Manufacturing sector GDP, Financial institutions sector GDP and electricity sector GDP) were specified and used to establish a relationship with Human Development Index and Gross Domestic Product Per Capita using the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) approach. Other tests carried out include: stationary, counteraction and Granger causality tests. The study found that the selected explanatory variables have no significant relationship with Gross Domestic Product Per Capita. While only Agricultural Sector GDP and Telecommunication sector GDP have significant relationship with Human Development Index, other variables are not statistically significantly at 5% level. Based on the findings the work concludes that the above selected sectors of the economy have not contributed significantly to the development of the Nigerian economy. The researcher recommends among others that financial sector services to the real sector should be sustainable to stimulate economic activities in a manner that creates linkages across economic value chains that will assure development in the long run.
M00|Factors Determining the Choice of Health Care of Textile and Engineering Industrial Workers in Coimbatore|Industrial workers constitute only a segment of general population and the factors that influence the health of the population also apply equally to industrial workers. The present study would bring out the availability and adequacy of health facilities in the urban Coimbatore. Therefore, the study of the people’s perception of health care services would indicate the line of improvement to be made in the health care services in future. Coimbatore is one of the most industrially developed Districts in Tamil Nadu and has the pride of being called the “Manchester of South India”. The data collected from both the textile and engineering industries in Coimbatore city was 1447 employees. It is found that workers who have been born and brought up in urban areas have shown higher tendency to avail private health care services (81%) than those workers whose nativity status is rural areas. Obviously, the reverse pattern is noticed among the sample workers in the case of government health services. The chi-square results between the nativity status and workers’ choice of health care services is found to be highly significant (p
M00|Project Leadership in Oil and Gas Industry: An Empirical Investigation in Kuwait|This paper examines the major findings of a research project, analysing the leadership style of project managers in Kuwait with focus on oil and gas industry. The main objective is to identify the leadership style of project managers applying a model of intellectual, emotional and managerial competence (IQ, EQ, and MQ, respectively). The leadership styles are identified and the results indicate some differences in leadership behaviour of project managers compared to Western countries.
M00|Risk Premium and Its Effect on Bank’s Non-Performing Loans|The present outcomes of risk premium have started the discussion over the Bank’s nonperforming loans and its determinants. Banking sector is taking active part in different fields of life such as financing, business transactions and loan provisions. Therefore, it is very important for the management to make good decisions relating to the non-performing loans of the bank. In the current study, we have conducted an analysis in order to examine the risk premium and its effect on bank’s non–performing loans in 8 western countries of the world based on GDP over a period from 1998 to 2010. A conceptual model has been developed for this purpose and panel data analysis has been performed. Key finding have been explained for the financial expert to make the future decisions. Our result shows that there is significant relationship between risk premium and bank’s non-performing loans.
M00|A Hybrid Clustering Method Using Balanced Scorecard and Data Envelopment Analysis|This paper introduces a new hybrid clustering method using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Balanced Scorecard (BSC) methods. DEA cannot identify its’ input and output itself, and it is a major weakness of the DEA. In the proposed method, this gap is resolved by integrating DEA with BSC. Some decision-making units (DMUs) needed in DEA method, in compliance with some inputs and outputs is the major drawback of this integration. To deal with this disadvantage, the proposed method selects the most important strategic factors, attained from the BSC method. These data considered to be the input data for the DEA method to calculate relative closeness (RC) of each DMU to the ideal one. Plotting the screen diagram regarding RC index leads us to the final clustering method. Finally, computational results show the applicability and usefulness of the method.
M00|The Risk and Countermeasure Study of Chinese Enterprises Cross-Border M&A in the New Period|Pursuing Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) allows companies access to more markets, achieves higher revenue and influence, and generates new opportunities to exchange knowledge, thus, becoming more flexible and absorptive to new knowledge, technology and change in general. At the same time, they expose themselves to higher risks inherent in operating in the foreign country environment. This study investigates how risks affect M&A and operations in foreign countries. Based on a critical literature review, we have conceptualized M&A and risk relationships. In these terms, both external and internal risks were investigated. The investigation was performed on a macro and micro economic levels. The databases examined encompass Dealogic, Thomson Reuters and M&A Reports provided by EMIS PRO. The country risks of our study model include political risks, financial risks, and economic risks. A qualitative study encompassing descriptive analysis was utilized. The theoretical findings suggest that country risks have a partial influence on M&A deals. However, because many countries with different external obstacles still have significant acquisitions level, this implies that when making a decision of merger or acquisitions as conceptualized in our study, firms do not consider political, financial and economic country risks. Chinese M&A was explored, and it appears that political instability during 2013 – 2015 years decreased the level of M&A. The current finding can be explained by understanding that acquisitions’ level implies the effect of the decision made to enter the market. As long as the risk does not occur in the host country, M&A level remains unaffected. Given this, we can conclude that the state should modify the existing policy regarding M&A. The decision of firms is rarely shaped by the risks existing in the country they plan to make the investment or purchase any company. The findings of the study are a signal for national governments to establish policies that would either ease M&A in their countries or provide sufficient support for their firms to go abroad and perform successfully.
M00|Capital Structure and Financial Control: The Effect of Leverage on Project Management|Amplification characteristics are leveraging financial system which has a small risk of capability. However, the efficiency of this ability is the two-ways result and will also pose a lot of risks. Therefore, taking positive measures to strengthen the management of the financial system leverage feature in project management becomes very important. This paper describes the financial system leverage to bring the main problem through the lever amplification (nature) analysis of the characteristics, bi-amplified comparative analysis of profit and loss and bi-amplification characteristics of the risk analysis. Based on the above analysis, we put forward countermeasures about the management of leverage properties of a financial system from the application of project management.
M00|Developing a Path of Influence: Decision Support System (DSS) Capabilities Impact on Firm Performance|The study emphasizes the importance of Decision support systems (DSS) for corporate performance. Prior studies have been reviewed to validate theories that explain how Decision support systems (DSS) affect corporate performance. Decision support systems (DSS) provides information that is valuable to take decisions and reflects current economic, and financial state of the company: efficiency, output rates, information on the effect of different events, that relate to the impact that the employees’ decision has on the performance of other departments. Furthermore, greater management information system capability leads to a higher degree of strategic performance. These and many other factors are suggested to be critical features of DSS that have a direct influence on the financial and strategic performance of companies. This paper uses resource based view in order to explain the importance of DSS capabilities and their direct influence on firm performance. In other words, the main idea behind the paper involves the analysis of company performance based on how information system capabilities are used. For this purpose, this paper formulates conceptual framework which explains the link of DSS capabilities to absorptive capacity through the interaction of market access competency, integrated related competency, functionality related competency. Finally, the influence of DSS capabilities is described in terms of their influence on companies market based and operation performance.
M00|Cultural Environment as a Potential for Society Renewal|The renewal of society is a broad term in its original sense but in the context of the article, it is linked with issues of depopulation, territorial polarization, and shrinking processes in Latvia. One of the “hot points” for local governments has been finding ways to attract people and promote the development of rural territories for the past decades. Both theoretical and practical solutions for maintaining rural society and promoting the renewal of society are the development of the cultural environment. Cultural activities directly affect public participation, cooperation among the population, the development of creativity, and promotion of inclusive society, health and society renewal. As recent investigations show, cultural environment is broadly developing in rural territories of Latvia. The research of cultural environment as a potential for the renewal of society of Latvia is a novelty due to the beginning of the National Research Program for the period 2014–2017 funded by the Government of Latvia (EKOSOC LV projects 5.2.4., 5.2.8.). The aim of the article is to analyze cultural environment as a potential for renewal of society in rural territories of Latvia. The research object is planning and development documents of local governments, different agents of rural territories. The results of the study reveal development of cultural environment in rural regions in Latvia. However, these practices are fragile yet and need support. They can bring forth new social and economic structures and serve as promoters of the smart development of rural territories in Latvia. For this reason, local governments should create their strategies to appreciate and support cultural activities as their potential for renewal of rural society.
M00|The centre of gravity of international trade has been shifting eastwards; 2 of 3 largest economies come from Asia. It witnessed 6.9% growth in 2014, much above the 2.6% on the global level. Credit goes in full to continent’s hard working population. It is presumed that 90% of the global growth within the next 10 – 15 years will be generated outside Europe; the majority of it in Asia. By 2050 a half of the global GDP will be generated there. Asia represents the global model in promoting R&D and innovations; it has become the key trading partner of the EU, with strategic partners in China, India, Japan, and South Korea. Numerous EU´s FTAs are being negotiated, hopefully eliminating remaining barriers to trade. The contribution focuses on prospects which are emanating for Slovakia and the Western liberal economic model vis-a-vis state control. It discusses the China’s economic downturn as a risk but also as a new opportunity. Slovak prosperity is vitally interlinked with the performance of export. It disproportionately depends on the EU. Out of the first eight countries within Slovakia‘s negative trade balance statistics, six come from Asia. Thus Asia should imperatively facilitate diversification of Slovak economy. The paper attempts to establish a frank and open picture of the state of the game, with the right balance between theory and authentic professional experience of the author. It assesses key Slovak strengths and weaknesses, identifies opportunities and offers a “food for thought”|No abstract is available for this item.
M00|Development of the Tax System in the Slovak Republic after 1993 and Prospects for Tax Harmonization as A Member of the European Union|The emergence of taxes and the tax system has historically been associated with the development of the state. The tax system of Slovak Republic passed in 1993 after several major reforms. Taxes are economic and financial instruments that the government affects not only the functioning of economic entities but also households and individuals. Taxes are categorized in several ways, most often regarding related taxes for the taxpayer, on direct and indirect taxes. Tax systems are made up of elements which include: tax quota, tax mix, tax structure and others. One of the most important macroeconomic indicators of the tax is tax quota. This indicator represents the share of taxes in GDP, and it is used in international comparison. An important and often discussed topic is tax harmonization in the European Union, which aims to bring member states together and create a strong, economically, politically and culturally unified group of countries. The aim of harmonization is to protect the common market, the removal of fiscal frontiers in the European Union, focusing mainly on direct and indirect taxes.
M00|Building of Social Capital among Workers in Project Teams and Its Effect on Knowledge Sharing: a Saudi Arabia’s Cultural Context|In the study, we aim to explain how higher levels of knowledge sharing between project workers are attained by companies. The paper creates a research model that ties social capital aspects to tacit knowledge sharing. In that way, the paper suggests on what companies should focus in order to secure a higher team or firm performance through improved knowledge sharing. Social ties, trust, shared vision, reciprocity and shared language are identified as the specific social factors that are key when it comes to achieving satisfactory levels of tacit knowledge sharing. Additionally, we explore how knowledge sharing process is facilitated through Saudi Arabia network system rooted in national culture. The study is designed to suggest ways for organizations to enhance their tacit knowledge sharing. The paper employs a literature review methodology and contributes to the theory of knowledge management and organizational behavior.
M00|Labour Force Participation of Cameroonians in Informal Sector|In this paper, we analyze the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) of informal workers in Cameroon. We also estimate the effects of some determining factors on LFP decisions. We use data from the Cameroon National Institute of Statistics (CNIS), a three-wave panel obtained respectively in 2001, 2005 and 2010 for a sample of individuals in the labour market. The sample data of the national population is representative. All information’s on demographic, socioeconomic and employment characteristics used in this study are provided by the CNIS database. It is particularly remarkable that the LFPR in informal sector increased substantially during latest years, particularly those of young workers. This rise in the LFPR is principally explained by the significant increase in the labour-market activity of the urban younger generation which has been improved by migration. Estimating a simple model of LFP with logistic methodology, we find that poverty, age and urbanization are significantly related with LFPR of informal labour market in Cameroon.
M00|People as a Source of Competitive Advantage During Recruitment and Retention of Senior Managers in Financial Services Sectors in Laos|The focus of the paper is to identify the importance of recruiting and retaining senior management in the banking industry in Laos. Both quantitative and qualitative research methods were adopted to collect data from three banks in Laos. Interview section: the questions were to explore the understanding of concepts of HRM, perspectives towards HRM about recruitment and retention. Questionnaire section: part one – demographics data, part two attitudes towards HRM processes recruitment and retention. Findings: HRM plays a critically important role in banks in keeping their competitive advantage; lack of development and implementation of HRM practices and policies to recruit and retain the right people.
M00|Estimating Value Added Tax Gap in Turkey|As an important issue in the fiscal structure of a country, tax gap is defined as the difference between tax burden that the taxpayer should face and the amount actually paid. In this study, tax gap was evaluated by the framework of the Value Added Tax. The reason behind this choice, i.e. Value Added Tax Gap (VAT Gap) is to make an effort to evaluate the efficiency of the tax administration, the compliance of the taxpayers and the relationship between policy gap and the compliance gap. With this aim, VAT Gap and the various methods to calculate this gapwere examined. Furthermore, based on the reports by the European Commission, VAT Gap in Turkey for 1993-2014 period were estimated and evaluated by employing thetopdown method.
M00|The aim of this paper is to provide the critical analysis of the potential determinants of FDI. Review of the literature led to the development of research model which provides the most potential determinants of FDI. The importance of FDI is considered to be important for both developed and developing countries. In this regard, the potential determinants of FDI which have been identified as a result of literature review include market size, labour cost and productivity, political risk, infrastructure, economic growth and tax. Nearly all of these variables are reported to have an indecisive relationship with FDI, that is to say, some papers show a positive correlation between variables while other present negative or no relationship at all|No abstract is available for this item.
M00|In this article, we analyse the argument that lack of holistic approach in planning and research have contributed to the lack of sustainable development in Africa. We base our discussion on the speech by the special advisor on the national consultation on the post-2015 development as it relates to Uganda and other African Context (held on 8th August 2015). The advisor was convinced that there is a need to adopt a more integrated and comprehensive planning approach to reinventing traditional development tools, and meeting persistent and emerging challenges. Efforts must be made to start putting in place the practical measures, markers, mechanisms and partnerships that make sustainable advancements possible. Scholars and managers are called upon to take the challenge of demonstrating how the adoption of a holistic approach in planning, and research can contribute to sustainable development|No abstract is available for this item.
M00|Beyond Bologna: The Sustainable University Enterprises Partnership|There is a necessity to understand the effects of the globalization on the labor market concerning job markets. The economic and cultural growth and the ability of renewal are the fundamental objectives of every country, and they should also be the main objective of developing and in-transition countries. This is, particularly important in European Eastern countries. The article analyses university-enterprise partnership projects of the European Union. A series of recommendations has been elaborated for Higher Education Institutions, in particular, European Universities intending to progress further with the critical dimension of University-Enterprise cooperation as one of the key elements to enhance their competitiveness, and contribute to EU policy and activities in this area. These recommendations will be based on the findings of the online survey, the case studies and the discussions between all stakeholders of the European Conference held in Bonn on 18-19 June 2007. The qualitative effectiveness of the “higher education product” depends conclusively on the human components – teacher, in the first place, their behavior, competence, and attitudes.
M00|Challenges of International Migration in a Globalized World: Implications for Europe|The research conducted aims to identify and assess the interdependencies between international migration and labour market outcomes, focusing both on emigration and immigration effects on sending, and destination countries, as well as on economic (labour force) and non-economic (humanitarian, refugees) migration. International migration as one of the most important frontiers of globalization represents a major challenge globally, with significant economic consequences, especially for Europe, where large migrant flows have emerged in the context of European integration. Moreover, recently there is an increased waves of refugees and asylum seekers targeting Germany, Austria, Sweden or Turkey as main destination countries coming through Eastern and Central Mediterranean or Western Balkans routes. The analysis is based on developing various double-log fixed and random effects models, as well as dynamic models, using a panel structure that covers five main EU destination countries (Germany, Austria, Sweden, Italy and Spain) and three New EU Member States since 2007 and 2013 (Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia). We used a complex set of indicators (national accounts – GDP total, per capita, per person, employed; labour market – employment, unemployment, wages, secondary and tertiary education; migration specific data – immigration flows and stocks, asylum seekers and refugees, emigrant stocks), compiled during 2000-2014. Moreover, we used a SEM model (Structural Equations Modelling) to better capture the labour market impacts of international migration for the selected EU countries. The models are processed through OLS, GLS, and MLE methods, as well as by using panel corrected standard errors, and are completed within and out-of-sample predictions. The results show that immigration flows have important economic consequences leading to significant changes in labour market performances (slight decrease in employment rates and wage levels), which largely vary from one country to another. On the long-run, the negative effects of immigration tend to predominate. From the emigration perspective, the findings show some positive effects of labour emigration on sending countries, by enabling to upgrade the living standards for those remaining, mainly through remittances. Still, there is a negative impact generated on the size and structure of internal labour force and, on the long run, this is proving to be extremely negative (slow GDP per capita growth rates).
M00|Womens Migration Processes from Georgia|Purpose of the paper is to study the territorial movement of population in line with predictable and unpredictable changes following world globalization, with its economic and social-political outcomes having become a severe problem for Georgia. World Bank database, materials of Ministry of Resettlement and Refugees of Georgia, IOMs assessment mission report Review in Georgia and data of Geostat (National Statistics Office of Georgia) were used in the study. Methods of statistical observation, grouping and analysis were used to determine the migrants distribution from Georgia according to age and sex. Scientific aim of the paper is to throw light upon the migration process of women from Georgia in political, economic and social respects and identify the trends and advantages and disadvantages of this process. The paper notes that. Georgia, in respect of migration, is a country of origin, destination and transit. Traditionally, mostly men made up the labour or study migration currents from Georgia. Since the 1990s, the picture has changed. As the statistics of 2014 suggest, 65 females area encountered for every 100 migrants. This ratio changes according to womens age groups. In economic respect, womens migration from Georgia is justified, as money sent by them is the means of living for their families and plays a role in overcoming property. Recently, many young girls have left Georgia. Studies demonstrate that migration-prone attitude is quite strong among young people. Such a situation needs much consideration and contemplation by every citizen, whole society and government of the country, as Georgia is going to face severe demographic, social-economic, political, national security and other problems. The state must improve the living standards in the country through job generation, better compensation and gender equality on the labour market and less migrants as an ultimate aim.
M00|A Case of Cultural Conflict, Centering around «Communal Computer» at a University in Japan as a Transcultural Contact Zone|In this case study, a conflict in the concept of «communal computer» is to be reviewed and analyzed in numerous internet messages that were exchanged for about three months in 2015, and the actual setting up by one of the actors that caused the fatal damage to one of the actors computer. These actors cultural backgrounds include Chinese, Japanese and Americans. The scene takes place at a Japanese university; a task was to set up a computer to be used for «communal use.» The central argument is about the transculturation of the «contact zone (Pratt, 1992)» in which logics of three cultures land on the appropriateness through a case study of conflict. Questions include, «how three subjugated and dominant cultural players show the modes of the concept of «communal property,» and «how they appropriate their concepts.» Through knowing different modes of appropriateness, or «what they make it mean (Ibid. p.7),» modes to a coherent peace can be suggested. In other words, all three aspects, not one, should be taken into consideration when it comes to «an agreement.» It appeared that a Japanese professor in computer science claims «communal property» usage is legitimized by financial ownership, so authorized persons share the password. A Chinese believes that a «communal» computer should be available to anyone at large, so that there should be no restrictions on anyone, thus, a password was posted on the monitor for a «communal» e-mail address. A professor with an American cultural value claims that it is a violation of law unless the contract is made to cover a multiple number of users. Thus, the concept, «communal property» plays in ownership, authorizing decisions, access, and usage specified in the contract. The author suggests, all these aspects should be informed thoroughly to actors prior to the installation of a communal computer.
M00|The Impact of Government Debt on the Economic Growth of Ghana: A Time Series Analysis from 1990-2015|In this study we investigate the impact of government debt on the economic growth of Ghana adopting the methodology of the simple Ordinary Least Squares with data spanning from 1990 to 2015. Ghana has unfortunately found itself in the tragic situation of high external government debt which has led to high dependency on aid and other loans to support its development. These aids and loans have seen the debt of Ghana rise steadily over the years. As a result of the Heavily-Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) which was presented by the IMF and World Bank in 1999, Ghana was judged to be a HIPC with unsustainable debt enabling the country to benefit from debt relief. We investigate the impact of government debt (both external and domestic) by testing three related models at the domestic and external levels including the general growth of the Ghanaian economy. In constructing our dataset, we build on the study of many scholars including a substantial amount of new materials from both primary and secondary data sources being Ministry of Finance (MOF) or Treasury Latest actual data: Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM), Ghana and World Bank. The research findings revealed that there is a negative relationship between debt (domestic and external) and growth in the economy of Ghana and recommend among others that government debt borrowing should be discouraged while increasing the revenue base through tax reform programs is encouraged.
M00|Effects of Teacher Training on Secondary Teachers Mathematical Content Knowledge in Dhaka, Bangladesh|In Bangladesh, there are improvements in secondary education by quantitative indicators but the satisfactory picture is remained far from the quality. The gross deficiency in teaching includes one of the main reasons for poor quality of secondary education. There are higher failure rates in Mathematics subject in Secondary School Certificate examination in the last consecutive years. An extensive review of research has shown that teachers account to a large extent for student learning and achievement gains. For secondary teacher education in Bangladesh, there is a one-year long training program named as Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.). Therefore, the study sought to find out the effectiveness of B.Ed. training program on mathematics teachers content knowledge as a mean of improving secondary school mathematics in Bangladesh. The study was conducted among 38 mathematics teachers (trained and untrained) selected from 16 secondary schools of Dhaka city using survey method. Teachers content knowledge was measured through an assessment test and classroom teaching observation. The study found that though the B.Ed. trained mathematics teachers (96.3%) possess better content knowledge than their counterpart (91.7%) but no relationship between teachers personal characteristics and their content knowledge in mathematics. This is the first study to investigate the effectiveness of secondary teacher education program within Bangladesh. It contributes important insights about secondary teacher education that can be used to inform the professional development of the secondary school mathematics teachers in Bangladesh.
M00|Interactional Justice and Employees Commitment to Supervisor in Nigerian Health Sector|This research was designed to study the relationship between interactional justice and employees commitment to supervisor in Nigerian health sector. A self-administered survey questionnaire was sent out to a sample size of 103 employees, resulting in 99 responses out of which 13 copies of the questionnaire were not statistically usable. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used for data analysis, and our findings reveal that employees who have received fair informational and interpersonal treatments commit themselves to their supervisors. We discovered that the degree of influence exerted by interpersonal justice on employees commitment to supervisor was stronger than that of informational justice. We concluded that employees attach themselves to supervisors that are fair in communication and relationship. The fairness of interaction and communication boost employees confidence, impacting positively on employees commitment to supervisor and making employees see themselves as part owners in the organization. We, therefore, recommended that organizational managers or supervisors should communicate and relate properly with employees, in order to satisfy their customers and other stakeholders.

This research is prepared primarily to have clear and real life ideas about the position of Eastland Insurance Company in insurance sector of Bangladesh. The research focuses on the major challenges of insurance industry in Bangladesh that obstruct smooth development of Bangladesh. This study conveys the message that if the insurance companies are operated very smoothly, the insurance sector will flourish very fast way.
M00|Constructing a framework for empirical research of foreign direct investment (FDI) and fdi intent|Foreign Direct Investment has been linked with an extensive number of positive consequences both on micro and macro level. Still, firms of emerging economies have difficulties attracting FDI. Part of the problem may also lie in the lack of FDI intent on behalf of the firm management to attain FDI. In this study, we aim to construct a framework that would use for a future empirical research of FDI attraction and FDI intent on the organizational level. A systematic approach is described providing a strong foundation for an empirical study soon to come. The process encompasses research design, development of the measurement tool, data collection, preparation and analysis-planning phase. Additionally, we suggest the potential findings and benefits of research following the framework developed.
M00|The Impact of Facebook Upon Social Skills of Young People ? a Business Employment Perspective|Social networks can be successfully used to promote any business, being developed in such a way to allow both individuals and business organizations to interact one with another. Companies may obtain important information about users of social networks which will help to a better understanding of their profile and needs and, consequently, to build their marketing and sales strategies.
