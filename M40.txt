M40|Economic and regulatory aspects of crypto-assets|TIn this study, we investigate the economic characteristics of bitcoin and similar crypto-assets. Following an introduction to the blockchain protocol, the role of exchanges and of digital wallet providers, we consider the regulatory measures adopted in various jurisdictions. Lastly, we examine the accounting and prudential aspects related to crypto-assets, of which significant uncertainties still remain. The paper provides a taxonomy of crypto-assets, and describes the basic features of the initial coin offerings (ICOs) and related aspects. The literature shows that bitcoin, and similar crypto-assets, do not fully fall within the category of money and financial instruments. This class of digital tokens, based on a permissionless distributed ledger technology (DLT), is highly volatile and absent of intrinsic value. The instability of their price, which is often undetermined, must be considered when evaluating these instruments from an accounting and prudential standpoint.
M40|Embedded supervision: how to build regulation into blockchain finance|The spread of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in finance could help to improve the efficiency and quality of supervision. This paper makes the case for embedded supervision, ie a regulatory framework that provides for compliance in tokenised markets to be automatically monitored by reading the market's ledger, thus reducing the need for firms to actively collect, verify and deliver data. After sketching out a design for such schemes, the paper explores the conditions under which distributed ledger data might be used to monitor compliance. To this end, a decentralised market is modelled that replaces today's intermediary-based verification of legal data with blockchain-enabled data credibility based on economic consensus. The key results set out the conditions under which the market's economic consensus would be strong enough to guarantee that transactions are economically final, so that supervisors can trust the distributed ledger's data. The paper concludes with a discussion of the legislative and operational requirements that would promote low-cost supervision and a level playing field for small and large firms.
M40|Ownership Structure, Board of Directors and Firm Performance: Evidence from Taiwan| Purpose Using a dataset of listed firms domiciled in Taiwan, the main aim of this paper is empirically assess the effects of ownership structure, board of directors on firm value. Design/methodology/approach Using a sample of Taiwanese listed firms from 1997 to 2015, the study uses a panel estimation to exploit both the cross-section and time-series nature of the data. Furthermore, a 2SLS regression model is used as robustness test to mitigate the endogeneity issue. Findings Our main results show that the higher the proportion of independent directors, the smaller the board size, and together with a two-tier board system and no CEO duality, the stronger the firmâ€™s performance. With respect to ownership structure, block-holdersâ€™ ownership, institutional ownership, foreign ownership and family ownership, are all positively related to firm value. Practical implications Although the Taiwanese corporate governance reform concerning the independent director system which is mandatory only for newly-listed companies is a successful, the regulatory authority should require all listed companies to appoint independent directors to further enhance the Taiwanese corporate governance. Originality/value First, unlike much of the previous literature on western developed countries, this study examines the effects of corporate governance mechanisms on firm performance in a newly-industrialised country, Taiwan. Second, while a number of studies use a single indicator of firm performance this study examines both accounting-based and market-based firm performance. Third, this study addresses the endogeneity issue between corporate governance factors and firm performance by using two stage least squares (2SLS) estimation, and details the econometric tests for justifying the appropriateness of using 2SLS estimation
M40|Breaking it Down: Competitive Costs of Cost Disclosures|Does decomposing cost of goods sold entail significant competitive costs? We examine this question using a relaxation of disaggregated manufacturing cost disclosure requirements in Korea. Our survey evidence indicates managers perceive these disclosures to provide a competitive edge to competitors. Using archival data, we find firms with distinctive cost structures and high market shares are less willing to disclose, consistent with a desire to protect cost-leadership advantages embedded in production and sourcing. Firms experience higher gross profits and lower liquidity after withholding manufacturing cost details, suggesting these disclosure decisions involve trading off competitive costs (and not managersâ€™ self-interests) against capital market benefits. At the aggregate level, industries with more nondisclosing firms subsequently experience greater profitability dispersion, suggesting uncertainty about competitorsâ€™ cost of goods sold helps drive the widely studied performance dispersion observed within industries.
M40|Thinking infrastructure and the organization of markets: the creation of a legal market for cannabis in Colorado|This chapter explores the ways in which a large-scale accounting system known as Marijuana Enforcement Tracking Reporting and Compliance (METRC) contributes to the construction and organization of a new market for recreational cannabis in the US state of Colorado. Mobilizing the theoretical lenses provided by the literature on market devices on the one hand, and infrastructure on the other, we identify and unpack a changing relationship between accounting and state control through which accounting and markets unfold. We describe this movement in terms of a distinction between knowing devices and thinking infrastructures. In the former, we show, regulators and other authorities perform the market by making it legible for the purpose of intervention, taxation and control. In the latter, thinking infrastructures, an ecology of interacting devices is made and remade by a variety of intermediaries, disclosing the boundaries and possibilities of the market, and constituting both opportunities for innovation and domination through “protocol”.
M40|The Effect of Corporate Tax Planning On Firm Value|Objective – This research aims to empirically examine the effect of tax planning on firm value. The population of this research consists of manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) from 2014 to 2016. Methodology/Technique – This research uses 3 recent years and uses variables not used in previous research. The 43 respondents were chosen using purposive sampling. The hypotheses were tested using multiple regressions with Eviews program to determine the relationship between each independent variable to firm value. Findings – The empirical results show that tax planning that is measured by the cash effective tax rate has a negative effect on firm value, while tax planning measured by effective cash rate and tax savings has no effect on firm value. Novelty – The study recommends the need for firms to institute more robust tax planning practices that will help reduce their effective tax liabilities and therefore improve their overall value. Firms that engage in better tax planning practices are likely to get higher firm value. Type of Paper: Empirical.
M40|The Determinants of Islamic Social Reporting Disclosure in Indonesia|Objective – The purpose of this research is to identify the relationship between corporate performance, Good Corporate Governance (GCG), and corporate characteristics on Islamic Social Reporting disclosure in Indonesia. Methodology/Technique – A quantitative approach is applied in this research. The sample of this study consists of companies that were consistently listed on the Jakarta Islamic Index (JII) from 2012 to 2017. A purposive sampling method with certain criteria was employed to produce a total of 72 samplings. Partial Least Square (PLS) was also used to analyse the data. Findings – The results of this research indicate that corporate performance has a positive and significant effect on ISR disclosure, GCG has a positive and significant effect on ISR disclosure, and corporate characteristics have a negative and insignificant effect on ISR disclosure. Novelty – Islamic Social Reporting is the answer and solution to the needs of the interested parties concerned with the company's financial statements. ISR becomes a very important thing for the reputation and performance of Islamic financial institutions. Islamic financial institutions that succeed in revealing their ISR value will be perceived as a reliable entity by the Muslim community in channelling their fund. Type of Paper: Empirical.
M40|The Influence of Dividend Policy and Income Tax on Income Smoothing|Objective – This research aims to obtain the empirical evidence on the influence of dividend policy, income tax, firm size, profitability, and leverage on income smoothing. Methodology/Technique – In this research, income smoothing is proxied with the Eckel index and logistic regression is used to test the hypothesis. The research population consists of non-financial companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange from 2013 to 2016. The sampling method used in this research is purposive sampling. The number of companies selected is 79 with 316 data. Findings – The results show that dividend policy, income tax, profitability, and leverage all have an influence on income smoothing. Meanwhile, firm size has no significant influence on income smoothing. Novelty – These findings are consistent with a firm's dividend policy and income tax having an incremental impact on income smoothing behavior. Type of Paper: Empirical.
M40|The Effect of Corporate Governance on Financial Performance in Non-Financial LQ-45 Firms Listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange from 2012 to 2017|Objective – This research is conducted in order to determine what factors in corporate governance affect the financial performance of a firm. Methodology/Technique – Financial performance, as the dependent variable, is measured by Return on Asset (ROA), while the independent variables (corporate governance) are measured using Board Independence, Board Size, Dividend, Firm Size, and Financial Leverage. The sampling method used in this research is purposive sampling. The requirements for the sample of this research are the non – financial firms included in LQ-45 from 2012 to 2017 that publish annual reports that are available to the public. The research method used in this paper is a quantitative method. Panel data analysis technique and E-views tools were also used. Findings – The results indicate that firm size and percentage of board independence has no effect on financial performance, while board size, dividends, and financial leverage all effect financial performance. Novelty – The study adds to the literature of corporate government and firm performance in emerging countries. Type of Paper: Empirical.
M40|Company Characteristics, Corporate Governance, Audit Quality Impact on Earnings Management|Objective - The purpose of this research is to empirically examine how company characteristics, corporate governance and audit quality affect earnings management. Methodology/Technique - The population used for this research is manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange between 2013 and 2015. The sampling method used in this research is purposive sampling. 64 companies are examined, with 192 items of data being obtained. Finding - This research also uses statistical testing through a multiple regression. The results show that return on assets, financial leverage, free cash flow, and sales growth all have an influence on earnings management. Meanwhile, other variables such as managerial ownership, institutional ownership, board size, the presence of an audit committee, firm size, and audit quality have no significant effect on earnings management. Novelty - In this research, company characteristics are proxied with the return on assets, financial leverage, firm size, free cash flow, and sales growth, while corporate governance is proxied with managerial ownership, institutional ownership, board size, and the presence of an audit committee. Type of Paper - Empirical.
M40|Determinants of Personal Financial Literacy among Young Adults in Malaysian Accounting Firms|Objective - In the twenty-first century, financial competencies are an essential tool in understanding the connection between financial behaviour and knowledge of individual financial problems. High financial knowledge may encourage young adults to carry less debt, increase their wealth and have a better financial retirement plan. According to Wolla (2017), less than one-third of youths have basic financial knowledge. This will have an impact to their lifelong financial well-being. Hence, this research intends to explore the personal financial literacy of young adults in Malaysian accounting firms. Methodology/Technique - The study examines 150 young working adults between the ages of 18-35 years old, working in accounting firms in Malacca, Malaysia. Stratified sampling and convenience sampling techniques were used to distribute questionnaires. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple regression analyses were also employed. Findings - The empirical findings show that geographical locations and family characteristics are significantly related to the personal financial literacy of young adults in accounting firms in Malacca. However, financial education and financial experience do not influence young adults in their financial decision making. Novelty - The results of this study suggest that the relevant authority should take an appropriate action to improve the financial well-being of young adults in Malacca, Malaysia.
M40|Enablers of the Neo-Liberal State? Exploring the Role of the International Accounting-Consulting Firms in Australia Since the Mid-1980s|This Discussion Paper is part of a wider contemporary history project examining the growth and role of the commercial consultancy and contractor market within the public sector in Australia since the neo-liberal turn in the mid-1980s. The paper considers evidence as to whether the role of the big international accounting firms within the public sector was â€˜neo-liberalâ€™ in nature, either as a result of ideological and policy advocacy or technical facilitation of pre-set neo-liberal directions. The extent to which these firms (currently PwC, KPMG, EY and Deloitte) are seen as integrated or fragmented organisations has some bearing on this question. Hence, the first quarter of the paper sketches the historical broadening-out of the firms from accounting to a wider range of services, the debate over whether they have functioned as global corporations or networked partnerships, the rationalisation of the leading firms over the past three decades and the relatively sparse commentary from political scientists about the significance of the firms and other commercial consultants for public policy and administration in Australia. The second quarter of the paper points to the role of the firms in regard to two markers of a neo-liberal policy direction: privatisation of government business enterprises and particular tax policies and practices. Drawing on qualitative sources, it argues that while the firms made some contribution to the agenda-setting process in both areas, in tacitly (privatisation) or explicitly (taxation) signalling their broad policy preferences, they played a more fundamental role in detailed policy formulation and implementation â€“ in easing the path of privatisation and corporate tax minimisation. The second half of the paper summarises original research by the author in regard to official public listings of consultancies and contracts at the national government level. This quantitative analysis yields important findings: that overall spending on the firms displayed a long-term, consistent and strong increase, both in absolute terms and relative to other consultancies and contractors; that this spending went far beyond accounting and auditing to many areas of management, though with financial analysis likely to underpin management inputs; and that a good deal of this work appeared to be oriented to program content and policy-relevant tasks. otwithstanding these findings, the paper emphasises that the extent to which this work confirmed to neo-liberal markers â€“ such as support for private modes of provision and greater competition â€“ cannot be readily confirmed, due to limitations in the official summary data. Such confirmation can only be achieved by qualitative case studies.The paper acknowledges that, as the firms have broadened their personnel and services over the three decades, much of the management and technology work of the firms in the public sector is unlikely to be intrinsically neo-liberal but potentially compatible with other philosophies of the public sector. Nonetheless, the growing presence of the firms within the public sector does erode notions of public sector capability and distinctive ethos. The paper concludes with a brief pointer to how the foregoing discussion, and further research, can be related to the academic literature on the differing roles played by commercial consultants in relation to clients, ranging from legitimation and facilitation of client preferences through to independent advice and learning.
M40|Impact of IAS 39 reclassification on Income Smoothing by European Banks|We examine the impact of the reclassification of IAS 39 on income smoothing using loan loss provisions among European banks. We predict that the strict recognition and re-classification requirements of IAS 139 reduced banks' ability to smooth income using bank securities and derivatives, motivating them to rely more on loan loss provisions to smooth income. Our findings do not support the prediction for income smoothing through loan loss provisions. Also, there is no evidence for income smoothing in the pre- and post-IAS 39 reclassification period. The implication of the findings is that: (i) European banks did not use loan loss provisions to smooth income during the period examined, and rather rely on other accounting numbers to smooth income; (ii) the IASB’s strict disclosure regulation improved the reliability and informativeness of loan loss provision estimates among European banks during the period of analysis.
M40|Evaluating Factors of Small and Medium Hospitality Enterprises Business Failure: a conceptual approach|The aim of this paper is to present a comparison between macro and micro economic factors as they are suggested by the current literature in corporate failure field. Present study answers two research questions, firstly which the causes of corporate bankruptcies in tourism are, and secondly which metrics could help more on effectively predict a corporate failure. Based on a conceptual approach authors analyze and collect different macro and micro economic factors. Results indicates how strongly the various factors affect the quantity and intensity of bankruptcy applications and suggestions are given on how different models could be developed to predict the risk of bankruptcy in a macro or micro aspect. This is one of the first studies that investigates the effectiveness of different types of Corporate Failure metrics, which has, until now, suffered a dearth of conceptual studies in the field, especially in the context of national economies due to the economic recession.
M40|Последващо Оценяване На Репутацията – Преглед На Съществуващата Нормативна Уредба<BR>[Subsequent Evaluation Of Goodwill - Overview Of Existing Accounting Legislation]|The purpose of this article is to review and analyze existing practices in the accounting regulation of post-reputation accounting as one of the major problems in the field of accounting harmonization by not aiming to critically analyze individual regulations in terms of their relevance. The objective analysis of the reviewed regulations allows us to summarize that the existing order for carrying out the ex post evaluation of the reputation and the specified disclosure elements are very important in order to obtain real indications of the business situation and the need for impairment but on the other hand they are extremely sensitive and easy to manipulate, as they use internal assumptions and assessments of enterprise management that are extremely difficult to verify. We believe that this is one of the main prerequisites for changing the regime in subsequent accounting for goodwill.
M40|Risk allocation and management in PPP and PFI: Systematic Literature Review|Public private partnerships (PPP) and Public Finance initiative (PFI) have been widely used to finance infrastructures and public services. PPP and PFI are an effective way to achieve value for money (VFM) (Broadbent et al. 2008) as they guarantee efficiency levels and transfer risk away from the public sector. Scholars analysed â€œriskâ€ from different angles, i.e. risk identification and controlling (Broadbent et al. 2008), diffusion of risks (Demirag et al. 2012), demand risk (Burke and Demirag 2013) and risk management (Chung and Hensher 2015). Despite the importance of the risk the topic has not yet been deepened. This research aims at understanding the state of the art of risk consideration under PPP and PFI studies. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR), we defined five constitutive areas, namely: value for Money, risk determination and allocation, financial risk transfer, contractualization of risk and risk management in post construction phase. Risk in PPP and PFF is still in its infancy. Further research are required. In particular, regarding operational and post-operational risk studies, risk management and the role of trust between partners in operational phase, and more in general issues related to PPP/PFIs within developing countries.
M40|Insurance, A Guaranteed Risk Or A Risk Assumed?|In the context of various changes in the players' composition on the insurance market, along with the changes that take place in the legislative area of the insurance system, we ask ourselves whether insurance is a guaranteed risk or a risk assumed by secure? At national level, due to the fact that within the insurance companies the internal control is not well implemented, there is no staff to pursue this goal and no mitigating measures are taken so that the risks triggered by the human decision-making factor be decreased. Because of this fact, the insurance can become a lottery for the insuree at one point because either the insuree cannot cover the damage s/he has secured, or s/he can lose as a result of some decisions taken by a representative of the insurance company. Therefore, a well-implemented and managed internal control can save both the activity of an insurance company as well as its image. That will generate a profitability, a good reputation for the insurance company, as well as policy-holders’ satisfaction. In this paper we aim to highlight the importance of internal control within insurance companies, as well as the consequences arising from a lack of internal control or its existence at a declarative level only.
M40|Adapting Public Services to Citizen Requirements: Trend or Need?|Public services are the basic elements in the evolution of a local administration. They can be developed with the help of IT sector and received by the decision makers in due time, so that citizens can continue their life and evolution in relation to the new standard of living using computer technology. The technological level of a territorial administrative unit, as well as the opening to urban and computer technology, of the urban representatives, are directly proportional to the degree of the area development, either local or national. Thus, an adequate technological equipping of all public institutions can generate both information and a pool of information that will lead to a quicker, better justified and grounded decision that satisfies the needs of the citizen when requesting. Through this paper, the author aims to highlight the need to adapt new information technologies in public services, as well as the benefits of implementing and using them.
M40|Capitalization of tangible and intangible assets in non-profit organizations in Bulgaria|The report analyzes applicability of the equity capital approach for the acquisition of tangible and intangible assets by non-profit organizations in Bulgaria. Attention is also paid to the accounting of depreciation of the assets. Without any claims of comprehensiveness, the conclusions in the report are based on analysis of accounting and legal literature, Bulgarian national accounting standards, as well as data collected from individual interviews that the author conducted among accountants.
M40|Съдържателни Аспекти На Счетоводната Политика На Сдружения В България От Гледна Точка На Ползвателите На Документа<BR>[Content of the accounting policies of Bulgarian non-profit associations from user's point of view]|According to data published in the Sustainability Index for Central and Eastern Europe and Eurasia, 1579 new associations and 370 foundations are registered in 2016 in Bulgaria. As a comparison in 2015 the newly registered associations are 1463, and the foundations - 306. Being active entities at the economic life of our country, not only the number of foundations and associations is increasing, but also the range of their business and non-profit activities are expanding. In this respect, non-profit organizations are involved in the political, economic, spiritual, cultural and social life of Bulgaria. Such an idea undoubtedly has a direct impact on the accountability of these activities. As an appendix to the financial statements, accounting policies provide information regarding the accounting methodology used for preparing the statements and hence are essential for the purposes of interpreting the data by the users. The accounting policies must ensure that the information they contain is cautious, reliable, neutral and impartial. Due to the possibility of certain conflicts of interest between the needs of different users, the data written inside the document is not as transparent and comprehensible as it should be. Based on that a main goal of the report is to present data analysis regarding the main content components of the document and their importance based on the user’s point of view. The subject of the study is the content of the accounting policy of Bulgarian associations. The methodology used for the analysis is a survey conducted among target groups related to the activities of the associations. The data collection period covers the months July 2018 - August 2018. For the analysis of the data, the programs SPSS, ver. 16.0/2007, as well as Microsoft Office Excel 2013 are used. The results from the questionnaire are based on the methods of mathematical statistics. The study of statistical relations and dependencies is done on the basis of a Chi square - analysis (χ2). Cramer’s (V) coefficient is used to measure the strength between the nominal variables. The author’s hypothesis is that users are not aware of the role, functions, and purposes of the accounting policies. In this respect the information they expect to find out in the document is irrelevant to the essence of the accounting policy. The results of the survey would help for better understanding of the accounting policy of associations, its structure and expected content components.
M40|La convergence de la comptabilité de l’Etat avec les normes IPSAS. Le cas du Maroc<BR>[Convergence of state accounting with IPSAS standards. The case of Morocco]|The State's accounting system must have an accrual accounting system in order to prepare financial statements that record changes in the heritage value, explain and reflect the way in which the state budget is managed both in revenue and expenditure and thus reflect the exact financial situation of the state at a given time. Once the accounting system of the State reflects the exact financial situation it can serve as a source of reliable and transparent financial information addressed, published and accessible to any interested person (citizen, politician, international financial institution ...). This article proposes to examine the impact of the adoption of IPSAS on Moroccan public finances.
M40|Дълготрайните Материални И Нематериални Активи, И Стоково-Материалните Запаси Като Елементи На Счетоводната Политика На Хотели В България<BR>[Intangible and tangible assets, and inventories as elements of the accounting policies of hotels in Bulgaria]|A main goal of the report is to analyze disclosed data about intangible and tangible assets, and inventories in the accounting policies of 20 hotels, offering accommodation and food services at the territory of Republic of Bulgaria. Subjects of research are the accepted and applied accounting rules and practices regarding the analyzed assets. For the purposes of the analysis, data from officially published financial statements in the Commercial Register from 2014, 2015 and 2016 were used, as well as information from the official websites of the hotels.
M40|The Effect Of Experience And Knowledge On Fraud Detection With Intuition As Intervening Variable|This study aims to examine the effect of the knowledge of government internal supervisors through the intuition of government internal supervisors to detect irregularities. The sample in this study was the auditor who served at the Regency and municipal Inspectorates in Bangka Belitung totaling 122 respondents. This study uses path analysis to examine the relationship between hypothesized variables. The results of the study concluded that the experience and knowledge of government internal supervisors had a significant effect on deviation detection. In addition to the knowledge of government internal supervisors through government intuition, internal supervisors influence the detection of irregularities. This research needs to be further developed, to get stronger empirical results, such as by adding other variables from deviation detection, further research can also expand the object of research, and use the experimental method.
M40|Verification Of An Innovative Logistics-Based Costing Model For Agricultural Enterprises In A Process Approach|This paper presents the main assumptions and functionalities of an innovative logistics-based costing model dedicated to agricultural enterprises. The model was verified in purposefully selected farms of various acreage engaged in crop or livestock production. The use of an innovative logistics-based costing model allowed to determine the basic logistics cost ratios both at a general level and in a process-based approach (by stages and by basic logistics processes), taking total/actual process costs into account. In livestock farms, the ratio of logistics costs to total costs was twice as high as in crop farms, and ranged from 30.4% to 42.9% of total costs. In crop farms, the corresponding ratio varied from 15.8% to 23.6%. The analysis of logistics costs by basic logistics processes shows that the largest difference in ratios between the farms was observed for warehousing processes. In livestock farms, the relevant ratio was three times higher than in crop farms.
M40|Integrating Third Parties in Digitally Mature Companies: Determinants of Innovation Success|We develop and empirically analyse a theoretical model that examines both the antecedents of digital maturity and the involvement of external third parties in companies undergoing digital transformation. We use structural equation modelling technique to test our propositions using the survey data from IT executives on self-reported importance scores they assign to different types of IT competences. We find that digitally mature companies are more likely to establish partnerships with the third parties with a purpose of jointly carrying out digital innovation projects.
M40|Why do you trust me? A structural equation model of trustworthiness in financial advisory|The paper provides a comprehensive model of trust formation in financial advisory using a dataset of 1,184 Italian advisors that differ across some specific characteristics (bank advisors or tied agents, market maturity of the bank/institution they work for, classified as new player or incumbent). The goal is twofold: on one side, we aim at demonstrating the validity of a trust-formation model that explicitly accounts for both a professional and a relational component; on the other, we wish to investigate whether different types of financial advisory induce different trust formation processes. The latter goal is of particular relevance with respect to the introduction of the MiFiD II Directive, as different trust formation processes may rely on features that are differentially affected by the regulatory changes. Through the estimation of a structural equation model, we are able to prove both its validity and the differential impact of the two dimensions in the trust-formation process. In particular, we find that the novelties introduced by the legislator, favouring the anticipated reciprocation dimension, could help increasing competition in the advisory industry. In fact, this dimension is the one that plays a fundamental role for the advisors of new entrant institutions and that could help support their accreditation in the market.
M40|Opacity, Liquidity and Disclosure Policies|We present a model that links the opacity of an asset to its liquidity. While low opacity assets are liquid, intermediate levels of opacity provide incentives for investors to acquire private information, causing adverse selection and illiquidity. High opacity, however, benefits liquidity by reducing the value of a unit of private information to investors. The cross-section of bid-ask spreads of U.S. firms is shown to be consistent with this hump-shape relationship between opacity and illiquidity. Our analysis suggests that uniform disclosure standards may be suboptimal; efficient disclosure can instead be achieved through a two-tier standard system or by subsidizing voluntary disclosure.
M40|The Effect of Foreign Cash Holdings on Internal Capital Markets and Firm Financing|Prior to 2018, U.S. repatriation taxes motivated companies to retain cash offshore. Using confidential jurisdiction-specific data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, we find that firms with high tax-induced foreign cash have approximately 3.3 percent higher domestic liabilities relative to other multinationals, equivalent to $152.2 million more domestic debt per firm, or approximately $98.9-$141.9 billion in aggregate. We next examine motives for firms with tax-induced foreign cash to borrow domestically, finding this behavior is associated with shareholder payouts and some domestic investment spending. Finally, repatriations and intercompany loans from foreign subsidiaries act as substitutes and complements, respectively, to external borrowings.
M40|Real options models of the firm, capacity overhang, and the cross-section of stock returns|"We use a stochastic frontier model to obtain a stock-level estimate of the difference between a firm's installed production capacity and its optimal capacity. We show that this ""capacity overhang"" estimate relates significantly negatively to the cross-section of stock returns, even when controlling for popular pricing factors. The negative relation persists among small and large stocks, stocks with more or less reversible investments, and in good and bad economic states. Capacity overhang helps explain momentum and profitability anomalies, but not value and investment anomalies. Our evidence supports real options models of the firm featuring valuable divestment options."
M40|Accounts of the future: a multiple-case study of scenarios in planning and management control processes|Purpose This paper examines the design and use of scenarios in planning and management control processes. Research approach The study is based on an exploratory case-study approach. Qualitative data has been collected between 2008 and 2011 from three energy companies operating in Italy. Findings The paper sheds light on three styles of designing and using scenarios. In the first (called ‘reactive’), scenarios provide a means for corporate actors to analyse past performance in the light of future expected performance. In the second (‘proactive’), scenarios contribute to envision different future states of the world. In the third (‘disciplined’), scenarios contribute to develop plausible, if not accurate, narratives about future outcomes. Research limitations/implications The study is comparative and exploratory. Possible areas for further work based on in depth-studies of scenarios within planning and control processes are identified. Practical implications The comparative analysis of the case-study material has implications for the ways in which flexible forms of management control can be mobilised by managers as a resource of action. It is shown that choices around the design and use of scenarios can mitigate some concerns with traditional planning and management control processes focused on the achievement of a single set of targets, but also raise new ones. Originality The paper sheds light on a scenario-based approach - called ‘disciplined flexibility’ - that avoids the restrictive nature of budgetary controls without losing the benefits of setting a plan and a target for the future. The paper outlines elements that may support the use of ‘disciplined flexibility’, but also its potential limitations

M40|Creativity, risk and the research impact agenda in the United Kingdom|This article describes the recent requirement for UK universities to account for the social and economic impact of their research, and asks whether this impact agenda may change the conduct of research itself. Three critical issues are highlighted: the epistemology of impact; the problem of quantifying qualities; and the likelihood of impact growing in significance and changing the landscape of research – so-called ‘impact creep’. Overall, the article identifies some features of the research impact agenda that pose risks to creativity and risk-taking by academics.
M40|The Impact of the Current Expected Credit Loss Standard (CECL) on the Timing and Comparability of Reserves|The new forward-looking credit loss provisioning standard, CECL, is intended to promote proactive provisioning as loan loss reserves can be conditioned on expectations of the economic cycle. We study the degree to which one modeling decision–expectations about the path of future house prices – affects the size and timing of provisions for first-lien residential mortgage portfolios. While we find that provisions are generally less pro-cyclical compared to the current incurred loss standard, CECL may complicate the comparability of provisions across banks and time. Market participants will need to disentangle the degree to which variation in provisions across firms is driven by underlying risk versus differences in modeling assumptions.
M40|Analysis of Voluntary Disclosure Before and After the Establishment of the Integrated Reporting Framework|"Objective - The goal of integrated reporting is to enhance the cohesiveness and efficiency of corporate reporting. It encourages organizations to create greater value by identifying the factors that have a material impact on its operations. The Integrated Reporting (IR) Framework guides the overall content of an integrated report through the Guiding Principles and Content Elements. The Framework has eight elements. This study explores the level of voluntary disclosure of information related to these eight elements by companies listed on the Bursa Malaysia before and after the establishment of the Framework. Methodology/Technique - This study examines the annual reports of 603 Main Market listed companies of Bursa Malaysia between 2012 and 2015. The year 2012 is referred to as the ""pre-issuance period"" while 2015 is referred to as the ""post issuance period"". Findings - The findings of the study show that the companies that do disclose more information, do so in relation to three out of the eight elements only. These are: governance, strategy and resource allocation, and outlook. Overall, there is a lack of lineage among the information related to the IR elements presented in the annual reports. Novelty - The findings demonstrate the need for the full adoption of integrated reporting in Malaysia."
M40|Gender-Diversity, Financial Performance and Cash Holding in Family Firms|Objective - This research aims to determine the presence of partial effects on gender-diversity and financial performance variables on the cash holding of family firms on the Indonesian Stock Exchange included in the Kompas100 index. Methodology/Technique - The approach used in this research was causal associative testing using a panel data regression with a General Least Square (GLS) method using six independent variables: size, growth opportunity, dividend, return on assets, leverage, and gender diversity. Meanwhile, cash holding acts as a dependent variable. Findings - The results of the research show that the independent variables of leverage have significantly negative relationships on cash holding on the Kompas100 index of Indonesia in the period of 2013-2016. Contrary to this, return on asset has a significantly positive relationship with cash holding. Novelty - Gender diversity is an important variable of boardroom; this paper reveals the impact of gender diversity and performance on family holding firms. These results can be used to assess the performance and fundamentals of a firm.
M40|Capital Policy on Firm's Profitability: A Case of the Thai Agro and Food Industry|Objective - The objectives of this research include: (1) to identify working capital investment policy and working capital financing policy, (2) to study the effect of working capital investment policy on profitability, and (3) to study the effect of working capital financing policy on profitability. Methodology/Technique - 41 firms in the agro-food industry listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand are examined in this study. Secondary data was collected and analyzed within a 5-year period between 2013-2017. Findings - The results show that the most frequently employed working capital investment policy is the aggressive approach (46.30%), and the most frequently employed financial policy is the moderate approach (82.90%). According to the inferential statistics, it is concluded that: (1) profitability is significantly affected by the choice of working capital investment policy and a moderate investment policy results in the greatest profitability, and (2) profitability is not affected by the choice of working capital financing policy. Novelty - As a result, firms should focus on the selection of a moderate working capital investment policy when seeking to maximize profits. On the other hand, any type of working capital financing policy (aggressive, conservative, or moderate approach) is appropriate.
M40|The Design and Development of a Framework for Enhancing Internship Programs in Malaysia: A Model for Accounting Students|Objective - The purpose of this study is to explore the ability of accounting graduates to improvise i.e. the ability to deal with complicated and unexpected situations in an entrepreneurial, contextual, creative and professional manner, the ability to react in conditions of complexity and temporariness, the ability to identify opportunities and try new methods on the spot from the perspective of employers, institutions and students. All these dimensions are very important to students and organizations as part of the skills required to succeed in a highly competitive business world. Unemployment among local graduates has become a serious problem in Malaysia. The problem does not lie with limited employment opportunities but stems from a lack of work-ready graduates. The Malaysian government has introduced a compulsory internship program for each graduate student. Various attempts have been taken to study the effectiveness of this internship program. However, there remains limited knowledge on how interns can improve their skills within the internship program, to gain meaningful employment in the future Therefore, this research will examine the ability for accounting graduates to improve their improvisation through their internship programs. Methodology/Technique - The first research gap of this study looks at the micro perspective i.e. student's improvisation capacity within an internship. The second research gap is the lack of empirical evidence on the factors affecting student/individual/employee improvisation from three perspectives i.e. employers, institutions and students. The last research gap is the limited availability of research on the development of a framework for enhancing internship programs in Malaysia for accounting students.
M40|Deconstructed CSR and Social Audit Model: Postmodernist Paradigm Observations in Luwu Mining Areas, Indonesia|Objective - The research aims to decode the model of Social Audit on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and develop a new model for CSR. Methodology/Technique - The study uses qualitative research using Derrida's deconstructive postmodernism paradigm. This study scrutinises all models of CSR, distinguishing between capitalism and socialism in audit practices, and creates a new CSR model that integrates the local wisdom of indigenous peoples. Findings - The study observes several unfair practices without ensuring social and distributive justice to the indigenous community where mining activities are conducted. Several concepts linked to sustainable development were evolved during the data collection phase. By deconstructing the two major concepts of CSR and Social Audit, the research develops a new model of sustainable corporate responsibility which enables stakeholders to empower the Luwu community by ensuring cultural integration and social development. Novelty – By exploring CSR activities in the Luwu area, this study verifies all existing CSR practices and Social Audit models to generate a sustainable corporate social responsibility model for corporations, government and allied stakeholders. This research may be used to support policy agreements between governments, industry players and the corporations, towards effective SCSR implementation.
M40|Internet Financial Reporting Of Public Institutions and E-Government as a Medium of Good Governance in Indonesia|Objective - Transparency of financial reporting can be achieved through various media including the internet and is an important factor of good governance. The use of internet in government has been regulated to encourage the government to build and develop websites to present information to the public. This research analyzes the factors that influence the government's internet financial reporting (IFR) through e-government. Methodology/Technique - The factors tested in this research are: size, leverage, capital expenditure, and audit opinion of the Republic Indonesia Audit Board (BPK). The population of this research is 25 ministries registered on the e-government ranking index (PeGI) between 2013 and 2015. Path analysis using the SPSS 21 application program is used. Findings - The results show that size, capital expenditure and audit opinion of BPK affected the use of IFR through e-government, whereas leverage did not affect the use of IFR through e-government. Novelty – These findings indicate that e-government is an important mediating factor in disclosing financial reports on the internet as a medium of good governance for public institutions in Indonesia.
M40|The Effect of Integrating Reporting on Earnings Quality: A Study of Family Firms in Indonesia|Objective - The implementation of integrated reporting (IR), which is a composite of financial and non-financial information, in one single report makes financial reporting more comprehensive and more transparent. Transparent information in IR gives annual reporting of family firms a higher earnings quality. Methodology/Technique - This research aims to examine the effect of IR on earnings quality of family firms in the mining industry on the Indonesian Stock Exchange between 2014 and 2017. Findings - The results of this study indicate that there is a positive and significant relationship between integrating reporting and earnings quality. These results confirm that firms that use integrated reporting tend to show higher earnings quality. The study also finds that larger sized companies and larger leverage amounts equals a higher volume of information disclosed. Novelty – The motivation of this research is to examine IR issues that are relatively new.
M40|Control Systems and Strategy: A Literature Review|Objective - Organisational change necessarily requires an adaptation of a company's information structure, particularly its Management Accounting and Control Systems (MACSs). These systems should be designed according to the defined strategies to assist managers in the decision-making process. This paper reviews research that analyzes the MACSs concept and the elements that characterise it, so that it may be used to identify and characterise the existing systems in any company. Methodology/Technique - Based on a contingency approach to management, the authors perform a broad literature review. Among other aspects, MACS information outputs will be analyzed in terms of the style of use, its nature and the type of decisions supported. In an attempt to broaden the scope of MACS functions, this paper reviews the present literature and provides a theoretical framework for studying the operationalization of MACS. Findings - The results obtained indicate that the operationalization of the MACS concept can be achieved through the way information is managed and characterised, establishing three categories and six different dimensions. Novelty - Theoretically, this framework characterises the existing MACS concept to analyse its impact on company strategy. The authors conclude that knowledge on the relationship between MCAS and strategy is limited, providing considerable scope for further research. In the future, the authors intend to develop a case study to analyse the impact of this framework on companies' internationalisation strategy.
M40|Exporting corporate governance: Do foreign and local proxy advisors differ?|European regulators are concerned that US-based proxy advisors might export US corporate governance by not considering sufficiently the unique aspects of the local setting. In contrast, local proxy advisors are expected to have a deeper understanding of the local setting. Using the German setting, we examine the pattern and the impact of shareholder voting recommendations by foreign (ISS, Glass Lewis) and local (IVOX) proxy advisors. First, we find that the voting recommendations diverge more between foreign and local proxy advisors than among foreign proxy advisors. Second, we document that against-recommendations by the local proxy advisor have an incremental impact on voting outcomes even after controlling for the voting recommendations by foreign proxy advisors. Third, we observe that the impact of the voting recommendations on voting outcomes increases with a higher proportion of institutional investors. Dividing the proportion into foreign and local institutional investors reveals that against-recommendations by foreign proxy advisors influence the voting decisions of both groups similarly. Overall, our study provides novel evidence that the informational contents of voting recommendations by foreign and local proxy advisors differ, implying that foreign proxy advisors may not fully integrate unique aspects of the local setting in their voting recommendations.
M40|Non‐additivity in Accounting Valuation: Theory and Applications|This paper has three objectives. First, to introduce a theoretical solution to the issue of non‐additivity between assets in place, relying on an accounting‐based valuation approach. Second, to explain how such an approach can be implemented empirically by measuring synergies between assets. Third, to present the properties of this non‐additive valuation technique. We use Choquet capacities, that is, non‐additive aggregation operators, to measure the interactions between assets and apply our methodology to a sample of US firms from the capital goods industry. To operationalize our approach we examine the relationships between synergies—captured by Choquet capacities—and the market‐to‐book ratio (proxying for growth options), and show how interactions between assets are consistently linked to a firm’s market‐to‐book ratio. We also measure firm‐specific productive efficiency relative to the industry and firm size. For large firms, efficiency, as defined by our approach, is positively associated with higher future operating cash flows. For small firms, efficiency is positively associated with higher future sales growth. We document that the non‐additive approach appears to be better able to identify expected relationships between efficiency and future performance than a simpler approach based on the market‐to‐book ratio.
M40|Increased Information Content of Earnings Announcements in the 21st Century: An Empirical Investigation|This study examines the factors contributing to a striking increase in information content of quarterly earnings announcements, measured as the absolute magnitude of stock price revision at earnings announcements relative to price revision at other times from 1999 to 2012. We provide evidence that one-day announcement windows exhibit roughly twice the price response observed for three-day windows. Furthermore, we find that management guidance, analyst forecasts, and disaggregated financial statement line items are more frequently bundled with earnings announcements over our sample period, and these variables help to explain the increase in the information content of earnings announcements over time. However, after controlling for these concurrent disclosures, a striking increase in information content of earnings announcements remains. In addition, we compare the price response to earnings announcements without management guidance or analyst forecasts to the response to management guidance or analyst forecasts issued outside earnings announcements. We find that the relative return volatility on stand-alone earnings announcement dates is on average comparable to that on management guidance dates. However, management guidance exhibits a declining pattern of information content, whereas the information content of earnings is increasing and surpasses that of guidance in years 2007 to 2012. Abnormal return variability at stand-alone earnings announcements is more than twice that at analyst forecast dates. Our findings indicate that after controlling for the effects of concurrent disclosures by analysts and management guidance, earnings announcements are increasingly more informative to investors in the 21st century.
M40|The Link between Information Technology, Activity-based Costing Implementation and Organizational Performance|Activity-based costing (ABC) is as a strategic tool that ensures accurate product costs as compared to traditional costing system. The implementation of ABC implementation offers useful information for performance measurement, cost control and strategic decision-making. Meanwhile, certain factors such as information technology (IT) determine the success of ABC implementation and its impact on organizational performance. However, past studies in this realm have neither been so emphatic in explaining the role of IT usage in implementing ABC in organizations nor examined the perception of employees and organizations’ decision makers towards the adoption of ABC. In addition, the government of Iraq and the Central Bank of Iraq has also issued strong recommendations to Iraqi banks to consider initiating ABC due to its influence of reduction cost. Thus, this study is motivated to examine the direct and the indirect relationships between IT, ABC implementation and organizational performance of banks in Iraq. This study surveyed 150 chief accountants of banks in the North region of Iraq. The data collected was analyzed using SPSS Version 21. The study revealed that there is a significant relationship between IT, ABC implementation and organizational performance. Also, the findings of this study demonstrated that, ABC implementation partially mediates the relationship between IT, ABC implementation and organization performance. Future researchers are recommended to consider other contingency factors and examine their effect on ABC implementation and organizational performance.
M40|Does managerial sentiment affect accrual estimates? Evidence from the banking industry|We examine whether managerial sentiment is associated with errors in accrual estimates. Using public banks we find (1) managerial sentiment is negatively associated with loan loss provision estimates, (2) future charge-offs per dollar of provision are positively associated with sentiment when the provision is estimated, and (3) the effects of sentiment are greater for firms with more uncertain charge-offs. Results are similar for private banks, suggesting accrual manipulation related to capital market incentives is unlikely to explain the results. Although economic fundamentals explain most of the variation in the provision, we find sentiment has an incremental and economically meaningful effect.
M40|Performance volatility, information availability, and disclosure reforms|Using the 2002 Sarbanes–Oxley reform as an exogenous disclosure shock, we find that high, relative to low, volatility firms opt for lower levels of information availability pre reform and experience increases in information availability, CEO turnover-to-performance sensitivity, myopic behavior, CEO compensation with a structure tilted towards more cash pay, and a reduction in firm value post the reform. Our findings suggest that mandating high levels of information availability across the board increases managerial evaluation risk and produces additional agency costs for firms with volatile performance.
M40|Explaining CEO retention in misreporting firms|We propose a framework that advances our understanding of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) retention decisions in misreporting firms. Consistent with economic intuition, outside directors are more likely to fire (retain) CEOs when retention (replacement) costs are high relative to replacement (retention) costs. When the decision is ambiguous because neither cost dominates, outside directors are more likely to retain the CEO when they both benefit from selling stock in the misreporting period. We show that joint abnormal selling captures director–CEO alignment incrementally to biographical overlap. This new proxy operationalizes information sharing and trust, making it useful for studying economic decision-making embedded in social relationships.
M40|What promotes R&D? Comparative evidence from around the world|R&D drives innovation and productivity growth, but appropriability problems and financing difficulties likely keep R&D investment well below the socially optimal level, particularly in high- technology industries. Though countries around the world are increasingly interested in using tax incentives and other policy initiatives to address this underinvestment problem, there is little empirical evidence comparing the effectiveness of alternative domestic policies and institutions at spurring R&D. Using data from a broad sample of OECD economies, we find that financial market rules that improve accounting standards and strengthen contract enforcement share a significant positive relation with R&D in more innovative industries, as do stronger legal protections for intellectual property. In contrast, stronger creditor rights and more generous R&D tax credits have a negative differential relation with R&D in more innovative industries. These results suggest that domestic policies directly dealing with appropriability and financing problems may be more effective than traditional tax subsides at promoting the innovative investments that drive economic growth.
M40|The relation between auditor reputation, earnings and capital management in the banking sector: An international investigation|In this study we examine two types of manipulation: earnings and capital management (or capital adequacy management) in banks, using an international sample of banks from four countries (USA, UK, Germany and France), which in couples belong in common financial systems (two common – law countries and two code – law countries). In specific, we examine the implications of two aspects of auditor reputation, auditor type and auditor industry specialization, for earnings management via the manipulation of the earnings benchmark. We prove that different aspects of auditor reputation per financial system restrict the motivation of managers for earnings manipulation. Furthermore, we examine the levels of the earnings and capital management in banks by separating our research period in the pre – Basle II regime and the post – Basle II regime. We prove that in the post – Basle II period the banks per financial system limit earnings and capital adequacy management. Moreover, we examine the effects of auditor reputation both in earnings and capital management by using the same model taking into account the financial crisis of 2008 with the results of this (expanded) research to be highly interesting for each financial system.
M40|Earnings management to exceed thresholds in continental and Anglo-Saxon accounting models: The British and French cases|The purpose of this paper is to compare the extent to which French and British firms manage their earnings in order to avoid losses, decreases in earnings and earnings below the forecasts of analysts. Further, this study aims to investigate the factors that potentially influence earnings management to exceed thresholds with reference to the Anglo-Saxon and continental accounting models. Britain and France, correspondingly, belong to those different socio-economic environments. Based on a panel data of 1771 French and 2057 British firm-year observations during the period 2002–2012, we show that all firms considered manage earnings to beat zero and last year’s earnings. However, earnings management in order to meet analysts’ forecasts appears to be more prevalent in British firms. Considering earnings management incentives, we find that firm size has a positive effect for all thresholds considered. Similarly, the signaling hypothesis is more evident for British firms for all thresholds examined. The corporate governance structure is also found to impact the extent of earnings management.
M40|Measuring the independence of audit oversight entities: a comparative empirical analysis|Purpose: Independent audit oversight is a prerequisite for restoring public confidence in financial reporting and auditing after the past accounting scandals and the financial crisis. By analysing and comparing the independence of the audit oversight boards of 27 European Member States and the USA, this study aims to provide insights into the question of how independent “independent” audit oversight boards are. Design/methodology/approach: Independence is measured in terms of the organisational compositions and regulatory competences of the audit oversight authorities. The data were collected through an e-mail questionnaire that was sent to all European oversight authorities, and by analysing legal provisions of various regulators. The results are analysed and visualised by a Partial Order Scalogram Analysis with Coordinates, which allows conclusions about the similarities of various systems and their relative levels of independence. Both measurements are then equally combined into one value of material independence, which is used to rank the oversight authorities. Findings: Although all countries encounter similar pressures to establish profession-independent oversight systems, this study identifies how differently “independence” has been translated in regulatory outcomes. While all countries claim to possess formal independent oversight bodies, there is a visible gap between countries with comparatively strong independent oversight authorities and systems in which accounting bodies still maintain far-reaching regulatory influence. At the same time, the results question the role of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) as the globally perceived benchmark of an entirely independent regulator. Research limitations/implications: This study focuses on formal independence rather than de-facto independence. Future research has, therefore, to address how these formal arrangements have evolved in regulatory practice. Practical implications: Policy makers around the world perceive independent oversight as one of the essential elements of regulatory reforms aiming at restoring public confidence in the aftermath of past accounting scandals. This study enables the comparison and benchmarking of national specific regulatory designs with other forms of independent oversight. Originality/value: Although the role of independent regulation is a recurring theme in accounting research, a systematic and encompassing comparison of the intertwining of audit oversight authorities and the accounting profession has not yet been provided. This study takes a first step towards providing a quantifiable measure of the formal independence of audit oversight authorities by mobilizing concepts, methods and prior findings from the field of public policy research.
M40|The development of Chinese accountingand bookkeeping before 1850:insights from the Tŏng Tài Shēngbusiness account books (1798-1850)|Claims have repeatedly been made for the importance of double-entry bookkeeping (‘DEB’) for capitalism’s development in the West, so it is valuable to explore the book-keeping and accounting practices of economically successful organizations elsewhere. Our paper reports our exploration into the original account books contained in the archive of Tŏng Tài Shēng (‘TTS’), a substantial Chinese ‘grocery / merchant-banking’ business whose surviving books span a period from the late 18th century to the middle of the 19th century. The TTS archive is the most complete and integrated surviving merchant archive from before China’s forced opening to the West in the mid-19th century. Our findings about its accounting processes and records (of which we give illustrations) shed critical light on the nature of indigenous Chinese bookkeeping and business organization and on the larger questions about Chinese commercial culture and the path of its development, for comparison with those about the West. We find no evidence in the surviving account books of TTS to support previous arguments in the literature that at this period Chinese accounting practice for successful businesses (must have) had its own 'Chinese double entry bookkeeping' ('CDEB') comparable to Western DEB.
M40|“Global” management accounting research: some reflections|"I start with some examples of global studies that compare and contrast ""remedies"" to management control and corporate governance issues across borders to expose the common tenet of such studies that ""uniformity"" of practices or regulations is ""counter-productive"" given national/cultural variations across countries. However, I critically evaluate this so-called ""non-uniformity"" prescription by considering the costs of local or situational adaptions. This naturally links with the ""homogenizing"" effects of globalization, where I ponder whether globalization might actually reduce the power of comparative studies across countries or regions, or whether, regardless, there remains great benefit to be had from studying ""local"" practices that can be theoretically generalized. I also offer some suggestions to help strengthen the design of comparative studies to try and maximize their (conceptual, if not econometric) power."
M40|Super behaviour: a note on young Australian adults’ engagement with their superannuation accounts|We examine the behaviour and attitudes towards superannuation of 25-34 year old Australians. Our results suggest that they are generally uninterested in their superannuation accounts. They seldom read the information provided by their funds, rarely change their fund, and a majority of them do not make voluntary contributions. Overall the results suggest significant lack of interest in, and engagement and concern with issues related to their retirement planning.
M40|The role of intellectual capital reporting (ICR) in organisational transformation: a discursive practice perspective|Intellectual Capital Reporting (ICR) has garnered increasing attention as a new accounting technology that can engender significant organisational changes. However, when ICR was first recognised as a management fashion, the intended change it heralded in stable environments was criticised for having limited impact on the state of practice. Conceiving ICR through a lens predicated on the notion of discursive practice, we argue that ICR can enable substantive change in emergent conditions. We empirically demonstrate this process by following the implementation of ICR in one organisation through interviews, documents and observations over 30 months. The qualitative analysis of the data corpus shows how situated change, subtle but no less significant, can take place in the name of intellectual capital as actors appropriate ICR into their everyday work practices while improvising variations to accommodate different logics of action. The paper opens up a new avenue to examine the specific roles of ICR in relation to the types of change enacted. It thus demonstrates when and how ICR may transcend a mere management fashion and the intended change it sets in motion through altering organisational actors’ ways of thinking and doing within the confines of their organisation.

M40|The farm as an accounting laboratory: an essay on the history of accounting and agriculture|The shop, the factory, the office: these appear, to the popular imaginary, as natural sites for accounting, and for accountants. They are the places where accounting is usually said to be invented and practised, the places where accounting sustains business. The shop stands for commerce, which reportedly saw the emergence of double-entry bookkeeping in the so-called ‘commercial revolution’ of the early-modern times. The factory stands out as the chief target of management accounting from the nineteenth century and its ‘industrial revolution’. The office is where accounting clerks work, but also itself an object of productive accountability in the ‘service economy’ of the twentieth century.
M40|Discussion of “are related party transactions red flags?”|Kohlbeck and Mayhew (2017) create a new data set featuring two types of related party transactions. They use empirical-archival methods to investigate the effect of such transactions on the likelihood of restatements and on audit fees. Their findings suggest that related party transactions related to directors, officers and major shareholders are associated with poor “tone at the top” and that this leads management to negotiate for lower-quality audits to minimize monitoring costs. To offer avenues for future research, we focus our discussion on three aspects of their paper related to causality, definitions of variables, and generalizability to non-U.S. jurisdictions.
M40|Asset volatility|We examine whether fundamental measures of volatility are incremental to market based measures of volatility in (i) predicting bankruptcies (out of sample), (ii) explaining crosssectional variation in credit spreads, and (iii) explaining future credit excess returns. Our fundamental measures of volatility include (i) historical volatility in profitability, margins, turnover, operating income growth, and sales growth, (ii) dispersion in analyst forecasts of future earnings, and (iii) quantile regression forecasts of the interquartile range of the distribution of profitability. We find robust evidence that these fundamental measures of volatility improve out of sample forecasts of bankruptcy and are useful in explaining crosssectional variation in credit spreads. This suggests that an analysis of credit risk can be enhanced with a detailed analysis of fundamental information. As a test case of the benefit of volatility forecasting, we document an improved ability to forecast future credit excess returns, particularly when using fundamental measures of volatility.

M40|Corporate Leverage and Employees’ Rights in Bankruptcy|Corporate leverage responds differently to employees’ rights in bankruptcy depending on whether it is driven by strategic concerns in wage bargaining or by credit constraints. Using novel data on employees’ rights in bankruptcy, we estimate their impact on leverage, exploiting time-series, cross-country and firm-level variation in the data. For financially unconstrained firms, results accord with the strategic debt model: leverage increases more in response to rises in corporate property values or profitability if employees have strong seniority in liquidation and weak rights in restructuring. Instead, in financially constrained firms leverage responds less to these shocks if employees have stronger seniority.
M40|Methodology of Building up the Accounting and Analytical Management Support for Organizations in Russia|This article deals with the issues, concerning methods of providing accounting and analytical support for the management of organizations with various patterns of ownership in Russia, related to national mentality and caused by the lack of uniform terminology, the need for a systematic approach to the formation and interaction of accounting, analytical and control subsystems, the influence of international practices in the context of harmonization of world economy. The ways of solving the problems have been identified. The original classification of the principles of the accounting and analytical support buildup for the organization man-agement has been compiled. We have analyzed the existing approaches and individual points of view to determine the content of this concept, and put forward our individual interpreta-tion. The authors explain the purpose of the effective functioning of the accounting and ana-lytical support of management and offer a system of fundamental principles of its organiza-tion. The main advantage of the authors' interpretation of accounting and analytical support is in the improvement of general methodology as well as creating the ground for developing techniques of record keeping, analysis and control on the basis of international experience, which ensures the continuity of the process of tactical and strategic decision making, well-timed adjustments of the development strategy of the organization in the long term, contrib-uting to the efficiency of administrative decisions taken by the management.
M40|Impact of Tri Hita Karana Culture on the Use of Accounting Information Systems and User Satisfaction as the Expression of Information System Success|"""Objective – The research aims to examine whether Tri Hita Karana (THK) culture influences the use of Acccounting Information System (AIS) and user satisfaction as the expression of Information Systems (IS) success. Methodology/Technique – The research was conducted in Badung Regency with Customary Village Financial Institution (LPD) as the sample. This research observes 55 LPDs in Badung Regency. The data was analyzed using SEM analysis with a PLS approach. Findings – The results of this research show that THK culture influences the use of AIS; THK culture influences through perceptions of use and perceptions of simplicity; THK culture influences user satisfaction through perception of use, perception of simplicity, and the use of AIS; perception of use and perception of simplicity influence the use of AIS; perception of use does not influence user satisfaction; perception of simplicity influences user satisfaction; AIS use effects user satisfaction; perception of use effects user satisfaction through the use of AIS. Novelty – The research suggests that suggestions for developing AIS in LPDs across Badung Regency or for further research in the field of AIS include: (1) dividing the LPDs into groups based on their business scale (either their amount of capital or the amount of assets owned); and (2) further exploring the impact of THK culture on the use of AIS."""
M40|The Effect of Application of Management Accounting To Performance through Strategy|"Objective – The context strategy as process and strategy as content have significant impact to the correlation between strategy and management accounting (Muktiyanto, 2016; Parnell, 2010). In the context strategy as process, this paper aims to investigate the role of management accounting to performance through the choice of strategy. Methodology/Technique – The method by structural equation modeling on 70 (seventy) of undergraduate Accounting Study Program (composition: 70% Private Universities and 30% Public Universities). Opposite with Henry (2006) and Widener (2007) and support with Speklé and Verbeeten (2014) and Acquaah (2013). Findings – This paper shown that the accounting management directly influence the performance, but not mediated by strategy. The practice of budgetary slack, the implementation of modern accounting such as activity-based costing and target costing, the use of performance measurement techniques such as the balanced scorecard, measurements based performance, and the economic value added, as well as integrated information system is an important factor in improving the performance of Higher Education. Unfortunately, the choice of strategy moderate or ""stuck in the middle"" has not been able to improve the performance of Higher Education directly nor as a mediating between management accounting and performance. However, in the context strategy as process, management accounting have positive influence to the strategic choice. Novelty – The effort of Higher Education to improve the performance is choose a single strategy or focus on the prospector's strategy."
M40|Audit Firm Reputation versus Auditor Capability: Their Effect on Audit Quality in Indonesia|Objective –The emergence of the ASEAN Single Window has triggered the need for higher audit quality in ASEAN countries, including Indonesia. A recent study conducted in Indonesia reveals that the reputation of auditing firms, as rated by clients and users, and auditor's competence, as rated by the auditor, are the primary determinants of audit quality. The purpose of this study is to analyze whether the reputation or competence of an auditor affects audit quality, within manufacturing companies in Indonesia. Methodology/Technique –This paper contributes to the creation of new measurements for auditor capability, by highlighting empirical evidence concerning the determinants of audit quality in Indonesia. Findings – By using discretionary accrual as the inverse determinant of audit quality, the result show that financial statements audited by reputable auditing firms contain the same discretionary accruals as those audited by other firms. The results further demonstrate that auditor capability does not affect audit quality. Audit quality in Indonesia is therefore not determined by firm reputation or auditor capability. Hence, it is important to search for new determinants of audit quality. Research Limitations/Implications – The limitation of this research is the low number of reputable audit firms and specialized auditors used by the sample firms, which lead to the exclusion of numerous controlled variables that may be integral when explaining audit quality. Future studies may use other sample firms and use additional controlled variables, to further explain audit quality.
M40|The Effect of IFRS Convergence on Earnings Quality: Empirical Evidence from Indonesia|Objective –The purpose of this research is to examine the impact of the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) convergence in Indonesia on earnings quality. Methodology/Technique – Earnings quality is measured on both accrual earnings management and real earnings management. Indonesia began convergence IFRS in 2012. IFRS is considered capable of improving comparability, transparency, and earnings information, which is expected to ultimately improve earnings quality. The sample in this research uses manufacturing firms listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange that were suspected to avoid loss during the observation period. The data consist of 45 companies examined between 2008 and 2015. Results –This study uses statistical methods and multiple regression linear to analyse the data. The research results show that IFRS convergence in Indonesia has had a negative impact on accrual earnings management and no impact on real earnings management. Novelty –The evidence shows that IFRS convergence in Indonesia has the ability to improve earnings quality related to a decrease in accrual earnings management but not real earnings management.
M40|The Effect of Corporate Governance, Ownership and Tax Aggressiveness on Earnings Management|Objective –The purpose of this research is to empirically examine the effect of corporate governance, ownership and tax aggressiveness on earnings management. Methodology/Technique –The population of this research consists of non-financial companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) between 2013 and 2015. This research uses 3 recent years and utilizes different variable that have not been used in prior research. The 67 samples were choose using a purposive sampling method. The hypotheses are tested using multiple regression analysis with the SPSS program, to investigate the influence of each independent variable on earnings management. Findings –The results show that the board of director have a positive influence on earnings management, while board independence, audit quality, managerial ownership, and tax aggressiveness have no influence on earnings management. Novelty –This research add value in the existing literature and empirically study the effect of the board of directors, independence of the board, audit quality, managerial ownership, and tax agressiveness on earnings management.
M40|The Effect of Tangible Service Quality on The Performance of The Regional Office of Directorate General of State Assets Management West Kalimantan|"""Objective – The objective of this study was to test and analyze the public sector performance from the customer perspective.

Moreover, it also aims to examine and analyze the effect of tangible service quality to public sector performance using multiple regression analysis to test the hypothesis. Methodology/Technique – This study uses purposive sampling method and obtained 58 respondents who are clients of DJKN Regional Office of West Kalimantan as the study sample. The data used is primary data collected through questionnaires. Findings – The results showed that the service time and the conditions of the office or facilities significantly affect the customer's satisfaction. While the service procedures, the cost of service, and the service staff did not significantly affect the customer's satisfaction. Novelty – The implication of this study is the DJKN Regional Office in improving the performance requires improvement in some aspects related to the customer's perspectives to improve the satisfaction of the customers which can encourage the achievement of better performance."""
M40|Antecedent Factors on an Auditors' Attitude Towards Conducting an Intended Qualified Audit|Objective – This study proposes to investigate an auditor's works by usingthe model on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), with the inducement of intervention by a supervisor, that influences an auditor's aattitudes. The study uses the TRA proposed by Fishben and Ajzen (1975) to predict and explain the behaviors of Indonesian auditors. The results reveal those factors influencing an auditor's intention to provide qualified and reliable audit reports. Methodology/Technique – The study focuses on audit implementation in the public sector, specifically the auditing of financial statements in regional administrations. The study examined a total of 53 governmental auditors from the Audit Board of the Indonesian Republic (BPK-RI). A Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used for the analysis. Findings – The results of the study show that perceived audit risk, moral norms, and incentives have a positive and statistically significant impact on an auditor's attitude when performing an audit. Meanwhile, intervention by a supervisor has a negative impact, and is not statistically significant towards the auditor's attitude and behavior. This means that the auditor's attitude and behavior implies that there is no intervention from their supervisor when performing an audit. Furthermore, an auditor's attitude influences their intention to perform qualified and credible audits. Novelty – This study infers that The Indonesian Republic Decree No. 188 of the Year 2014 regarding Personel Performance Benefit in the Audit Boards of Indonesia Republic (BPK-RI) is achieving its intended purpose.
M40|The Role of Taxes in the Disconnect between Corporate Performance and Economic Growth|We investigate the relation between the growth in corporate profits and the overall U.S. economy, focusing on the impact of the U.S. corporate tax regime on this relation. We document that the growth of corporate profits, on average, has outpaced the growth of the economy and this disconnect increases as the difference between the corporate income tax rate of the U.S. and the other OECD countries increases. The underlying mechanism is fewer corporate profits being channeled into subsequent domestic investments when the U.S. tax rate is relatively higher, leading to lower economic growth. Our findings have implications for policy setters.
M40|Do board interlocks motivate voluntary disclosure? Evidence from Taiwan|Abstract Conference calls have become a widely used medium for voluntary corporate disclosure, especially among firms associated with greater information asymmetry, intangible assets, and external competition. These features are common in high-tech sectors, which dominate the Taiwanese economy and render it a useful research setting for investigating whether board interlock, as a social network, affects corporate decisions to hold conference calls. We show that firms connected to conference-call-making firms through interlocked directors are more likely to hold conference calls and the frequency of holding conference calls increases with interlocking directors’ relevant experience. Moreover, such evidence is more pronounced if the connections are held through independent directors and among firms with greater information asymmetry. These results support the argument that the spread of corporate practices is positively associated with board interlock networks. Our findings have implications for the choice of board of director members, and can be generalized to other emerging economies characterized by weaker corporate information environments.
M40|Достоверното Счетоводно Дефиниране На Научноизследователската И Развойна Дейност<BR>[Defining and interpreting the term research and development for accounting purposes]|The process of planning the research activities that are included within the scope of an innovative project is a complex and multi-layered one. At the end of this process an intangible asset is developed. For the purposes of a successful innovation the intangible asset must be properly valued and priced. It is mainly associated with the proper accounting of the expenditures within the scope of R&D. The thesis that the author advocate is that for the proper accounting of the intangible asset it is important to clearly distinguish the activities that are included at the research and the development phase. The main objective of the paper is to distinguish the activities within the scope of R&D, by a comparison of the accounting standards used in the United States, Great Britain and Bulgaria.
M40|Static and Dynamic Indicators in the Analysis of Internal Sources of Companies’ Investments Financing|The Republic of Serbia is characterized by an unsatisfactory macroeconomic environment. Under the conditions of an evident shortage of liquid assets, the financial capital has moved from real to the financial sector, which led companies to over-indebtedness and shutdown of their own capacities. Therefore, capital investments largely depend on internal financing sources and the ability of companies to internally generate funds for investments. In this regard, an emphasis is placed on the difference in the assessment of the company’s investment capacity based on internal financing sources, which are measured using static and dynamic indicators in order to prove the necessity of applying dynamic coefficients, which are unfortunately not present in our domestic practice. The paper examines and proves the advantages of the use of the dynamic approach for such analyses using the example of energy sector, which is one of the most important branches in Serbian economy.
M40|Qual a importância da Auditoria Operacional nas PME Portuguesas?<BR>[The importance of the operational audit of Portuguese SMEs]|Atualmente, as organizações enfrentam vários desafios, por exemplo, as suas transações organizacionais crescem em volume e complexidade e estão a viver em ambientes de negócios altamente regulamentados. Portanto, os mecanismos de controlo e monitorização são necessários para avaliar e validar todas as transações, de forma abrangente, para atender aos controlos e regulamentos. Contudo, o processo de auditoria tradicional ocorre principalmente após a conclusão das transações, uma vez que não é viável auditá-las a tempo. Assim, torna possível inibir o risco associado à sua execução. Para muitas organizações existe um conjunto de riscos significativos de erros e fraudes e estes não são detetados atempadamente, resultando num impacto bastante nefasto para as organizações. A atual crise financeira global e os sucessivos e conhecidos escândalos de algumas organizações, como Lehman Brothers, A-Tec, Madoff, Kaupthing Bank, WorldCom, Enron, Parmalat, e muitos outros, levaram a que exista uma forma de prever esses erros e fraudes. Assim, qualquer organização deve estar suficientemente preparada para sobreviver, independentemente do número de riscos a que está sujeito, mediante a implementação de um sistema adequado de Garantia Contínua, com o quadro legislativo e regulamentar aplicável. Esta garantia contínua poderá ser efetuada através da auditoria operacional. O presente artigo tem como objetivo a análise da importância da auditoria operacional das PME’s portuguesas. Através da aplicação de um questionário semiestruturado, e da análise de um caso prático, identificam-se o tipo de erros que podem ocorrer afetando de forma significativa as Demostrações Financeiras.
M40|Diamonds and “the Golden Flute”: from the Golden Age of prodigies and geniuses to the Knowledge Based Digital Economy|Information sharing, as a means of resource generating capabilities – as well as mitigating information gaps which present challenges to the development of innovative techniques, has also been facilitated through information technology, the rise of the digital economy and resources which avail from the rapidly advancing era of information technology. To what extent are our creative abilities still motivated and stimulated? Can an unhealthy balance and level of competition serve as a deterrent to constructive innovation? This paper attempts to investigate – as well as appreciate the role of information technology in generating economic stimulus and development – particularly in a world where budding entrepreneurs and innovation constitute key elements in addressing poverty alleviating initiatives. It also aims to highlight why, whilst certain geniuses may still exist, it is certainly evident that the current environment does not really stimulate or generate the same enthusiasm or kind of magical revolution that took place during the Golden Age.
M40|Social assistance and its importance in economy|Social assistance is an important component of the national and international economy and indicates the degree of development of local and national government, being an important element in the composition of the administration budget. A sensitive and, at the same time, special issue of social policies is the need of social assistants, which over time has led to political confrontations, electoral strategies, but also to the construction and implementation of economic strategies in order to track, guide and diminish the number of social assistants and reduce the budget burden. Local and national budgets are affected by the number of social assistants, and accurately categorizing them in well-defined categories can generate targeted policies with varying degrees of implementation among social assistants, depending on the category they belong to, generating social assistance where appropriate, and a reduction in the number of social assistants who should not benefit from this form of assistance. Through this article we want to highlight the close link between the social aid granted by the state through the social assistance programs offered to the people able to carry out gainful employment, the consequences of these social assistance measures on the labor market and the influence of this phenomenon in the local economy and national.
M40|Market insurance and risks in this field|The insurance market can be considered a market where all sorts of anomalies can be encountered or a current acquisition for a situation considered to be certain or relative future, depending on the type of insurance. For the most part, assurance is based on a premise, a hypothesis that is generally based on several factors of influence. Generally, the most important factors in making such a decision are generated by the human-sensitive factor or the economicprotective. Therefore, by joining the insurance market and purchasing any kind of insurance, we must also take into account the risks that arise from these products. Generally, most people perceive these insurance policies in different areas as a future guarantee without considering additional elements that can highlight risk elements that may alter the expected outcome of the acquirer. An important element to mitigate these risks would be the implementation and use of internal control over the supply chain, control that would make a difference between an activity under normal, predictable and legal conditions and a random activity with many elements of risk that can cause major damage to those involved, and to the insurer and the insured. Through this paper, the author aimed to highlight the importance of internal control in insurance companies, as well as the consequences of the lack of internal control within these societies.

M40|Telaah Kepemilikan Kebenaran Ilmiah Pada Pengembangan Pengetahuan Akuntansi<BR>[Review Of Scientific Truth Ownership On Development Of Accounting Knowledge]|This article aims to examine the conflicting paradigm in accounting research and development from the point of view of the philosophy of science. Each adherent is both mainstream and alternative, assuming that their point of view is the most scientific approach and more suitable for developing the discipline of accounting scholarship. This article also agrees on the use of a multiparadigm approach as a space for researchers so that it does not have to be trapped in a single point of view, it would be better to paradigm each other interact and synergize to produce strength. Accounting research and development can be approached from the point of view of the philosophy of science. From any point of view the paradigm used in researching and developing whether the mainstream or accounting alternative is a product of knowledge that has no absolute truth, so it is not necessary to differentiate the way of view in researching accounting into a contradiction that can negate the essence of epistemology, ontology, and axiology
M40|The Effectiveness of Internal Control System in Safeguarding Assets in the Ghanaian Banking Industry|The study assessed the effectiveness of internal control system in safeguarding assets against fraud in Agricultural Development Bank Ghana Limited (ADB). The study specifically highlighted the major causes of fraud; determined the extent of implementation of internal control systems; assessed the effectiveness of internal control system on fraud detection and prevention; and ascertained the effect of fraud on the bank in terms of its profitability, liquidity and operational efficiency. A structured questionnaire was used as a primary data collection instrument to select employees of ADB by purposive and convenient means. Items of the questionnaire were measured on the ranking scale. 37 employees from five branches of the bank were sampled. Data analysis was done using descriptive statistics. The study found that employees of the bank perceived that; poor internal control system, presence of unqualified staff, inadequate staffing, poor record-keeping practices, and inadequate training and re-training of staff among others were the main causes of fraud. All aspects of internal control system were strongly implemented and practiced by the bank. Internal control system was effective in controlling fraud in the bank in various forms. Fraud had negative and insignificant effect on the performance of the bank. The study recommends the continuous practice of the internal control system to ensure that fraud of any form is reduced to the barest minimum.
M40|Corporate Leverage and Employees' Rights in Bankruptcy|Corporate leverage responds differently to employees' legal protection in bankruptcy depending on whether leverage is chosen to curtail workers' bargaining power or is driven by credit constraints. Using newly collected cross-country data on employees' rights in corporate bankruptcy, we estimate the impact of such rights on firms' capital structure, applying triple-diff strategies that exploit time-series, cross-country and firm-level variation. The estimates show that leverage increases more substantially in response to rises in corporate property values or in profitability at firms where employees have strong seniority in liquidation and weak rights in restructuring, consistently with the strategic use of leverage.
M40|Cost Efficiency and Cost-Benefits Relationship Analysis in the Romanian Education System|For reaching a certain level of performance, it is not absolutely necessary to have additional amounts of money, but an amount distribution in a more efficient manner between school units, or their reorganization. One of the important ways to reduce the base cost and in the same time to reach a high level of preparation for students is efficiency growth. In other words, the best way to grow student performance in lack of cost growth is to grow the productivity through management methods specific to teaching activities.
M40|The Internal Control Management Development Strategy in Romania|The internal control management means all the forms of control exercised at the public entity, including internal audit, established by the management in accordance with its objectives and legal regulations in order to provide fund administration economically, efficiently and effectively; it also includes the organizational structures, methods, and procedures. The phrase, â€œinternal control managementâ€ emphasizes the responsibility of all hierarchical levels for controlling all internal processes undertaken in order to achieve its general and specific objectives. The internal control management development strategy prioritizes managerial responsibility and ensures that the implemented internal control management systems are adequate and prevent or limit errors and fraud.
M40|Effects of management control mechanisms: towards a more comprehensive analysis|Abstract Even though it is widely accepted that management control systems consist of formal (results and/or action controls) and informal mechanisms (personnel and/or cultural controls), empirical research analyzing the effects of these management control mechanisms in a more comprehensive way is still scarce. Based on a cross-sectional survey among 295 senior management accountants, we examine how different management control mechanisms are related to control system effectiveness and organizational commitment and how these two outcomes subsequently affect overall organizational performance. Our results suggest that particularly more informal control mechanisms are strongly associated with beneficial outcomes. Our study contributes to extant literature by identifying distinct relative effects of alternative management control mechanisms on organizational-level outcomes. Overall, our results support the growing relevance of more informal control mechanisms compared to prevailing formal control instruments in contemporary organizations.
M40|Terminological distinctions of ‘control’: a review of the implications for management control research in the context of innovation|Abstract The article reviews the terminological distinctions (e.g. action and result control, interactive and diagnostic control) used for control in twenty-five empirical studies on management control in the context of innovation. The terminological distinctions are classed in three categorizations. These are (a) the types of managerial control, (b) the design and use mode of managerial control instruments and (c) the enabling and constraining character of managerial control instruments. By analyzing the categorizations, it becomes evident that there are two, almost independent ontological streams shaping the empirical field: the determinist perspective and the voluntarist perspective of management control with different understandings of contingency. The ‘ideal fit’ approach to contingency of the determinist perspective adds little cumulative knowledge to the field of management control in the context of innovation. Therefore, the article suggests to strengthen the voluntarist perspective and to develop a ‘quasi fit’ interpretation of contingency. The agenda for prospective research in management control in the context of innovation includes to investigate deviant and repair behavior related to management control systems (MCS) in innovating activities, to understand MCS as dependent as well as independent variable and to explore the role of MCS in economizing innovative activities.
M40|Corporate investment and changes in GAAP|Abstract This paper investigates whether changes in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) affect corporate investment decisions. Using a sample containing forty nine changes in GAAP, I find that changes in accounting rules affect investment decisions. I then examine two mechanisms through which changes in GAAP affect investment. First, I find that changes in GAAP affect investment, particularly R&D expenditures, when firms have financial covenants that are affected by changes in GAAP. Second, I find evidence suggesting that the process of complying with some changes in GAAP alters managers’ information sets and consequently changes their investment decisions, particularly their capital and R&D expenditures and, to a weaker extent, their acquistion expenditures. This paper contributes to the literature on the real effects of accounting by providing evidence that accounting rules affect investment decisions even when the rule change does not concern the measurement and reporting of investment, and by documenting specific mechanisms through which the relation manifests.
M40|Literacy and Digital Storytelling: Sviluppo di nuovi prodotti per l'apprendimento esperienziale dei nativi digitali in ambito mussale: Il caso #smARTradio|Nowadays itÕs very important to instill in the new generations a civic sense of respect and love for the artistic heritage of our national monuments and museums. But how to engage the native digitals with museum environments often inadequate to host children, and with subjects such as history or art history that do not have a strong appeal like music, movies or other fields might have? This paper is divided in two parts. The first one aims to analyze the fundamental role that storytelling has in the museum environment as a learning strategy for the new generations. Different empirical cases will be analyzed, which deal with both museums and virtual museums around the world. In the second part of the paper, a model for a new social innovation project called #smARTradio will be analyzed. It is a project in which, leveraging technology, a participative approach is used to build contents for a virtual museum, describing artworks and monuments from the Friuli Venezia Giulia region. The target audience for this project is a public of families, schools, and tourists.

M40|The managerialization of the arts in the era of creativity. The case of an Italian opera house|This paper investigates how management discourses developed in the arts industry. The theoretical background applied to answer this question, is rooted in the deep discussion on the role of managerial thinking in capitalistic societies which is provided in Boltanski and ChiapelloÕs ÒThe new spirit of capitalismÓ (2005; first version in French ÒLe nouvel esprit du capitalismeÓ, 1999), and it is enlarged by a discussion on how managerial discourses have affected the creative and the arts sector in more recent times. The theorizing provided in this paper is based on the analysis of the managerialization process of an Italian opera house. The case study is described by reporting both the Òofficial versionÓ and less official voices, putting particular emphasis on the role played by managerial discourses. The results show how the vocabulary of management is used internally to justify the managerialization process, and externally to communicate with potential investors of the private sector. However it is contrasted internally by some Òvoices out of tuneÓ which see management principles as conflicting with the artistic mission of the opera house, and their application as detrimental for the artistic quality and as source of frustration for artists and creative professionals. After the analysis of the case study, I provide a discussion of what seems to be a managerialization process investing the arts sector, in contrast to the artification of management which is undergoing in the profit-seeking creative sectors. Following Boltansky and ChiapelloÕs reasoning, I conclude by questioning about the possibility of a revival of the artistic critique in the cultural sector.
M40|Consumer Innovation Adoption Stages and Determinants|Existing research on innovation adoption is divided into two main streams: organizational innovation adoption and individual (consumer) innovation adoption. Proponents of both perspectives approach the topic in a variety of ways. Contrary to the organizational adoption, research on the consumer adoption investigates the determinants of adoption/non-adoption without considering the innovation- decision as a process. Particularly, for high involvement innovations that require efforts in terms of cost, money, and resources to switch to a new routine and behavior, innovation adoption as a multi- stage process is most relevant. In line with Rogers' (2003) multi-stage individual adoption process, this study aims to first explore the existence of distinct stages of innovation adoption and then identify the different determinants of each stage of adoption. To address both research questions, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and a structural equation modeling (SEM) technique were used. Data was collected from individuals using two different online surveys on smartwatch and alternative engine cars (AECs). Data from the first survey was used to extract factors using EFA. The results confirmed the existence of five distinct stages: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. Based on these results, data from the second online survey was used to identify the predictors of each stage. Different determinants in terms of perceived innovation characteristics of AECs were analyzed using a structural model. In line with temporal distance theories and loss aversion theory, the findings show that perceived benefits of an innovation explain variation in persuasion stage, while perceived losses impact implementation stage. Decision and confirmation stages on the other hand are less explained. The study contributes by confirming the existence of distinct stages of consumer adoption of high involvement innovations and developing a framework which not only determines the direction but also the strength of the relationships between different determinants and adoption stages.
M40|Predicting earnings and cash flows: The information content of losses and tax loss carryforwards|We analyze the relevande of losses, accounting information on tax loss carryforwards, and deferred taxes for the prediction of earnings and cash flows up to four years ahead. We use a unique hand-collected panel of German listed firms encompassing detailed information on tax loss carryforwards and deferred taxes from the tax footnote. Our out-of-sample predictions show that considering accounting informaton on tax loss carryforwards and deferred taxes does not enhance the accuracy of performance forecasts and can even worsen performance predictions. We find that common forecasting approaches that treat positive and negative performances equally or that use a dummy variable for negative performance can lead to biased performance forecasts and we provide a simple empirical specification to account for that issue.

M40|Review on tax research in accounting: Is the information given by U.S. GAAP income taxes also provided by IFRS?|In this paper, we present a review of tax research in accounting. We outline U.S. GAAP accounting rules for the following four income tax notes and survey the area of research literature dealing with the information content provided by U.S. GAAP: (1) unrecognized tax benefits, (2) valuation allowances, (3) foreign earnings designated as permanently reinvested, and (4) book-tax differences. Building on this, we present the accounting rules for comparable income tax notes following IFRS standards and offer which we believe are interesting avenues for future research on the information on tax notes provided by IFRS financial statements.
M40|Integrated reporting and board features|In the last two decades the concept of sustainability reporting gained more importance in the companies’ annual reports, a trend which is embedded also in integrated reporting. Issuing an integrated report became a necessity, because the report explains to the investors how the organization creates value over time. The governance structure, more exactly the board of directors, decides whether or not the company will issue an integrated report. Thus, are there certain features of the board that might influence the issue of an integrated report? Do the companies which issue an integrated report have certain features of the governance structure? Looking for an answer to these questions, we seek for any possible correlations between a disclosure index and the corporate governance structure characteristics, on a sample from the companies participating at the International Integrated Reporting Council Examples Database. The results highlight that only the size of the board influences the extent to which the issued integrated report is in accordance with the International Framework.
M40|Islamic Banks Financial Performance and Implications of Basel III Standards in the GCC: An Empirical Analysis|This study empirically evaluates Islamic banks financial performance and implications of Basel III regulations in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. We utilize bank-level data for 24 Islamic Banks based in six GCC countries (namely, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain) for the period of 2006 to 2015. Financial performance is measured by using both Internal¨Cbased performance measure (Return on Assets) and Marketbased performance measure (Tobin¡¯s Q model). We employ regression analysis to capture the impact of bank size, credit risk, operational efficiency and asset management on performance measured by the two indicators. Moreover, to control for the implications of Basel III standards, we run our model with a dummy ¡®control¡¯ variable. The results reveal that the explanatory power of the internal¨Cbased performance model is higher than the market-based performance model. Not surprisingly, the results also indicate that financial performance of GCC Islamic banks is highly sensitive to Basel III regulations. We argue that findings of this study highly useful for capitalmarket participants who are interested in Islamic banking industry, in particular, GCC region.
M40|The new era of expected credit loss provisioning|"Following the Great Financial Crisis, accounting standard setters have required banks and other companies to provision against loans based on expected credit losses. While the rules adopted by the two main standard-setting bodies differ, banks must in both cases provision for expected credit losses from the time a loan is originated, rather than awaiting ""trigger events"" signalling imminent losses. In the short term, provisions may rise but the impact on regulatory capital is expected to be limited. However, the new rules are likely to alter the behaviour of banks in credit downturns, potentially dampening procyclicality. Banks, supervisors and market participants must prepare for their respective roles in implementing the new approach and assessing its impact."
M40|Research On The Evolution Of The Financial Performance Of Companies Listed And Traded On The Bucharest Stock Exchange, During 2006-2013, Based On Rates Of Return|DuPont financial analysis system is one of the most used methods of understanding the causes that led to the evolution of the rate of return on equity, as a measure of financial performance of a company. Financial return is evolving under the holistic influence of several factors, without being determined only by the independent action of asset rotation, of assuming the financial risk or practiced profit margin. Studies are based on the hypothesis that companies listed and traded on the Bucharest Stock Exchange, operating in industry and construction, obtain financial performance, assessed in terms of the Economic rate of return and the Financial rate of return, even if their financial performance declined during the period 2006-2013.
M40|Economic And Social Environment - Global Outlook 2016 And Beyond|The aim of the paper is to provide a perspective on the current economic situation through a brief analysis of the economic environment and main macroeconomic indicators. Today's economy shows a moderate improvement, with a more gradual growth in emerging markets and developing countries and a modest growth in advanced economies. Prospects are showing that the total economy output will still remain under the pre-crisis levels and countries must take into account many challenges like high unemployment rates, geopolitical issues and need for a high quality life.
M40|Does Social Capital Matter in Corporate Decisions? Evidence from Corporate Tax Avoidance|We investigate whether the levels of social capital in U.S. counties, as captured by strength of civic norms and density of social networks in the counties, are systematically related to tax avoidance activities of corporations with headquarters located in the counties. We find strong negative associations between social capital and corporate tax avoidance, as captured by effective tax rates and book‐tax differences. These results are incremental to the effects of local religiosity and firm culture toward socially irresponsible activities. They are robust to using organ donation as an alternative social capital proxy and fixed effect regressions. They extend to aggressive tax avoidance practices. Additionally, we provide corroborating evidence using firms with headquarters relocation that changes the exposure to social capital. We conclude that social capital surrounding corporate headquarters provides environmental influences constraining corporate tax avoidance.
M40|How cultural and contextual variables affect the disclosure and transparency of pro-forma indicators|The paper analyses how company-specific financial factors and country-specific institutional and cultural factors affect the extent to which companies disclose Non-GAAP Financial Measures (NGFMs) in their financial communications. Our study is based on the analysis of 1,731 quarterly financial reports from 120 companies located in 23 countries and listed in Standard & Poor’s Global Oil Index. The results provide evidence that supports both the informative theory on NGFMs (asserting that NGFMs are disclosed to provide the investors with higher quality information) and the opportunistic theory (affirming that NGFMs are disclosed to mislead investors). On one side we see that highly indebted companies more frequently disclose NGFMs, but they are conservative in their adjustments, which is consistent with the informative theory. On the other side, low profitability is a driver of positive adjustments providing evidence of an opportunistic behaviour. The regulation on NGFMs has a positive effect on disclosure and does not increase conservatism. It increases the transparency of adjustments, but more in a formal way than substantially. Also the specific set of accounting standards adopted has a relevant effect on the disclosure of NGFMs. The cultural factors play a role partially consistent with this theory, but on average their impact is negligible. Our study was the first to analyse the use of NGFMs including companies from different continents and considering the impact of cultural variables. From a theoretical point of view, the results provide evidence that an informative and opportunistic use of NGFMs coexist and that different factors (mainly company-specific financial factors and institutional factors) lead to different practices. From a practical point of view the analysis provides interesting evidence for the evolution of regulations on NGFMs.
M40|Opportunism in disclosing pro-forma indicators: rationale and contextual drivers|The paper examines the impact of the institutional context and the regulation on the disclosure of non-GAAP indicators (NGIs), with a focus on the adoption of NGIs for opportunistic purposes. We firstly discuss the concept of opportunism and the approaches to discover opportunistic behaviours in the adjustment process. Then, we define a new procedure in three steps to highlight opportunistic behaviours. Based on a sample of 120 international listed companies, from 23 countries included in the S&P Global Oil Index, we employ logistic panel regression models to test our hypotheses about the role of the institutional context in affecting opportunism. First results suggest that while strong institutional contexts (developed market, high-quality legal system, protection for minority shareholders, common law system) reduce the disclosure of NGIs, they increase opportunistic behaviours. Moreover, the introduction of a regulation on NGIs increases the general disclosure of adjusted measures, but it does not moderate the opportunistic use of NGIs. Our research contributes to the non-GAAP literature providing a practical approach for measuring opportunism in NGIs disclosure. At the same time, the results provide useful insights to regulators and standard setters about the role and the effectiveness of regulations on NGIs in different institutional contexts.
M40|Paradigm Of Accounting Change|The words and phrases swop with each other and the apparent stability of a word’s meaning sometimes change in time. This explains why the generic term of accounting is used when referring to the qualities attributed to accounting,but also when it comes to organizing financial accounting function within the entity, and when referring concretely to keeping a double record with its specific means, methods and tools specific, respectively seen as a technical accounting.Speaking about the qualities of accounting, but also about the organizational form it takes, we note that there is a manifold meaning of the word accounting, which is why the purpose of this article is to demonstrate that the paradigm shift aimed at a new set of rules and if the rules changes, then we can change the very purpose of accounting.
M40|Predictive Analytics Of The Fraud Prevention And Detection At Asf Level|A need for greater rigor, which is felt by insurance companies in order to guarantee the fundamental balance of their financial sources, led to intensification of the concerns for preventing and combating fraud. The scope of the controller's mission is variable and its limits are set by the control program which has been established. In assessing the fair price of the caused damage, the essential role of the controller is to put a stop to the fraud and to avoidearly damage coverage.But information is required in order to accomplish this.The predictive analytics, of those processes necessary to prevent and combat fraud, is a way of passing from a retroactive and intuitive process to a proactive one, that is oriented according to the information possessed. Based on this approach, insurance companies can build models, to predict the risk of fraud, in order to reduce their financial-cost impact.
M40|Using Activity Based Costing For Investment Decisions|This article presents one of the most common tools in making investmentdecisions - Activity Based Costing (ABC). For this, we focused in the study on the literaturereview and practice using the ABC method in funding to establish investment decisions. We usefor exemplification a project financing with the objective based on upgrading a hotel throughcomplex arrangement works, achieved in order to obtain European funds. The basic informationused for the cost-benefit analysis we access using the financial layout related to the fundingmeasure that was desired accessing grants, information found in the financial statements of thecompany. The accuracy of the method used for this evaluation depends on the accuracy offinancial statements provided by the hotel that reflects the work. Thus, our results have allowedus to establish clearly the investment situation, but equally the sustainability and reliability,confirming the need of the hotel analyzed to access grants.
M40|Public Entities Through The Looking Glass: A Disclosure Assessment Study On Romanian Municipalities|Recent trends in organizational reporting show that improved disclosurelevels are increasingly important for public sector entities, as they employ publicly availableresources in their activity and are accountable towards various impacted stakeholders. Thus,enhancing transparency is a mean to justify the use of and effects on the elements which have asignificant role in the economic environment of the entity. This study aims to pinpoint the mainelements of disclosure (of different complexity levels) in the case of Romanian municipalities,using public sources of data and determine the overall level of disclosure with a refinedassessment model (linked with previously-developed instruments). The added value of this studyis the integrated approach of the disclosure assessment process for Romanian local publicadministration, focusing on both the financial and non-financial sides. The findings show thatRomanian municipalities exhibit a level of transparency which is more elevated than expected -with sufficient instruments of disclosure publicly available, and the focus does not fall solely onfinancial information (although it is prioritized through the lens of accountability for the use ofpublic funding).
M40|An Empä°Rä°Cal Analysä°S Of Audä°T Delay Ä°N Turkey|The main purpose of this study is to examine the factors that affect delaysin the signing of audit reports in Turkey. The audit delay is measured as a function of the numberof days that elapse from the accounting period until the date when the audit report is signed.This study utilizes a sample of 508 firms listed on the Borsa Istanbul in 2013. The findingsindicate that the companies that report net income, that have standard audit opinion releasetheir audited financial statements earlier. Variables such as auditor firm and leverage show nosignificant relationship with audit delay.
M40|Introduction to the Special Issue on Corporate Social Reporting In Central and Eastern Europe|Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) regulations, frameworks and practices have increasingly preoccupied accounting researchers over the last decades. The countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) have significantly evolved after the fall or the decline of their non-democratic regimes, and improved reporting by companies in such countries is called for and supported by international and regional organizations, as well as driven more or less successfully by local bodies. In the midst of such evolutions, CSR-related matters are an important concept materializing in the accounting academic and practitioner literature in the CEE region, as well as in the practices of local companies. We then devote this special issue of the Journal of Accounting and Management Information Systems to studying the state of CSR reporting in the CEE region. We include in this special issue six papers that treat the respective cases of Poland, Romania and Turkey as exponents of the CEE region. Results of the papers published attest to the increased interest showed by accounting researchers in the CEE region to CSR-related matters. However, a number of issues still require further investigation, such as the determinants and consequences of good CSR practices, the process of change in integrating the CSR thinking in organizations, CSR disclosures and the impact of the institutional context, the role of regional and national regulators in establishing adequate CSR regulations and frameworks that promote sound CSR practices in the region, the perception of CSR-related matters by the millennials, or the impact of Information Technology advancements on CSR practices.
M40|The Role of the Stakeholders in the Institutionalization of the CSR Reporting In Romania|Social and environmental aspects are increasingly included in the different types of reports prepared by the Romanian companies. Our research question is which are the forces that drive the institutionalization of the CSR reporting in Romania. We consider the stakeholders as the primary responsible parties for how CSR reporting is implemented. We find that the main initiatives regarding the CSR in Romania belong to the government. Also, the European institutions, through the directives approved, play a major role in CSR reporting in Romania. Our results also show that other stakeholders (companies, the academic environment or Big Four companies) play active roles in the institutionalization of CSR practices and there is an apparent need for more coordinated efforts. Evidence was found with respect to coercive and mimetic isomorphism.
M40|Archival Analysis of Corporate Social Responsibility Research: The Romanian Perspective|Corporate Social Responsibility has emerged as one of the main topics of the current economic environment, hence the accounting literature. This paper establishes the characteristics of CSR research and the contribution of authors to the incremental knowledge within Romanian context. It is a retrospective review of mapping out the defining landscape of Romanian research focused on CSR as the most referred to sustainability issue. The paper employs the archival analysis and literature review methods in order to answer its purpose. This research adds to prior published literature reviews in accounting by focusing on the particular topic of CSR. A range of information collected from 186 papers with Romanian authors, published in 46 scientific journals is analyzed. Results reporting authors’ affiliation, content, research methods, citations and references exhibit a tangible and continuous interest for the topic. The paper is expected to be of a particular interest to new researchers in sustainability accounting.
M40|An Original Assessment Tool for Transparency in the Public Sector Based On the Integrated Reporting Approach|This paper aims to provide a transparency assessment tool, highlighting the importance of disclosing qualitative information to stakeholders to increase accountability in the public sector. The agency theory, stakeholders and legitimacy theory underpinning transparency in reporting as an enabler of public accountability ensure a more holistic approach in developing the disclosure framework. The main contribution of this paper relates to its methodology, comprising both quantitative and qualitative disclosures. The quantitative index was developed by overlapping the indicative metrics from the GRI guidelines and the structure of the six capitals defined by the integrated reporting framework. Furthermore, the information comprised under each capital has been analyzed by applying the qualitative characteristics of information recommended (GRI and IR), each one being deconstructed into several evaluation criteria. This study has practical implications, providing an assessment tool for enhancing public accountability throughout greater transparency in reporting by offering interesting opportunities for further empirical studies.
M40|Etyczny aspekt teorii normatywnych rachunkowosci / Ethical Aspect of the Normative Theories of Accounting|The aim of this study is to show the ethical aspects of the so-called normative accounting theory (NT), with particular emphasis on the ethical and normative theory (EN) important for the development of accounting as a science, taking into account its social function. Attention is focused on the so-called axiological layer with regard to the methodological foundation (pragmatic methods and related metascience) regarding the work of theorists in Western Europe. Although in the years 70s shall be considered as unscientific and begin the process of domination positive theory of accounting. It seems that in the twentyfirst century takes rebirth specific ethical and social topics in accounting. The importance and usefulness of ethics in accounting due to turbulent environment changes of accounting and social needs, as well as changes within the science.
M40|Analysts’ Forecasts and Asset Pricing: A Survey|This survey reviews the literature on sell-side analysts’ forecasts and their implications for asset pricing. We review the literature on the supply and demand forces shaping analysts’ forecasting decisions as well as on the implications of the information they produce for both the cash flow and the discount rate components of security returns. Analysts’ forecasts bring prices in line with the expectations they embody, consistent with the notion that they contain information about future cash flows. However, analysts’ forecasts exhibit predictable biases, and the market appears to underreact to the information in forecasts and to not fully filter the biases in forecasts. Analysts’ forecasts are also helpful in estimating expected returns on securities, but evidence on the relation between analysts’ forecasts and expected returns is still scarce. We conclude by identifying unanswered questions and offering suggestions for future research.
M40|地域四半期gdpの推計に向けた諸課題|本稿では、地域データの利用促進を目的として、関西地域を対象に県民経済計算の 四半期化を試みた。四半期化にあたっては、内閣府「地域別支出総合指数」をもとに補 助系列を推計して年度系列を分割する「分割法」を用い、これを、全国の四半期GDP を関西地域について按分する「按分法」の結果と比較した。本稿では、以下のことが 確認された。補助系列の推定の際にあてはまりの良いものについては、按分法との乖 離が小さく、あてはまりの悪いものについては乖離が大きくなった。次に、分割法と 按分法の結果の違いは水準の違いに表れ、変化率の違いにはあまり反映されなかった。 また、按分法に比べて分割法の変動が小さくなる傾向がみられた。
M40|ORGANIZAlIONAL CULTURE - FACTOR OF EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS|Risk management is a structured and continuous process in an entity that aims to identify and assess risks and deciding on responses to the opportunities and threats that affect the achievement of objectives. The management entity creates and implements risk management process and monitor its effectiveness. Organizational culture is a set of beliefs, values that influence individual and collective performance of an organization. This is based on symbols and traditions and the essence of the organization. The role of organizational culture is to balance both at institutional level and between the organization and its external environment. Organizational culture is a much discussed topic lately, by experts in the field, but little considered by management to managing an organization.Effective management of risk management is assured if there is a risk appropriate organizational culture where staff at all levels and concept known risk strategy adopted within the organization and is aware that achieving organizational goals mastery of risk guarantees.

The result of the research revealed the tendency for users to use software tools also in the special audit assignments.
M40|Transfer pricing documentation – an efficient measure for combating the base erosion and profit shifting?|The setting up of groups of companies has become a large scale phenomenon, dominating the global economy. These groups have set up subsidiaries in different countries, leading to the occurrence of issues regarding the taxation of the results within the group, and to the development of the transfer pricing concept, respectively. This concept has been used over the time by multinational corporations to move their profits in low- tax jurisdictions. For this reason, globally, there have been concerns regarding the adoption of a legislation that could combat the base erosion and profit shifting. This article analyses whether the adoption of a legislation which provides the transfer pricing documentation requirement represents an efficient measure for the blurring of the base erosion and profit shifting phenomenon. The research was performed at the level of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The article also aims to clarify certain aspects regarding transfer pricing and to provide a practical approach of the associated mechanisms. The novelty, originality and impact of the article on the accounting profession are represented by the fact that the transfer pricing concept is relatively new for the specialists from Romania and also for the tax authorities.
M40|An analysis of budgetary goals impacting organizational performance|This study proposes a conceptual review of how budgetary goals impact organizational performance. The aim of this study is to get a better understanding of the direct and indirect relationship between the organization’s decision-making process and operational performances. Setting the budget particularly influences subordinates’ budget goal levels and motivations (i.e., budget goal acceptance and budget goal commitment), which ultimately enhances the organization’s performance. To test these relationships, data were collected using the three perspectives approach: budgetary goal, budgetary participation and budgetary evaluation. The study provided evidence that perception of fairness mediates the relation between the levels of budget participation and goal commitment, whereas goal commitment mediates the relation between fairness perceptions and performance. At the end of the article, there are some implications for SMEs industries and some suggestions for future studies.
M40|Considerations on the selection and prioritization of information security solutions|This paper provides a set of guidelines that can be used for prescribing a methodology or a detailed process for selecting and prioritizing security projects or solutions. It is based on the idea that costs of security solutions should be justified by their contribution to ensuring adequate protection of information resources in the organization which implements them. The article reviews general issues of security risks and costs, arguing the need for explicit consideration of information resources security requirements in order to validate decisions concerning security projects implementation. In such an approach, security requirements of information resources are used as a reference system to quantify the benefits and limitations of security solutions defined as alternative or complementary responses to certain security risks as their implementation faces budget constraints.
M40|Corporate Governance And Strength Of Auditing And Reporting Standards: A Cross-Country Survey| The purpose of this cross-country empirical survey is to investigate the relationship between the strength of auditing and reporting standards and some corporate governance characteristics such as efficacy of corporate boards and ethical behaviour of firms. All three variables were captured through the indicators included in the report of World Economic Forum entitled “The Global Competitiveness Report 2012-2013” selected for 144 countries from all over the world. The findings validate the research hypothesis concerning the significant influence of some of the corporate governance dimensions on the strength of auditing and reporting standards, from a cross-country perspective.
M40|Debt signaling and outside investors in early stage firms|By imposing a market like governance and directing entrepreneurs towards professional management, debt, and especially business debt, can serve as a reliable signal for outside equity investors. Such signals of firm accountability can alleviate the stringent information asymmetry at the early stages of the firm, and become stronger for bank business debt, in the presence of personal debt, and in high capital industries. Using the Kauffman Firm Survey, we find evidence consistent with our hypotheses. Outside investors can rely on the governance role of debt and its underpinnings such as the bank-firm relationship. We also corroborate that young firms tend to focus on growth rather than profitability.
M40|Specific Restrictions And Theoretical Background For Joint-Stock Company Equity|"This article considers approaches to the economic content of the concept of equity, as well as the theoretical and scientific analysis of the definitions (perspectives) and their functions.

M40|Accounting in central banks|This paper examines the important but not often discussed issue of accounting in central banks. It highlights the distinguishing factors that make the financial statements of central banks unique relative to those produced by other bodies. We begin by explaining why central banks produce financial statements. We then discuss a variety of specific topics in central bank accounting. In terms of balance sheet items, we discuss banknotes, shareholders’ equity, gold, foreign exchange and financial instruments. Our discussion of the income statement then centres on profit recognition and distribution.
M40|Auditor`S Requirements And European Funds|"European funds are an important source of financing both the private and public institutions that make capital investments of national interest. After accessing some European projects, auditing is mandatory and is performed by auditors authorized by the Chamber of Financial Auditors of Romania. The reference framework which underpins the auditing of European projects is ISRS 4400 ""Missions on agreed upon procedures regarding financial information"" and The Code of Ethics emitted by the International Federation of Accountants. The Code of Ethics presents the fundamental ethical principles that a professional must comply when offering his services and these are: integrity, objectivity, professional competence, confidentiality, professional behavior."
M40|Emphasizing The Performance Management Of The Project Cycle|Investment projects financed from European funds is performed in a sequence of steps, starting with a strategic development document which shows the need for a project in a particular area (infrastructure, environment, tourism, etc.), then it is formulated, implemented and finally its results are evaluated in order to create conditions necessary for the development of future actions. A specific feature is the emphasis on performance management, resulted in two key points of the project cycle, relative accepting the grant application by the Intermediate Bodies / Managing Authorities and final reporting of the results. This requires coordination of activities, cooperation of all relevant actors in order to achieve coagulation efforts managing budgets and investment programs should be better integrated in order to have better results in the implementation.
M40|An Etymological Approach To The Moldavian Chart Of Accounts|Empirical research in accounting history can help the scholar gain a better insight into the various cultural influences that shape the reasoning of accounting professionals. An empirical approach to accounting history can provide an additional dimension to the context which shapes the underlying principles and practices. For the purpose of this paper, an etymological analysis was performed on the chart of accounts from the Republic of Moldova since March 2015, with the purpose of identifying the various layers of the accounting terminology and their probable corresponding periods in history. The research reveals a surprising linguistic profile which has not been influenced significantly by the Soviet Union, with major influences being drawn from the 19th and early 20th centuries.
M40|An Assessment Of The Transparency Level In Romanian Public Universities|Transparency in the public sector is of paramount importance for the general sentiment of trust in the system itself, as public servants are publicly accountable for the use of and effects on public resources. In this respect, ensuring an increase in transparency would allow these public servants to discharge accountability accordingly and would provide the necessary frame for assessment of public resource use from stakeholders. This paper aims to determine whether transparency levels are adequate in the case of Romanian public universities, using a refined assessment tool which consists of multiple criteria based on principles and required elements for the reduction of information asymmetry. Our findings show that overall, in the case of Romanian public universities, the transparency level is high and there is a prerequisite to ensure the fair judgement from stakeholders.

M40|Determinants Of Financial Structure Of Greek Companies|Capital structure is essential for the survival, growth and performance of a firm. There has been a growing interest worldwide in identifying the factors associated with debt leverage. This article aims to investigate the factors affecting the capital structure of companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE). The data set used is composed of indicators reflecting the financial position and performance of 40 firms listed on the ASE in 2014. Using a regression model we estimate in what extent the financial structure of companies is affected by performance indicators and other specific factors like the field of activity or the size of the firms. The results obtained show an important influence of share of tangible assets in total assets of the company on the financial leverage, as main variable selected in order to reflect the capital structure of Greek companies.
M40|Accounting Policies Effects On Depreciation And Evaluation Of Balance Sheet|In the actual context of accounting nomination and globalization, the requirement for information which reflects the reality and which allows comparison between time and space may be satisfied only by respecting the main accounting principles. These principles, together with accounting policies are the main elements which concur for obtaining a truthful image reflected in financial situations. The elements / items of financial situation are being evaluated according to the main accounting principles, being taken into consideration the limits of accrual accounting. Starting from the diversity of principles and rules that exist within the accounting, this paper aims to form a main problematic frame concerning the principle of the method’s constancy, whose purpose is applying the same registration, evaluation and presentation methods for operations, transactions, and balance sheet elements.
M40|Benford’S Law In The Case Of Hungarian Whole-Sale Trade Sector|Benford’s law has attracted many researchers for detecting the fraudulent data and can be used as one of the digital analysis tools for auditing of the accounting data. In this treatise, the accuracy of figures reported in Hungarian Trading Companies’ data are examined through digital analysis technique with the consideration of Benford’s Law. The net sales data from the period of year 2009 to 2014 has been used for detecting the anomalies and to confirm whether the digit-pattern follows Benford’s distribution. Through the obtained results we claimed that the frequencies of first and second digits’ place follow the Benford’s theoretical distribution and exhibits to close conformity. Moreover analysis of the second, first-order and second-order gave a mixed result of close conformity to significant deviation from expected frequency. Also the absolute deviation (MAD) value of first and second digit suggest an overall conformity of the data to Benford’s distribution.
M40|Towards Integrated Reporting: Analysis Of Information Published On The Companiesâ€™ Websites That Could Be Part Of The Integrated Reporting|Integrated reporting is a new approach to corporate reporting which is rapidly gaining international recognition. Integrated reporting is based on integrated thinking, which include interconnectivity of strategy, performance, risk and incentives and helps to identify sources of value creation. In this paper are summarized the need for integrated reporting, companiesâ€™ benefits of its implementation as well as content of the integrated report. The aim of the paper is to increase the awareness of the companies about integrated reporting especially in the Republic of Macedonia due to the absence of its implementation in Macedonian companies realized by pre-research phase about implementation of integrated reporting conducted on companies listed on Macedonian stock exchange. Furthermore, as a result of the negative results from the pre-research phase, it is made qualitative analysis about publication of information through the companiesâ€™ websites that might be part of the integrated report if it commence to be prepared by the companies.
M40|Uncovering expected returns: Information in analyst coverage proxies|We show that analyst coverage proxies contain information about expected returns. We decompose analyst coverage into abnormal and expected components using a simple characteristic-based model and show that firms with abnormally high analyst coverage subsequently outperform firms with abnormally low coverage by approximately 80 basis points per month. We also show abnormal coverage rises following exogenous shocks to underpricing and predicts improvements in firms’ fundamental performance, suggesting that return predictability stems from analysts more heavily covering underpriced stocks. Our findings highlight the usefulness of analysts’ actions in expected return estimations, and a potential inference problem when coverage proxies are used to study information asymmetry and dissemination.
M40|Made in the U.S.A.? A Study of Firm Responses to Domestic Production Incentives|How do U.S. companies respond to incentives intended to encourage domestic manufacturing? I study the Domestic Production Activities Deduction (DPAD), which was enacted in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and was the third largest U.S. corporate tax expenditure as of 2017. Using confidential data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, I find greater average domestic investment spending of $143.6-$146.8 million, but only within the sample of domestic-only firms and not until 2010, when the greatest statutory DPAD benefits were available. Additional evidence suggests that U.S. multinational claimants invest abroad rather than in the U.S. and that the increased investment by DPAD firms is accompanied by a reduction in the domestic workforce, consistent with a substitution of capital for labor. I show that the delayed investment response is due to firms engaging in other responses first, such as changing corporate reporting to shift income across time and borders. Quantifying the extent of these effects contributes to the literature that studies this tax deduction and informs policy makers as to the effectiveness of both manufacturing incentives and U.S. corporate income tax rate reductions in stimulating real domestic activity.
M40|Do Personnel Stability, Family Business and Auditor Influence Financial Restatement?|This paper explores how the interaction of four conditions (chief director stability, top management stability, family business and firms with Big4 auditor) results in restatements. This paper uses qualitative comparative analysis, which is a relatively new method applied in accounting research to examine the cause of the restatements systematically. The results show firms not audited by Big4 and family business are more possible to restate the financial reports due to accounting type errors. The results also imply that non family business audited by Big4 or family controlled firms not audited by Big4 have more chance to restate the financial reports due to material accounting errors. Last family business not audited by Big4 has more chance to restate the financial reports voluntarily.
M40|An Investigation into the Determinants of Risk Disclosure in Banks: Evidence from Financial Sector of Pakistan|The purpose of this paper is to find the determinants of quantity as well as quality of the risk disclosures in annual reports of banking sector of Pakistan. The paper employs the word count approach to measure the quantity of risk disclosures in annual reports whereas to measure the risk disclosure quality (RDQ), RDQ index is adapted from the study by Barakat and Hussainey in 2013 after making some changes. The researcher selected a data sample on desired variables for a period of 7-year (2008-2014) through 31 scheduled banks (excluding 7 Foreign Banks) and run generalized least square as the researcher supposed there was an effect of endogeneity in the model. The researcher found confirmation that, banks with a higher proportion of independent non-executive board directors, lower ownership proportion of executive management, banks with a high asset value and banks having non-governmental ownership tend to present to their stakeholders a higher degree of risk disclosure in terms of volume of information as well as quality of the disclosure. Practically, the results recommend that there should be strict regulations by the supervisory body to enhance the quantity and quality of risk disclosure by banks in their annual reports. Further, audit committees of the banking institutions should positively play their vital role in this regard. As another practical suggestion, the findings demonstrate that banking institutions operating in Pakistan may improve their own RDQ and quantity by appointing independent outside board directors and ensuring the audit committee activities as effective monitors of risk disclosure and advisors for risk disclosure management at bank level.
M40|Risk Disclosure Practices among Malaysian Listed Firms|This study discusses the development of risk disclosure policy in Malaysia after the 1997 financial crisis and provides evidence on the importance of risk disclosure over the recent years. Analysis on the trend of risk disclosure based on the new development was carried out through content analysis. The findings show positive trend of development in risk disclosure practices in Malaysia over the period of 2001-2011. In addition, risk disclosure sentences were found to be insufficient and should be rectified. There is a need to revisit the current regulations and standards to improve the risk disclosure practices and to follow internationally-based accounting policy.
M40|Creation of Provision for Doubtful Debts|The purpose of this study is to develop methods of creation of provision for doubtful debts. It was proposed to use two methods of provisioning for doubtful debts, both individually and in the aggregate. The first method is percentage of sales approach that is used in international standards. Its use requires to calculate the average percentage of doubtful debt by determining the average ratio of the outstanding accounts receivable to revenue volume over 3-5 years. This method is recommended for use to organizations with a large number of debtors with minor amounts of debts. The second method, developed by the authors, takes into account the timing of incurring of debt, the solvency of the debtor and the risk of non-repayment. It is advisable to apply for debtors with significant amounts of debt. Using the author’s method, the provision for doubtful debts was calculated according to the data from the existing company “Elephant” LLC for 2015, which resulted in revealing the deviation in the amount of the provision from the actual data. The use of the proposed methods will improve the reliability of the accounting (financial) statements in terms of the reflection of the receivables and simplify the work of accountants in finding a method to create a provision for doubtful debts.
M40|A Sustainability Accounting: Case Study on Exploration, Production and Midstream Activities at Maersk Oil|This paper gives a short introduction to sustainable accounting and its essential measurement problems.

M40|Do Reviews by External Auditors Improve the Information Content of Interim Financial Statements?|In the last decades, regulators around the world have increasingly mandated stricter assurance requirements for interim reporting. In several countries, firms must have their interim financial statements reviewed by an external auditor. However, there is little evidence to indicate whether auditor assurance is desirable for interim financial statements. We address this gap and analyze whether investors care about a review of interim financial statements. By exploiting a setting in which firms can voluntarily decide to buy a review, we find that the publication of reviewed interim financial statements causes more abnormal return volatility as well as abnormal trading volume than the publication of un-reviewed interim financial statements. Additional analyses reveal that the increase in information content is largely driven by a signaling effect of the review rather than by an increase in earnings quality. The findings inform the current political debate of mandating reviews for interim financial statements in several jurisdictions.
M40|Discussion of “Do Reviews by External Auditors Improve the Information Content of Interim Financial Statements”|Kajüter, Klassmann, and Nienhaus (forthcoming) investigate a topical and challenging question: “How do investors and other stakeholders use and react to the reviewed interim financial statements?” In this discussion I show that the research question is timely, relevant, and important. I discuss what the paper shows and what it does not show. I highlight the underlying question “should reviews of interim financial statements be mandatory?” and link it to a joint-question, “should interim financial statements be mandatory?” Finally I address avenues for future research.
M40|Culture and Cost Stickiness: A Cross-country Study|In this study, we examine the effect of national culture on managerial decision-making through the lens of cost stickiness. Recent studies document that managerial discretion in adjusting resources leads to costs that are “sticky” in that costs respond less to decreases in activity than to increases in activity. We analyze how different dimensions of societal culture explain cross-country variation in cost stickiness. Using a sample of firms from 39 countries, we find that cost stickiness is less pronounced in countries with higher uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, and long-term orientation. Our findings support the proposition that culture affects resource management decisions made by managers and, in doing so, our study makes a significant contribution in understanding differences in sticky cost behavior observed across countries.
M40|Ruling Family Political Connections and Risk Reporting: Evidence from the GCC|This study examines whether the presence of ruling family members on boards of directors influences the extent and the quality of risk reporting. Based on a sample of publicly listed financial firms of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries between 2007 and 2011, our regression results show that ruling family board members reduce the quality and extent of risk disclosures. Firms with ruling family board members also disclose significantly less during periods of financial distress and when they are subject to higher levels of risk. We find that risk reporting is negatively associated with the existence of a ruling family director acting as the board chairperson, negatively associated with increasing proportions of ruling family directors on the board, and negatively associated with increasing numbers of board members who are connected to ruling family directors. Our results suggest that politically connected directors seize private benefits at the expense of their firms' shareholders. Our regression results hold after a series of robustness checks that control for endogeneity and for alternative measures of ruling family membership.
M40|Compensation or feedback: Motivating performance in multidimensional tasks|Employees often perform tasks with multiple dimensions. In this study, we examine how employees' performance on multidimensional tasks differs under different control structures. We conduct two experiments in which we manipulate the presence of compensation controls and the presence of feedback controls on multiple task dimensions. Our findings suggest that when employees are compensated on multiple dimensions they commit to multiple goals and divide their attention among those task dimensions. However, when feedback controls are implemented on one task dimension with compensation controls on another dimension, employees can improve performance on individual dimensions as well as their overall task performance. As a result, we find that employee performance on a multidimensional task can be higher when firms compensate employees on one task dimension and provide feedback on the other task dimension than when firms compensate on both task dimensions. This study highlights the benefits of complementing compensation-based controls (i.e., incentive pay) with non-compensation based controls (e.g., feedback), and provides a theoretical basis to help explain the prevalence of this approach in practice.
M40|Analyst coverage and IPO management forecasts|Given the all-importance of analyst coverage for IPO firms, we examine the interaction between the initiation of analyst coverage and management forecast disclosure in IPO prospectuses. We find that IPO firms that provide a prospectus forecast are more likely to receive coverage (and earlier), particularly from lower quality analysts. The depth of coverage, measured by the number of analysts issuing a recommendation on the firm, is also greater for forecasters. These results hold after controlling for potential endogeneity due to simultaneity in management decision to provide a forecast and analysts' decision to cover the firm. Further analyses show that reputation concerns matter to analyst coverage decisions — conditional on firms providing a prospectus forecast, the likelihood of receiving coverage decreases with the magnitude of the absolute management forecast error. There is evidence of quid pro quo where the analyst working for the underwriter of the IPO aligns her forecast with the management forecast more than unaffiliated analysts. Insofar as management forecasts are important to coverage decision and analyst coverage is valuable, our research has important implications for strengthening the safe harbour provision for prospectus forecasts in litigious environments such as that in the U.S.
M40|The effect of overvaluation on investment and accruals: The role of information|This paper examines whether the effect of overvaluation on accrual and investment is weak in a good information environment using the naive manager hypothesis and the monitoring hypothesis. The results show that CEOs recognize overvaluation and reduce their shareholdings regardless of the extent of the information environment and the naive manager hypothesis is not supported. However, managers in a good information environment do not respond to overvaluation with accrual or investment, and more institutional investors help to reduce overvaluation-driven behaviors. Thus, the monitoring hypothesis is supported. These findings are free from causality concerns and robust for alternative measures of misvaluation.
M40|New findings on repurchase anomaly — The first-month effect|Prior studies find positive abnormal returns following share repurchase announcements. We examine the association between announcement month and the excess returns. We find that the average excess return is consistently higher for repurchases announced in the first month of a fiscal quarter than for those announced in the other two months. Interestingly, 1st-month and non-1st-month announcers are highly comparable in firm characteristics, pre-announcement returns, and disclosed motives. The magnitude of the first-month effect barely changes after we switch to multivariate regressions, and it remains large under firm-fixed effects. Investment strategies based on BTM, firm size, and pre-announcement return are all improved by a first-month strategy. The first-month effect extends well beyond the first year, but the market does not seem to realize it. We propose an explanation for the first-month effect based on the conjecture that managers receive firm information in an uneven manner throughout a fiscal period. This explanation is supported by our empirical tests. Additional empirical analyses provide results that fail to support several plausible alternative explanations.
M40|Finance methodology of Free Cash Flow|Free Cash Flow (FCF) was adopted in the late 1980s as a financial tool to evaluate the firm and its individual projects. We question the procedure of calculating the FCF where a significant portion of Current Liabilities is offset against Current Assets, thereby creating the hybrid asset Net Working Capital (NWC). Borrowed from accounting methodology, that procedure distorts the FCF size, composition, volatility, and estimated value. Our empirical analysis shows that the nature and extent of those distortions can misinform the firm's stockholders, lenders and borrowers, and investors at large. We propose a revised FCF that would avoid those distortions.
M40|The confounding effect of cost stickiness on conservatism estimates|Sales decreases affect earnings more than sales increases because of cost stickiness. We hypothesize that this correlated omitted variable constitutes a confounding effect in standard asymmetric timeliness models. Controlling for a piecewise linear effect of sales changes in these models decreases the measured asymmetric timeliness significantly and changes inferences about the average level of conservatism and the extent of cross-sectional variation in conservatism. Validation tests confirm that the asymmetry for sales changes is consistent with sticky costs and is distinct from conditional conservatism. Future empirical research on conditional conservatism should recognize the potential confounding effect of sticky costs.
M40|The association between corporate general counsel and firm credit risk|This paper examines whether bond market participants alter their credit risk assessments of firms that appoint the corporate general counsel (GC) to senior management. GCs may place less emphasis on their gatekeeping responsibilities upon appointment to senior management, thus potentially resulting in increased firm credit risk. Using changes in firm-level credit ratings and credit default swap spreads to proxy for changes in credit risk, we find a positive association between GC promotions to senior management and increases in firm credit risk. Additionally, the increased personal liability for GCs under the Sarbanes–Oxley Act only partially mitigates this association.
M40|Measuring the probability of financial covenant violation in private debt contracts|We measure the probability that a borrower will violate financial covenants in private debt contracts. We analyze hand-coded data and specify standard covenant definitions using Compustat data that minimize measurement error for all individual Dealscan covenants. We use these definitions to create a measure of aggregate probability of violation, which can be used across all covenants in a loan or among covenant subsets of interest. We provide evidence that our aggregate probability measure is superior to alternatives used in prior literature.
M40|Do information releases increase or decrease information asymmetry? New evidence from analyst forecast announcements|Prior literature documents that both earnings announcements and management earnings forecasts increase information asymmetry at announcement. In contrast, we predict and document that analyst earnings forecasts decrease information asymmetry at announcement. As expected, this directional contrast is temporary, in that all three information release types lead to a decrease in information asymmetry following the short-window announcement period. Our evidence demonstrates that the direction of the effect of a public information release on announcement-period information asymmetry is determined by how the information contained in the release relates to prior information held by sophisticated and unsophisticated investors, which supports extant disclosure theory.
M40|The activities of buy-side analysts and the determinants of their stock recommendations|We survey 344 buy-side analysts from 181 investment firms and conduct 16 detailed follow-up interviews to gain insights into the activities of buy-side analysts, including the determinants of their compensation, the inputs to their stock recommendations, their beliefs about financial reporting quality, and the role of sell-side analysts in buy-side research. One important finding is that 10-K or 10-Q reports are more useful than quarterly conference calls and management earnings guidance for determining buy-side analysts׳ stock recommendations. Our results also suggest that sell-side analysts add value by providing buy-side analysts with in-depth industry knowledge and access to company management.
M40|Using unstructured and qualitative disclosures to explain accruals|We examine the usefulness of support vector regressions (SVRs) in assessing the content of unstructured, qualitative disclosures by relating MD&A-based SVR-accrual estimates (MD&A accruals) to actual accruals. We find that MD&A accruals explain a statistically and economically significant portion of firm-level accruals and identify more persistent accruals. We find that the explanatory power of MD&A accruals is higher for more readable 10-Ks, thereby providing evidence for the construct validity of the readability measures. To highlight the flexibility of the SVR method, we apply it to other dependent variables and disclosures. We find that MD&A-based cash-flow forecasts produced by SVR predict next period’s cash flows. We apply SVR to conference call transcripts and find accruals estimates have similar explanatory power to MD&A accruals. Finally, the explanatory power of MD&A accruals increases between 1994 and 2013.
M40|Rank and file employees and the discovery of misreporting: The role of stock options|We find that firms grant more rank and file stock options when involved in financial reporting violations, consistent with managements’ incentives to discourage employee whistle-blowing. Violating firms grant more rank and file options during periods of misreporting relative to control firms and to their own option grants in non-violation years. Moreover, misreporting firms that grant more rank and file options during violation years are more likely to avoid whistle-blowing allegations. Although the Dodd-Frank Act (2010) offers financial rewards to encourage whistle-blowing, our findings suggest that firms discourage whistle-blowing by giving employees incentives to remain quiet about financial irregularities.
M40|Derivatives usage, securitization, and the crash sensitivity of bank stocks|We show that the information on derivatives usage and securitization activities of U.S. banks as disclosed in their pre-crisis 10-K filings explains extreme equity returns of banks during the financial crisis. Stocks of banks that had previously disclosed a more extensive use of financial derivatives and loan securitization were more likely to experience extreme losses. Our findings are consistent with investors viewing banks that used derivatives for non-hedging purposes as highly vulnerable to the crisis. Moreover, banks which had significant securitization activities and were thus potentially exposed to under-capitalized risks from conduits possess a higher vulnerability of their equity to market downturns.
M40|Regulations, institutions and income smoothing by managing technical reserves: International evidence from the insurance industry|This paper investigates the role of technical reserves in the income smoothing behavior of insurance companies. This is one of the first attempts in the literature to trace such relationship in the insurance industry, especially at a multi-country setting. The experience of 770 insurance firms operating in 87 countries over the period 2000–2009 reveals that there is a significant evidence of income smoothing. The paper also finds that institutional characteristics, e.g., the rule of law, common law legal origin, economic freedom, and regulations relating to technical provisions and supervisory power constrain income smoothing but other factors such as capital requirements, tax deductibility of provisions, auditing, and corporate governance do not have a significant effect.
M40|Measuring the inadequacy of IRR in PFI schemes using profitability index and AIRR|The internal rate of return (IRR) is widely used in Private Finance Initiative (PFI) schemes in the UK for measuring performance. However, it is well-known that the IRR may be a misleading indicator of economic profitability. Treasury Guidance (2004) recognises that the IRR should not be used and net present value (NPV) should be calculated instead, unless the cash flow pattern is even. The distortion generated by the IRR can be quantified by the notion of scheduling effect, introduced in Cuthbert and Cuthbert (2012). We combine this notion with the notion of average IRR (AIRR), introduced in Magni (2010, 2013) and show that a positive scheduling effect arises if the AIRR, relative to a flat payment stream, exceeds the project's IRR. The scheduling component can be measured in two separate ways, in terms of specific AIRRs, one of which enables the scheduling component to be decomposed into relative capital and relative rate components. We also highlight the role of average capital, whose quotation in the market, in association with IRRs or AIRRs, would deepen the economic analysis of the project.
M40|Divergent effects of external financing on technology innovation activity: Korean evidence|This paper explores a variety of effects of external financing subdivided into bank loans and bond and stock issues on the technology innovation activity (TIA) of Korean listed firms for the full sample period of 1st January 2000 to 31st December 2008. We find evidence that indirect external financing of bank loans makes a negative impact on TIA of the Korean firms whereas direct external financing of security issues does a positive one on it. The results support the hypothesis of manager discretion that banks' conservative lending criteria demanding considerable collaterals from firms discourage managers from an investment in TIA with high risk-high return while external financing via security issues grants managers more discretion for their TIA. This study building up the prior literature that primarily devote to an effect of internal financing on TIA of firms provides firm managers or academic researchers with valuable implications for evaluation of various impacts and roles of external financing in association with financing decisions for TIA of firms.
M40|Market exit through divestment: the effect of accounting bias on competition|We analyze the effect of accounting bias on the competition and market structure of an industry. In our model, firms interim accounting reports on investment projects may contain bias introduced by the mandatory accounting system. We find that this bias strictly decreases firm's profits when investors do not have an abandonment option, but different results emerge when we allow the investors to divest in the interim. Specifically, a conservative accounting regime may increase the likelihood of projects being discontinued, inducing some firms to exit from the product market and leaving rivals to capture their market share. A conservative regime can thus soften market competition and result in ex ante higher investment payoff, higher consumer surplus, and higher total social welfare. Since industries often have common reporting standards, we also identify the degrees of industry-wide accounting bias that maximize the expected investor payoffs. Finally, we allow for investors to coordinate their divestment decisions when both firms report unfavorable costs and show an improvement to both firms profits and consumer surplus.
M40|Management accounting in context: industry, regulation and informatics|This commentary is based on the remarks I made as the chair of the panel on “the future of management accounting research” on the occasion of the Management Accounting Research 25th Anniversary Conference at the London School of Economics in April 2015. The three panelist’s contributions are published in this issue immediately following this commentary, and cover perspectives on management accounting research “in context” related to the panelists’ chosen applications of industry, regulation or regulatory “shocks”, and informatics or, especially, “big data”. The audience at the conference also wanted to hear my views on the future direction of the journal as the then‐incoming Editor-in-Chief of Management Accounting Research. I offer a few thoughts on this in the second part of my commentary.
M40|From peer review to PCAOB inspections: regulating for audit quality in the U.S|This study reviews the existing literature on the U.S. peer review system and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) inspection system to assess our knowledge of audit regulation. The traditional self-regulatory system of the accounting profession came to an end, in 2002, when the PCAOB was established to oversee the audit firms of publicly traded companies. This paper contributes to the controversial debate about self-regulation versus independent regulation by analyzing, categorizing, and comparing the research findings on the peer review system and the PCAOB system along three dimensions: the validity of peer reviews and PCAOB inspections, the recognition of reviews and inspections by decision-makers (e.g., investors, bankers, committees), and the effect of reviews and inspections on audit quality. Synthesizing the research on the regulatory regimes suggests that the notion of external quality control, both through peer reviews and government inspections, is positively linked with an improvement of audit quality. At the same time, the analysis indicates that external users do not seem to recognise peer review and PCAOB reports as very useful instruments for decision-making, which is in line with an identified rather skeptical perception of the audit profession on reviews and inspections. Overall, this study reveals that although the academic literature on peer review and PCAOB inspection is extensive it has not produced definitive conclusions concerning various aspects of audit regulation. This paper shows how this blurred picture is due to conflicting research findings, the dominance of the quantitative research paradigm, and unchallenged assumptions within the literature, and concludes by proposing research opportunities for the future.

M40|Quantifying, economising, and marketising: democratising the social sphere?|In recent decades, there has been an avalanche of numbers in public life, one that matches that which occurred in the first half of the nineteenth century. The difference today is that many of the numbers that are now so central to political rule pertain to performance, and depend on a felicitous interlocking of quantifying, economising, and marketising. The calculated management of life is at a critical juncture, and it is essential that we consider carefully how this is affecting who we are, what we have become, and who we wish to be. Only a few decades ago, this bandwagon seemed limited or at least focused in its reach, yet it now appears as if no domain of human endeavour can escape. We argue that it is important to differentiate quantifying, economising, and marketising, so as to counter the often phobic response to the unrelenting march of numbers in modern political rule. We call for greater attention to the role of accounting numbers, for accounting numbers go beyond the abstract models of economics and allow a form of action on the actions of others that economics does not. We argue also for greater attention to the conditionality of the performativity of quantification, so that we can identify the conditions under which numbers produce effects, and the varying nature and extent of those effects. Finally, we consider the thorny issue of “democratising” the social sphere, and note that it is only recently that quantification has been largely annexed by the phenomenon dubbed neoliberalism.
M40|“L'État c'est moi”....ou quoi? On the interrelations of accounting, managing and governing in the French ‘administrative monarchy’: revisiting the Colbert (1661-1683) and Paris brothers (1712-1726) episodes|We explore the genesis of the modern power of management and accounting, reviewing two historical episodes that have been claimed to embody aspects of this modernity. For our analysis we distinguish two aspects of double-entry bookkeeping (DEB): first, the basic bookkeeping technique of cross-referencing and analysing doubled entries (Sangster, 2016), and second ‘the full logic’ of a closed system tracking an entity’s income and expense, assets and liabilities and ‘capital’ (Mattessich, 2000). Our first episode is Colbert’s ‘governing by inquiry’ (1661-1683), understood as a ‘managing’ of the French ‘administrative state’ under Louis XIV, where we see DEB’s use as limited to the first technique, undertaken for a forensic auditing of tax revenues to control and amend bad conduct. Second is the episode (1712-1726) of a banking family, the Paris brothers, where DEB is again first deployed similarly, for auditing and control of tax farmer practice, but then proposed as more general means of managing/governing the state. We review the interpretations of the first of these episodes made by Miller (1990) and Soll (2009; 2014), and that of Lemarchand (1999) concerning the second. We draw on Foucault’s analysis of today’s forms of governing as a ‘governmental management’ (2007: 107-8), which was blocked in the era of the administrative state, and explain this blockage as a result of principal-agent structures being used to govern the state. In this light, we see Miller as overinterpreting the closeness of Colbert’s ‘governing by inquiry’ to modern ‘governmentality’, and Soll as overinterpreting modern forms of management and accounting as operative in the governing approach of Colbert as ‘Information Master’. We also re-analyze the effective reach of the ambitions of the Paris brothers, as set out by Lemarchand, for the deployment of DEB. We then draw on Foucault’s (2001) and Panofsky ‘s (1957) analyses of ‘inquiry’ as a ‘form of truth’ which began as a new twelfth-century way of thinking, and trace this to Abelard’s development of ‘inquisitio’ as a new ‘critical reading’ (cf. Hoskin & Macve, 1986). We characterise its modus operandi as a ‘graphocentric synopticism’, graphocentric since all ‘data’ are translated into a gridded, cross-referenced über-text, which is then readable synoptically, all-in-one, from an immobile synthesising position. Foucault (2001) suggests that ‘inquiry’ gives way as mode of truth to ‘examination’ around 1800, and we link the genesis of governmental management to this shift and to the consequent articulation of a ‘panopticism’ which is multiply semiotic and so ‘grammatocentric’.
M40|Biodiversity and local government: a reporting and accountability perspective|Purpose - – The purpose of this study is to illuminate the disclosure of biodiversity material contained in the reported information of 151 local government authorities (LGAs) in New South Wales, Australia. The introduction of the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (an international treaty to sustain the rich diversity of life on earth) has made the issue of fauna management and monitoring, and the associated requirement for cost-effective information, much more important. As local communities are best placed to make decisions about the protection of their local environments, the content in external reports and other disclosures allows stakeholders to gauge how accountable LGAs are regarding the conservation of biodiversity within their geographical jurisdiction. Design/methodology/approach - – Content analysis was used to analyze the disclosures of these LGAs. Findings - – The results reveal marked differences in the reporting of biodiversity issues. In fact, LGAs in the state of New South Wales (Australia) have been, at best, lukewarm in their disclosure of strategic information relating to biodiversity, particularly in their strategic goals and plans. Originality/value - – This paper contributes to the academic literature on biodiversity reporting by investigating existing reporting practices and providing evidence that a universally adopted framework for biodiversity reporting and reporting of local native fauna is required. In particular, the impacts of these practices need to be properly understood for LGAs to provide accountability to their stakeholders.
M40|Gauging the Impact of Country-Specific Values on the Acceptability of Global Management Accounting Principles|The implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in many countries brings with it the necessity to upgrade and further train in-company private accountants to comply with these new external reporting requirements. As part of this process, it is assumed that company accountants will also be expected to perform the internal management accounting functions of the firm in a more efficient and effective manner in accordance with internationally recognized best practices. The full range of management accounting activities includes cost and profitability analysis and reporting, decision support analysis, and a variety of activities relating to the planning and budgeting process. It has previously been observed that a countryâ€™s cultural and accounting values can have an impact on the success of its IFRS implementation. (Borker D. R., 2013) Furthermore, a more recent study indicates the likelihood that Global Management Accounting Principles (GMAP) as currently proposed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), may also be found more or less acceptable based on country specific cultural and accounting values. (Borker D. R., Manuscript) This paper addresses the possible impact of such values on the management accounting activities of a firm. Specifically, it examines the potential impact on GMAP acceptability by different countries. Using Hofstede cultural values (Hofstede, 1980), and a set of accounting values based on Grayâ€™s original work (Gray, 1988), expanded to include other socio-cultural factors, (Borker D. R., 2014) an analysis is conducted based on a worldwide twelve-country sample. Management Accounting standards, discussed here, are based the Global Management Accounting Principles proposed the AICPA and CIMA. Results of the analysis indicate that cultural and accounting values of individual countries may have a differential impact of the acceptability and success of firms in implementing international management accounting standards.
M40|Self-employed Person, Family Enterprise, Individual Enterprise: A Legal, Fiscal and Accounting Perspective|An ambitious initiative of the European Commission, also presented the Europe 2020 Strategy, is that, by 2020, 75% of the population aged between 20 and 64 be employed. The responsibility for action in this regard must not belong to governments only, but also to companies, trade unions, NGOs, local authorities and to each person individually. An important role in creating jobs in Romania is played by the self-employed persons, individual enterprises and family enterprises. They offer unemployed people the opportunity to bring their contribution to the economy and society. In this paper, we have proposed an analysis of the self-employed persons, individual enterprises and family enterprises as ways to exercise the free enterprise and a person’s free access to an economic activity, in three areas: legal, taxation and accounting.
M40|Il ruolo degli strumenti di cost management nello sviluppo di nuovi prodotti sostenibili|The literature on performance measurement in Research and Development addresses several topics. This paper investigates the role played by cost management in new product development activities. Particularly the adoption of Activity-Based Costing/Management, Target Costing/Design to Cost, Life Cycle Costing, Total Cost of Ownership is investigated through a survey of 65 companies working in Italy. The findings are interesting because they highlight how firms in Italy reacted to the increased competition and price stagnation during the economy slowdown. Firms respond to the crisis by developing new green products and services mainly in order to satisfy needs of loyal customers, acquire new customer in the same market and increase profitability of sales. Furthermore it emerges a significant strategic orientation towards sustainability and a considerable implementation of cost management tools on development activities focusing on Activity-Based Costing/Management and Life Cycle costing, mainly on those firms more oriented toward sustainability strategies.
M40|The role of financial reporting and transparency in corporate governance|The authors review recent literature on the role of corporate financial reporting and transparency in reducing governance-related agency conflicts between managers, directors, shareholders, and other stakeholders—most notably financial regulators—and suggest some avenues for future research. Key themes include the endogenous nature of governance mechanisms with respect to information asymmetry between contracting parties, the heterogeneous nature of the informational demands of contracting parties, and the corresponding heterogeneity of the associated governance mechanisms. The authors also emphasize the role of credible commitment to financial reporting transparency in facilitating informal multiperiod contracts among managers, directors, shareholders, and other stakeholders. Finally, they discuss the importance of regulatory supervision and oversight as a class of governance mechanisms that is particularly important for banks and financial institutions.
M40|Determining the Importance Level of Accounting Information for Investors’ Decision Making|The aim of this study was to determine the precedence order of the accounting information (factors) influencing choice of investment, to derive the relative weight of each factor and to identify differences and similarities in such factors between accounting experts and finance experts. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology was used for the outranking of accounting information (Baker & Haslem, 1973) including future economic outlook of the company, quality of management, future economic outlook of the industry in which the firm is a part, expected future growth in sales, financial strength of the company, expected future percentage growth in the company’s earnings per share, reputation of the company, rate of return the company earn on its assets, ease with which the company can sell its assets in case of failure, size of the company, expected future level of long-term interest rate on corporate bonds, value of a share of stock based on the company’s accounting records (book value) etc. The questionnaires were answered by accounting and finance experts. In this study, subjective opinions of accounting and finance experts turn into quantitative form with Analytic Hierarchy Process. Results of this study can be used by investors, Ministry of Economy, finance, accounting, business and economy students, professionals and academicians etc.
M40|Accounting and Analytical Support of Management: Concept and Structure|The article investigates the essence of the concept of 'accounting and analytical support', clarifying its definition and disclosure of its relationship with the concept of 'accounting and analytical support system'. The analysis of scientific approaches to the interpretation of the concept of 'accounting and analytical support'. It is proved that 'accounting and analytical support' of management may be considered as from an organizational point of view and from the point of view of final product. If the accounting and analytical support is viewed from an organizational point of view, it is necessary to apply the phrase 'accounting and analytical support system', and if from the point of view of final product â€“ 'accounting and analytical support'. It is proposed to consider the accounting and analytical support of management as a set of processed accounting and non-accounting information assigned for management of enterprise (organization), areas of activity or individual objects. Availability of various thematic elements (subsystems) in accounting and analytical support for business management suggests that the studied concept is a categorical accounting concept.
M40|Interpretation and Mission of Strategic Managerial Accounting in Management of Enterprises|In modern conditions, managerial accounting is a connecting link between the accounting process and company management. The article elucidates the nature and mission of strategic management accounting in the management of enterprises. The etymology of strategic management accounting is explored, and the author's definition of this category is presented. The main differences between the traditional and strategic management accounting are defined. The features and main tasks of strategic management accounting are revealed. The components of strategic management accounting are grounded. It is proved that the process of strategic management accounting includes not only the actual accounting, but also strategic analysis, strategic planning and strategic control. The elements of internal and external information environment are identified for the purposes of strategic analysis. It is found that strategic management accounting is a system for collecting and processing information from the external and internal environment, which ensures the achievement of the strategic goals and objectives of the entity.
M40|Accountant Professional Judgment: Definition of Concepts and Content|The article is devoted to the substantiation of what constitutes 'professional judgment of accountant', its structure and scope. The analysis of scientific approaches to the definition of 'professional judgment of accountant' was made and its author's definition was offered. It was justified that 'professional judgment of accountant' should be viewed from two perspectives: performing of functions and tasks of accounting (general definition); compilation of accurate and relevant information for users in financial statements (special definition). In the general sense the professional judgment of accountant is the use of necessary skills, knowledge and experience in the context of management, accounting standards, taxation, management accounting and professional ethics in taking of reasonable decisions aimed at implementation of accounting tasks. For the purposes of financial statements preparation under the professional judgment of accountant should be understood the application of the necessary skills, knowledge and experience in the context of accounting standards and professional ethics in taking of reasonable decisions aimed at delivery of accurate and relevant information for users in financial statements.
M40|Problems of Reforming State Statistics of Ukraine|The article is concerned with analysis of initiatives for reforming state statistics in Ukraine and substantiation of ways for improvement of information support to monitor agrarian markets and efficient state sectorial management. The critical evaluation is given to measures to be taken to reform state statistics, which stipulate reduction of the staff of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine, reduction in quantity of mandatory statistics reports and delivery of a range of statistics reports to be administered to other state authorities. It lists the forms of state statistic observations in agricultural, forest and fish industries to be filled in 2016. It proves the necessity to apply the balanced approach to reduction of quantity of report forms, full-fledged analysis and investigation of need in some forms for different user groups. It contains proposals on reforming statistics in agriculture through implementation of the institutional agrarian statistics that is the important element for agrarian market monitoring and effective sectorial management.
M40|Requirements to Present-Day Corporations' Reporting: Foreign and Ukrainian Experience|The article focuses on existing requirements to corporations' reporting and substantiation of main tasks for Ukrainian enterprises in relation to implementation of present-day models of informing the society about their performance from the point of view of fullness and maximum informative value. It clears up the particulars of formation of financial, consolidated and integrated statements of the entity, determines the requirements imposed to each type of statements in modern conditions. Differences in preparation of statements by foreign and Ukrainian entities are defined that enables to substantiate the target to improve reporting of national corporations for the purposes of unification with international requirements. It is found that opportunities of financial reporting improvement are limited to a certain extent, consequently, the increase in informative value of reporting is resolved at the expense of increase in the list of reporting forms including through preparation of integrated statements. The article concludes that improvement of reporting is primarily related to necessity to understand the role, which a single entity plays in the social and economic development of the country.
M40|An Examination Of The Impact Of Culture On Ifrs Risk Disclosures For Firms That Cross- List In The U.S|Accounting disclosures is an important factor in the decision making process of users of financial statements. Differences in cultural values across countries may result in different opinions regarding the adequacy or extent of the disclosures on the financial statements. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of culture on IFRS 7 risk disclosures in firms that cross-list in the United States. This paper extends the current literature in the area of culture and IFRS risk disclosure requirements. The study sample consists of 62 international firms that trade in the New York Stock Exchange. A cross country analysis related to IFRS 7 disclosure level of financial risk was prepared for each firm. Using Hofstede (1983) and Grayâ€™s theory (1988), each company and country was divided by cultural area and by a level of secrecy and conservatism scale. A level of risk disclosures was created for each company after considering the extension of the IFRS 7 disclosures in their annual reports. The results suggest that culture (secrecy and conservatism) do not have a significant impact in IFRS 7 disclosure levels. However, other economic and political factors seem to influence risk disclosures in financial statements
M40|Social And Environmental Accounting: Evidence From The Stock Exchange Of Mauritius|This paper looks at the social and environmental disclosure in Mauritius. In particular, the listed companies of Mauritius were targeted to assess their views for and against the social and environmental practices. Using a sample of 30 listed companies, the results suggest that there are listed companies in Mauritius which are engaged in some of the elements of social and environmental accounting (SEA) practices such as disclosing issues, ensuring transparency, complying with corporate governance. However, there are still areas of improvement such as proper education and wellbeing of the citizen, training, employment of handicapped person with adequate equipment amongst others which need to be addressed.

M40|Awareness Of Human Resource Accounting Practices And Costing: Evidence From The Philippines|This study focused on the awareness of the Human Resource Accounting Practices and Costing (HRAC) of companies located in Carmelray Industrial Park 1 (CIP 1), Canlubang, Calamba City. The respondents were 8 human resource managers, 18 human resource supervisors, 8 finance officers, 9 chief accountants, and 5 accounting supervisors of the forty-eight (48) companies of CIP 1. The researchers used a questionnaire to collect the data. The study disclosed that the companies were not aware of the HRAC Cost Based Approach Models. The results also revealed that CIP 1 companies used the traditional or conventional accounting for human resources, where costs incurred for human resources were charged to expenses. The level of awareness and acceptance of the forty-eight companies of CIP 1 is very low. Based on the findings, the researchers recommended an accounting system that the companies might be able to use
M40|A Real World Case Of Identity Theft|This case examines a real world case of identity theft from start to finish. The case details the victimâ€™s experience from the day he was told he had insufficient funds in his bank account and realized that he had been the victim of fraud until the resolution of the fraud. By completing the case, students will learn steps to prevent identity theft and also actions they can take if they do become victims of identity theft. The case was designed to be used in either undergraduate or graduate level classes. It is suitable for an Introduction to Business, an Ethics or a Fraud Detection and Deterrence course. Students typically require one to two hours outside of class to complete the case. The instructor should budget approximately one hour of class time to go over the case in class
M40|Target Security: A Case Study Of How Hackers Hit The Jackpot At The Expense Of Customers|For most people, the word cybercrime invokes getting individualsâ€™ personal information through Internet hacking. For this reason, many people are wary about making online purchases, concerned about the security of their personal data and the rise in identity theft. However, the recent breach of security at Target, when customers made in store holiday purchases, indicates the pervasiveness of this terrible crime. In late December 2013, Target announced that hackers, through point of sale terminals in stores, had successfully stolen data for up to 40 million credit and debit cardholders. Target later revised the estimate to 110 million cardholders, citing that the breach included encrypted pin information as well as purchases made more than a decade ago. This case allows students to analyze the Target security breach and propose ways that the attack could have been prevented or at least detected more quickly by Target management, internal and external auditors. This case is suitable for an undergraduate class or a graduate business class.
M40|Assessment of corporate governance disclosure in the GCC countries using the UNCTAD ISAR benchmark|This paper aims to present and analyze corporate governance disclosure (CGD) practices among listed non-financial companies in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries’ stock exchanges. GCC include Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates (UAE). The study utilizes the benchmark developed by the Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting (ISAR) of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). This benchmark comprises 52 disclosure items that are divided into five broad categories: (a) financial transparency and information disclosure; (b) ownership structure and exercise of control rights; (c) board and management structure and process; (d) corporate responsibility and compliance; and (e) auditing. This benchmark is based on the UNCTAD publication Guidance on Good Practices in Corporate Governance Disclosure. Results indicate a low level of CGD since corporate governance is still considered novel in the GCC countries. The average disclosure level was 26% while the maximum was 65%. The category with the highest disclosure level was the ‘Financial transparency and information disclosure’ which is the case with other emerging markets. Providing an assessment of CGD using ISAR benchmark provides a tool for its future re-assessment in the GCC countries. Results show how important it is to enhance the awareness of CGD in the GCC countries stressing its importance on the micro and macro levels. Results also provide regulators and policymakers with recommendations on enhancing CGD in the GCC counties. The evaluation of CGD in the GCC countries can also help various stakeholders in their investment decision making.
M40|Dynamics of scale effficiency of Indian banks: A deterministic frontier approach|Indian banking sector is characterized with intense competition, amongst the best regulated in the world and rapid growth. Indian banking sector have undergone rapid reforms and liberalization in last two decades, which resulted into advent of new and strong private sector banks, increased technology adoptions, rapid branch expansion, prudential regulations, focus on financial inclusion, market discipline of public sector banks and demanding customers. With Indian Banking system poised to become the world’s 3rd largest by 2025 and owing to the dynamism in banking sector the paper examines the bank efficiency. Most past studies focused on the impact of some or other regulatory phase, some segments of banking and under constant return scale assumption. Our study is distinct to the extent that we examine the bank efficiency after the Phase III and IV reforms and subprime crisis, across all ownership segments of Scheduled Commercial Banks and under plausible assumption of variable returns of scale given the dynamic banking environment. We employ non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis using intermediation approach under of variable return of scale. Our study period consist of 2008-2012 post reform and subprime crisis period and covers 26 public, 19 private and 21 foreign banks operating in India. We further examine the variation in efficiency across different ownership groups and small and large bank sizes over the period. Our findings indicate that Public sector banks’ average efficiency scores were better than that of private sector while foreign banks had the lowest efficiency score. Private sector banks had lower heterogeneity in efficiency compared to public sector banks. The smaller banks showed better efficiency compared to larger banks across the ownership groups. We find that the banking reforms have seen improvement in efficiency of public sector banks as compared to private and foreign banks. Thus our findings differ from studies on other emerging markets indicating efficiency improvement of foreign banks as compared to pubic banks. While banks have shown overall efficiency the lower technical efficiency indicate inefficiency in large banks probably due to sub optimal scale and scope efficiency. Our study point outs management of assets, branch rationalization and use of technology to improve the bank efficiency. The study suggests policy focus on reduction of non-performing assets and rationalization of staff and branches to obtain efficiency gain. Regulatory reforms in Indian Banking sector saw improvement in efficiency of public and private banks and efficiency scores differed across various ownership and large and small bank groups.
M40|What Drives Corporate Governance Quality In Emerging African Economies? Evidence From Ghana|This paper investigates the determinants of good corporate governance across Ghanaian listed firms for the study period 2000 to 2009. The Ghanaian Code of corporate governance introduced in 2003 was the first attempt to make official corporate governance guidelines on best practices not backed by the force of law of which the Ghanaian firms were encouraged to comply with its provisions. As such, firms listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange are expected to comply with the recommended governance provisions in order to promote good corporate governance. Some of the key provisions in the code are separating the posts of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the board of directors, limiting the board size to between eight and sixteen directors, having at least one-third of the total membership of the board to be independent directors, and the establishment of separate board committees to be responsible for audit and executive remuneration. Other provisions call for improvement of the relationship between shareholders and managers, and provisions on financial affairs, auditing and disclosure practices. We develop a corporate governance index and its six sub-indices to measure firm-level governance quality. Annual reports of the Ghanaian listed firms are scored according to their governance disclosure during the whole period, 2000-2009 and pre 2003 and post 2003 introduction of the Ghanaian Code. A panel data analytical framework was used to find the determinants of strong corporate governance in Ghanaian listed firms. The empirical results over the whole period, 2000-2009 show statistically significant and positive relationship between external financing needs, firm size, institutional shareholdings and governance quality measured by the Ghanaian corporate governance index. While we find no relationship between external financing needs, director shareholding and governance quality pre 2003, the result is positive and statistically significant for post 2003. The most consistent relationship we find concerns firm size and institutional shareholdings. However, growth opportunities and firm performance measures appear to have no association with strong governance in Ghanaian firms. The results have important implications for the Ghanaian firms and regulators. In particular, the Ghanaian firms with high external financing needs would have to improve their governance structures in order to attract such facility. For regulators, it is important to have clear code of corporate governance guidelines in place where firms’ governance practices can be benchmarked. In addition, the study contributes to our understanding of the firm attributes affecting strong corporate governance in emerging African economies.
M40|The Influence Of The Connections Of Romanian Non-Listed Firms To Tax Havens On Their Profitability|The offshore entities have become one of the most efficient solutions for tax avoidance and are used by taxpayers almost all around the world. This paper investigates the influence of the connections (via subsidiaries or shareholders) of Romanian non-listed firms to tax havens on their profitability and effective tax rate. In this regard, we used a sample of 7,167 Romanian firms (3,370 with connections to tax havens and 3,797 without tax havens connections). For statistical analysis, we used the simple and multiple linear regression methods with dummy variables. Results have shown that the presence of Romanian non-listed firms in tax havens significantly influences their profitability and effective tax rate. The firms with connections to tax havens have a return on equity ratio higher, a return on assets ratio lower, a gross profit margin ratio lower, a total assets turnover ratio higher and an effective tax rate lower than companies without connections to such jurisdictions

M40|A comparison of Graham and Piotroski investment models using accounting information and efficacy measurement|We examine the investment models of Benjamin Graham and Joseph Piotroski and compare the efficacy of these two models by running backtest, using screening rules and ranking systems built in Portfolio 123. Using different combinations of screening rules and ranking systems, we also examine the performance of Piotroski and Graham investment models. We find that the combination of Piotroski and Graham investment models performs better than S&P 500. We also find that the Piotroski screening with Graham ranking generates the highest average annualized return among different combinations of screening rules and ranking systems analyzed in this paper. Overall, our results show a profound impact of accounting information on investorâ€™s decision making.
M40|Balance sheet classification of compound financial instruments and the judgment of securities market analysts|This paper investigates the effect of balance sheet classification of a compound financial instrument on the analystâ€™s judgment on estimates in target prices using an experimental setting. The experimental design involves both buy and sales-side analysts grouped into three subsamples with limited information set about the company used in the experiment and different information regarding the accounting for the compound financial instrument (IAS 32 model, SOA model and NEA model) after the following event: a private placement of a mandatorily convertible debenture to finance the acquisition of another company abroad. We apply nonparametric means and bootstrap test. Our result show that regardless of balance sheet classification of the compound financial instrument, analysts are likely to treat it conservatively as a liability. Moreover, if the compound financial instrument is wholly classified as a liability and the company is highly leveraged, they tend to discount firmâ€™s share price.
M40|Fraud, security, and Controls in Small Businesses: A Proposed Research Agenda|Fraud and security issues are significant problems faced by businesses. Based on a survey of certified fraud examiners reported in the 2016 ACFE Report to the Nations, total annual loses of all businesses exceeded six billion dollars with an average per case loss just under three million dollars. Small businesses, defined as those with less than 100 employees, reported median fraud losses that were virtually identical to the losses of large businesses. However, given the relative magnitude of assets for these two sizes of businesses, the fraud losses for small businesses have a much bigger impact on small businesses than on large ones. Given the importance of fraud loses to small businesses, fraud, security, and compliance issues are discussed within this context at a conceptual level along with a proposed research agenda.The presented discussion is framed within the special problems, issues, and potential solutions to fraud and compliance in small businesses. We begin with security and compliance issues faced by all businesses. The essence is that the security and compliance solutions (e.g., software) suitable for large businesses are often inappropriate for small businesses. Based on these results, recommendations for small business controls are offered. After discussing the need to perform additional research in this area, a research agenda is proposed. The specific topics of identifying the target population, methods of fully understanding the target population, data collection and analysis, and potential manuscripts are presented. A brief summary of the paper is then provided.
M40|Cost Allocation Methods for Joint Products and By-products|The purpose of this paper is to look into the problems of costing of joint products and by-products in industrial organizations. The paper starts with an introduction to the problem of allocating joint costs (common costs up to the split-off stage) to products. The author defines the basic terms of joint products, by-products, common and joint costs and analyses how the problems of costing can be approached. Two approaches are discussed for joint products cost allocation and two approaches for by-products cost allocation. The author presents adapted methods for costing within those approaches and discusses the situations in which those will be most appropriate to apply. The paper concludes with a note on the importance of using proper methods for cost allocation of joint products and by-products as part of the broader management process of ensuring long-term profitability of the industrial organizations
M40|Aligning Curriculum in Undergraduate Business Education to Integrate World’s Leading Professional Qualifications – Methodology and Limitations|The discussion on education-related issues in­variably addresses the question as to how the qual­ity of education should be improved. A successful example for adding value to professional education (a measure of education quality, though a condi­tional one) is the recent research project of the Faculty of Finance and Accounting at the University of National and World Economy – Sofia (Bulgaria). The project involves the aligning of syllabuses for the courses taught in the faculty with the modules of the chartered accountancy qualification of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales (ICAEW). Its goal is to ensure the appropri­ate recognition of high-quality learning and assess­ment and the award of credits for prior learning (ex­emptions) for programmes in the University by one of the oldest and currently the largest organizations of professional accountants in Europe. The innovative character of this research proj­ect emphasizes the need to summarize the expe­rience acquired during the project’s implementa­tion, which includes but is not limited to: problems, objectives, methods, activities and results. This paper discusses that set of interrelated elements. The paper contributes to the existing literature by the novel idea to integrate these elements within a general methodological framework for aligning curricula in undergraduate business education with the requirements of world’s leading professional qualifications. While much of the discussion is ori­ented at the development of students at the under­graduate level in accounting, finance and financial control, in many aspects it is also applicable in a more general context of education and training. The paper applies deductive reasoning – project implementation is contingent on the proposed meth­odological framework. In other words, the project is just a test to apply the methodology and a specific attempt to verify the developed theoretical model. Deductive logic provides at least two valuable ad­vantages First, it enables the essential understand­ing of the project’s results and allows for reflections on the project’s limitations, giving some insights for future research. Second, that approach supports the universal character of the proposed methodol­ogy as well as its applicability in other initiatives of similar vein. The paper concludes with a brief sum­mary and a call for further discussion on the prob­lems of undergraduate business education
