P43|Crypto ‘Money’: Perspective of a Couple of Canadian Central Bankers|The market for cryptoassets has exploded in size in the 10 years since bitcoin was launched. The technology underlying cryptoassets, blockchain, has also been held up as a technology that promises to transform entire industries. In this paper we examine what is new about cryptoassets and their technology and how they may affect core central bank functions. We do this by outlining what we think are the three most important research and policy questions for central bankers around cryptoassets and cryptocurrencies specifically. First, what is fundamentally new about the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies and other cryptoassets? Second, how do cryptocurrencies affect a central bank’s role in the economy? Third, given the two challenges of a rise of cryptoassets and a decline in the use of cash, should digital payments be left entirely to the private sector or should central banks issue their own digital currencies? We discuss these three policy questions and highlight what aspects of them are most important to central bankers. Finally, we raise several new questions to help guide researchers in studying cryptoassets and their underlying technology.
P43|Sustainable Finance for Sustainable Development|The paper explores how ethical and sustainable oriented finance is key to reach sustainable development by tackling environmental risk through green finance and showing empirical evidence on the link between finance and inequality. The theory provided puts in the right mind frame to analyze markets, intermediaries and instruments with a sustainable lens to focus on the benefits that have brought to sustainable development. A discussion is presented between different intermediaries and highlights the benefits of cooperative banks especially the close relationship of customers and bank and the resilience it gives to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in difficult times. Different investments strategies are discussed walking through the evolution of Sustainable and Responsible Investing (SRI) funds and diving into the ESG analysis to use as criteria to allocate investments based on environmental, social and governance principles. Microfinance is introduced as a different market that has reached the people at the bottom of the pyramid and highlights the key role it will play to bring financial inclusion. Islamic finance and Fintech are also discussed. Different instruments are presented to understand the current landscape of how different investors are using innovative products to attack social and environmental problems. Finally, five different ways are presented on how policies can strengthen and support sustainable development arguing that the most important is by promoting sustainable footprint certification.
P43|Projective Paternalism|We study experimentally when, why, and how people intervene in others’ choices. Choice Architects (CAs) construct opportunity sets containing bundles of time-indexed payments for Choosers. CAs frequently prevent impatient choices despite opportunities to provide advice, believing Choosers benefit. We consider several hypotheses concerning CAs’ motives. A conventional behavioral welfarist acts as a correctly informed social planner; a mistakes-projective paternalist removes options she wishes she could reject when choosing for herself; an ideals-projective paternalist seeks to align others’ choices with her own aspirations. Ideals-projective paternalism provides the best explanation for interventions in the laboratory and rationalizes support for actual paternalistic policies.
P43|A supply-demand model of the size of public sector and Wagner's law|In this paper, we develop a supply-demand model for the public sector, measured as governments' tax revenues divided by GDP. We use a political equilibrium with a rule of majority. The model takes into account inefficiencies caused by taxes and includes costs associated with public goods provision to consumers. We show that the size of the public sector depends on the median voter's income, size of population, costs associated with taxpaying, and quality of institutions, which reflect costs of public goods provision. The estimates for the OECD countries (2000-2017), using dynamic panel model techniques, are in line with the theoretical predictions; however, they do not confirm Wagner's law. Our estimates suggest that the size of the government sector grows as income increases, but at a slower rate. We show that the quality of institutions matters: a more effective government raises the share of public sector; better regulations, which permit and promote private sector development, reduce it.
P43|Kritik atas Sistem Bunga Perbankan Konvensional dan Solusi Moneter Islam|The purpose of this study is to review some of the criticisms of the Bank's interest system. Issues related to whether bank interest including usury or not usury has been debated and is still being discussed to date by Islamic economists. But now there has been criticism from Western or Conventional Economists of the negative impact of the Bank's interest in the economy. The method used is a qualitative method using descriptive analysis and literature review. From these experiences, the Islamic Monetary System which is free from interest can be a solution to realize prosperity and guarantee economic injustice. this system is expected not only to increase the money in circulation but how to be able to improve the performance of the real sector in accordance with Islamic sharia. Because basically in the Islamic monetary system, it is not only aimed at material welfare but aims at moral well-being. There are at least five values of Islamic economic instruments that can be integrated into the economic system, namely zakat, waqf, social security, the justice system in resolving economic disputes and sharia financial institutions.
P43|Problematics in Development and Management of Money Affairs (Cash Affairs) in Indonesia|This article explains the problems in the development and management of cash waqf in Indonesia. Cash waqf by people, groups of people, and institutions or legal entities in the form of cash. Waqf cash is still debated among scholars whether it is legal or not, and managing cash waqf professionally is still a discourse and not many people or institutions can accept such waqf models. This article also discusses understanding, legal basis, problematics, management and solutions. Also discussed about cash waqf as the basis for community economic development by opening up Muslim rigidity to cash waqf, as well as the economic prospects of waqf property. The potential of waqf is one of the instruments of economic empowerment for Muslims even though management in Indonesia is still not good. But seen from the number, waqf property in Indonesia is quite large. Money waqf has played an important role as one of the new Islamic fiscal instruments in the economy. Money waqf has two functions as a means of worship and the achievement of social welfare. This article tries to explore how the problems in developing money waqf management such as the way it is distributed and its circulation and how the waqf is able to have a good impact on the surrounding community.
P43|Incentive Compatibility on the Blockchain|A blockchain is a digital ledger that keeps track of a record of ownership without the need for a designated party to update and enforce changes to the record. The updating of the ledger is done directly by the users of the blockchain and is traditionally governed by a proof-of-work (PoW) protocol. We formalize this protocol as a Cournot game where users compete to update the blockchain for a reward. Cheating occurs in the form of “double spending” when users try to tamper with ownership records in order to defraud their counterparties. Ruling out incentives to cheat can be summarized in the form of a “no double-spending constraint.” These constraints put restrictions on the design of a blockchain and, thus, play a role akin to incentive compatibility constraints in classic mechanism design.
P43|Blockchain-Based Settlement for Asset Trading|Can securities be settled on a blockchain, and, if so, what are the gains relative to existing settlement systems? The main benefit of a blockchain is faster and more flexible settlement, whereas settlement fails need to be ruled out where participants fork the chain to cancel trading losses. With a proof-of-work protocol, the blockchain needs to restrict settlement speed through block size and time in order to generate transaction fees, which finance costly mining. Despite mining being a deadweight cost, our estimates for the U.S. corporate debt market yield net gains from a blockchain in the range of 1–4 bps.Received May 31, 2017; editorial decision May 29, 2018 by Editor Itay Goldstein. Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.
P43|Could/Should Jubilee Debt Cancellations be Reintroduced Today?|In this paper we recall the history of Jubilee debt cancellations, emphasizing what their social purpose was at that time. We note that it would not be possible to copy that procedure exactly nowadays, primarily because most debt/credit relationships are intermediated via financial institutions, such as banks, insurance companies, etc., rather than by governments or wealthy families directly. But we argue that the underlying social purpose of such Jubilees- to keep debt within the reasonable ability to be paid without social and economic polarisation - could be recreated via alternative mechanisms, and we discuss the politico-economic arguments for, and against, doing so
P43|Relasi negara dan pasar bebas dalam mewujudkan keadilan ekonomi: Analisis sejarah keuangan publik Islam<BR>[State and free markets relation in realizing economic justice: Analysis of History of Islamic Public Finance]|The state becomes a political entity that is responsible for the collective affairs of the community so that it plays an important role in creating economic justice and prospering the community through instruments of development. However, the role of the government in carrying out development depends on public finance which in fact has problems in terms of management and implementation. In the perspective of Islamic economics, public finance is a top priority managed from the side of the sources of income and expenditure used in implementing pro-poor development so as to create prosperity for the community.

P43|Mate choice mechanism for solving a quasi-dilemma|Sajio et al. (2015) showed that the mate choice mechanism for a symmetric prisoner's dilemma (PD) game implements cooperation in backward elimination of weakly dominated strategies (BEWDS), and it attained almost full cooperation in their experiment. This study theoretically shows, first, that this mechanism works well in the class of quasi-dilemma (QD) games, such as asymmetric PD games and coordination games. Second, the class of BEWDS-implementable games is exactly the same as the class of QD games. Third, the mechanism cannot implement cooperation in a subgame perfect equilibrium. Finally, we confirm that the mate choice mechanism works well experimentally for an asymmetric PD game.
P43|The Political-Economy Implications of the Transition from State-Owned to Mixed-Owned Enterprises: Evidence from the European Gas Sector|This paper analyses how the transition from State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to Mixed- Owned Enterprises (MOEs) in the European gas sector affected the European states’ ability to pursue public policy objectives. More specifically, the analysis focuses on the extent to which public and private interests can be reconciled within MOEs’ strategy. The paper suggests that the rise of profitability as the central objective for MOEs has prevented states from pursuing some, though not all, of the policy objectives that they could pursue before the transition. For example, states can no more pursue large-scale plans of economic and technological development through MOEs, or ensure consumers’ price affordability irrespective of market fluctuations. However, states may still be able to positively contribute to energy security thanks to the major shares held in MOEs, for instance by vetoing divestment from import infrastructure. The analysis suggests the need for states to devise alternative ways to pursue their objectives in the framework of national and European energy policy.
P43|Is there a Link between Profit Share Rate of Participation Banks and Interest Rate?[:] The Case of Turkey|Today, the sensitive side of national economies is financial sector. The main reason for this sensitivity is financial crises. This situation has increased the demand and orientation for Islamic finance as a substitute for the modern financial system. The Islamic finance is discussed as a real solution to financial crises because the Islamic finance methods and applications depend on real economic activities. Both this case and the distance that is taken by Muslim countries in recent years has increased the share of Islamic banking/finance in the world. Thus, it has been a long debate in Islamic finance literature to investigate the presence of dependency between profit share rate settled by participation banks and deposit interest rate offered in conventional banking. In this study, variables that affect profit share rate of participation banks and deposit interest rate of conventional banks are examined over the period between January 2006 and May 2015 in Turkey. OLS method is constructed and empirical results are pointed out that interest rate on government security and foreign exchange rate are significantly effective on participation banks’ profit share rate. In addition, the profitability of conventional banks, government security, and foreign exchange rate are significantly effective on deposit interest rate settled by conventional banks. The main reason for this link between conventional interest rate and profit share rate arises with the domiance of murabahah, simple buy and sell with term sale transactions, at Islamic financial institutions. The interest rate is a benchmark for participation banks to determine the profit share rate. To get rid of this dependency, Islamic financial institutions may tend towards mudarabah transactions.
P43|Political Regimes and Stock Market Performance in Africa|This paper assesses the effect of political institutions on stock market performance in 14 African countries for which stock market data is available for the period 1990-2010. The estimation technique used is a Two-Stage-Least Squares Instrumental Variable methodology. Political regime channels of democracy, polity and autocracy are instrumented with legal-origins, religious-legacies, income-levels and press-freedom qualities to account for stock market performance dynamics of capitalization, value traded, turnover and number of listed companies. The findings show that countries with democratic regimes enjoy higher levels of financial market development compared to their counterparts with autocratic inclinations. As a policy implication, the role of sound political institutions has important effects on both the degree of competition for public office and the quality of public offices that favour stock market development on the African continent.
P43|Law, Politics and the Quality of Government in Africa|This paper examines interconnections between law, politics and the quality of government in Africa. We investigate whether African democracies enjoy relatively better government quality compared to their counterparts with more autocratic inclinations. The empirical evidence is based on Instrumental variable Two-Stage-Least Squares and Fixed Effects with data from 38 African countries for the period 1994-2010. Political regimes of democracy, polity and autocracy are instrumented with income-levels, legal-origins, religious-dominations and press-freedom to account for government quality dynamics, of corruption-control, government-effectiveness, voice and accountability, political-stability, regulation quality and the rule of law. Findings show that democracy has an edge over autocracy while the latter and polity overlap. As a policy implication, democracy once initiated should be accelerated to edge the appeals of authoritarian regimes.
P43|Bridging the Divide: Measuring Party System Change and Classifying Party Systems|Party systems research has proceeded along two parallel lines of inquiry, one predominantly “qualitative” and the other “quantitative.” This article attempts to bridge this divide in two ways. First, by showing that qualitative information can be valuable in the construction of quantitative measures. Second, by showing that the results from applying theoretically- sensitive measurement tools can be useful for qualitative classification. These analyses are performed using an original dataset of party system changes in Sub-Saharan Africa.
P43|Risk management and capital adequacy in Turkish participation and conventional banks: A comparative stress testing analysis|In this study, we investigate changes in banks' capital adequacy ratio (CAR) under different stress scenarios and examine the results by comparing conventional banks to participation banks in Turkey. Our results report that the capital adequacy ratio of the banks declines substantially given the stress scenarios. We find that participation banks in Turkey suffer more in declined capital adequacy ratio compared to conventional banks. Our findings reveal that participation banks in Turkey are more sensitive to sudden changes in exchange rates and increased non-performing loans. However, this sensitivity is in regards to capital adequacy, not profit. Overall, our study shows the effect of stress in the banking sector by contributing to the existing literature.
P43|Boom oder Blase? Einschätzungen von Preisentwicklungen auf Immobilienmärkten am Beispiel Berlins|The article analyzes whether Berlin’s housing market shows signals of a new housing bubble between 2009 and 2014. Specifically, it is investigated whether there exists an empiric relationship between the low interest rate policy of the ECB and Berlin's housing prices. A potential housing bubble scenario, caused by the ECB policy, is considered and the user cost of housing approach is applied to measure the effects of the low interest rates. Furthermore the interaction between the housing supply and demand is analyzed to evaluate Berlin's “housing scarcity” and to test to what extend the increasing prices are economically justified. Der Artikel analysiert die zeitliche Entwicklung des Berliner Wohnimmobilienmarktes (2009–2014) mit Blick auf die Frage, ob es zu einer potenziellen Überhitzung gekommen ist. Dabei wird der empirische Wirkungszusammenhang zwischen der andauernden Niedrigzinspolitik der Europäischen Zentralbank (EZB) und dessen Wirkung auf den Immobilienpreis evaluiert. Folglich wird ein mögliches Immobilienblasenszenario, ausgehend von der Politik der EZB, entworfen und die Wirkung der Niedrigzinsen anhand des User Cost of Housing Approach gemessen. In diesem Zusammenhang wird das Zusammenspiel von Angebot und Nachfrage mit einer eventuellen Wohnungsverknappung untersucht, um zu sehen, ob der vermeintliche, von der EZB-Politik beflügelte Preisauftrieb auch ökonomisch nachvollziehbar ist.
P43|Analysis of Awareness on Biogas Adoption as the Alternative Energy through the Blue Economy Concept Application|"""Objective – The purpose of this study is (1) to analyse community perception in the use of biogas as an alternative energy, (2) to analyse whether variables such as income, age, education, cost savings, and livestock maintenance costs actually affect the willingness of community to use biogas, and (3) to develop a relationship among potential regional resources in the blue economy development. Methodology/Technique – The method used in this study is a collaboration between quantitative and qualitative models. For the first research objective, the qualitative theory approach focused on in-depth interviews and focus group discussions to develop a variety of potential economic relations in the implementation of the blue economy. For the second objective, descriptive statistics was used to identify differences in community perceptions on the use of biogas by the people in the Ngawi and Boyolali regencies. For third objective, model is used to analyze whether income, age, education, cost savings, and livestock maintenance costs affect community willingness to use biogas: Findings – The results show that (1) there are different community perceptions on biogas adoption in the Ngawi and Boyolali regencies, (2) variables such as income, age, education, cost savings, and livestock maintenance costs affect the willingness of community in using biogas, and (3) the blue economy concept can be developed by utilizing economic potentials in Ngawi towards an energy-independent village. Novelty – The use of biogas as an alternative energy needs to be developed so as to stimulate influential variables that can raise public awareness because the method is simple and exploits local potentials without waste."""
P43|The Clean Energy Package: Are its objectives always consistent?|"On 30 November 2016, the European Commission published a proposal for a reform of energy markets titled ""Clean Energy for all Europeans"", better known as the ""Winter Pack-age"". Its aim is to speed up the integration of electricity markets in Europe and to further encourage the use of renewables and the pursuit of energy efficiency, while at the same time placing European consumers at the heart of this project. This Policy Brief sheds light on the Commission’s proposal - which runs to no less than 5000 pages - by examining its three major innovations and looking in depth at issues that remain unresolved in terms of pricing. Putting the consumer at the centre of the policy. In concrete terms, consumers must be able to participate more fully in the functioning of the electricity market, both as self-producers and as contributors to demand-side responses. Strengthening the governance of grids and markets. National capacity markets must be open to other Member States and to all technologies. The only exception is coal-fired power plants, the most polluting technology, which should be totally eliminated from the capacity markets in the long term. Improving the integration of renewables. The project puts an end to the priority of access to grids that has benefited renewables so far and recommends the eventual removal of production support mechanisms. The issue of electricity pricing appears to be inescapable given increasing inputs of decentralized renewable electricity that are destabilising the standard principle of electricity pricing at marginal cost. Alternatives - pricing at average cost or on the basis of capacity - will need to be explored. The central role of the carbon price and the implications of its insufficiently high level, which penalizes the competitiveness of low-carbon energies, are hidden. The reform of support mechanisms for renewables is no substitute for an ambitious carbon pricing policy."
P43|Cooperation among behaviorally heterogeneous players in social dilemma with stay or leave decisions|Given the substantial evidence of behavioral heterogeneity in social dilemma experiments, in this study we consider how to achieve cooperation in n-player prisoner's dilemma situations where each player has one behavioral type, either selfish or conditionally cooperative. We introduce a two-stage game form called the stay-leave mechanism, where each cooperator has the chance to revise his choice when players' choices are not unanimous. For homogeneous behavioral type cases, theory predicts that the unique outcome is cooperative under the stay-leave mechanism, regardless of the benefit derived from cooperation. For heterogeneous behavioral type cases, we show that the benefits of cooperation shrink such that the unique outcome is cooperative under the stay-leave mechanism if the number of conditionally cooperative players increases. The average cooperation rate in the stay-leave mechanism experiment is 86.6% across 15 periods, which increases to 96.0% after period 5. We also provide evidence that selfish and conditionally cooperative types coexist throughout the sessions, in the proportion that the equilibrium outcome is cooperative. Our results corroborate the importance of incorporating behavioral heterogeneity into institutional design.
P43|The Islamic Political System: A Basic Value Approach|Any economic system will certainly be influenced in institutions and rules by the underlying political system. While the political processes are not carried out in the market, it can influence economic decisions related to consumption, saving, investment and exchange in no small way. Through the political processes, the shape of markets is formed, the taxation system is setup and government budget is determined. In addition, the political processes directly influence economic policies, including fiscal, monetary, trade and development policies, especially in the ways are formed and implemented. The analysis of the Islamic political system through the use of economic methodology is rare. It is common to provide historical analysis based on the experience of “Saqifah(t) Bani Saad” with the selection of the first Caliph Abu Bakr, as well as the method used to select the three following Caliph. This would involve a great deal of textual evidence and their interpretation. This paper presents an alternative approach to draw the main features of the Islamic political system from the basic Islamic values as well as contemporary human experiences. We start with identifying the most important Islamic values related to the field of politics, and set the salient features of a configuration of a contemporary political system that would fulfill such values. The first section deals with Islamic political values and in particular, those related to Tawheed, which we define it to be something more than just monotheism. In addition, we draw from contemporary Muslem literature the Islamic constitutional values. The second section discusses how Maqassed (ultimate objectives) of Shari'ah are related to the political system. The third section discusses economic theory of social choice. The fourth section discusses the sources of political failure and how they can be confronted. The fifth section discusses the choice between types of government. The sixth section discusses the lessons to be learnt from the government of Madinah. Finally, in the last section, a blueprint for an Islamic economic system is presented.

P43|Fiscal Policy in Indonesia: Analysis of State Budget 2017 in Islamic Economic Perspective|This study ananlyze the State Budget (APBN) 2017 of Indonesia in Islamic economic perspective. The state budget is prepared using the rules of public economics consisting of state revenues, state expenditures, and budget financing has the posture of the budget, the issues of fiscal policy, and the role of the government in carrying out its functions. With the analysis of Islamic economics, fiscal policy in the State Budget 2017 is the duty of the government to implement the budget for the public welfare with indicators on aspects of religion (religious life), life (justice and security), intellect (education), descent (health and social security family), and treasure (income distribution and access to employment).
P43|Critical Review of the Tools of Ijtihād Used in Islamic Finance|Sharī‘ah covers all aspects of human dealings, including Islamic financial law and its Fiqh nominated contracts, essentially the basis for all Islamic banking and finance transactions. These contracts are either readily found in the classic books of Islamic law or modified versions adopted to suit the modern financial needs. In some cases they are a combination of more than one contracts designed to serve a particular financing purpose, like the contract of Ijārah Muntahia Bittamlik (lease ending with transfer of ownership) where the transaction starts with lease and ends with sale. This paper attempts to discuss the most important Ijtihād instruments that can be used by the faqih (jurists) to evaluate and endorse products in Islamic finance. It then elaborates on the instruments that are in use in the modern Islamic finance, and which reflect a departure from Sharī‘ah rules and tools for Ijtihād (the process of deriving Sharī‘ah rules for the new incidents from the Sharī‘ah sources). The objective of this paper is to shed light on the cotemporary Ijtihād in Fiqh of finance in light of the guidelines provided by the Sharī‘ah in an attempt to draw the outlines of what constitutes a proper use of Ijtihād instruments in Islamic finance
P43|Arbitrage with Production, Collateral Constraint and Heterogeneous Belief|We construct a dynamic model economy in which households from segmented markets have varying financial asset demand. Intermediaries make profit by exploiting the price difference in segmented financial markets. However, intermediaries have to separately post their physical investment as collateral to trade. We show that the heterogeneous belief will disturb the intermediaries’ self-recovery process in both financial and real sectors through endogenously determined collateral constraints. The dynamic interaction between belief determined collateral constraint and liquidity supply turns out to be a powerful transmission mechanism by which the effects of shocks persist, amplify and spill over to other sectors.
P43|Neighborhood Racial Characteristics, Credit History, and Bankcard Credit in Indian Country|Abstract We draw on a large-scale dataset of individual-level credit bureau records to study bankcard credit limits in Indian Country. Utilizing approaches that aim to isolate supply from demand considerations, we find that residing in a predominantly American Indian neighborhood is ceteris paribus associated with lower awarded bankcard credit limits than residing in a neighborhood where the share of American Indian residents is low. Consumer’s credit history is a robust and quantitatively more important predictor of awarded credit limits than racial composition of the consumer’s neighborhood. Bankcard credit limits do not depend on the consumer’s location vis-à-vis a reservation.
P43|Personal Pensions with Risk sharing: Affordable, Adequate and Stable Private Pensions in Europe|Private pension provision faces the challenging task of providing stable income streams during retirement. The challenge has increased markedly in the last decades due to volatile financial markets, falling interest rates and the withdrawal of employers and external insurers as risk bearers of systematic financial and longevity risks. Partly because of these developments, policyholders desire pensions tailored to their individual needs. This paper proposes a new type of pension: the Personal Pension with Risk sharing (PPR). By unbundling and valuing the investment, (dis)saving, insurance and risk-sharing functions of pensions, PPRs allow risk management and (dis)saving to be customized to the specific features of heterogeneous individuals. Moreover, unlike variable annuities, PPRs allow investment risks to be combined with longevity insurance without giving rise to high year-on-year volatility in consumption streams or opaque and rigid valuation and smoothing rules. The unbundling of functions in the PPR also deepens the internal markets for financial and insurance products while at the same time accommodating the diverse traditions of countries in terms of occupational pension provision. Finally, the PPR reconciles financial, fiscal and macroeconomic stability with growth by increasing the supply of long-term risk-bearing and illiquid capital, complementing public retirement provision, reducing the interest-rate sensitivity of pensions and smoothing shocks.
P43|Fiscal Deficits and Economic Growth in Nigeria: A Chow Test Approach|The recent criticism of poor fiscal performance levelled against the democratic regimes in Nigeria has resulted in questions being asked as to the soundness of the acclaim which heralded its advent. Such questions generally focus on the growth impacts of the deficits incurring during this regimes. In view of this, this study examined the relative impact of fiscal deficits (FSD) on economic growth in Nigeria during the military and democratic regimes. The study employed Chow endogenous break test, unit root and cointegration tests. The results derived from the Chow test analysis reveal that there is a difference between the growth-impact of FSD in the two regimes. In particular, the study found that FSDs had a significant growthimpact during the military regime, while it has not had a significant impact on economic growth during the democratic regime. On the other hand, the study’s results indicated that the interest rate did not have a significant growth-impact during both regimes, while the gross fixed capital formation had a significant growth impact during both regimes in view of the findings, the study recommended the strengthening of the country’s budgetary institutions so as to ensure the de-politicization of the budgetary process. Furthermore, the study recommended the reduction in the current lending rate so as to ensure increased access to investment funds by domestic entrepreneurs.
P43|Consumer credit on American Indian reservations|This paper provides the first encompassing quantitative picture of consumer credit in Indian Country. Drawing on a unique large-scale consumer credit database, we find that Equifax Risk Scores and the use of certain forms of credit, especially mortgages, are low on reservations. However, usage of other forms of credit on reservations is not always low. Moreover, the gaps in credit usage on versus off reservations differ significantly across states and can change notably over time. Among predictors of consumer credit outcomes, the percentage of American Indian residents is robustly negatively associated with favorable credit outcomes. Furthermore, once controlling for racial composition, the effect of an area's location vis-à-vis a reservation often becomes statistically insignificant. Other socio-economic variables are generally poor predictors of credit outcomes on reservations. State jurisdiction over legal matters is, at least on average, associated with favorable credit outcomes on reservations.
P43|Anatomy of the â€œEconomic Miracleâ€|The authors analyze evolutionary-institutional patterns and factors of economic growth and development on the example of a number of countries which have demonstrated the â€œeconomic miracleâ€ . Their research method is a structure of socio-economic genotype which aims at maximizing the economic system outcomes. It is concluded that the â€œeconomic miracleâ€ appears when the economic policy and development strategy of a country coincide with the succession (logic) of a cyclic structure of genotype as a driving force of economic evolution.
P43|Re-designing equalization transfers: an application to South Africa provincial equitable share|In this paper we examine the design of transfer systems, focusing on the Provincial Equitable Share (PES) in the Republic of South Africa. Provinces in South Africa have been assigned a wide range of responsibilities. Because provinces are almost completely reliant on transfers from the central government, the design of the PES is of critical importance, especially in its ability to achieve the goal of equalization across provinces. Our specific conclusion is that the PES largely fails in its efforts to equalize across provinces. Our more general conclusion that follows from this is that the PES attempts to achieve too many conflicting goals, and so it necessarily fails to achieve all goals equally or well, especially its ability to equalize. We conclude with suggestions for ways to reform the PES to better achieve the goal of equalization, lesson that also apply to other countries.
P43|The approval mechanism solves the prisoner's dilemma theoretically and experimentally|Consider a situation where players in a prisoner's dilemma game can approve or reject the other's choice such as cooperation or defection. If both players approve the other's choice, the outcome is the one they chose, whereas if either one rejects the other's choice, the outcome is the one when both defect, which we name the approval mechanism herein (this is inspired by the Cold War doctrine of mutually assured destruction). Experimentally, we find that the cooperation rate with the approval mechanism is 90% in round one and averages 93.2% across the 19 rounds. The questionnaire analysis also allows us to find that subjects' behavior is consistent with subgame perfect elimination of weakly dominated strategies (SPEWDS) rather than Nash equilibrium (NE) or subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) behavior. Theoretically, this mechanism implements cooperation in SPEWDS, but not in NE or SPNE.
P43|The New Architecture Of Economic Governance In The European Union|The economic crisis that began in 2007-2008 has highlighted the need for a stronger economic coordination at EU level, to ensure financial stability. The new architecture of economic governance in the European Union is based on Fiscal Pact, on Macroeconomic Imbalances Identification Mechanism, on European Stability Mechanism and on Banking Union. Since the banking system is the most significant component of the financial system, we will give more importance to the analysis of Banking Union, which is based on three pillars: The Single Supervisory Mechanism, The Single Resolution Mechanism and The Deposit Guarantee Schemes.
P43|The New Hungarian Public Finance System – in a Historical, Institutional and Scientific Context|Hungary began to address the profound reasons for the economic crisis after 2010, which resulted in the creation of a new public finance system. This renewal of the public finance system was justified and supported by three factors: the increased importance of public finances all over the world and the spread of the institutional approach; the Hungarian historical traditions; and the social expectations in regard of restoring trust in the government. In practice, the new system is based on three pillars: fiscal policy, which ensures burden sharing; monetary policy, which ensures optimisation in a broad economic-social context; and efficient public auditing that can be utilised at the social level.

P43|Risk Sharing in Corporate and Public Finance: The Contribution of Islamic Finance|The risk-sharing principles of Islamic finance have been most extensively adopted and used in non-Muslim countries. Early European city-states, especially those in Italy, used risk-sharing finance (RSF) to fund their development and build empires. Although some components of Islamic finance have survived in venture capital financing, with the passage of time RSF has been surpassed by debt financing (risk transfer). Today as the world struggles with the excesses of debt and leverage, the risk-sharing principles of Islamic finance offer a potential alternative. The profile of the debt-equity trade-off, which so heavily favours debt over equity, is altered when RSF based contracts are used. In this paper, we offer some preliminary thoughts on the design and implementation of RSF for both private and public sector funding, for revenue and non-revenue generating projects. It is argued that such financing avoids the leverage of conventional debt, minimizes the costs of dilution, reduces macroeconomic vulnerability and enhances financial inclusion. It also has the potential to be a less risky alternative for developing countries to finance public spending and economic growth.
P43|Risk Sharing and Shared Prosperity in Islamic Finance|This paper argues that risk sharing is an effective method of expanding participation of agents in economic growth and development and more effective sharing of fruits of prosperity than risk transfer that currently dominates financial systems. Kuala Lumpur Declaration of 2012, by a group of leading Sharī‘ah scholars and Muslim economists, considers risk sharing as the essence of Islamic finance, a litmus test of which is its ability to promote financial inclusion and asset-building capacity of the poor and thus better sharing of prosperity. The mobilisation of financial resources toward productive activities through risk sharing enables the Islamic financial system to actualize economic justice and social participation in an efficient manner. The asset-backed equity-financing nature of Islamic finance is conducive to financial system stability because returns, which can only be known ex post, and thus shared on the same basis, are not divorced from risk. Stability and equitable growth challenges are arguably difficult to undertake through debt-financing, which transfers the burden of losses from financiers to entrepreneurs even at microfinance levels, distorts economic incentives, increases systemic risk, and renders financial regulation more complex. The procyclicality of the conventional financial system leads to credit contraction during economic downturns, precisely when the need rather increases for real investment to stimulate economic output and reduce unemployment. Financial intermediaries tend rather to respond to changes in the riskiness of assets by adjusting balance sheets through credit contraction and various mechanisms of credit risk transfer. This study is an attempt to demonstrate that the risk-sharing modes of financing real investment in the public and private sector reduce the procyclicality of the financial system. The equity-financing of real investment is conducive to more efficient channels of savings towards development finance. The risk-sharing principle underlying Islamic finance reduces the economic incentives for credit risk transfers and speculative activities. By preventing risk from being entangled in complex debt-creating structures that characterize the incompleteness of contracts under conventional finance, this principle also redefines the role of financial markets and institutions in smoothing consumption and capital expenditure. It is the asset-backed nature of Islamic finance that allows for a participative securitization process that provides different segments of the society with fair opportunities to share economic prosperity. The allocation of risk commensurate to the idiosyncratic abilities to bear losses is arguably more conducive to a socially inclusive financial system. Systematic risk cannot be eliminated, but it is collective risk taking and individual risk aversion that promote more efficient mobilisation of resources, and more equitable sharing of economic risk and prosperity.
P43|Institutions and Creative Destruction in CEECs: Determinants of Inefficient Use of Assets|We analyze the relationship between institutional quality and firm efficiency. Using rich data on firms in the European Union between 2005 and 2012, we show that high institutional quality lowers the share of persistently inefficiently used assets. The adverse effect of low institutional quality may be one of the narrow channels through which institutions affect income per capita in the long-run. Our approach combines institutional economics and Schumpeterian creative destruction. In addition, we observe similarities between inefficiently used assets in Europe and the phenomenon of zombie lending in Japan during the last decades.

P43|The minimum approval mechanism implements the efficient public good allocation theoretically and experimentally|We propose the minimum approval mechanism (MAM) for a standard linear public good environment with two players. Players simultaneously and privately choose their contributions to the public good in the first stage. In the second stage, they simultaneously decide whether to approve the otherʼs choice. Both contribute what they choose in the first stage if both players approve; otherwise, both contribute the minimum of the two choices in the first stage. The MAM implements the Pareto-efficient allocation in multiple solution concepts including backward elimination of weakly dominated strategies (BEWDS), limit logit agent quantal response equilibrium, subgame perfect minimax regret equilibrium, level-k thinking, and diagonalization heuristics. Moreover, the MAM is unique under plausible conditions. Overall, contributions in the MAM experiment averaged 94.9%. Quantifying subjectsʼ responses to the questionnaire reveal heterogeneous reasoning processes and highlight the importance of developing mechanisms that implement the desired social choice outcome in multiple solution concepts.
P43|Accelerating commercialization: a new model of strategic foundation funding|Venture philanthropy presents a new model of research funding that is particularly helpful to those fighting orphan diseases, which actively manages the commercialization process to accelerate scientific progress and material outcomes. This paper begins by documenting the growing importance of foundations as a source of funding academic research as traditional funding from industry and government sources decline. Foundations are known for their innovative techniques and we consider the evolution of the ways that foundations fund academic research and form partnerships across academia and industry. We examine the example of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the development of the drug Kalydeco ® as a demonstration of the principals of strategic foundation funding. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation adapted to a venture philanthropy model and took an active role in drug development, stewarding the commercialization process from funding basic scientific work in academic institutions, to making an equity investment in a start-up firm. We conclude by evaluating the advantages and disadvantages to venture philanthropy for the academic researchers, industry partners, foundations, and universities and consider an agenda for future research.

P43|Effects of the matching fund program on IPO and bankruptcy of SMEs in Korea|Most small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Korea struggle in financing R&D. Thus, the Korea Core Industrial Technology Investment Association (KITIA) was established to implement a matching fund program (MFP) to help SMEs with this undertaking. Applicant firms to the MFP are reviewed first based on their technology levels and are required to attract financing from venture capitalists (VCs), before receiving funds from the MFP. This paper, based on KITIAs MFP applicant data from 2001 to 2004, evaluates the performance of the MFP in terms of the success rate of funded SMEs’ initial public offerings (IPOs) and bankruptcy rates in relation to those SMEs that could not attract matching funds. Propensity score matching was used to eliminate selection bias from the data in order to assess the actual treatment effect of the MFP. According to the result of logistic regression applied to the matched data, MFP apparently did not have significant effects on IPO success and bankruptcy. This implies that MFP needs to allow VCs more time to evaluate SMEs covering qualitative aspects as well. It is expected that this change of structure can provide better performance of MFP in terms of IPO success and bankruptcy of matched SMEs. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014

P43|The Significance of Waqf for Economic Development|There is an opinion among Western scholars that the institution of waqf could not any longer perform its economic role in the present times. Instead of being a vital institution as it truly played at the pre-modern era, waqf nowadays seems to be an impediment to the development in Muslim countries. This paper therefore is meant to refute such an opinion and attempts to point out the economic impacts of waqf for Muslim society in the context of the present economy. In the last part, the paper also brings about several necessary prerequisites for the revitalization of waqf in the current days.

P43|Islamic finance: an alternative financial system for stability, equity, and growth|Conventional finance has long been plagued by crises that cause economic dislocations and impede sustained economic growth, with banks and non-bank financial institutions requiring periodic bailouts. Numerous developing countries have been unable to mobilise domestic and foreign financial resources for development while many advanced countries continue to be plagued by recurring financial crises. A number of eminent economists have denounced the shortfalls of conventional banking and have advocated 100% reserve banking as the stable foundation for a financial system, a recommendation that happens to coincide with the Islamic financial system. The Islamic financial system is characterised by a two-tier banking system with 100% reserve deposit system and risk-sharing equity or investment banking akin to a mutual fund, and the prohibition of interest and interest-based transactions. Islamic finance promotes risk sharing and an efficient risk-sharing vehicle would be a stock market that operates along Islamic principles that prohibit interest and interest-based leverage.
P43|Risk sharing, public policy and the contribution of Islamic finance|A major reason for the recurrent episodes of financial instability is the predominance of interest-based debt and leveraging. Financial stability is achievable through risk sharing finance instead of risk shifting that characterizes contemporary finance. A risk sharing system serves the true function of finance as facilitator of real sector activities and avoids the emergence of a “paper economy” where there is gradual decoupling of finance from the real sector. Islamic finance was initially proposed as a profit-loss sharing system, but its core principle is risk sharing. In prohibiting interest-based debt instruments, Islam grounds finance on a strong risk sharing footing. Although still a young industry that has come a long way, it has not managed to develop truly risk-sharing instruments that would allow individuals, households, and firms as well as whole economies to mitigate systematic and un-systematic risks. It is suggested that governments should intervene and issue macro-market instruments to provide their treasuries with a significant source of non-interest rate based financing while promoting risk sharing. Moreover, given that evidence across the world suggests that monetary policy’s transmission mechanism may be impaired, it is suggested that these government issued securities could also impart added potency to monetary policy.

In this study, digital goods are evaluated in public goods based on the assumptions of two characteristics of public goods: non-excludability and non-rivalry in consumption/use. Finally, aimed to establish the existence of the digital economy, as the new economy entered the literature and today with the development of digital goods to be dealt with in more detail on them.
P43|Alternativen zur gegenwärtigen Finanzierung des öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunks|The funding system for public broadcasting in Germany is facing several difficulties: The existing license fee “Rundfunkbeitrag” causes discontent in the society and creates constitutional violations. Therefore, a reformation of public broadcasting funding is necessary. In this article, an alternative model is discussed, namely the implementation of a tax-financed system. Public broadcasting should receive payments from the budgets of the federal states to fulfill its tasks. At the same time, commercials should be banned from public broadcasting, because partial dependency on the advertising industry has a negative influence on the programming.

P43|Do Common Stocks Have Perfect Substitutes? Product Market Competition and the Elasticity of Demand for Stocks|Though common stocks are one of the most important assets in an economy, little is known about their demand curves. I estimate demand curves for 144 NYSE stocks using a unique data set of all orders, including off-equilibrium orders, during three months in 1990 and 1991. Connecting asset pricing with industrial organization, I find that stocks of firms in less competitive industries are more elastic because they have closer substitutes than stocks in more competitive industries. Tests that exploit the 1991 Gulf War shock and S&P 500 Index additions confirm these results. © 2014 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
P43|Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act:Purpose, Critique, Implementation Status and Policy Issues|In this volume, what are thought to be some of the more important aspects of the Dodd–Frank Act are discussed from a number of perspectives, including that of industry scholars who have been actively involved in evaluating financial regulation, regulators who are responsible for implementing the reform, financial policy experts representing think tanks and banking trade associations, congressmen and congressional staff involved with developing the legislation, and legal scholars.

P43|The Dodd–Frank Act: An Overview|As financial regulation evolved over the past 80 years, it became common to introduce new legislation with the claim that “this is the most significant regulatory reform since the Great Depression and the Banking Act of 1933.” On July 21, 2010, following the 2008–2009 financial crisis, President Barack Obama signed into law the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (hereafter Dodd–Frank). In the view of many in the industry, Dodd–Frank became the new standard against which all future reforms should be compared. The stated goals of the act were to provide financial regulatory reform, to protect consumers and investors, to put an end to the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem, to regulate the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets, and to prevent future financial crises. The act has far-reaching implications for industry stability and how financial services firms will conduct business in the future…

Moreover, in this chapter, where appropriate, I also mention and describe some of the updates to the implementation of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act being performed by the various government agencies since passage of the act…
P43|Financial Stability Regulation|As one would expect of a piece of legislation that has 16 titles and runs 849 pages in the Statutes at Large, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ranges widely in addressing problems both directly and indirectly associated with the financial crisis. Taken as a whole, though, the primary aim of those 849 pages can fairly be read as a reorientation of financial regulation towards safeguarding “financial stability” through the containment of “systemic risk,” phrases that both recur dozens of times throughout the statute. The law, explicitly in many provisions and implicitly in many others, directs the bank regulatory agencies to broaden their focus beyond the soundness of individual banking institutions, and the market regulatory agencies to move beyond their traditional focus on transaction-based investor protection.

P43|Implementing the Dodd–Frank Act: Progress to Date and Recommendations for the Future|I know that I don't have to tell you that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has been extraordinarily busy in its efforts to fulfill the regulatory mandates of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. As of May 2011, the CFTC has put forth 66 proposed and final rules under the Dodd–Frank Act (DFA). Not even counting the last four rule proposals the CFTC voted on, we're at over 1,046 dense Federal Register pages filled with legal jargon and regulatory requirements. If you were to run the comment periods on all of those proposals consecutively, it would take 2,964 days, or a little over 8 years. I doubt I have to give those numbers much context; they speak for themselves. But just for fun, if you were to lay each of those Federal Register pages end to end, they'd stretch two-thirds of the way up the newly renamed Willis Tower in Chicago. And we're not done yet, so I am sure we'll reach the top of the tower before this is all over.

For nearly 50 years, the Bank Structure Conference has been a vitally important forum for addressing the challenges facing the financial services industry. It all began in the early 1960s as a series of symposia on competition and market structure in what was then, in many respects, a much more heavily regulated banking industry. In those days, branching restrictions, product and service limitations, and interest-rate ceilings were the norm. But by the 1970s, the focus shifted somewhat to the need for banking deregulation in a fast-changing financial landscape…

P43|Implementing Dodd–Frank: Orderly Resolution|I would like to take the opportunity to discuss one of those challenging issues — the orderly resolution of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act provided important new authority to the FDIC to resolve SIFIs. Prior to the recent crisis, the FDIC's receivership authority was limited to federally insured banks and thrift institutions. There was no authority to place the holding company or affiliates of an insured institution or any other nonbank financial company into an FDIC receivership to avoid systemic consequences. The lack of this authority severely constrained the ability of the government to resolve a SIFI. This authority has now been provided to the FDIC under the Dodd–Frank Act (DFA)…

P43|The Effect of the Subprime Crisis on the Financing of Entrepreneurial Activities by Islamic Banks|The subprime financial crisis and the subsequent economic recession had encouraged economists world-wide to consider alternative financial solutions. Attention has been focused on Islamic banking and finance as an alternative model. The purpose of this research paper is to assess empirically the effect of the subprime crisis on the financing of entrepreneurial activities by Islamic banks using a sample of 10 Islamic banks during the period from 2004 to 2009. The empirical results show that Islamic banks have found in the crisis an opportunity to justify their practices to gain market share and to introduce themselves to the aid of entrepreneurial activities.
P43|Income Redistribution In Urban China By Social Security System—An Empirical Analysis Based On Annual And Lifetime Income|This study investigates the redistributive effect of the social security reform in urban China using the nationally representative urban household surveys in 1995 and 2002. The main findings are as follows. First, public pension is the main income for the elderly in urban China. Majority of people aged 60 and over (72% in 1995, 82% in 2002) have pension. Second, the social security system in urban China improved the income of low-income and older age groups and reduced the relative poverty rate. However, the redistributive effect did not offset the expanding income inequality, which resulted in the Gini coefficient of redistributed income in 2002 being higher than that in 1995. Third, during 1995 and 2002, both low income group and high income group get positive net benefit from social security system, but the net benefit is increasing with income. There is an adverse income transfer in social security system no matter measured on annual income or lifetime income. Fourth, assuming that the reformed policy were applied to public sector employees, the long-term redistributive effect of the pension system for the working population, as calculated using their lifetime income, would be larger.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P43|Persistent effects of empires: Evidence from the partitions of Poland|We use spatial regression discontinuity analysis to test whether the historical partition of Poland among three empires--Russia, Austria‐Hungary, and Prussia--has a persistent effect on political outcomes in contemporary Poland and to examine the channels of this influence. We find that the main difference in voting across Polish territories attributed by many observers to the legacy of empires is driven by omitted variables. However, empires do have a significant causal effect. The lands that belonged to Prussia (compared with those that belonged to Russia) vote more for anticommunist (post‐Solidarity) parties. This difference is largely explained by the persistent effect of infrastructure built by Prussians at the time of industrialization. The former Austrian lands (compared with former Russian lands) votes more for religious conservatives and for liberals. The difference in the vote for religious conservatives is explained by persistent differences in church attendance driven by vastly different policies of the two empires toward the Catholic Church. Higher support for liberals on the Austrian side is partly explained by a persistent belief in democracy, which is a legacy of decentralized democratic governance of the Austrian empire.
P43|The wonder-clause|The Greek debt crisis prompted EU officials to embark on a radical reconstruction of the European sovereign debt markets. Prominently featured in this reconstruction was a set of contract provisions called Collective Action Clauses, or CACs. CACs are supposed to help governments and private creditors to renegotiate unsustainable debt contracts, and obviate the need for EU bailouts. But European sovereign debt contacts were already amenable to restructuring; adding CACs could make it harder. Why, then, promote CACs at all, and cast them in such a central role in the market reform initiative? Using interviews with participants in the initiative and those affected by it, as well as observations at policy and academic meetings, we attempt to shed light on the puzzle and draw implications for the role of contract techniques in market construction.
P43|Grant legislation vs. political factors as determinants of soft budget spending behaviors. Comparison between Italian and French regions|This paper analyses intergovernmental transfers in France and Italy to assess to which extent soft budget spending behaviors result from slack in fiscal constraints or from political factors. It innovates on the previous literature, which concentrated on single countries, by adopting a comparative perspective. We estimate two separate but identical autoregressive forecasting models on French and Italian data to evaluate how rules and political factors lead the regional administrators of each country to form their expectations about the amount of transfers they will receive from the central government. This allows to proxy the transfer expectations in both countries and their role in determining soft budget spending behaviors. The estimates indicate that transfer expectations are a quantitatively important component of regional spending in both countries, regardless thedifferent degrees of stringency of grant legislations and the type of grants and expenditures (total, currentand capital) examined.

P43|An Old Measure of Decision-Making Quality Sheds New Light on Paternalism|Definitive judgment about the quality of decision-making is made difficult by twin problems of measurement and identification. A measure of decision-making quality is hard to formalize, to quantify, and to make practical for use in a variety of choice environments; and it is difficult to distinguish differences in decision-making quality from unobserved differences in preferences, information, beliefs, or constraints. In this paper, we describe a widely applicable set of tools for theoretical analysis and experimental methods for addressing these problems. These tools and methods can indicate a more targeted approach to ilight paternalismj polices aimed at improving decision-making quality.
P43|The U.S. economy today: Between systemic crisis and permanent war|This paper studies the U.S. economy from an original point of view: that of the links existing between crisis and war. The first part analyzes the workings of the current crisis, considered to be a “systemic” one. The second part places the U.S. economy at the very heart of this crisis. The third part emphasizes the limitations of the anti-crisis policies that are being implemented, as well as the “currency war” issue. Then, the central focus moves towards U.S. warfare as a permanent feature. In a fifth part, the author examines the control exercized by finance capital on the military sector, including military-industrial complex and privately owned military companies. And finally, it examines how these links between crisis and war exacerbe the current capitalist contradictions

The first part proposes a periodization of the spread of U.S. military bases. The second part exposes the official statistical data disseminated by the US Department of Defense. The third part analyzes in a critical way the main limitations of these data, and suggests some revisions. The fourth and last part gives a brief outline on networks of military bases on the northern countries which are strategic allies of the United States
P43|Institutional Models of Real Sector Financing|"The author considers basic institutional models that define the macroeconomic policies for the real sector financing under economic growth. The hypothesis is tested that two institutional models in real sector financing could be singled out, so called ""state as the main investor"" and ""state as the regulator"". To prove this hypothesis, data about the dynamics of real sector financing in Russia and in the USA are used. X- and Y-economies concept (Kirdina, 2012) is used to explain the differences. Concerning this, some particularities of investment characteristics in the national statistics due to institutional differences of two countries are also discussed."
P43|Transition To The Innovative Model Of Development In The National Economy And The Need For Financial Support Of This Process|This article aims to analyze some obvious sources of financing the innovative development. Mobilizing capital for financial support innovative development model is traditionally performed by the state and private investors. Institutions participating in financing the innovation are investment funds and pension funds, insurance companies, major industrial companies, commercial banks, government agencies, international organizations, and individual investors with their own free capital. The structure and share of resources for the venture fund formation varies from country to country and depends on such factors as: state policy on science and innovation, legislative regulation, the level of development of the financial sector, investor aversion to risk innovation etc
P43|Fragility Of Interest-Based Debt Financing: Is It Worth Sustaining A Regime Uncertainty?|Evidence has been mounting that the interest-based debt financing regime is under increasing distress. Evidence also suggests that the financial crises, whatever title they carried - exchange rate crisis or banking crisis – have been debt crises in essence. At present, data suggest that the debt-to-GDP ratio of the richest members of the G-20 is expected to reach 120% mark by 2014. There is also evidence that out of securities worth US$ 200 trillion in the global economy, no less than three-fourth represents interest-based debt. It is difficult to see how this massive debt volume can be validated by the underlying productive capacity of the global economy. This picture becomes more alarming considering the anemic state of global economic growth. There is great uncertainty with regard to interest rates. Although policy-driven interest rates are near-zero level, there is no assurance that they will not rise as the risk and inflation premia become significant. Hence, a more serious financial crisis may be in the offing and a general collapse of asset prices may occur. This paper argues that the survival of the interest-based debt regime is becoming less tenable, as is the process of financialization that has accompanied the growth of global finance over the last four decades. It further argues that Islamic finance, with its core characteristic of risk sharing, may well be a viable alternative to the present interest-based debt financing regime.
P43|Die Finanzierung des öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunks|Germany is characterised by a dualism between public and private broadcasting. Public broadcasting services, encompassing radio and television, are mainly financed by license fees. As a result of the revised Broadcasting Law, the former broadcasting fees were replaced on 1 January 2013 by a monthly broadcasting contribution paid by every household and company regardless of whether or when they use public broadcasting services. The new system resulted in higher fees for many people and a controversial public dispute. The author of this paper highlights some options to improve the current financing system.

P43|Co-movements of Shanghai and New York stock prices by time-varying regressions|We use time-varying regression to model the relationship between returns in the Shanghai and New York stock markets, with possible inclusion of lagged returns. The parameters of the regressions reveal that the effect of current stock return of New York on Shanghai steadily increases after the 1997 Asian financial crisis and turns significantly and persistently positive after 2002 when China entered WTO. The effect of current return of Shanghai on New York also becomes significantly positive and increasing after 2002. The upward trend has been interrupted during the recent global financial crisis, but reaches the level of about 0.4–0.5 in 2010 for both markets. Our results show that China’s stock market has become more and more integrated to the world market in the past twenty years with interruptions occurring during the recent global economic downturn.
P43|A Hitelek És Megtakarítások Alakulása A Bács-Kiskun Megyei Háztartások Tükrében| 2011 tavaszán és őszén a Lakitelki Népfőiskola Kossuth Kollégium néven kérdőíves fel-mérést végzett a Közép- alföldi régióban, leginkább Bács- Kiskun megyében, a lakosság önértékelését vizsgálva pénzügyi, gazdasági helyzetéről, tájékozottságáról. Az említett kutatásban részt vettünk a Károly Róbert Főiskolát képviselve, ahol tapasztalatot és kutatási anyagot szereztünk, amelynek szabad felhasználásához hozzájárultak a Kossuth Kollégium szervezői. A tavaszi kutatás során 1 132, az őszi felmérés alatt 1 773 darab kérdőívet dolgoztunk fel. Ezekre az adatbázisokra építettük tudományos munkánkat. A kérdőíves kutatás egyebek mellett a háztartások hitelezéshez és megtakarításokhoz való viszonyát is vizsgálta, amely dolgozatunk témáját adja. A primer kutatás tükrében célunk bemutatni, hogy a megkérdezettek hogyan viszonyulnak a hitelekhez, megtakarításokhoz, illetve a válság milyen hatással volt a vizsgált háztartások pénzügyeire. Célunk egy olyan figyelemfelkeltő anyag összeállítása, amely rávilágít a vidéki emberek modern pénzügyi termékekkel szembeni hozzáállására, az öngondoskodás kérdésével kapcsolatos problémáira, illetve arra, hogy számukra megjelenik-e a „megtakarítás” lehetőségként, és ha igen, milyen formában. ---------------------------------------------------------------- In spring and autumn 2011, the People’s Collage of Lakitelek – under the name of Kossuth College – made a survey in the region of Central-Lowland, mainly in Bács-Kiskun county, investigating the self-assessment of the population in the field of their own finan-cial and economic situation, awareness. We took part in this survey as an interviewer, representing Károly Róbert College. We have gained experience and research material which we can use now with the permission of the organizers at Kossuth College. We processed 1 132 questionnaire during the research of spring and 1 773 questionnaire during the research of autumn. Our scientific work is based on this data base. This research tested the attitude of households concerning crediting and savings and that is the topic of this study. In light of the primary research, our aim is to present what kind of attitude the respondants have towards credits and savings. We would also like to point out how the crisis af-fected the finance of these households in question. During the analysis we study the financial culture of this area and compare it with social and economic publications. Our intention is to create a documentation to raise awareness and to shed some light on the attitude of the country people towards modern financial products, their problems connected with the question of self-care and whether they consider „saving” as an option. If so, what kind of solution would they choose?
P43|Autocorrelation in economic indicators before and after Natural Disaster|This study investigates the autocorrelation in economic indicators of Pakistan before and after Natural disaster in the light of variables,which includes GDP (deflator), Inflation (CPI), Money supply (M2), Remittances and Net export (X-M).This study considers the data forthe period of 1989-2009. In thisstudy, data has been divided into two sets; first having a data for the period of 19892005forbefore earthquake and second has adata for the period of 2006-2009 for after earthquake. The findings of this paper reveal that all of the major economic players of Pakistan as stated above do follow the certain upward trend for the period before natural disasters. While, after the event of natural disasters these major players have no certain trend and they move randomly.
P43|Subnational Taxation in Large Emerging Countries: BRIC Plus One|This paper reviews the evolution and current state of subnational taxation in five large emerging countries: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and Nigeria—BRIC plus one. As these case studies show, intergovernmental fiscal relations in any country are inevitably both path-dependent and context-sensitive. In India and Brazil, for example, subnational governments already have a significant degree of fiscal autonomy in being able to set some key tax rates. In both countries, however, substantial attention still must be paid to improving the general consumption taxes that are the main source of regional government revenues as well as the property taxes on which local governments mainly depend. Although Nigeria, like India and Brazil, is a federation, its fiscal system depends so heavily on oil revenues that almost all political attention has been focused on securing a bigger share of these revenues. Both China and Russia have made important changes in the direction of centralizing rather than decentralizing effective control over subnational taxes. In both countries, the key issue is the extent to which fiscal decentralization is to be accompanied by significant political decentralization. At present, in neither China nor Russia is it clear that the central authorities are willing to permit subnational governments much autonomy in this respect.
P43|Création d'un indice boursier islamique sur la place financière de Paris : méthodologie et performance|Taking into account the huge potential and the increasing role played by the Islamic finance, this paper analyses the methodological process linked to the introduction of a shariah compliant index on the Paris Stock market along with a study of its short and long term performance. A screening process is applied to different stocks composing the SBF 250 index in order to make it shariah compliant. This process leads to the exclusion of almost 90% of the stocks, thus the final Islamic index is composed by 25 companies. The weighting procedure is based on the free float of each stock composing the index with a capping factor of 15%. From August 31, 2007 to August 31, 2010 the Sharpe Ratio, the Jensen’s alpha and the « Buy and Hold » returns lead to the same conclusion : the French 25 shariah outperforms both its conventional and shariah compliant counterparts, on the short run and on the long run. Over the same period, the low average beta of the French 25 shariah index (0.30) can be explained by the dominance of stocks belonging to the health industry (40%).

P43|Cost probability analysis of reprocessing spent nuclear fuel in the US|The methods by which nuclear power's radioactive signature could be reduced typically require the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. However, economic assessments of the costs that are associated with doing this are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We present a probabilistic analysis of the costs to build, operate and decommission the facilities that would be required to reprocess all US spent nuclear fuel generated over a one hundred year time frame, starting from a 2010 power production rate. The analysis suggests a total life-cycle cost of 2.11±0.26mills/kWh, with a 90% and 99% confidence that the overall cost would remain below 2.45 and 2.75mills/kWh respectively. The most significant effects on cost come from the efficiency of the reactor fleet and the growth rate of nuclear power. The analysis shows that discounting results in life-cycle costs decreasing as recycling is delayed. However the costs to store spent fuel closely counter the effect of discounting when an intergenerational discount rate is used.
P43|Euros(c)epsis - The theory of the optimum currency area and the history of the Euro|The examines whether the euro crisis can be entirely attributed to factors such as regulatory failure or fiscal indiscipline, as opposed to the mechanisms built into the euro itself. It concludes that the euro contains a built-in bias that would result in the divergence of the path taken by the developed members on the one hand and the less developed ones on the other. The original the optimum currency area („OCA”) theory appears to have been valid, and the departure from it, as embodied in the Maastricht Treaty, amounted to an unjustified departure in light of the experience of the five weak countries of the eurozone (PIIGS). These experiences have proved that after the introduction of the common currency overcoming significant differences in initial conditions seems quite difficult. Only the countries having international companies with very strong positions on the world markets could take advantages of the euro, and the disadvantages resulting from the deterioration in competitiveness were left to the weaker ones. This also implies that the advantages for the stronger countries to the extent actually experienced were enhanced by the competitiveness of the weaker ones.
P43|Credit Risk in Agriculture Sector|The objective of the research paper is to study the credit deficit in agricultural sector. Credit deficit in agricultural sector means the difference between the institutional farm credit availed by the farmers and cost of production. Farmers require access to affordable, adequate and timely credit to purchase and use the inputs required for cultivation. But the credit provided by the financial institutions to agricultural sector continues to be inadequate and less than the cost of production. It compels them to depend on informal sources of credit. So, in this paper in order to examine the difference between institutional short term credit availed by the farmers and cost of production i.e. credit deficit per acre and per farms, a field study (2009-10) of three villages of different degree of Bargarh district (Orissa) India has been done. In order to test the hypotheses to know the significant difference in the credit deficit per acre and per farm across the villages and farm sizes TWO WAY ANOVA TEST has been done.
P43|Growth and public finance in Bihar|This paper explores the causal links between the role of public finance and Bihar's growth and development in the last decade; and argues that these links are tenuous. Bihar's growth acceleration precedes the ‘policy reforms' in public finance based on the ‘good governance' agenda initiated since 2005-06. However, the constraints on sustaining efforts to close Bihar's development gap with the rest of India stems from the nature of the growth process in its regional, sectoral and social dimensions and the contradictory means and ends of the ‘policy reforms' in public finance. Together, this has not only prevented the economic growth to add to public coiffeurs of the state but also occluded the role of tax institutions.

P43|Cross-cultural management: peculiarities of business cultures and communication problems|The article discusses real and potential communication problems caused by cultural differences between the representatives of various national business cultures. No doubt that in addition to the ability to overcome the language barrier business associates should prepare thoroughly so that they could prevent possible problems of business communications.
P43|Democracy and Stock Market Performance in African Countries|Purpose – This paper assesses the incidence of political institutions on stock market performance dynamics in Africa. Design/methodology/approach – The estimation technique used is a Two-Stage-Least Squares Instrumental Variable methodology. Channels of democracy, polity and autocracy are instrumented with legal-origins, religious-legacies, income-levels and press-freedom qualities to account for stock market performance dynamics of capitalization, value traded, turnover and number of listed companies. To ensure robustness of the analysis, the following checks are carried out: (1) usage of alternative indicators of political institutions; (2) employment of two distinct interchangeable sets of moment conditions that engender every category of the instruments; (3) usage of alternative indicators of stock market performance; (4) account for the concern of endogeneity; (5) usage of Principal Component Analysis(PCA) to reduce the dimensions of stock market dynamics and political indicators and then check for further robustness of findings in the regressions from resulting indexes. Findings – Findings broadly demonstrate that democracy improves investigated stock market performance dynamics. Practical implications – As a policy recommendation, the role of sound political institutions is crucial for financial development in Africa. Democracies have important effects on both the degree of competition for public office and the quality of public offices that favor stock market development in the African continent. Originality/value – To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper to assess the incidence of democracy on stock market performance in an exclusive African context. Political strife has plagued many African countries and continue to pose a significant threat to financial market development.
P43|Government Quality Determinants of Stock Market Performance in African Countries|How do government policies and institutions affect stock market performance? As stock markets grow broader and deeper in African countries, the question becomes more critical. Government quality dynamics of corruption-control, government-effectiveness, political-stability or no violence, voice & accountability, regulation quality and rule of law are instrumented with income-levels, religious-dominations, press-freedom degrees and legal-origins to account for stock market performance dynamics of capitalization, value traded, turnover and number of listed companies. The results demonstrate a significant positive association between stock market performance measures and the quality of government institutions. These findings suggest countries with better developed government institutions would favor stock markets with higher market capitalization, better turnover ratios, higher value in shares traded and greater number of listed companies.
P43|Fiscal Policy in Crisis: Rethinking Austerity|Many macroeconomists and politicans claim that fi scal austerity – getting the budget defi - cit down immediately – would be good for employment and growth. We think that fi scal stimulus is expansionary, and fi scal contraction is contractionary. There is a large and growing body of literature that shows that fi scal expansion can help economy to grow and reduce unemployment in near term; that certain types of fi scal stimulus are very effective and that fi scal contractions tend to lower output and employment in the short run. Fiscal austerity may be desirable for the long-term solvency and health of the economy. But it lowers growth and raises unemployment in the near term. A policy mix between new monetary strategy (nominal GDP targeting) and fi scal stimulus would be especially effective.
P43|Law, democracy and the quality of government in Africa|This paper examines the big questions of African comparative politics. It assesses the interaction of three crucial components in the development of the continent: law, democracy and quality of government. Political regimes of democracy, polity and autocracy are instrumented with income-levels, legal-origins, religious-dominations and press-freedom levels to account for government quality dynamics of corruption-control, government-effectiveness, voice and accountability, political-stability, regulation quality and rule of law. Findings indicate democracy has an edge over autocracy while the later and polity overlap. A democracy that takes into account only the voice of the majority is better in government quality than autocracy, while a democracy that takes into account the voice of the minority (polity) is worse in government quality than autocracy. As a policy implication, democracy once initiated should be accelerated to edge the appeals of authoritarian regimes and reap the benefits of time and level hypotheses.
P43|Learning by investing|Learning is a subject of intense research in experimental economics. We contribute to this debate by presenting persuasive evidence that learning took place among uninformed heterogeneous agents on a quasi-stock market during a large-scale natural experiment that by size, incentives, and variation belongs among the largest experiments ever conducted. To detect and quantify learning we develop new measures of individual performance during the bidding process when prices of goods vary over succeeding stages of bidding.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P43|Public pension and household saving: Evidence from urban China|We relate household savings to pension reform, to explain the high household savings rates in urban China from a new perspective. We use the exogenous – policy-induced – variation in pension wealth to estimate explicitly the impact of pension wealth on household savings, and obtain evidence of a significant offset effect of pension wealth on household savings. Although the size of the effect depends on the parameter values assumed, the finding that household savings are affected by pension reform is robust. Our estimates show that, under plausible scenarios, pension reform boosted household savings rates in 1999 by about 6–9 percentage points for cohorts aged 25–29 and by about 2–3 percentage points for cohorts aged 50–59. Our results also indicate that declining pension wealth reduces expenditure on education and health more than on other consumption items.
P43|Political Competition, Ideology and Corruption|This paper presents a model of political competition, where voter decisions are affected by their ideological adherence to political parties. We derive a number of interesting results: First, we show that an equilibrium exists even though voting is fully deterministic. Second, although politicians, because of deterministic voting, can win an election with certainty by making concessions to voters, they choose to win the election only with some probability in order to maximize their expected rents. Third, if the distribution of ideology is asymmetric, then political parties follow different platforms in equilibrium. Finally, our model generates two novel empirical predicitions, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been tested yet: i) the higher the ideological adherence to a political party the more inefficient policies this party will follow, ii) the higher the number of extra votes required for election victory (the super-majority requirement) the higher the degree of corruption.
P43|Frictions to Political Competition and Financial Openness|In this paper we present a political economy approach in order to explain the degree of financial openness for an economy. In the model, entrepreneurs, who may have good or bad projects, vote for policies, which are proposed by selfi sh politicians. Two political frictions (ideological adherence and a super- majority requirement) impair political competition and lead to equilibria, where politicians receive corruption bribes. Furthermore, the model implies a non-monotonic relationship between financial openness and corruption and a positive relationship between financial openness and government size. Some of the model predictions are consistent with empirical findings while other predictions have not beeen tested yet.
P43|A New Approach to Causality Testing|A new causality test based on Higher Order Cumulants (HOC) is proposed in this paper. The test can be applied on non Gaussian time series. The methodological novelty is the usage of a two- step method based on digital whitening, which is performed by ARMA-HOC filter. To substantiate the method further, an empirical analysis of the relationship between the interest rate spread and real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is presented for the period 1982:q1 -2010:q1. The spread is measured as a difference between 10-year bond yields and three-month Treasury bill rates in the US. The fist step applies ARMA-HOC models to obtain white residuals from a quarterly term spread (TS) and GDP growth. The second step tests the dynamical correlation of TS and GDP growth residuals. The results show that the proposed test can capture the information about non Gaussian properties of the random variables being tested. The test is compared with the Granger-Sims causality test. The paper questions the reliability of the Granger test.
P43|On the nature of the present world economic crisis. A non-neoliberal sketch|The author wrote this paper in 2009, after the outbreak of the crisis. The paper, in the first place, was made for the young economist generation about the non-liberal crisis interpretation. The main thoughts are also topical at present, in the middle of 2011, when perhaps a new wave of the crisis might have started, for world economic tensions, which the paper introduces, survived in essence as the consequence of bank-saving and money-producing policies. At first, the paper enumerates the crisis explanations from Sismondi through Marx to Krugman and Roubini the economists of our present days. It shortly mentions previous typical world economic crises and lists their changing features, outlines the stages of economic cycles, and touches upon the existence of the greater crises that change the functioning of capitalism, the so-called node crises.

P43|Default Predictors in Retail Credit Scoring: Evidence from Czech Banking Data| Credit to the private sector has risen rapidly in European emerging markets, but its risk evaluation has been largely neglected. Using retail-loan banking data from the Czech Republic, we construct two credit risk models based on logistic regression and classification and regression trees. Both methods are comparably efficient and detect similar financial and socioeconomic variables as the key determinants of default behavior. We also construct a model without the most important financial variable (amount of resources), which performs very well. This way, we confirm significance of sociodemographic variables and link our results with specific issues characteristic to new EU members.
P43|Islamic asset management|Islamic Finance, which is based on the Shari'ah Law, has seen a growing interest in the last few years. This phenomenon is attributable not only to the demographic trends within Muslin countries but also to the wealth accumulated by HNWI and the growing demand to manage it in compliance with religious rules. In this article we will focus on the Islamic asset management and in particular on asset class equity highlighting the main element of the investment process as well as challenges that the industry is facing to reach a more mature stage of development. We will also consider an indices style analysis to highlight effects of the Islamic principles on the portfolio allocation process.
P43|Provincial and Local Governments in China: Fiscal Institutions and Government Behavior|"What are the incentives faced by local officials in China? Without democratic institutions, there is no mechanism for local residents to exercise ""voice"". Given the hukou registration system, local residents have little opportunity to threaten ""exit"" if they are unhappy with local taxes and spending. This paper explores an alternative source of incentives, starting from the premise that local officials aim to maximize the jurisdiction's fiscal residual (profits), equal to local tax revenue minus expenditures on public services. In a Tiebout setting with mobile households, this objective should lead to efficient provision. What happens, though, if firms and economic activity but not people are mobile? The paper examines the incentives faced by local Chinese officials in this context, and argues that the forecasted behavior helps to explain both the successes and the problems arising from local government activity in China.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
P43|O “sociologie” a crizei actuale: de la social-democraţia “subprime”-lor, la conservatorismul tip “too big to fail”|The lesson of crisis in economy, if we could condense it into a single idea, would sound like this: when private property gets mixed with illusion and fraud, the societal order becomes a tensed experiments system, both discretionary and costly. This is, in fact, the interventionism’s essence, as opposed to (or as deviation from) the private property order, in a jus-naturalist sense.
P43|The State, the Crisis and the Expectations Trap|Over the past 20 years, I have supported the idea that the state intervention in the economy lays at the root of Romania’s most economic problems. Each and every time, I mentioned Romania as an example of a country that abused the state intervention in all fields from bailouts to overregulation. However, in recent years, the developed economies, which we took for a model, did the same.
P43|Equity of Health Care Financing: An Application to Iran|This paper analyzes inequality in Iran's health system from a financing perspective. Through grouped data of household budget published by Iran Statistic Center (ISC) and Beta Lorenz curve introduced in Kakwani (1980), it has been tried to extract Beta Lorenz curve and Kakwani progressivity index in each individual rural and urban district, and also to obtain other inequality measure in (1997-2007) Period.Then to study health inequality for the given period, we divided it into two sub-periods: (1997-2001) and (2002-2007) and finally to compare health inequality, using Bootstrap technique, we made a pseudo statistical population. Results show a degree of descending progressively in urban areas while in rural areas it has witnessed a slight improvement. However as the results show in both rural and urban areas, because of the negativity of Kakwani's index of the household expenditure which is financed by themselves is not progressive at all. Also the ratio of share richest quintile to poorest quintile for health care in urban and rural areas are 8.79 and 8.01 respectively.

P43|Democracy and stock market performance in developing countries|This is paper is a natural extension of Yang (2011) where-in democracy is not positively related to stock market development. We postulate that when moment conditions of stock market performance are accounted for, democracy improves financial markets in developing countries. Channels of democracy, polity and autocracy are instrumented with legal-origins, religious-legacies, income-levels and press-freedom qualities. As a policy implication democracies have important effects on both the degree of competition for public office and the quality of public policies that favor stock market performance in developing countries.

P43|The New â€œVoodoo Economicsâ€|Marxâ€™s notion of the â€œfetishism of commoditiesâ€ and money is used to analyze the modern phenomenon of the public/private divide, the apparent division of society into state and market. The public/private divide, in turn, provides greater insights into the sources and limits of public finance. The importance of the role of the state as the issuer of the currency is highlighted in the development of Marxâ€™s analysis, as well as in recent debates regarding economic policy and the causes of global financial crises. Using Marxâ€™s analysis of the rules of capitalist property, along with the distribution of the surplus and the formation of the equal average rate of profit, the illusion that money is productive is found to be the source of distortions in understanding, and erroneous policies for the management of, the capitalist economy. According to Marx, the existence of money as a commodity is a sign that the economy is already beyond social control.JEL code: B51, P16, P43
P43|Hedging Derivatives|Valuation and hedging of financial derivatives are intrinsically linked concepts. Choosing appropriate hedging techniques depends on both the type of derivative and assumptions placed on the underlying stochastic process. This volume provides a systematic treatment of hedging in incomplete markets. Mean-variance hedging under the risk-neutral measure is applied in the framework of exponential L¨¦vy processes and for derivatives written on defaultable assets. It is discussed how to complete markets based upon stochastic volatility models via trading in both stocks and vanilla options. Exponential utility indifference pricing is explored via a duality with entropy minimization. Backward stochastic differential equations offer an alternative approach and are moreover applied to study markets with trading constraints including basis risk. A range of optimal martingale measures are discussed including the entropy, Esscher and minimal martingale measures. Quasi-symmetry properties of stochastic processes are deployed in the semi-static hedging of barrier options. This book is directed towards both graduate students and researchers in mathematical finance, and will also provide an orientation to applied mathematicians, financial economists and practitioners wishing to explore recent progress in this field.
P43|Does More Government Deficit Lead to a Higher Long-term Interest Rate? Application of an Extended Loanable Funds Model to Estonia|Applying and extending the open-economy loanable funds model, this article shows that more government borrowing or debt as a percent of GDP leads to a higher government bond yield, that a higher real money market rate, a higher expected inflation rate, a higher EU government bond yield, or depreciation of the Estonian kroon (EEK) would increase the Estonian government bond yield, and that the negative coefficient of the percent change in real GDP has an unexpected sign. When the conventional closed-economy or openeconomy loanable funds model is considered, the article finds that more government borrowing as a percent of GDP does not result in a higher government bond yield, that the positive coefficients of the real money market rate, the growth rate of real GDP, and the expected inflation are significant at the 1%, 5% or 10% level, and that the negative coefficient of the ratio of the net capital inflow to GDP in the conventional open-economy loanable funds model is significant at the 1% level.
P43|Scotland: A New Fiscal Settlement| Executive Summary Many commentators have criticised the strategy currently used to finance the Scottish Parliament â€“ both the block grant system, and the small degree of fiscal autonomy devised in the Calman report and the UK governmentâ€™s 2009 White Paper. Nevertheless, fiscal autonomy has now been conceded in principle. This paper sets out to identify formally what level of autonomy would be best for the Scottish economy and the institutional changes needed to support that arrangement. Our conclusions are in line with the Steel Commission: that significantly more fiscal powers need to be transferred to Scotland. But what we can then do, which the Steel Commission could not, is to give a detailed blueprint for how this proposal might be implemented in practice. We face two problems. The existing block grant system can and has been criticised from such a wide variety of points of view that it effectively has no credibility left. On the other hand, the Calman proposals (and the UK government proposals that followed) are unworkable because, to function, they require information that the policy makers cannot possibly have; and because, without borrowing for current activities, they contain no mechanism to reconcile contractual spending (most of the budget) with variable revenue flows â€“ which is to invite an eventual breakdown. But in its attempt to fix these problems, the UK White Paper introduces three further difficulties: new grounds for quarrels between the UK and Scottish governments, a long term deflation bias, and a loss of devolution.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P43|Sistema integral de gestión pública sobre la base de devengo. Experiencias en el ámbito de países de la OCDE|This paper analyses the way the budget works using the accrual system method as a basic hypothesis in conceptual coherence with the countable system, to configure a modern global system of public administration used to successfully tackle the goals that the public bodies have set. We analyse the experiences that are happening in different countries of the OECD sphere, as paradigmatic models of these reforms. We resume the characteristics of the budgetary systems, the characteristics and objectives of the financial management systems, the problems for their implementation, as well as their implications in the decision making process. We conclude studying the starting process of the reform in Spain.
P43|Social Aspects in Buyer-Supplier Relationships of SMEs in Hungary|Cooperation among companies was brought to the focus of attention by the fast changes of economic circumstances and the role it can play in coping with risk, appreciating all those characteristics which can help fast reactions and adaptability, like faith among business partners and long run relationships. The entrepreneur him/herself has a great influence on the characteristics of cooperation as well, besides these processes pushing them to the direction of cooperation, whose intention to get involved depends on his/her skills, abilities, but such characteristics of the company like scale, fields of activities affect it too. Economic, social and cultural circumstances are of major importance too, among which the above mentioned factors pursues their effects. Cooperation among companies can happen on any fields of the firms’ activities, for example research and development, marketing, purchase, or trading. This present paper intends to introduce the reader to the characteristics of supplier-purchaser relationships of small- and medium sized enterprises, based on an empirical research’s experiences. According to our opinion, we can draw conclusions on the intention to cooperate concerning the nature of the buyer-supplier relationships of companies, so a wide range of information can be concluded on small- and medium sized enterprises’ partnerships.
P43|Voyage of Indian Banking Sector: 1979-2007|Observing through the voyage of India Banking Sector, it could be concluded that Indian banking system is operating under competitive state of affairs and earns revenues as if under monopolistic competition, despite not depending on traditional source of fund in the form of deposits as profitability, i.e., return on assets are increasing and approaching towards industry ratio. But still foreign banks functioning in India are on a higher plane with respect to its performance in comparison with other bank groups. Costs of deposits and return on advances of all scheduled commercial banks have declined in the post reform period. However, return on advances was approaching closer to industry average showing competition amongst the banks in making profit on the interest rate front.
P43|Direct and indirect state ownership on banks in Russia|This paper uses the banking industry case to show that the boundaries of public property in Russia are blurred. A messy state withdrawal in 1990s left publicly funded assets beyond direct reach of official state bodies. While we identify no less than 50 state-owned banks in a broad sense, the federal government and regional authorities directly control just 4 and 12 institutions, respectively. 31 banks are indirectly state-owned, and their combined share of state-owned banks’ total assets grew from 11% to over a quarter between 2001 and 2010. The state continues to bear financial responsibility for indirectly owned banks, while it does not benefit properly from their activity through dividends nor capitalization nor policy lending. Such banks tend to act as quasi private institutions with weak corporate governance. Influential insiders (top-managers, current and former civil servants) and cronies extract their rent from control over financial flows and occasional appropriation of parts of bank equity.
P43|Fuentes de financiamiento de los sistemas de seguridad social en países de América del Sur<BR>[Sources of financing social security systems in countries of South America]|One of the objectives of the State is to achieve the highest possible level os society, which is central to ensuring a level of social protection that tends to universality and coverage of socially recognized needs and contingencies such as education, health, security, old age, maternity, disability and unemployment, among others. In this context, social security, defined as the set of institutions aimed at protecting people from the circumstances described above assumes a vital role. This document aims to provide a comparative analysis of various sources of financing social security in South America countries. In particular, it describes the situation in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela. There will be description of the subsystems that make up the Social Security and analyze the particular situation of each selected by focusing on financing.

P43|Russian banking: a comeback of the state|"The purpose of this paper is to assess the size of public sector within the Russian banking industry. We identify and classify at least 78 state-influenced banks. We distinguish between banks that are majority-owned by federal executive authorities or Central Bank of Russia, by sub-federal (regional and municipal) authorities, by state-owned enterprises and banks, and by ""state corporations"". We estimate their combined market share to have reached 56% of total assets by July 1, 2009. Banks indirectly owned by public capital are the fastest-growing group. Concentration is increasing within the public sector of the industry, with the top five state-controlled banking groups in possession of over 49% of assets. We observe a crowding out and erosion of domestic private capital, whose market share is shrinking from year to year. Several of the largest state-owned banks now constitute a de facto intermediate tier at the core of the banking system. We argue that the direction of ownership change in Russian banking is different from that in CEE countries."
P43|Yolsuzlukla Mücadelede E- Devlet ve Türkiye’deki Durum|Although corruption is seen in many countries, it is higher and rampant in developing countries than developed countries. There are many factors which affect corruption. However “the lack of transparency and accountability” and “discretion power” is basic factors to increase corruption in government. For this reason, e-government is thought as a partial but important tool to combat corruption which is the multifaceted problem in government sector. The aim of this study is to examine the efficiency of egovernment as a way of reducing corruption. This study contributes to combat corruption by e-government from the point of both theory and practice. The results of the study support the hypothesis that e-government can make important contributions to reduce corruption.
P43|DEPENDENCE MODELING:Vine Copula Handbook|This book is a collaborative effort from three workshops held over the last three years, all involving principal contributors to the vine-copula methodology. Research and applications in vines have been growing rapidly and there is now a growing need to collate basic results, and standardize terminology and methods. Specifically, this handbook will (1) trace historical developments, standardizing notation and terminology, (2) summarize results on bivariate copulae, (3) summarize results for regular vines, and (4) give an overview of its applications. In addition, many of these results are new and not readily available in any existing journals. New research directions are also discussed.

P43|Do Institutions Have a Greater Effect on Female Entrepreneurs?|This paper compares the impact of institutions on individual decisions to become entrepreneurs in the form of new business start ups by males and females across 44 developed and developing economies between 1998 and 2004. We test four hypotheses; that women are less likely to undertake entrepreneurial activity in countries where the rule of law is weaker; where the state sector is larger; where the informal financial sector is weaker and where the formal financial sector is weaker. We use data from the Global Enterprise Monitor survey (GEM) which covers at least 2,000 individuals annually in each of up to 44 countries, merged with country-level data, from the WB WDI and Heritage Foundation. We start with a spectrum of institutional variables and by utilizing factor analysis prior to regression estimation models, we are able to obtain results that are more robust and address multicollinearity between the institutional measures. We find that women are less likely to undertake entrepreneurial activity in countries where the state sector is larger, and demonstrate that this result applies to both high aspiration and low aspiration entrepreneurship. We also find that women benefit more from the larger informal financial sector.
P43|Le Resultat Financier Des Assureur Et Le Contenu Economique De Celui-Ci|This article deals with scientific issues on the setting of the insurance company's profits. Insurance company's financial result is the effect of economic and financial activity obtained by the insurer during the financial year which can get as the profit or loss, which reflects the success or failure of this activity both in quantitative expression and qualitative expression.
P43|The Ownership and Industry Effects of Corporate Dividend Policy in India, 1961-2007|The cross-sectional trends in dividends are investigated at an aggregate level of ownership (i.e. closely/largely held and regulated firms), and at disaggregate level across 20 industries to examine how Indian Private Corporate Sector appropriated its profits over 1961-2007 periods. Alternatively it is examined whether internal funds are a significant source of finance and the dynamics of relation between dividends relative to earnings across type of companies and industries. Indian corporate sector pays relatively more equity dividends than preference dividends. Other things being equal, the probability of paying cash dividends decreases with share holder concentration and the regulated companies pay relatively larger dividends. Dividend payouts for all type of firms decline, and such tendency is more pronounced after liberalization periods indicating a greater choice of internal financing through retained earnings. The analysis of inter-corporate and inter-industry variations reveals that dividends interplays differently with exogenous factors.
P43|Equity of health care financing in Iran|This study presents the rst analyses of the equity of health care financing in Iran. Kakwani Progressivity Indices (KPIs) and concentration indices (CIs) are estimated using ten national household expenditure surveys, which were conducted in Iran from 1995/96 to 2004/05. The indices are used to analyze the progressivity of two sources of health care financing: health insurance premium payments and consumer co-payments (and the sum of these), for Iran as a whole, and for rural and urban areas of Iran, separately. The results suggest that health insurance premium payments became more progressive over the study period; however the KPIs for consumer co-payments suggest that these are still mildly regressive or slightly progressive, depending upon whether household income or expenditure data are used to generate the indices. Interestingly, the Urban Inpatient Insurance Scheme (UIIS), which was introduced by the Iranian government in 2000 to extend insurance to uninsured urban dwellers, appears to have had a regressive impact on health care nancing, which is contrary to expectations. This result sounds a cautionary note about the potential for public programs to crowd out private sector, charitable activity, which was prevalent in Iran prior to the introduction of the UIIS.
P43|Рыночная Доля Банков С Государственным Участием В России<BR>[Market share of state-influenced banks in Russia]|In this paper we rely on empirical data to develop a classification of state-influenced banks. An estimate of such banks’ combined market share by July 1, 2009 is suggested. We identify 53 state-controlled banks in Russia, including state-owned banks and state-governed banks. Public sector in the banking industry is not limited to the property of federal-level executive authorities or the Central Bank of Russia. It also comprises banks effectively controlled by sub-federal (regional and municipal) authorities, by state-owned enterprises and banks and by “state corporations”. Altogether these banks account for 56% to 57% of all banking assets. Banks owned by public capital indirectly are the fastest-growing group among state-influenced institutions. Concentration grows within public sector of the banking industry, with top-5 state-controlled banking groups in possession of over 49% of national bank assets. We also contemplate a crowding out and erosion of domestic private capital whose market share shrinks from year to year. Effectively a return to a state-run credit system has been accomplished. Several largest state-owned banks now constitute a de facto intermediate third tier of the banking system. Russia’s transition path goes in a quite different direction from that of CEE countries.

P43|Beyond GDP - Measuring the Wealth of Nations|This work devotes analysis to the consistency of the idea to measure the Wealth of Nations beyond GDP. Looking at the desirability, utility and feasibility of the concept, the main objective is to outline whether a socially and environmentally adjusted GDP would be able to have a real policy effect in the direction of sustainability. Section I discusses the desirability of the issue and suggests that our current paradigm of progress needs serious rethinking, as it rests on teleological presuppositions prevalent in the 17th and 18th century - an antiquated mechanical world view, developed by Descartes and Newton. In this context, the historical ascendency of GDP is discussed, outlining its rise and demise. Section II then discusses the utility of an adjusted GDP. Departing from an analysis of the growth elasticities of poverty (health and literacy), which gives empirical evidence on the insufficient correlation of GDP per capita and living standards, conventional GDP will then be weight against the alternative measures. An environmental adjustment will thereby be found justified on the ground of efficiency gain effects occurring along the allocation of resources and health expenditure among others, suggesting that the conventional GDP is inefficient and an economically irrational model to guide progress. Concerns will however be raised about the possible inflationary effect of a social adjustment, which is politically unfeasible under the current paradigm of progress and requires further research in terms of measurement techniques. Section III then suggests that the feasibility is a political question. Taking the Case study of the failed Green GDP attempt in China, lessons learnt will be formalised on which I conclude with suggestions under which circumstances an adjusted GDP would be able to have a real policy effect in the direction of sustainability.
P43|Does more government deficit raise the interest rate? Application of extended loanable funds model to Slovenia|Extending the open-economy loanable funds model, this paper finds that more government deficit as a percentage of GDP does not lead to a higher government bond yield. In addition, a higher real Treasury bill rate, a higher expected inflation rate, a higher EU government bond yield, or an expected depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar would increase Slovenia’s long-term interest rate. The negative coefficient of the percentage change in real GDP is insignificant at the 10% level. Applying the standard closed-economy or open-economy loanable funds model without including the world interest rate and the expected exchange rate, we find similar conclusions except that the positive coefficient of the ratio of the net capital inflow to GDP has a wrong sign and is insignificant at the 10% level.
P43|Existence crises of actual financial management systems|The present financial management systems reflects only partially the economic reality and they are no longer able to act as an instrument for the management. It is absurd that an economy populated by business models based on 21st century technology to use financial management systems based mainly on the same principles formalised by Luca Paciolli in 1494. Therefore, one of the causes of the current economic crisis could be the lack of coordination between the evolution of the business models and the development of new financial management models used by companies, state and investors. The present financial management systems facilitate the existence of grey or even black bookkeeping systems, tax evasion with the help of fiscal paradises, and financial shenanigans aiming to optimise, barely illegal, the financial situations.
P43|Does corporate ownership structure matter for economic growth? A cross-country analysis| The role of corporations in allocating resources has been of great importance in the debate about the manner in which enterprises should be governed to enhance economic growth. Corporate governance features seem to be central to the dynamics by which successful firms and economies improve their performance over time as well as relative to each other. In this paper we try to clarify the relationship between corporate ownership structure and output growth by using the data of La Porta et al. (J. Finance 1999; LIV: 471-517) on ownership structure of large- and medium-sized corporations in 27 economies. To search for empirical linkages, we use cross-country growth regressions. The evidence provided in the paper suggests that an environment with a higher percentage of directly and indirectly widely held companies and a lower degree of state than private ownership is associated with a higher growth rate of per capita income. We also conclude that a higher degree of institutional investment does not seem to enhance the growth performance of an economy. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
P43|Incomes And Expenses Define Elements Of The Budgetary Accounting Of Public Institutions Accounting|The process of reforming accounting has been transposed to the level ofpublic institutions for nearly 3 years. It was an audacious attempt by Cutting out theheavy legacy of the past, limited to income earned and expenses paid. The next stageof reform is sedimentation, decanting, and the formulation of strategies accountingfor supreme desideratum achievement of accounting - the image faithful. In thisprocess should be involved both theory and practice of accounting.

P43|The Concept Of Autonomy In The Context Of The Economic-Financial Mechanism At The Local Public Authorities Level|The local public authorities are based on an economic-financial mechanism which functions on the principle of financial and administrative local autonomy. In order to observe the way of its operation it is necessary to present the concept of autonomy in the structure of the economic-financial mechanism at the level of local public authorities. It is necessary to do this in order to eliminate any speculative ideas regarding the non existence or the limited existence of autonomy in Romania
P43|Comparative Survey on the Records of Fixed Assets of Companies and Public Institutions|This paper deals by way of comparison with the theoretical and practical methods to record the output and input of tangible fixed assets (non-current assets) in and from the patrimony of companies, on the one side and of public institutions, on the other side, intending to point out the differences and similarities, in compliance with the national norms and international standards of accounting (IAS and IPSAS, as the case may be).
P43|The vulnerability of enterprise and the operating financial balance|In the light of functional analysis, the company is vulnerable if used, for the most time part, to financing through bank loans in the short term. This item is highlighted by the study compared of variation of the operating revolving fund, with the variation of revolving fund need. In the frame of operating balance, it believes that the need for floating capital is the most important indicator whereas place in the record those cyclical needs not covered financial from temporary resources and permanent renewable in the same cycles of operation. Achieving this balance is put into evidence of the 4 levels of functional balance, namely: working capital fund (FRF) or stable level of funding, the need for capital funds for operating (NFRE), on the one hand and the need to revolving fund outside exploitation (NFRAE) on the other hand, and the level of treasury securities.
P43|The Indicators from the Financial Structure of the Balance Sheet|The competition frame of the market economy determines the businesses, which don’t manage to impose themselves through quality, competitiveness and efficiency, and for whom there is not possible a straightness in permissible terms, to become insolvent and, therefore, to be eliminated from the „arena” of the economical life. According to these circumstances, any form is interested, in its highest degree, to obtain detailed information regarding the economic-financial indicators obtained in a financial exercise. These indicators can be calculated on the basis of the data contained in the annual balance sheet, by regrouping and restructuring the positions from the balance sheet, the results account and the appendix form the balance sheet. The main category of analysing indicators that can be calculated is referring to the indicators of financial structure.
P43|The Transatlantic Economy Dollar vs Euro relations amid the Global Financial Crisis|The present study intends to describe and analyze recent trends in foreign exchange markets, specifically the United States Dollar and the Euro relations as well as the fundamentals behind monetary assets. It brings to light the relationship between economic variables and monetary policy as well as the importance of geostrategic positions and power. Fundamentally, it analyzes the current financial crisis and the importance of monetary decisions.
P43|Bond Market Emergence|We analyse the emerging Serbian bond market to compare its behaviour to developed markets and to indicate what is behind bond market emergence. As an analytical tool we model the term structure of the bond market. We find that a modified standard model performs rather well in the environment of an emerging market with numerous imperfections and external shocks involved since we obtain a concave yield curve as in developed markets. Further, we show the link of such a structure to macroeconomic developments in terms of responsiveness of interest rates to changes in industrial production and inflation. Finally, the frequency of trading, market liquidity and transparency can be considered as drivers that make the market emerge.
P43|Leonid Hurwicz, Eric Maskin, Roger Myerson et la Théorie des Mécanismes|Most economic decisions involve agents who do not share the same information. Suppose a planner wishes to collect the agents’ information and act for them. Is there a synthetic description of the set of all procedures available to the planner? Which are the criteria to be fulfilled by an optimal procedure? Is it possible to design a procedure which necessarily achieves a given outcome? These are topics in mechanism theory. Three prominent representatives of this theory, Leonid Hurwicz, Eric Maskin and Roger Myerson, have received in 2007 the Sveriges Riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel.
P43|A Balance-Sheet Approach to Fiscal Sustainability|Recent empirical research on emerging markets debt, currency crises and fiscal sustainability has placed a significant focus on the role of currency mismatches with the emphasis placed on the currency composition of explicit government liabilities. The key insight of this paper is that these liabilities, while relevant, usually represent a small share of actual government liabilities: indeed, as an indicator of fiscal solvency, they are relatively uninformative – and possibly misleading – if not matched with the remaining liabilities (promises of wage and pension payments among others) and the asset side of the government’s balance sheet: financial and real government assets as well as the present value of future tax collection. These non-debt liabilities and assets may be affected by changes in the real exchange rate in a way that dwarfs the effect on the explicit liabilities which are typically the focus of attention. With this in mind, this paper proposes a balance-sheet approach that, as illustrated by the practical applications included here, may radically alter the results from traditional sustainability evaluations – and, more generally, the perception of a country’s fiscal vulnerability.

P43|Political institutions and economic growth reconsidered|The debate on the relationship between institutions and economic development is discussed, focusing on two illustrations, i.e., the impact of democracy and political instability on economic growth. Various pitfalls of existing research are identified, like sensitivity of the outcomes to model specification, sample heterogeneity, measurement of political variables, and the treatment of the time dimension.

P43|Rechtliche und tatsächliche Bekämpfungsansätze gegen Geldwäsche<BR>[Legal and factual approaches to solving money laundering]|The present work deals with the basic idea of investigation against unfairly acquired wealth. It represents the view of the police in financial investigation and money laundering. The view of dark financial investment is enormous. The potential for capital recovery is immense. The observation and control of capital flow in part and full organized crime requires qualified resources, but is regularly self-financing. In addition to the previous introduction, especially legal process routes, become the first managerial approaches were examined. By simple probability economic models, but also basic considerations of economics indicators, to the calculation of a successful division, the reader can learn by examples, the possibilities and potential of the business under the Financial Intelligence.
P43|Rescuing the concept of vertical fiscal imbalance|This article restores the concept of vertical fiscal imbalance (VFI) to its original meaning. The literature shows that there is neither a universally accepted definition of VFI nor a commonly accepted approach to measuring it. Estimates of VFI are derived, much like accounting or deficit measurements, by comparing the revenues and expenditures of two levels of government. VFI is, however, too nuanced an issue to be described by this kind of national accounting procedure. We argue that ease of measurement should always take second place to the appropriateness of the economic concepts used; it makes no sense to adopt a definition that is convenient for measurement if it does not have a sound theoretical basis. The conventional definition of VFI however, falls into this trap, and the ad hoc definition was adopted for its expedience. This measure does not reflect whether taxes and expenditures across the various levels of government are too high, too low or about right. Unfortunately, the sacrifice of rigour for tractability has seriously harmed the quality of public policy debate on the issue.
P43|Existence procesu učení na umělém akciovém trhu<BR>[Existence of the learning process at a proxy stock market]|Learning is a subject of intense research in economics. We present persuasive evidence that learning took place among uninformed heterogeneous agents during a large-scale naturally-occurring set of auctions. Empirical study employs a unique bidding data set of 5000 individual investors that placed their bids in the voucher scheme that in terms of size, incentives, and variation is one of the largest experiments ever conducted. To detect and quantify learning we develop new measures of individual performance during the bidding process on the artificial stock market where prices of goods vary over successive stages of bidding on the basis of supply and demand.
P43|Liberté, justice et efficacité : distribution, impôts et transferts optimaux|« Social freedom » and the respect of corresponding rights, as well as Pareto efficiency (a priori required by democracy), imply that taxes and subsidies (re)distributing income are based on given « natural resources », the main of which –by very far– consists of individuals’ productive capacities. There results that this distribution should take the form of an equal sharing of people’s product of the same labour (while each freely chooses her total level of labour). Equivalently, each gives to each other the product of the same labour. Or, again, each receives the same « basic income » financed by an equal sacrifice of all in terms of labour. There results the practical fiscal reforms that lead society towards an efficient economy and a just distribution.

P43|Romanian Banking System Evolution and Basel II Requirements|Before 1989, Romanian Banking System was structured in the specific way of a centralized economy. Restructuring of the banking system took its first step at the end of 1990 when the newly- established bank, Banca Comerciala Româna, took over retail operations performed previously by the NBR. Simultaneously, some privately-owned banking companies were established and foreign banks’ branches were integrated into the domestic banking activity, the number of banks almost trebling. The unfriendly economic environment, the poor quality of bank managers and shareholders and cumbersome legal procedures led to an increase in tensions, the poor quality of credit portfolio representing the major difficulty of the banking sector. In the past years, NBR tried to control more the banking activity by implementing international settlements. More over, since Romania is one of the European Union countries, it is absolutely necessary the harmonization of entire economic and financial system to EU regulations. The paper try to present the position of Romanian banking system in the framework of all these transformations.
P43|Credit-Scoring Methods (in English)|The paper reviews the best-developed and most frequently applied methods of credit scoring employed by commercial banks when evaluating loan applications. The authors concentrate on retail loans – applied research in this segment is limited, though there has been a sharp increase in the volume of loans to retail clients in recent years. Logit analysis is identified as the most frequent credit-scoring method used by banks. However, other nonparametric methods are widespread in terms of pattern recognition. The methods reviewed have potential for application in post-transition countries.
P43|On Concepts Of Governance: A Survey And Interpretation|From the late 1970s onwards there has been a growing interest in the notion of governance both as an object of theoretical inquiry and as a practical solution to co-ordination problems in a wide range of systems. From a theoretical point of view, the spread of governance studies in many disciplines is generally seen as a consequence of the growing complexity of the economic and social-political environment. According to an increasing amount of economic and political theory, due to globalisation, fragmentation and complexity marking modern societies political and economic life has undergone a transition from “government” to “governance”, from “bureaucracy” to “markets and networks”. The debate on the change from government to governance is very inclusive and comprises different strands of research. As a consequence of that, the basic notion of governance is not precisely defined, even if a relevant attempt in the systematisation of distinct meanings of governance has been carried out by political scientists. Developments in theoretical literature are matched by increasing interest in governance as a means of solving co-ordination problems within and across functional systems. Important examples of such use of the concept include corporate governance, clinical governance, the governance of school and universities, urban governance, and so on. “Good governance” is now a part of the lending criteria of international bodies such as the World Bank and detailed indicators of what constitutes good governance have been developed. In short, governance is a multi-faceted concept that has multiple meanings and can be used into many different issues. A survey and interpretation of different uses of the concept is the main purpose of this paper. In particular, we focus on governance arguments developed by the economic literature. We argue that essential features implicit in the definition of a governance structure are relevant in outlining a framework of analysis that can be applied to specific co-ordination problems.
P43|The Stability and Growth Pact: A European Answer to the Political Budget Cycle?|The existing literature on political budget cycles looks at the temptation for incumbent governments to run a greater deficit before an election by considering the characteristics of the incumbent. We propose here to look at the signals the incumbent receives from the voters. For this purpose, we consider the votes from the previous national elections and see whether they may influence the incumbent government to run a sound fiscal policy or an expansionary fiscal policy. However, since 1993 Europe has been equipped with two fiscal rules: a deficit and a debt ceiling. In this context, can we find evidence of a “political budget cycle” before 1993, and did the fiscal rules prevent the existence of a “political budget cycle” afterwards? To address these questions, we use a cross-sectional time series analysis of European countries from 1979 to 2005.
P43|The Nigerian Wars, Regional Crises and Ethnic Disturbances: Policy Responses and Democratic Implications|Nigeria was incorporated in 1914 when Frederick Lugard(First Governor-General) amalgamated the two British protectorates of Northern and Southern Nigeria and the Crown colony of Lagos into a single entity. The primary reason for almalgamation was economic rather than political. It is therefore, a matter for great regret that this country(Nigeria)has suffered as a result of the all pervasive disunity that has characterised all government action since our accession to independence in 1960. This disunity has distorted, complicated and to a large extent stultified every developmental effort undertaken by government. This paper therefore argues that the much celebrated Nigerian reform progress might be a rhetorics or much ado about nothing. And that the 'BB-, BB AND B'rating of the Nigerian economy might have been a baseless exercise. Consequently, the paper recommends the adoption of e-governance(development as a therapy for a heterogenous and divisible nation such as Nigeria(ceteris paribus).

P43|Evolutia arieratelor in Romania<BR>[The Arrears Evolution in Romania]|This paper discusses about the evolution of arrears in Romania through 1995- june 2003 and try to reveal the most important causes of fiscally arrears. The study revealed that even the financial obstruction has affected initially the state companies in majority, the phenomenon has enclasped the private companies which represent the majority now. I revealed a “good” evolution recorded by the arrears towards banks and others creditors, and the worriment increasing arrears share towards the state budget and purveyors. Thus I think the banks succeded to keep up with debtors while fiscally discipline get more and more injury, national economy came to be dominated with corruption, lack of restructuring, masked or unmasked subventions and etatistic conceptions. More, the financial obstruction is not going to decrease, but to establishment, reaching out a high level annualy. The picture is more cleare if I add that approximately 80% from total arrears towards purveyors belong to the utility companies (electric and thermic energy). I consider that without exception measures the arrears won’t decrease.
P43|The Interregional Incidence of Public Budgets in Federations: Measurement Issues, Evidence from Canada, and Policy Relevance|In this paper, we examine the issue of the incidence of central government budgets in federal countries. In Section 1, we discuss a number of reasons why the picture painted of reality by even the best fiscal flow analysis is inevitably partial and hence inherently flawed to an unknowable extent. Despite these cautions, in Section 2 we review the evidence on the regional incidence of federal budgets in Canada, considering both aggregate results and some specific federal expenditure programs (e.g. equalization and employment insurance), as well as some relevant issues (e.g. the regional effect of some regulatory programs) not depicted in fiscal flows. We find that the regional distributional patterns revealed in this analysis are both robust to various reasonable adjustments and relatively stable over time. Nonetheless, we conclude in Section 3 that, while such studies are potentially useful in terms of providing a base-line for assessing performance in some respects, they cannot be used to demonstrate that e.g. one region is paying (or receiving) 'too much' or 'too little', let alone that there is a 'fiscal imbalance' that needs to be corrected. Numbers are necessary, and good numbers are better than bad ones; but they have to be interpreted carefully and in context before drawing any policy conclusions.
P43|Hedging Strategies and Financial Risks|Hedging strategies represent basic instrument used toward eliminating financial risk. Increasing volatility of financial markets and their globalization also lead to higher financial risks. These aspects are especially important for transitional and small open economies. The basic goal of the paper is to show the derivation and application possibilities of select hedging strategies. Five basic hedging strategies ? delta hedging, minimum variance, minimum value at risk, maximum expected utility value, and minimum shortfall ? are derived and described. All the strategies are derived for two asset portfolios consisting of risk assets (share, bond, commodity price, and exchange rate) and hedged assets (financial derivative). Another common assumption is that random variables are normally distributed. Examples of exchange rate, interest-rate, equity and commodity-risk hedging are described. Several applications are suitable for small open economies that lack liquid capital market with limited secondary derivative market.
P43|Mission Implausible II: Measuring the Informal Sector in a Transition Economy Using Macro Methods|An easy and popular method for measuring the size of the underground economy is to use macro-data such as money demand or electricity demand to infer what the legitimate economy needs, and then to attribute the remaining consumption to the underground economy. Such inferences rely on the stability of parameters of the money demand and electricity demand equations, or at the very least on knowledge of how these parameters are changing. We argue that the pace of change of these parameters (such as velocity) is too variable in transition economies for the above methods of estimating the size of the underground economy to be applicable. We make our point by using the Czech Republic and other transition country data from the financial and electricity sectors.

P43|Matriz de intercambios de agua. Analisis mediante la Teoria de Grafos| Resumen Nos planteamos como objetivo poner de manifiesto las relaciones que se establecen entre los sectores productivos y el consumo de agua que éstos realizan para generar su producción. Aplicamos el estudio a Andalucía, Comunidad Autónoma del sur de España caracterizada por su escasez de agua, y nos preguntamos si la dependencia excesiva de los recursos hídricos que algunos sectores productivos de dicha Comunidad pueden llegar a tener, podría afectar de forma negativa, no sólo a la conservación y a la calidad del recurso, sino también a la sostenibilidad de la propia economía. Utilizamos una metodología mixta en la que combinamos el análisis Input-Output, con el que definimos un modelo de consumo de agua y a partir de él elaboramos una Matriz de Intercambios de Agua, con la Teoría de Grafos, mediante la cual analizamos las relaciones contenidas en dicha matriz. Concluimos que la especialización económica de Andalucía no sólo no contribuye a la conservación del recurso sino que además podría llegar a poner en peligro la propia sostenibilidad de la economía regional si los dirigentes políticos no asumen estas limitaciones hídricas en la definición de su política económica. PALABRAS CLAVE: Consumo de agua, Teoría de Grafos, Análisis Input-Output. Summary The aim of this work is to demonstrate the relationships established between an economy's productive sectors and the water consumption generated during their productive processes. We study de Andalusian reality, region of the South Spain characterized by its scarcity, and we will examine if the excessive dependence on water resources which may occur in some productive sectors might affect not only the conservation and quality of this resource, but also have negative effects upon the stability of the economy itself. A mixed methodology has been used, combining Input-Output analysis with Graphs Theory. We obtain a water Input-Output model and an interrelationship matrix which is analysed by Graphs Theory. The main conclusion is that Andalusian's economic specialisation does not make a positive contribution water conservation and, moreover, the regional economy's sustainability might be seriously endangered if the authorities do not take into account water limitations in their economy policy.
P43|Decomposing Wage Gaps between Ethnic Groups: The Case of Israel|Past investigations of the income gaps between Jews and non-Jews in Israel treat non-Jews as one group. In this paper we separate the non-Jewish group into three main religious minorities: Muslims, Christians, and Druze and focus on the northern part of Israel, where most minorities live. Using the latest Israeli census, we find significant explained and unexplained income gaps in favor of Jews. The unexplained gaps tend to be larger the more educated the individual. Jews have much higher representation in the more lucrative occupations, and earn significantly more in them. Muslims generally suffer from the largest income gaps, while Druze have the lowest income gaps, reflecting direct and indirect benefits reaped from serving in the army. Among minorities, Christians are the most educated and most concentrated in the top occupations, which explains why they have the lowest gaps in the highest percentiles of the income distribution.

P43|On The Regulation Of Fee Structures In Mutual Funds|AbstractWe offer an alternative framework for the analysis of mutual fund structure and use it to examine the rationale behind existing regulations that require mutual fund adviser fees to be of the “fulcrum” variety. We find little justification for the regulations. Indeed, we find that asymmetric “incentive fees” in which the adviser receives a flat fee plus a bonus for exceeding a benchmark index provide Pareto-dominant outcomes with a lower level of equilibrium volatility.Our model also offers some insight into fee structures actually in use in the asset-management industry. We find that when leveraging is not permitted and the fee structure must be of the fulcrum variety, the equilibrium fee in our model is a flat fee with no performance component; while if asymmetric incentive fees are allowed and leveraging is permitted the equilibrium fee is an incentive fee with a large performance component. These predictions match observed fee structures in the mutual fund industry and the hedge fund industry, respectively.
P43|The Mean-Variance Synthesis Of Corporate Balance Sheets|AbstractThis paper studies the corporate financial policy of minimizing the risk of a large loss. The implications of this policy are examined using a mean-variance risk model. The model creates mean-variance efficient balance sheets featuring the minimum equity risk for a target level of earnings. The model offers unambiguous decisions on the firm's capital structure, investing, financing, dividend policy, mergers and acquisitions. The implications of the model agree with empirical evidence. The paper suggests that capital structure and dividend decisions, that are irrelevant in a Modigliani–Miller market from the valuation viewpoint, are relevant for corporate risk management.
P43|Multi-Stage Optimization For Long-Term Investors|AbstractMulti-stage simulation and optimization models are effective for solving long-term financial planning problems. Prominent examples include: asset-liability management for pension plans, integrated risk management for insurance companies, and long-term planning for individuals. Several applications will be briefly mentioned.A multi-stage framework provides advantages over single-period myopic approaches. First, the investor gains an understanding of the risks that a long-term goal will be unfulfilled, such as retiring with adequate wealth. A multi-stage model can be more realistic than a single period model. Thus, assets such as equity, which reduce long-term risks while increasing short-term volatility, can be evaluated in a temporal setting. The tradeoff between long- and short-term gains becomes apparent in a multi-period context. As a second advantage, enhanced returns are possible with dynamic investment strategies. For instance, the traditional approach of rebalancing assets to a fixed strategic benchmark generates higher returns when assets possess increased volatility. This “volatility pumping” is dampened by transaction and market impact costs. Only by solving a multi-stage optimization model can we discover the optimal rebalancing rules. Likewise, moving a large portfolio to a new strategic benchmark can be optimized. As a third example, individuals often hold assets with large embedded gains. Selling these assets triggers a capital gains tax. Again, these decisions can be evaluated by means of a multi-stage model. A real-world example from pension planning illustrates the concepts.Three distinct approaches are available for solving the multi-stage optimization model: (1) dynamic stochastic control, (2) stochastic programming, and (3) optimizing a stochastic simulation model. We briefly review the pros and cons of these approaches; it seems unlikely that a single approach will dominate the others. We conclude with some topics for future research.
P43|A Discrete–Time Approach To Arbitrage-Free Pricing Of Credit Derivatives|AbstractThis paper develops a framework for modelling risky debt and valuing credit derivatives that is flexible and simple to implement, and that is, to the maximum extent possible, based on observables. Our approach is based on expanding the Heath–Jarrow–Morton term-structure model to allow for defaultable debt. Rather than follow the procedure of implying out the behavior of spreads from assumptions concerning the default process, we work directly with the evolution of spreads. The risk-neutral drifts in the resulting model possess a recursive representation that facilitates implementation and makes it possible to handle path-dependence and early exercise features without difficulty. The framework permits embedding a variety of specifications for default; we present an empirical example of a default structure which provides promising calibration results.
P43|An Alternative Approach For Valuing Continuous Cash Flows|AbstractWe consider the problem of replicating the payoffs from variable annuities with a continuous cash flow given by a function of some traded asset's price. The standard approaches involve either dynamic trading in this underlying asset or a static position in a continuum of options of all strikes and maturities. We present an alternative approach which combines dynamic trading in the underlying asset with a static position in options of a single maturity. In many instances, our approach yields explicit valuation formulas and hedging strategies when the volatility of the underlying is an arbitrary function of its price.
P43|Nonlinear Financial Models: Finite Markov Modulation And Its Limits|AbstractWe study a Markov modulation of the classical Black–Scholes model. We prove that, for European type of securities, a model which has any kind of pay-off distribution may be approximated arbitrarily well using Markov modulation. In the limit we obtain a model of Black–Scholes type where the parameters in the model depend on an underlying environment which is governed by a diffusion process. The price in the special two-state case which is of interest itself is derived explicitly.
P43|Pricing American Options With Transaction Costs By Complementarity Methods|AbstractThe inclusion of nonzero transaction costs in option pricing invalidates the Black–Scholes hedging strategy that relies on continuous rebalancing of the option portfolio. Based on Leland's approach of discrete hedging, this paper presents complementarity based numerical methods for the pricing of American options in the presence of transaction costs. The American option pricing models with transaction costs are formulated as partial differential complementarity problems, which are discretized by finite-difference schemes. The resulting discretized finite-dimensional linear and nonlinear complementarity problems are shown to have solutions, which are computable by iterative complementarity methods. Numerical results are reported.
P43|A Linearization Approach In Modeling Quasi-Affine Coupon Rate Term Structures And Related Derivatives|AbstractFor an affine model, we propose a “dynamic bootstrapping” method that would linearly relate coupon (or swap) rates to the term structure model's factors. Two techniques targeting different applications are considered, the standard linearization intended for equilibrium modeling or historical fine-tuning, and stochastic linearization (moment matching) for pricing interest rate derivatives. Analyzing theoretical accuracy of these techniques we conclude that it is sufficiently high and suitable for most applications they are intended for.Among other results, we prove that a two-factor Gaussian model with constant coefficients does a very decent work in modeling term structures of the U.S. Treasury rates and especially the swap rates. The daily factor increments for the period of 1995–2000 appear to be “moderately Gaussian” whereas the achieved accuracy of the term structure modeling as measured across maturities, ranges from 3 basis points (2-year to 30-year swaps) to 6 basis points (3-month to 10-year Treasuries). Although the fine-tuned model parameters do depend on chosen historical sub-interval, the two principal components reveal robustness in shape and size.Finally, we consider the role played by volatility term structure and inter-rate correlations in pricing financial derivatives contingent on coupon or swap rates.
P43|A Generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process Of Yield Rates Calibrated With Strips|AbstractIn this article, we present a Gaussian multivariate factor model of the term structure of interest rates. We show that under a martingale valuation law, the factors follow a generalized multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We also give an explicit expression for Green's function which leads to a complete characterization of value functions for European-type securities. The model's linear and Gaussian structure yields a simple model where estimation and calibration is relatively easy to do. Using yield data on stripped bonds, we calibrate our model and demonstrate that the Gaussian assumption is not unreasonable. The model accurately explains the dynamics of the whole yield curve for periods of at least one year.
P43|Mathematical Pseudo-Completion Of The Bgm Model|AbstractIn this paper, the BGM model is generalized such that it does not need the instantaneous forward rates in the framework of HJM, but includes the original BGM theory as a special case with smooth volatility. Our two convergence theorems show that the original BGM theory is topologically dense in our framework. This topological result makes the BGM model mathematically complete for numerical pricing with piecewise continuous volatility. In addition, we shall make some remarks on the BGM calibration for business use in connection with our theorems.
P43|A Finite Difference Method For The Valuation Of Variance Swaps|AbstractWe develop here a finite difference approach for valuing a discretely sampled variance swap within a Black-Scholes framework. This approach incorporates the observed volatility skew and is capable of handling various definitions of the variance. It is benchmarked against Monte-Carlo simulation in the presence of a volatility skew and is shown to provide extremely accurate values for a variance swap. Our method is based on decomposing the problem of valuing a variance swap into a set of one-dimensional PDE problems, each of which is then solved using a finite difference method.
P43|Pricing Discrete Barrier Options With An Adaptive Mesh Model|AbstractMany exotic derivatives do not have closed-form valuation equations, and must be priced by approximation methods. Where they can be applied, standard lattice techniques based on binomial and trinomial trees will achieve correct valuations asymptotically. They can also generally handle American exercise. But for many problems, including pricing barrier options, convergence may be slow and erratic, producing large errors even with thousands of time steps and millions of node calculations. Options with price barriers that are only monitored at discrete points in time present additional difficulty for lattice models. Standard tree methods increase accuracy by shrinking the time and price step size throughout the lattice, but this increases the number of calculations sharply and much of the additional computation is in regions of the tree where it makes little difference to accuracy. A previous paper [4] introduces the Adaptive Mesh Model (AMM) which is a very flexible approach that greatly increases efficiency in trinomial lattices. Coarse time and price steps are used in most of the tree, but small sections of finer mesh are constructed to improve resolution in specific critical areas. This paper presents an especially effective AMM structure for pricing options with discrete barriers. In a basic example, an AMM with 60 time steps is ten times more accurate than a 5000-step trinomial, but runs more than 1000 times faster.
P43|Bermudan Option Pricing With Monte-Carlo Methods|AbstractWe explain, compare and improve two algorithms to compute American or Bermudan options by Monte-Carlo. The first one is based on threshold optimisation in the exercise strategy (Andersen, 1999). The notion of “fuzzy threshold” is introduced to ease optimisation. The second one uses a linear regression to get an estimate of the option price at intermediary dates and determine the exercise strategy (Carriere, 1997; Longstaff–Schwartz, 1999). We thoroughly study the convergence of these two approaches, including a mixture of both.
P43|Linear, Yet Attractive, Contour|AbstractTo measure pre-settlement risk, a component of Credit Risk, we describe a method to quickly and accurately estimate Potential Future Exposure. Based on the properties of portfolios with single counterparties, this method determines exposures at desired confidence levels throughout a portfolio's life. Results are within 5% of a full Monte Carlo simulation estimate, but 100 times faster, while still based on full valuation, supporting an unlimited number of risk factors, and netting.
P43|Conquering The Greeks In Monte Carlo: Efficient Calculation Of The Market Sensitivities And Hedge-Ratios Of Financial Assets By Direct Numerical Simulation|AbstractThe calculation of price-sensitivities of contingent claims is formulated in the framework of Monte Carlo simulation. In this article, we compute the sensitivities of prices of contingent claims by varying the probabilities, or weights assigned to the different paths in the simulation. This contrasts with the standard approach which consists of perturbing the parameters of the model and computing the price corresponding to new scenarios. The procedure is related to work of Broadie and Glasserman (1996) and to recent proposals based on Malliavin Calculus (Fournié, E. ; J.-M. Lasry, J. Lebuchoux, P.-L. Lions and N. Touzi (1998)). The hedging technique that we propose here is based on calculating regression coefficients of cashflows onto the cashflows of benchmark securities and taking advantage, whenever possible, of closed-form solution for the sensitivities of benchmark instruments. We show numerically that the sensitivities computed in this way are in excellent agreement with analytic closed-form solutions whenever the latter are available, e.g. with the Greeks of the Black-Scholes model, and with approximate analytic solutions for Basket Options in multi-asset models. The advantage of the new sensitivities is that they are “universal” (non-parametric) and simple to compute: they do not require performing multiple MC simulations, discrete-differentiation, or re-calibration of the simulation.
P43|Development Of Mudarabah Instruments: Understanding Their Profitability, Securitization And Negotiability Aspects|This paper attempts to examine the securitization, negotiability and profitability aspects of three types of muèOErabah instruments; namely, asset-enfaced muèOErabah instruments, currency-enfaced muèOErabah instruments representing monetary contributions and currency-enfaced muèOErabah instruments representing real assets. This paper begins with a distinction between ribOE (usury) and profit and concludes that an exchange of currencyenfaced muèOErabah instruments in varying amounts entails ribOE while an exchange of asset-enfaced muèOErabah instruments will generate legitimate profits. The current practice is to issue currency-enfaced muèOErabah instruments but treat them as asset-enfaced muèOErabah instruments. This position is analyzed and policy implications are drawn for future development of muèOErabah instruments.

P43|Islamic Banking: An Evaluation|Islamic banking, a financial innovation, has come to be seen as the most 'visible' aspect of Islamization. Notwithstanding its novelty, it has made considerable progress, measured by the rapidity with which it has been adopted in the Muslim (even non-Muslim) countries in a relatively short period of time. However, the progress made by Islamic banking is seen by some Muslim economists as more apparent than real because it is not being run exclusively (or even mostly) on the basis of the Sharicah-favored profit and loss sharing (PLS) principle; rather, the fixed-rate type of financial instruments, which are seen as a 'deviation' from the Islamic ideal, have proliferated. It is argued in this paper that there is no warrant whatsoever for this misplaced 'financial puritanism', which has obfuscated the subject and its manifestations. The fact of the matter is that, deviation or not, the fixed-rate financial instruments, duly approved by the Sharicah, form an integral part of Islamic banking; and that it would be counterproductive to limit the possibilities of this institution just to the PLS principle. Hence, respecting the preferences of the consumers, Islamic banks should aim to evolve a risk-minimizing 'mixed' investment portfolio, containing both the variable and fixed-rate of return types, without any 'imperfection complex'. Even more important, rather than pursue an ambiguous financial ideal, which cannot be reached, the focus of the future reform should be to produce something strikingly original which can win the acknowledgement of the people. To this end, Islamic banking should be informed with an earnest knowledge of the ethical objectives of an Islamic economic system, the truth of which can be established only by the quality of social justice and the primacy it accords to the needs of the underclass in society. If Islamic banking is unmindful of its economic consequences and remains hooked on 'procedural purity', it will wither on the vine of public apathy, even its disapproval.

P43|The Design of Instruments For Government Finance in An Islamic Economy|This paper attempts to present a viable approach for the design of an instrument of government finance (and monetary management) in an Islamic economy where conventional transactions based on an ex-ante promise of a risk-free rate of return are forbidden. Resources to finance government infrastructural and development projects can be mobilized through the issuance of a national participation paper (NPP) and this instrument can also serve as an instrument of monetary management. Various conceptional issues underpinning the introduction of such an instrument and methods of calculating a corresponding rate of return are discussed In principle, this approach has been accepted in Iran.
P43|La révolution biotechnologique quand le débat éthique masque les enjeux économiques et industriels|La commercialisation des plantes transgéniques suscite de vives polémiques sur les implications scientifiques et éthiques des manipulations du génome des plantes. Les questions scientifiques, environnementales et sanitaires masquent toutefois les enjeux économiques sous-jacents. En effet, les biotechno1ogies suscitent un intérêt économique croissant non seulement de la part des firmes, mais aussi des États. Les biotechnologies végétales sont considérées comme un domaine d'avenir, source de croissance économique et d'emplois. Cependant les nouvelles activités sont de plus en plus dominées par les grands groupes de l'agrochimie. Si les petites firmes semblent jouer un rôle crucial dans cette révolution économique, les biotechnologies permettent une recomposition du paysage industriel au bénéfice des grands groupes – remodelant tout en renforçant cet oligopole mondial très concentré. The commercialization of transgenic plants rises several discussions on the scientific and ethical implications of plant-genome manipulations. However the scientific and sanitary questions mask the underlying economic stakes. Actually biotechnology engenders an economic interest not only from corporations, but also from States. Biotechnology, in general and more specifically in agriculture, is considered as a source of economic growth and jobs creation. If small firms seem to play a crucial role in this economic revolu-tion, biotechnology gives the agrochemical giants the opportunity to restructure the industrial landscape to their benefit–remodeling while strengthening this highly concentrated worldwide oligopoly.

Der gewählte Analyseansatz greift auf positive und normative Hinweise der Club Theorie zurück. Es wird zunächst gezeigt, wie sich die optimale Größe (Anzahl der Mitglieder) und die optimale Bereitstellung des Clubgutes (Inflationsrate) einer Währungsunion simultan bestimmen lassen. Gleichfalls wird die Anreizstruktur für bisherige Mitglieder, neue aufzunehmen und für Aufnahmekandidaten, der Währungsunion beizutreten, dargestellt. Vor diesem Hintergrund werden Kriterien (Kosten und Nutzen des Beitritts) für eine bestmögliche Strategie der Wechselkurspolitik der Beitrittskandidaten zur Vorbereitung auf den EURO entwickelt. Der am Ende erarbeitete Vorschlag läuft darauf hinaus, das Konzept von der Schlange im Tunnel neu zu beleben, wobei die Reformstaaten enge Bandbreiten ihrer Wechselkurse untereinander und vergleichsweise weite gegenüber dem EURO wählen sollten.
P43|Delegation and Delay in Bank Privatization|"The paper explains why bank privatization in transition economies is frequently delayed in comparison to privatizing non-financial firms. In the model, the government inherits a distressed bank with bad loans to a representative non-financial firm. The firm will only abstain from wasteful opportunistic behavior if there is a credible to signal that its future budget constraint will be hard. If the government takes over the state-owned bank directly or re-capitalizes and privatizes it immediately, then signaling leads to excessive liquidation. Delay in privatization allows delegating the signaling and can be beneficial because the signaling distortion can be shifted across ""types"". The analysis assumes a political constraint to sell the state-owned bank to a domestic investor (shallow pockets), but shows also that a Pareto improvement can typically be achieved if a buyer with a deep pocket can be found (foreign investor), Policy implications concerning timing and scope of bank privatization are discussed."

P43|Government Subsidies to Enterprises in Central and Eastern Europe: Budgetary Subsidies and Tax Arrears|This paper analyses the distribution and allocation of budgetary subsidies and tax arrears in Central and Eastern Europe. Budgetary subsidies are relatively small in aggregate, highly sector specific, and the manufacturing sector receives few of them. Tax arrears, by contrast, are a significant problem, and the paper argues they can be considered a form of government subsidy. Data for the various Visegrád countries suggest that the total stock of tax arrears is on the order of 5- 10% of GDP, the annual flow of tax arrears is around 2% of GDP, and the annual flow of tax arrears to the manufacturing sector is around 1% of GDP. Survey data from Hungary and Poland show that tax arrears are concentrated in a small number of low profitability firms; the main correlate of tax arrears is low profitability; and the flow of new tax arrears is the main financing that enables these very unprofitable firms to continue to operate.
P43|Key Elements of the Reform of the Hungarian Banking System: Privatization and Portfolio Cleaning|This paper focuses on some of the major problems of the Hungarian banking system and investigates the possible ways to deal with these problems. It discusses the issue of bank restructuring, concentrating on the large commercial banks for which direct or indirect state ownership is decisive. Special attention is paid to the problem of low quality loan portfolios and the possible ways of cleaning them up, as well as to the ways in which a better ownership structure can be achieved. The paper assumes that these two problems are very strongly linked and thus should be analysed together. Due to its specific intermediary role, a successful reform of the banking system could be an important first step, with a strong positive impact on the rest of the economy as well. The paper argues that the demands of enterprise restructuring can not be met without the active role of the existing commercial banks.
P43|Del presupuesto por programas al management estratégico del gasto público: nuevo papel del Ministerio de Hacienda|This paper initiaily concentrases on describing and analysing the macrobudgetary adjustments, as well as the reforms related to financial management, which have been implemented in this last decade in order to strengthen the powerful position of the Treasuries in Europe. The scope of these reforms is then questioned to the point that the author proposes the need for a new theoretical framework, if financial management is to be better adapted to the budgetary context where it is developped. Finally, new action lines are both proposed and anal.ysed, so that the Treasury play an active role as an strategic leader in budgetary matters, in such a way that the limitations imposed by programming budgeting, when dealing with uncertain and unstable situations, can be overcome.
