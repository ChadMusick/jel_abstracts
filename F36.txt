F36|Does International Financial Integration Increase the Standard of Living in Africa? A Frontier Approach|We investigate whether a higher financial integration with the rest of the world can help the African countries reduce their production inefficiency and/or push up their efficient frontier of production. We use two alternative empirical approaches based, respectively, on a stochastic frontier analysis and quantile regressions. We provide evidence of heterogeneous situations across countries and time. This paper proposes a new approach for defining, at the aggregate level, a link between financial openness and production efficiency. We show that one size does not fit all: international financial integration can increase or decrease African countries' standard of living.
F36|FDI, banking crises and growth: direct and spill over effects|"This study suggests a new decomposition of the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the long-term growth of developing countries. It reveals that FDI not only has a direct positive effect on growth, but also increases it by reducing the recessionary effect resulting from a banking crisis. However, these advantages are conditioned by the FDI threshold, which in turn depends on the ""absorption capacity"" of the host country. JEL: F65, F36, G01, G15"
F36|Stress Testing the Equity Home Bias: A Turnover Analysis of Eurozone Markets|Shifts in equity turnover happen on and around holidays because rationally bounded investors become distracted. Their pattern reveals a persistent equity home bias even in the Eurozone, a stress test case for the survival of this bias given the high level of economic and financial development and integration in this area. The bias is greater for small caps because investors are reluctant to hold this class of foreign asset. Our study corroborates calendar anomalies in trading volumes, but refutes the hypothesis regarding turnover sensitivity to stock returns common in the empirical and theoretical literature based on investor heterogeneity and short sale constraints. Our results reveal vanishing cost asymmetries in taking long rather than short positions.
F36|Are international banks different? evidence on bank performance and strategy|This paper provides evidence on how bank performance and strategies vary with the degree of bank internationalization, using data for 113 countries over 2000-15. The paper investigates whether international banks headquartered in developing countries behave and perform differently from those headquartered in high-income countries. The results show that, compared with domestic banks, international banks have lower valuations and achieve lower returns on equity in general. This suggests that, on average, bank internationalization has progressed beyond the point where it is in the interest of bank shareholders, potentially because of corporate governance failures and too-big-to-fail subsidies that accrue to large and complex banks. In contrast, developing country international banks seem to have benefited from internationalization compared with their high-income counterparts. Furthermore, for international banks headquartered in developing countries, bank internationalization reduces the cyclicality of their domestic credit growth with respect to domestic gross domestic product growth, smoothing local downturns. In contrast, if the international bank is from a high-income country investing in a developing country, its lending is relatively procyclical, which can be destabilizing.
F36|Bilateral swap agreement and Renminbi settlement in cross-border trade|This research empirically examines the impact of China’s Renminbi (RMB) bilateral swap agree-ments (BSAs) on the usage of the currency in cross-border trade transactions. By using a unique dataset from SWIFT including cross-border settlement messages of 91 countries/regions between October 2010 and November 2015, we confirm that the signing of a RMB BSA helps to increase the number, the value and the proportion of RMB settlement in cross-border trade. Our results are robust with respect to the choice of different models, including multi-level mixed model, two-stage regression model, and difference-in-difference model. In addition to justifying the effectiveness of China’s BSA-signing strategy to promote the RMB usage in trade settlement, our results clarify that the signing of those RMB BSAs is not purely for China’s political ends as some scholars claim.
F36|Domestic banks as lightning rods? Home bias and information during Eurozone crisis|European banks have been criticized for holding excessive domestic government debt during economic downturns, which may have intensified the diabolic loop between sovereign and bank credit risks. By using a novel bank-level dataset covering the entire timeline of the Eurozone crisis, I first re-confirm that the crisis led to the reallocation of sovereign debt from foreign to domestic banks. This reallocation was only visible for banks as opposed to other domestic private agents and it cannot be explained by the banks' risk-shifting tendency. In contrast to the recent literature focusing only on sovereign debt, I show that banks' private sector exposures were (at least) equally affected by a rise in home bias. Finally, consistent with these patterns, I propose a new debt reallocation channel based on informational frictions and show that informationally closer foreign banks increase their relative exposures when sovereign risk rises. The effect of informational closeness is economically meaningful and robust to the use of different information measures and controls for alternative channels of sovereign debt reallocation.
F36|Foreign competition and the durability of US firm investments|How does the exposure to product market competition affect the investment horizon of firms? We study if firms have an incentive to shift investments toward more short‐term assets when exposed to tougher competition. Based on a stylized firm investment model, we derive a within‐firm estimator using variation across investments with different durabilities. Exploiting the Chinese World Trade Organization (WTO) accession, we estimate the effects of product market competition on the composition of US firm investments. Firms that experienced tougher competition shifted their expenditures toward investments with a shorter durability. This effect is larger for firms with lower total factor productivity.
F36|America First? A US-centric view of global capital flows|Both academic researchers and policymakers posit a unique role for the US in the inter-national financial system. This paper investigates the characteristics and determinants of US cross-border financial flows and examines how these contrast with those of the rest of the world. We analyse the relative importance of US, country-specific, and global variables as determinants of aggregate and bilateral US financial flows and as determinants of country-level cross-border financial flows excluding those directly involving the US. Our results indicate that variation in US variables – notably the VIX and US dollar exchange rate – has a quantitatively important influence on global financial flows, but mostly via US cross-border flows. Global and national risk indicators perform better in explaining “rest of the world” flows. Moreover, we find that the correlation between US and rest of the world flows peaks in periods of elevated uncertainty. We interpret our findings as evidence for the existence of a global financial cycle, only some of which is driven by policies and events in the US. JEL Classification: F15, F21, F36, F42, G15
F36|Securisation special purpose entities, bank sponsors and derivatives|This paper documents the use of derivatives by securitisation special purpose entities (SPEs), also known as financial vehicle corporations (FVCs), domiciled in Ireland using transaction-level data established by the European Market Infrastructure Regulation. We show that these entities primarily engaged in interest rate derivatives over the period of 2015-2017. We find that larger entities that already engage in international capital markets are more likely to have derivative exposures. We also show that entities sponsored by banks and non-bank financial institutions are relatively more likely to engage in derivative markets. The characteristics of these bank sponsors are important in determining SPEs' engagement in derivative markets. SPEs' heavy reliance on debt finance coupled with their strong interconnectedness with bank sponsors underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and macroprudential surveillance of their derivative activities.

F36|Private bank deposits and macro/fiscal risk in the euro-area|We examine the relationship between private bank deposits and macro/fiscal risk in the euro area. We test three hypotheses: First, private bank deposits relative to Germany are determined by macro/fiscal risk factors. Second, this relationship is time-varying. Third, time-variation is driven by the level of macro/fiscal risk. Our findings validate all three tested hypotheses. They also reveal persistent fragmentation between EMU core and periphery banking systems caused by a deficit of trust in periphery banking systems, unmitigated by the introduction of OMT and European Banking Union. Our findings have implications for the introduction of the European Deposits Insurance Scheme (EDIS), for which they offer tentative support.

F36|Financial integration in the GCC region: market size versus national effects|This paper examines financial spillovers between the four largest equity markets (by market capitalization) in the GCC region using a VAR-GARCH (1,1) framework that sheds light on interdependence as well as the effects of the 2014 oil crisis. Since the UAE is a federation including two stock exchanges (Abu Dhabi and Dubai), it is possible to test whether being part of a federal union matters more than market size in terms of financial integration. Our results suggest that the latter is more important, since we could not find evidence of stronger linkages between the Abu Dhabi and Dubai markets compared to those between other markets in the region. By contrast, there are significant spillover effects, both in the mean and in the volatility, from the largest market of Saudi Arabia to Qatar and the two markets in the UAE, which confirms that market capitalization is a more important determinant of financial integration than belonging to a federal union. Further, spillovers from the larger markets have become stronger as a result of the 2014 oil crisis. Finally, there is also evidence of spillovers from the smaller to the larger markets.
F36|The Euro Crisis and Economic Growth: A Novel Counterfactual Approach|Macroeconomic adjustment in the euro area periphery was more recessionary than pre-crisis imbalances would have warranted. To make this claim, this paper uses a Propensity Score Matching Model to produce counterfactuals for the Eurozone crisis countries (Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Cyprus, Spain) based on over 200 past macroeconomic adjustment episodes between 1960-2010 worldwide. At its trough, between 2010 and 2015 per capita GDP had contracted on average 11 percentage points more in the Eurozone periphery than in the standard counterfactual scenario. These results are not dictated by any specific country experience, are robust to a battery of alternative counterfactual definitions, and stand confirmed when using a parametric dynamic panel regression model to account more thoroughly for the business cycle. Zooming in on the potential causes, the lack of an independent monetary policy, while having contributed to a deeper recession, does not fully explain the Eurozone’s specificity, which is instead to be traced back to a sharper-than-expected contraction in investment and fiscal austerity due to high funding costs.
F36|Creating a Euro Area Safe Asset without Mutualizing Risk (Much)|This paper explains and evaluates three proposals to create “safe assets” for the euro area based on sovereign bonds, in which sovereign risk is limited through diversification and some form of seniority. These assets would be held by banks and other financial institutions, replacing concentrated exposures to their own sovereigns. The paper focuses on three ideas: (1) to create multitranche “sovereign bond-backed securities” (SBBS), of which the senior tranche would constitute a safe asset; (2) to create a senior, publicly owned financial intermediary that would issue a bond backed by a diversified portfolio of sovereign loans (“E-bonds”); and (3) to issue sovereign bonds in several tranches and induce banks to hold a diversified pool of senior sovereign bonds (“multitranche national bond issuance”). Public attention (including public criticism) has so far focused on the first idea; the other two have not yet been seriously debated. We find that none of the competing proposals entirely dominates the others. SBBS do not deserve most of the criticism to which they have been subjected. At the same time, E-bond and multi-tranche national bond issuance have several interesting features—including inducing fiscal discipline—and warrant further exploration.
F36|The dollar and the Transition to Sustainable Development: From Key Currency to Multilateralism|Drastic changes in US politics relative to international agreements and to bilateral relationships with China raise a political question about the key currency status of the dollar and a theoretical question in international monetary economics: Can a key currency system be maintained if the issuing country deliberately engages in conflicting protectionist policy? This policy brief investigates how the positions of major currencies have been changing in the international monetary system for several years. The key currency relies on the acceptance of the issuing country as a benevolent hegemon that delivers an economic policy conducive to international financial stability. Until recently, it appeared that, despite the relative shrinking of the US weight in the world economy, the dollar had maintained its dominance both in international payments and in official reserves. However, uncertainty in US policy is disrupting risk perception in heavily dollar-indebted emerging and developing countries. Besides, denying the services of international transactions for non-US-resident firms with countries under US embargo is a serious encroachment on the key currency system. In the long run, the forces that can transform the international monetary system (IMS) stem from the transformation of the growth regime under environmental constraints. Since its genesis in the industrial revolution, the key currency has been the currency of the country dominating the primary energy resource, e.g. the commodity most traded worldwide. The pound sterling was linked with UK dominance in coal, the dollar with US dominance in oil. The irremediable shift to renewables, required to moderate climate change, will shift the growth regime to dispersed sources of renewable energy. The developing countries have inadequate financial resources to undertake the needy investments. Second, the positions of countries in terms of energy dependence will be reshuffled. A multilateral financial system, mixing public and private financial institutions, will require the cooperation of major countries to channel saving from all parts of the world to finance those investments. Here we argue that a multilateral monetary system would be more adapted to these challenges than the present one. It would fulfill the basic functions of international money in providing an ultimate reserve asset that will be the debt of no country, an SDR-based IMS. The last section of the paper explains the transition from dollar to SDR reserve.
F36|Setting the Stage for RMB Internationalisation - Liberalizing the Capital Account and Strengthening the Domestic Bond Market|Internationalizing the Renminbi pertains to the new era of China’s reform, starting at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party. It is not a technical reform, but a political one. The objective is threefold: to match China’s autonomy in economic policy, to further Asian integration, and to safeguard worldwide multilateralism against by the rise of protectionist forces. The challenge has been aggravated by the protectionist policies pursued by the US, degrading ipso facto the functions assumed by the dollar in the international payment system. China’s authorities have drawn lessons from the Asian crisis of 1997-98 and the systemic crisis of 2008-09. They are now searching for a second-best option in advocating a multilateral international payment system based on the SDR. The process of currency internationalization is linked to the modernization of domestic capital markets. Studying the progress in both dimensions makes the first two parts of the paper We ask the following questions. In the first part: which steps has China taken, and should take in the future, to complete the gradual process of currency internationalization currently under way? In the second part: how can China build the deep and resilient bond market required to attract international investors? A shorter third part examines why emerging market countries are incentivized to issue their government debt in their own currencies to attract foreign investors in the lingering context of ultra-low interest rates in the main convertible currencies. The status of a freely usable currency, already reached by the Renminbi in its prudent internationalization, together with a reform of the huge domestic bond market, should make China able to attract foreign saving. This is compatible with the Belt and Road Initiative, which is bound to mobilize massive capital exports in the form of long-term loans.
F36|Host-country financial development and multinational activity|This paper evaluates the influence of host-country financial conditions on the global operations of multinational firms. Using detailed U.S. data, we establish that financial development in a country is associated with relatively more entry by multinational affiliates, as well as with higher aggregate affiliate sales to the local market, back to the U.S. and to third destinations, with these effects being more pronounced in financially more vulnerable sectors. At the level of individual affiliates, by contrast, these forces are associated with relatively lower local sales and higher return and third-country sales. Yet at both aggregate and affiliate levels, the share of local sales in total sales is smaller, while the shares of U.S. and third-country sales are both bigger. These empirical regularities hold when using fixed effects to account for unobserved differences across country-years, sectors, and parent firms. We show theoretically that these patterns are consistent with host-country financial development affecting multinationals’ incentives for FDI through two channels: a financing effect that induces affiliate entry and expansion by improving their access to external finance, and a competition effect that reorients affiliate sales away from the local market due to increased entry by credit-constrained domestic firms.
F36|Small Firms and Domestic Bank Dependence in Europe’s Great Recession|The paper studies the role of small businesses (SME) in the transmission of the Eurozone crisis to member countries and whether regions or countries with many SMEs were less able to share risk. Our analysis draws attention to domestic bank dependence—defined as the share of domestic private credit originated by domestic banks—as a key variable modulated the impact of shocks on bankdependent SMEs and thus on the real economy. We argue that Eurozone banking integration in the years after the creation of the single currency was lopsided in the sense that, until 2008, cross-border lending between banks increased markedly while foreign banks’ lending to the real sector stayed relatively flat. Hence, SMEs remained very dependent on domestic banks for credit, in spite of high levels of banking sector integration between Eurozone countries. Our results suggest that domestic bank dependence made countries, regions, and sectors with many SMEs more vulnerable to global banking sector shocks and, at the same time, provided little risk sharing.
F36|After the Panic: Are Financial Crises Demand or Supply Shocks? Evidence from International Trade|Are financial crises a negative shock to demand or a negative shock to supply? This is a fundamental question for both macroeconomics researchers and those involved in real-time policymaking, and in both cases the question has become much more urgent in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis. Arguments for monetary and fiscal stimulus usually interpret such events as demand-side shortfalls. Conversely, arguments for tax cuts and structural reform often proceed from supply-side frictions. Resolving the question requires models capable of admitting both mechanisms, and empirical tests that can tell them apart. We develop a simple small open economy model, where a country is subject to deleveraging shocks that impose binding credit constraints on households and/or firms. These financial crisis events leave distinct statistical signatures in the empirical time series record, and they divide sharply between each type of shock. Household deleveraging shocks are mainly demand shocks, contract imports, leave exports largely unchanged, and depreciate the real exchange rate. Firm deleveraging shocks are mainly supply shocks, contract exports, leave imports largely unchanged, and appreciate the real exchange rate. To test these predictions, we compile the largest possible crossed dataset of 200+ years of trade flow data and event dates for almost 200 financial crises in a wide sample of countries. Empirical analysis reveals a clear picture: after a financial crisis event we find the dominant pattern to be that imports contract, exports hold steady or even rise, and the real exchange rate depreciates. History shows that, on average, financial crises are very clearly a negative shock to demand.
F36|Exportweltmeister: The Low Returns on Germany's Capital Exports|"Germany is world champion in exporting capital (\Exportweltmeister""). No other country invests larger amounts of savings outside its borders. However, Germany plays in the third division when it comes to investment performance, as we show in this paper. We study the returns on German foreign investments from 1950 to 2017 and find that: (1) Germany's annual returns on foreign assets were 2 to 5 percentage points lower than those of comparable countries. Germany ranks last among the G7 countries, also in the last decade; (2) Domestic returns on German assets have outperformed foreign returns abroad by about 3 percentage points per year; (3) Germany's external wealth provides very little consumption insurance as foreign returns are highly correlated with domestic activity; (4) The capital exports do little to diversify demographic risks as Germany mainly invests in countries with similar demographics. Taken together, these facts raise substantial doubts whether German households, firms, and banks allocate their savings in a beneficial way."
F36|Global Dimensions of U.S. Monetary Policy|This paper is a partial exploration of mechanisms through which global factors influence the tradeoffs that U.S. monetary policy faces. It considers three main channels. The first is the determination of domestic inflation in a context where international prices and global competition play a role, alongside domestic slack and inflation expectations. The second channel is the determination of asset returns (including the natural real safe rate of interest, r*) and financial conditions, given integration with global financial markets. The third channel, which is particular to the United States, is the potential spillback onto the U.S. economy from the disproportionate impact of U.S. monetary policy on the outside world. In themselves, global factors need not undermine a central bank's ability to control the price level over the long term -- after all, it is the monopoly issuer of the numeraire in which domestic prices are measured. Over shorter horizons, however, global factors do change the tradeoff between price-level control and other goals such as low unemployment and financial stability, thereby affecting the policy cost of attaining a given price path.
F36|Foreign currency loan conversions and currency mismatches|This paper examines the effect of currency conversion programs from Swiss franc-denominated loans to other currency loans on currency risk for banks in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Swiss franc mortgage loans proliferated in CEE countries prior to the financial crisis and contributed to the volume of non-performing loans as the Swiss franc strongly appreciated during the post-crisis period. Empirical findings suggest that Swiss franc loan conversion programs reduced currency mismatches in Swiss francs but increased currency mismatches in other foreign currencies in individual countries. This asymmetric effect of conversion programs arises from the loan restructuring from Swiss francs to a non-local currency and the high level of euro mismatches in the CEE banking system.
F36|Riders on the Storm|Interest rates in major advanced economies have drifted down and in greater unison over the past few decades. A country's rate of interest can be thought of as reflecting movements in the global neutral rate of interest, the domestic neutral rate, and the stance of monetary policy. Only the latter is controlled by the central bank. Estimates from a state space New Keynesian model show that central bank policy explains less than half of the variation in interest rates. The rest of the time, the central bank is catching up to trends dictated by productivity growth, demography, and other factors outside of its control.
F36|Global Collateral and Capital Flows|Cross-border financial flows arise when (otherwise identical) countries differ in their abilities to use assets as collateral to back financial contracts. Financially integrated countries have access to the same set of financial instruments, and yet there is no price convergence of assets with identical payoffs, due to a gap in collateral values. Home (financially advanced) runs a current account deficit. Financial flows amplify asset price volatility in both countries, and gross flows driven by collateral differences collapse following bad news about fundamentals. Our results can explain financial flows among rich, similarly-developed countries, and why these flows increase volatility.
F36|Euro area sovereign risk spillovers before and after the ECB's OMT announcement|We study the dynamics of sovereign risk spillovers from (and between) Spain and Italy, before and after the ECB's announcement of the OMT program. We identify domestic Italian and Spanish sovereign risk shocks through an intraday event study. The shocks are used as external instruments in bilateral, daily, local projection regressions. Prior to the announcement of the OMT, changes in the Spanish and, to a lesser extent, Italian spread spilled over to many other euro area member states, and also affected the euro-dollar exchange rate. Peak effects generally materialized after 2-3 days. Since the OMT announcement, spillovers to non-crisis, non-safe haven countries have disappeared. Some spillovers among crisis countries persist, but are smaller and shorter-lived than before. Overall, our results are consistent with the view that the OMT, through eliminating equilibrium multiplicity, has largely stopped contagion.
F36|Medium-term asymmetric fluctuations and EMU as an optimum currency area|Recent studies find that short-term fluctuations in EMU have been symmetric. This finding leads to benign views on the functioning of EMU as an optimum currency area (OCA), that are difficult to reconcile with the sovereign debt crisis. We try to solve this puzzle by looking at medium-term fluctuations instead, and reach five conclusions. First, medium-term fluctuations in EMU are much larger and less symmetric than short-term fluctuations. Second, medium-term fluctuations have become larger and less symmetric over time, while short-term fluctuations have become smaller and more symmetric. Third, medium-term fluctuations in EMU are less symmetric than in the US, while short-term fluctuations are more symmetric. Fourth, medium-term fluctuations in the euro area have become more strongly correlated with financial variables like credit and house prices, and less strongly correlated with real variables like productivity. Finally, medium-term fluctuations are more closely related to imbalances in price competitiveness, current accounts and budget deficits than short-term fluctuations. We conclude that our medium-term perspective has become relevant in the monetary union, due to the increasing importance of financial factors. It leads to less benign views on the functioning of EMU and on the endogenous OCA hypothesis.
F36|A provincial view of consumption risk sharing: Asset classes as shock absorbers|Using a unique data set on provincial net factor income flows disaggregated across the three asset classes of debt, equity and FDI reinvested earnings in Korea, we investigated how these asset channels impacted consumption risk sharing during the Global Financial Crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis. Adopting spatial panel methods, this study found that net receipts of debt, equity and FDI retained earnings have all contributed favorably to consumption risk sharing during these crises episodes, with FDI retained earnings robustly positive in its contribution in buffering shocks to consumption. We also found suggestive evidence that net equity receipts rather than net debt receipts contributed more to risk sharing during these episodes. Overall, our results indicate that different asset channels can provide the insurance needed to cushion the economy against adverse shocks.
F36|News Releases, Credit Rating Announcements, and Anti-Crisis Measures as Determinants of Sovereign Bond Spreads in the Peripheral Euro-Area Countries|This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of the determinants of the sovereign bond yields of the peripheral euro-area countries in recent years. We consider news releases, credit rating announcements, and anti-crisis measures undertaken by the ECB, for the EU/euro area as a whole as well as at the level of individual countries, as potential determinants. Our study is based on the daily sovereign bond spreads (with regard to German bunds) of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain in the years 2010-2016. We use the VARX-GARCH-BEKK model. Our results suggest that the spreads were most strongly influenced by the ECB’s measures and bailout programs, while the initiatives undertaken at the EU/euro area level played a less significant role. Rating changes proved to be significant, but some discrepancies with the results of previous studies occurred. Different sets of news variables were received for each country. Nonetheless, similarities were also identified.
F36|Determinants of the Public Debt and the Role of the Natural Resources: A Cross-Country Analysis|This paper investigates the major drivers of the public debt growth in 184 countries. The underlying cross-country survey is conducted on the basis of the improved compilation of datasets on the central government debt for 2013. The study finds that oil abundance, economic growth rate, the share of mineral rent in the total revenue, interest rate payments for foreign borrowings, and being a developing country have statistically significant impact on the growth of the public debt. In contrast, defense spending, unemployment rate, and inflation rate do not have a statistically significant positive impact on the public debt rate.
F36|Bond Flows and Liquidity: Do Foreigners Matter?|In their search for yield in the current low interest rate environment, many investors have turned to sovereign debt in emerging economies, which has raised concerns about risks to financial stability from these capital flows. To assess this risk, we study the effects of changes in the foreign-held share of Mexican sovereign bonds on their liquidity premiums. We find that recent increases in foreign holdings of these securities have played a significant role in driving up their liquidity premiums. Provided the higher compensation for bearing liquidity risk is commensurate with the chance of a major foreign-led sell-off in the Mexican government bond market, this development may not pose a material risk to its financial stability.
F36|Riders on the Storm|Interest rates in major advanced economies have drifted down and in greater unison over the past few decades. A country’s rate of interest can be thought of as reflecting movements in the global neutral rate of interest, the domestic neutral rate, and the stance of monetary policy. Only the latter is controlled by the central bank. Estimates from a state space New Keynesian model show that central bank policy explains less than half of the variation in interest rates. The rest of the time, the central bank is catching up to trends dictated by productivity growth, demography, and other factors outside of its control.
F36|Corporate Yields and Sovereign Yields|We document that positive association between corporate and sovereign cost of funds borrowed on global capital markets weakens during periods of unusually high sovereign yields, when corporate borrowers are able to issue debt that is priced at lower rates than sovereign debt. This state-dependent sensitivity of corporate yields to sovereign yields has not been previously documented in the literature. We demonstrate that this stylized fact is observed across countries and industries as well as for a given borrower over time and is not explained by a different composition of borrowers issuing debt during periods of high sovereign yields or by the relationship between corporate and sovereign credit ratings. We show that even if we exclude high-yield episodes that accompany financial crises and IMF programs, the sensitivity of corporate yields to sovereign yields is lower when sovereign yields are high. We propose a simple information model that rationalizes our empirical observations: when sovereign yields are high and more volatile, corporate yields are less sensitive to sovereign yields.
F36|Shock Transmission through Cross-Border Bank Lending: Credit and Real Effects|We study the transmission of financial shocks across borders through international bank connections. Using data on cross-border interbank loans among 6,000 banks during 1997-2012, we estimate the effect of asset-side exposures to banks in countries experiencing systemic banking crises on profitability, credit, and the performance of borrower firms. Crisis exposures reduce bank returns and tighten credit conditions for borrowers, constraining investment and growth. The effects are larger for foreign borrowers, including in countries not experiencing banking crises. Our results document the extent of cross-border crisis transmission, but also highlight the resilience of financial networks to idiosyncratic shocks.

F36|Subordinate financialization in emerging capitalist economies|In the explosion of literature on financialization, there is a much smaller but growing interest in what the phenomenon means for emerging capitalist economies (ECEs). We hold that for agents located in ECEs, the encounter with financialization is from a subordinate position: first, in relation to global production, ECE firms occupy subordinate locations in global production networks, providing cheap labor and raw, or at best, intermediate inputs; Second, in relation to global finance, ECEs are structurally subordinated to ACEs, that is, both trade and the most liquid capital markets are denominated in the currency of ACEs. Subordination in production means firms based in ECEs are able to capture less of the value created than firms higher in the hierarchy and must pay more to hedge macroeconomic risk. In circulation, strategies may emerge in ACEs wherein increased household indebtedness and/or asset market inflation maintain aggregate demand. In finance, ECEs’ subordinate position in relation to money and capital markets means that capital inflows are predominantly short-term, seeking financial yields rather than assuming productive risk. The results are continued volatility, external vulnerability and subordination to the currencies of the ACEs, which themselves serve to further deepen domestic financialization. We conclude that, while by no means pre-destined, financialization as experienced in ECEs may serve to further cement their subordinate position in the global structure.
F36|Financial constraints, institutions, and foreign ownership|We develop a model of cross-border acquisitions in which the foreign acquirer's ownership choice reflects a trade-off between easing the target's credit constraints and the costs of operating in an environment with weak institutions. Data on domestic and foreign acquisitions in emerging markets over the period 1990–2007 support the model predictions. The share of full foreign acquisitions is higher in sectors more reliant on external finance, in countries with lower financial development, and in countries with higher institutional quality. Sectoral external finance dependence accentuates the effect of country-level financial development and institutional quality. By contrast, the level of foreign ownership in partial acquisitions is insensitive to institutional factors and depends weakly on financial factors.
F36|Finance and synchronization|In the workhorse model of international real business cycles, financial integration exacerbates the cycle asymmetry created by country-specific supply shocks. The prediction is identical in response to purely common shocks in the same model augmented with simple country heterogeneity (e.g., where depreciation rates or factor shares are different across countries). This happens because common shocks have heterogeneous consequences on the marginal products of capital across countries, which triggers international investment. In the data, filtering out common shocks requires therefore allowing for country-specific loadings. We show that finance and synchronization correlate negatively in response to such common shocks, consistent with previous findings. But finance and synchronization correlate non-negatively, almost always positively, in response to purely country-specific shocks.
F36|Commodities risk premia and regional integration in gas-exporting countries|This study examines the fundamental driving forces of stock market integration with particular emphasis on major Gas-Exporting Countries (hereafter known as GECs), namely the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Kuwait, over the period from June 2003 to November 2017. The novelty of our study stems from the fact that we examine a dynamic process of international, regional and national stock markets integration using a set of local, regional, global and commodities as driving forces of integration. Particularly, we measure market integration using gas price as a common source of risk in addition to the world, regional and domestic sources of risk based on a conditional version of the International Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM). Our study also differs from past ones in that we investigate the integration of stock markets into the international market as well as in the GECs countries. Our results show that the level of market integration of the major gas-exporting countries varies widely over time and depends on the interest rate spread, the level of market openness and market volatility. It also seems to be still significantly segmented from both the global and GECs markets. Gas risk represents a small part of the global risk in all the countries considered in this study.
F36|Non-linear relationship between real commodity price volatility and real effective exchange rate: The case of commodity-exporting countries|The aim of this paper is to contribute to the existing literature by exploring the relationship between the real commodity price volatilities and the real effective exchange rate (REER) of commodity-exporting countries, taking into account the transition variable of financial market integration. To this end, we consider a sample of 42 commodity-exporting countries subdivided into 4 panels: food and beverages, energy, metals, and raw materials. Our results highlight that the relationship between real commodity price volatility and REER is non-linear and depends on the degree of financialization of the commodity market. Specifically, when a country is poorly integrated financially, the volatility of the real commodity price has a strong and negative impact on the variation in REER. However, for periods when a country is better integrated financially, we observe a decrease in the impact of real commodity price volatility on REER, especially for the two panels of food and beverages as well as energy. Our findings also highlight the growth of financialization of commodities post-2000, particularly in the case of the energy sector.
F36|Does Financial Globalization Still Spur Growth In Emerging And Developing Countries? Considering Exchange Rate Volatility'S Effects|We examine the effects of financial globalization and exchange rate volatility on growth in emerging and developing countries. We generate several measures of exchange rate volatility, as well as their interaction terms with indicators of disaggregated financial globalization. Using the two-step GMM system method on dynamic panel data, we find that exchange rate volatility has a negative impact on long-term growth. On the contrary, financial globalization, and particularly investment-globalization, promotes growth not only directly, but also indirectly, by reducing the negative impact of exchange rate volatility. However, the results show that indebtedness-globalization does not produce these benefits. In this way, the results inform the government's decision on the liberalization of the domestic financial market. JEL: E44, F21, F36, O42, G15, G18
F36|FDI, banking crisis and growth: direct and spill over effects|This study suggests a new decomposition of the effect of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on long-term growth in developing countries. It reveals that FDI not only have a positive direct effect on growth, but also increase the latter by reducing the recessionary effect resulting from a banking crisis. Even more, they reduce its occurrence. JEL: F65, F36, G01, G15
F36|Domestic intellectual property rights protection and exports: Accessing the credit channel|Recent studies on the export effects of domestic intellectual property rights protection focus on the innovation, border and technology transfer channels to underscore the pathways by which effective domestic IPRs protection influences own country's export. I extend this literature by arguing that another pathway domestic IPRs protection affects own country's export is via the credit channel i.e. firms access to external finance. Among many others, this occurs because effective domestic IPRs protection creates a scenario wherein exporters can use their intellectual properties in the same way they use tangible assets as collateral in order to overcome the huge variable and upfront fixed costs they face. To underscore this pathway, I evaluate the export effect of domestic IPRs protection within the comparative model framework and find empirical evidence for my hypothesis, with the results indicating that countries with more effective IPRs protection export more from sectors that depend more on external finance and that have more intangible assets.
F36|Search for Yield in Large International Corporate Bonds: Investor Behavior and Firm Responses|Emerging market corporations have significantly increased their borrowing in international markets since 2008. We show that this increase was driven by large-denomination bond issuances, most of them with face value of exactly US$500 million. Large issuances are eligible for inclusion in important international market indexes. These bonds appeal to institutional investors because they are more liquid and facilitate targeting market benchmarks. We find that the rewards of issuing index-eligible bonds rose drastically after 2008. Emerging market firms were able to cut their cost of funds by roughly 100 basis points by issuing bonds with a face value equal to or greater than US$500 million relative to smaller bonds. Firms contemplating whether to take advantage of this cost saving face a tradeoff: they can benefit from the lower yields associated with large, index-eligible bonds, but they pay the potential cost of having to hoard low-yielding cash assets if their investment opportunities are less than US$500 million. Because of the post-2008 “size yield discount,” many companies issued index-eligible bonds, while substantially increasing their cash holdings. The willingness to issue large bonds and hoard cash was greater for firms in countries with high carry trade opportunities that reduced the cost of holding cash. We present evidence suggesting that these post-2008 behaviors reflected a search for yield by institutional investors into higher-risk securities. These patterns are not apparent in the issuance of investment grade bonds by firms in developed economies.
F36|Global Collateral and Capital Flows|Cross-border financial flows arise when (otherwise identical) countries differ in their abilities to use assets as collateral to back financial contracts. Financially integrated countries have access to the same set of financial instruments, and yet there is no price convergence of assets with identical payoffs, due to a gap in collateral values. Home (financially advanced) runs a current account deficit. Financial flows amplify asset price volatility in both countries, and gross flows driven by collateral differences collapse following bad news about fundamentals. Our results can explain financial flows among rich, similarly-developed countries, and why these flows increase volatility.
F36|Exportweltmeister: The low returns on Germany's capital exports|"Germany is world champion in exporting capital (""Exportweltmeister""). No other country invests larger amounts of savings outside its borders. However, Germany plays in the third division when it comes to investment performance, as we show in this paper. We study the returns on German foreign investments from 1950 to 2017 and find that: (1) Germany's annual returns on foreign assets were 2 to 5 percentage points lower than those of comparable countries. Germany ranks last among the G7 countries, also in the last decade; (2) Domestic returns on German assets have outperformed foreign returns abroad by about 3 percentage points per year; (3) Germany's external wealth provides very little consumption insurance as foreign returns are highly correlated with domestic activity; (4) The capital exports do little to diversify demographic risks as Germany mainly invests in countries with similar demographics. Taken together, these facts raise substantial doubts whether German households, firms, and banks allocate their savings in a beneficial way."
F36|Creating a Euro Area Safe Asset without Mutualizing Risk (Much)|"This paper explains and evaluates three proposals to create ""safe assets"" for the euro area based on sovereign bonds, in which sovereign risk is limited through diversification and some form of seniority. These assets would be held by banks and other financial institutions, replacing concentrated exposures to their own sovereigns. The paper focuses on three ideas: (1) to create multitranche ""sovereign bond-backed securities"" (SBBS), of which the senior tranche would constitute a safe asset; (2) to create a senior, publicly owned financial intermediary that would issue a bond backed by a diversified portfolio of sovereign loans (""E-bonds""); and (3) to issue sovereign bonds in several tranches and induce banks to hold a diversified pool of senior sovereign bonds (""multitranche national bond issuance""). Public attention (including public criticism) has so far focused on the first idea; the other two have not yet been seriously debated. We find that none of the competing proposals entirely dominates the others. SBBS do not deserve most of the criticism to which they have been subjected. At the same time, E-bonds and multitranche national bond issuance have several interesting features--including inducing fiscal discipline--and warrant further exploration."
F36|The euro at twenty: Follies of youth?|This paper overviews the early history of the euro and argues that the euro was suboptimally designed, without monetary sovereignty of Eurozone (EZ) Member States, in order to comply with political goals set by wealthier Member States. Given this constraint, the euro architects designed a single currency in which its irreversibility is achieved through the EZ banking system, with recourse to the TARGET2 payment system. This allowed the banking systems of deficit Member States to fund large cumulative current account deficits in the first decade of the euro. The euro crisis led EZ policy makers to define new far more demanding fiscal rules and a new Banking Union to constrain the ability of EZ banking systems to fund sovereigns and current account deficits. Thus, the euro at twenty has become more fragile.
F36|Efficiency of the European banks in the aftermath of the financial crisis: A panel stochastic frontier approach|Using panel estimates and Stochastic Frontier Analysis this paper aims to contribute to the analysis of bank efficiency of the European banks in the aftermath of the international financial crisis and the sovereign crisis that seriously affected many EU countries. It also considershypothetical scenarios of exit from the EU of some of the particularly relevant member-states, including the Brexit scenario. The results obtained very clearly demonstrate the existence of statistically significant technical inefficiencies in all considered scenarios. Nevertheless, the results reveal that the exclusion of the Italian banks and of the UK banks from our estimates would be more beneficial to the decrease of the banks’ cost inefficiencies than the exclusion of the French and the German banks. Moreover, the worst scenario in terms of the decrease of the EU banks’ cost inefficiencies would be the exclusion of the banks from the five EU countries that were deeply affected by the international financial and sovereign crises and were obliged to restructure their bank systems, that is, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.
F36|The Role of Central Banks and the Political Environment in Financial Stability: A Literature Review|Financial instability and the subsequent credit crunches experienced by a number of countries following two decades of global structural reforms highlighted the importance of stabilizing credit supply and assigning a higher importance to financial stability. In this paper, I look at the independence of the Central Bank, the political environment and the impact of these factors on financial stability. I substantiate the literature review discussion with a brief empirical analysis of the effect of Central Bank independence on credit growth using an existing database created by Romelli (2018). The empirical results show that fluctuations in credit growth are larger for higher levels of Central Bank Independence and hence, in periods of financial instability or ultimately financial crises, Central Bank Independence would be reined back in an effort to reestablish financil stability.
F36|Fiscal Stabilization in the United States: Lessons for Monetary Unions|The debate about the use of fiscal instruments for macroeconomic stabilization has regained prominence in the aftermath of the Great Recession, and the experience of a monetary union equipped with fiscal shock absorbers, such as the United States, has often been a reference. This paper enhances our knowledge about the degree of macroeconomic stabilization achieved in the United States through the federal budget, providing a detailed breakdown of the different channels. In particular, we investigate the relative importance and stabilization impact of the federal system of unemployment benefits and of its extension as a response to the Great Recession. The analysis shows that in the United States, corporate income taxes collected at the federal level are the single most efficient instrument for providing stabilization, given that even with a smaller size than other instruments they can provide important effects, mainly against common shocks. On the other hand, Social Security benefits and personal income taxes have a greater role in stabilizing asymmetric shocks. A federal system of unemployment insurance, then, can play an important stabilization role, in particular when enhanced by a discretionary program of extended benefits in the event of a large shock, like the Great Recession.
F36|Evolving International Monetary and Financial Architecture and the Development Challenge: A Liquidity Preference Theoretical Perspective|This paper investigates the peculiar macroeconomic policy challenges faced by emerging economies in today's monetary (non)order and globalized finance. It reviews the evolution of the international monetary and financial architecture against the background of Keynes's original Bretton Woods vision, highlighting the US dollar's hegemonic status. Keynes's liquidity preference theory informs the analysis of the loss of policy space and widespread instabilities in emerging economies that are the consequence of financial hyperglobalization. While any benefits promised by mainstream promoters remain elusive, heightened vulnerabilities have emerged in the aftermath of the global crisis.
F36|The Economic Correlation between China and Southeast Asian Countries: derivative market and real sector analysis|This paper attempts to analyse the economic integration of China and Southeast Asian countries. This paper adopts several methods: One, stationarity for correlation, Error Correction Model (ECM) for short-run relation and Cointegration for long-run relationships. Two, Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) analysis to identify the cause and impact. As stock market index follows real sector performance this paper utilizes: One, elasticity analysis of economic growth between China and these countries as a proxy for real sector economic relations between them and two, descriptive statistical analysis on real effective exchange rate as well as Current Account Balance as a proxy of external economic performance between them. In correlation analysis, this paper found that one, stationarity of each country is the difference at level; two, short-run economic relations (ECM) between China and these Southeast Asian countries and three, they have long-run economic relations. In causality, this paper found that China affects all of these Southeast Asian countries and no causality between Singapore and the Philippines. In term of real sector analysis, this paper found that one, economic growth in China significantly affects all of these countries’ economic growth. Two, the external economic performance of these countries are the difference with special finding on Indonesia’s current account.
F36|Macroprudential policy at the ECB: Institutional framework, strategy, analytical tools and policies|This occasional paper describes how the financial stability and macroprudential policy functions are organised at the ECB. Financial stability has been a key policy function of the ECB since its inception. Macroprudential policy tasks were later conferred on the ECB by the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) Regulation. The paper describes the ECB’s macroprudential governance framework in the new institutional set-up. After reviewing the concept and origins of systemic risk, it reflects on the emergence of macroprudential policy in the aftermath of the financial crisis, its objectives and instruments, as well as specific aspects of this policy area in a monetary union such as the euro area. The ECB’s responsibilities required new tools to be developed to measure systemic risk at financial institution, country and system-wide level. The paper discusses selected analytical tools supporting financial stability surveillance and assessment work, as well as macroprudential policy analysis at the ECB. The tools are grouped into three broad areas: (i) methods to gauge the state of financial instability or prospects of near-term systemic stress, (ii) measures to capture the build-up of systemic risk focused on country-level financial cycle measurement and early warning methods, and (iii) the ECB stress testing framework for macroprudential purposes.

F36|Financial stability assessment for EU candidate countries and potential candidates|This paper reviews and assesses financial stability challenges in countries preparing for EU membership, i.e. Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey. The paper mainly focuses on the period since 2016 (unless the analysis requires a longer time span) and on the banking sectors that dominate financial systems in this group of countries. For the Western Balkans, the paper analyses recent trends in financial intermediation, as well as the two main challenges that have been identified in the past. Asset quality continues to improve, but the share of non-performing loans is still high in some countries, while regulatory, legal and tax impediments are still to be resolved in most cases. High unofficial euroisation is a source of indirect credit risk for countries with their own national legal tender, which calls for continued efforts to promote the use of domestic currencies in the financial system. At the same time, banking systems seem less prone to financial stress from maturity mismatches than certain EU peers. These risks are met with a solid shock-absorbing capacity in the Western Balkans, as exemplified by robust capital and liquidity buffers. Turkey experienced a period of heightened financial stress during 2018 and, while its banking system appears to have sufficient buffers to absorb shocks overall, significant forex borrowing of corporates and high rollover needs of banks in foreign exchange on the wholesale market constitute considerable financial stability risks.

F36|America First? A US-centric view of global capital flows|Both academic researchers and policymakers posit a unique role for the US in the international financial system. This paper investigates the characteristics and determinants of US cross-border financial flows and examines how these contrast with those of the rest of the world. We analyse the relative importance of US, country-specific, and global variables as determinants of aggregate and bilateral US financial flows and as determinants of country-level cross-border financial flows excluding those directly involving the US. Our results indicate that variation in US variables – notably the VIX and US dollar exchange rate – has a quantitatively important influence on global financial flows, but mostly via US cross-border flows. Global and national risk indicators perform better in explaining “rest of the world” flows. Moreover, we find that the correlation between US and rest of the world flows peaks in periods of elevated uncertainty. We interpret our findings as evidence for the existence of a global financial cycle, only some of which is driven by policies and events in the US.
F36|Debt Overhang, Rollover Risk, and Corporate Investment: Evidence from the European Crisis|We quantify the role of financial factors behind the sluggish post-crisis performance of European firms. We use a firm-bank-sovereign matched database to identify separate roles for firm and bank balance sheet weaknesses arising from changes in sovereign risk and aggregate demand conditions. We find that firms with higher debt levels and a higher share of short-term debt reduce their investment more after the crisis. This negative effect is stronger for firms linked to weak banks with exposures to sovereign risk, signifying increased rollover risk. These financial channels explain about 60% of the decline in aggregate corporate investment.
F36|Fiscal multipliers and foreign holdings of public debt|This paper explores a natural connection between fiscal multipliers and foreign holdings of public debt. Although fiscal expansions can raise domestic economic activity through various channels, they can also have crowding-out effects if the resources used to acquire public debt reduce domestic consumption and investment. Thus, these crowding-out effects are likely to be weaker when public debt is purchased by foreigners. We test this hypothesis on (i) post-war US data and (ii) data for a panel of 17 advanced economies from the 1980’s to the present. To do so, we assemble a novel database of public debt holdings by domestic and foreign creditors for a large set of advanced economies. We combine this data with standard measures of fiscal policy shocks and show that, indeed, the size of fiscal multipliers is increasing in the share of public debt held by foreigners. In particular, the fiscal multiplier is smaller than one when the foreign share is low, such as in the U.S. in the 1950’s and 1960’s and Japan today, and larger than one when the foreign share is high, such as in the U.S. and Ireland today
F36|Macroprudential policy in a monetary union with cross-border banking|We analyse the interaction between monetary and macroprudential policies in the euro area by means of a two-country DSGE model with ﬁnancial frictions and cross-border spillover eﬀects. We calibrate the model for the four largest euro area countries (i.e. Germany, France, Italy, and Spain), with particular attention to the calibration of cross-country ﬁnancial and trade linkages and country speciﬁc banking sector characteristics. We ﬁnd that countercyclical macroprudential interventions are supportive of mon-etary policy conduct through the cycle. This complementarity is signiﬁcantly reinforced when there are asymmetric ﬁnancial cycles across the monetary union, which provides a case for targeted country-speciﬁc macroprudential policies to help alleviate the burden on monetary policy. At the same time, our ﬁndings point to the importance of taking into account cross-border spillover eﬀects of macroprudential measures within the Monetary Union.

F36|The global capital flows cycle: structural drivers and transmission channels|In this paper, we study the effects of structural shocks that influence global risk – the main factor behind a “global capital flows cycle” – and how risk, in turn, is transmitted to capital flows. Our results show that not all the risk shocks driving the global financial cycle have the same effects on capital flows. Changes in global risk caused by pure financial shocks have the largest impact on the global configuration of capital flows, followed by US monetary policy shocks. As regards the transmission of risk to capital flows, we uncover a traditional “trilemma”, as countries more financially open and adopting a strict peg are more sensitive to global risk. This “trilemma” is mainly driven by one category of cross-border flows, “other investment”, confirming the importance of cross-border banking loans in the narrative of the global financial cycle.

F36|Cross-border effects of prudential regulation: evidence from the euro area|We analyse the cross-border propagation of prudential regulation in the euro area. Using the Prudential Instruments Database (Cerutti et al., 2017b) and a unique confidential database on balance sheets items of euro-area financial institutions we estimate panel models for 248 banks from 16 euro-area countries. We find that domestic banks reduce lending after the tightening of capital requirements in other countries, while they increase lending when loan-to-value (LTV) limits or reserve requirements are tightened abroad. We also find that foreign affiliates increase lending following the tightening of sector-specific capital buffers in the countries where their parent banks reside and that bank size and liquidity play a role in determining the magnitude of cross-border spillovers.

F36|International debt and Special Purpose Entities: evidence from Ireland|This paper examines international debt issuance through Irish-resident Special Purpose Entities (SPEs). Using a unique new dataset covering the population of Irish-resident SPEs reporting to the Central Bank of Ireland over the period 2005-2017, we identify cross-country debt financing links channelled through SPEs. The empirical analysis suggests that tax optimisation is an important motive, particularly for sponsors of Irish-resident securitisation vehicles, while investor protection and financial development are important additional considerations for sponsors of non-securitisation vehicles.

F36|Financial integration in Europe through the lens of composite indicators|This paper develops composite indicators of financial integration within the euro area for both price-based and quantity-based indicators covering money, bond, equity and banking markets. Prior to aggregation, individual integration indicators are harmonised by applying the probability integral transform. We find that financial integration in Europe increased steadily between 1995 and 2007. The subprime mortgage crisis marked a turning point, bringing about a marked drop in both composite indicators. This fragmentation trend reversed when the European banking union and the ECB's Outright Monetary Transactions Programme were announced in 2012, with financial integration recovering more strongly when measured by price-based indicators. In a growth regression framework, we find that higher financial integration tends to be associated with an increase in per capita real GDP growth in euro area countries. This correlation is found to be stronger the higher a country's growth opportunities. JEL Classification: F36, F43, F45, G01, G15
F36|After the Panic: Are Financial Crises Demand or Supply Shocks? Evidence from International Trade|Are financial crises a negative shock to demand or a negative shock to supply? This is a fundamental question for both macroeconomics researchers and those involved in real-time policymaking, and in both cases the question has become much more urgent in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis. Arguments for monetary and fiscal stimulus usually interpret such events as demand-side shortfalls. Conversely, arguments for tax cuts and structural reform often proceed from supply-side frictions. Resolving the question requires models capable of admitting both mechanisms, and empirical tests that can tell them apart. We develop a simple small open economy model, where a country is subject to deleveraging shocks that impose binding credit constraints on households and/or firms. These financial crisis events leave distinct statistical signatures in the empirical time series record, and they divide sharply between each type of shock. Household deleveraging shocks are mainly demand shocks, contract imports, leave exports largely unchanged, and depreciate the real exchange rate. Firm deleveraging shocks are mainly supply shocks, contract exports, leave imports largely unchanged, and appreciate the real exchange rate. To test these predictions, we compile the largest possible crossed dataset of 200+ years of trade flow data and event dates for almost 200 financial crises in a wide sample of countries. Empirical analysis reveals a clear picture: after a financial crisis event we find the dominant pattern to be that imports contract, exports hold steady or even rise, and the real exchange rate depreciates. History shows that, on average, financial crises are very clearly a negative shock to demand.
F36|Search for Yield in Large International Corporate Bonds : Investor Behavior and Firm Responses|"Emerging market corporations have significantly increased their borrowing in international markets since 2008. This paper shows that this increase was driven by large-denomination bond issuances, most of them with face value of US$500 million. Large issuances are eligible for inclusion in international market indexes, which attract institutional investors. Emerging market firms were able to cut their cost of funds by roughly 100 basis points by issuing large-denomination bonds. Firms face a tradeoff: issue large, index-eligible bonds to borrow at a lower cost (about 100 basis points) but pay the expense of hoarding cash. Because of the""size yield discount,""many companies issued index-eligible bonds, increasing their cash holdings. The willingness to issue large bonds and hoard cash was greater for firms in countries with high carry trade opportunities. These post-2008 behaviors reflected a search for yield by institutional investors into higher-risk securities and are not apparent in developed economies."
F36|Inflation and Exchange Rate Targeting Challenges Under Fiscal Dominance|Countries have increased significantly their public-sector borrowing since the Global Financial Crisis. In this context, we document several potential fiscal dominance effects during 2000-2017 under Inflation Targeting (IT), and non IT regimes. Higher ratios of public debt-to-GDP are associated with lower policy interest rates in Advanced Economies. In Emerging Market economies under non-IT regimes, composed mostly of exchange rate targeters, the interest rate effect of higher public debt is non-linear, and depends both on the ratio of foreign-currency to total public debt, and on the ratio of hard-currency debt to GDP. For these Emerging Market economies under non-IT regimes, real exchange rate depreciations and international reserves accumulation are significantly associated with higher interest rates. Sorting countries into low, medium and high nominal exchange rate volatility bins, we find that the high nominal exchange rate volatility group of Emerging Market economies, composed mostly of commodity intensive countries, show the most persuasive evidence of debt levels influencing policy interest rates.
F36|Global Dimensions of U.S. Monetary Policy|This paper is a partial exploration of mechanisms through which global factors influence the tradeoffs that U.S. monetary policy faces. It considers three main channels. The first is the determination of domestic inflation in a context where international prices and global competition play a role, alongside domestic slack and inflation expectations. The second channel is the determination of asset returns (including the natural real safe rate of interest, râ??) and financial conditions, given integration with global financial markets. The third channel, which is particular to the United States, is the potential spillback onto the U.S. economy from the disproportionate impact of U.S. monetary policy on the outside world. In themselves, global factors need not undermine a central bank's ability to control the price level over the long term -- after all, it is the monopoly issuer of the numeraire in which domestic prices are measured. Over shorter horizons, however, global factors do change the tradeoff between price-level control and other goals such as low unemployment and financial stability, thereby affecting the policy cost of attaining a given price path.
F36|Towards an Unstable Hook: The Evolution of Stock Market Integration Since 1913|We examine equity market integration for 17 countries from 1913-2018. We use network analysis to measure the evolution of global stock market integration as well as stock market integration between and across countries. The empirical results suggest that long-run stock market integration looks like an unstable hook. Equity market integration first peaked in 1913 during the first era of globalization (1870-1913) when unfettered markets ruled the day. Integration declined over the next 60 years as countries experienced the Great Depression and shunned international capital markets. The end of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s ushered in the second period of globalization. Our empirical analysis suggests that stock market integration in the recent period of globalization has surpassed the first era of globalization in the last 10 years and currently has the highest level of equity market integration and network instability in world history.
F36|Riders on the Storm|Interest rates in major advanced economies have drifted down and in greater unison over the past few decades. A country’s rate of interest can be thought of as reflecting movements in the global neutral rate of interest, the domestic neutral rate, and the stance of monetary policy. Only the latter is controlled by the central bank. Estimates from a state space New Keynesian model show that central bank policy explains less than half of the variation in interest rates. The rest of the time, the central bank is catching up to trends dictated by productivity growth, demography, and other factors outside of its control.
F36|Does Trilemma Speak Chinese?|Based on the limitations imposed by the trilemma, this paper examines the trade-offs faced by the Chinese economy. Taking into account the role of accumulation of foreign reserves we examine how binding the constraints are for the Chinese monetary authorities. Using a Panel VAR with dynamic and static interdependencies as well as cross-sectional heterogeneities, we examine the monetary spillovers from China to a series of Asian economies. In this way, we measure the degree to which the Chinese trilemma constraints are exported to other countries. Consistent with previous research, our empirical evidence suggests that China's trilemma configurations are unique as China manages to achieve exchange rate stability, along with moderate financial liberalization, without losing its monetary autonomy. Furthermore, there are no significant spillovers to regional economies. Overall, trilemma does speak Chinese, but only for a short period.
F36|EMU-Risk Synchronisation and Financial Fragility Through the Prism of Dynamic Connectedness|This study employs dynamic connectedness as a measure of financial risk synchronisation considering government bond yields in 11 EMU member states. In particular, large values of the relevant index can be an indication of comparable levels of risk further implying that the common currency area consists of a financially sensible set of countries. By contrast, small connectedness values can be an indication of fragmentation whereupon certain countries are considered to be safer than others. The latter would be detrimental for the EMU as it fuels financial fragility, which practically stipulates that crises occur as a result of self-fulfilling market fears. The results are based on a daily dataset which spans between 1st September 2003 and 31st August 2018. Findings show that fragmentation was present at the height of the European sovereign debt crisis and that the interconnectedness has not yet reverted to its pre-2009 levels. In addition, core countries appear to transmit shocks to periphery countries although, occasionally, there are noteworthy disparities. Further investigating these disparities on a pairwise connectedness level - which helps to identify sensible pairs of countries in terms of financial risk - shows that core countries dominate this exercise, with the exception of the bilateral relation between Italy and Spain. The fact that most periphery countries of our sample are not included in these pairs raises concerns and calls for a more substantial integration.
F36|Exchange rate dynamics, balance sheet effects, and capital flows. A Minskyan model of emerging market boom-bust cycles|The paper provides a dynamic Minskyan open economy model of endogenous boom-bust cycles in emerging market economies, which explains the empirically observed procyclicality of exchange rates and the countercyclicality of the trade balance. It highlights the interaction of exchange rate dynamics and balance sheets. Currency appreciation makes firm balance sheets with foreign currency debt more solid. Throughout the resulting boom phase, the current account position worsens. Pressures on the domestic exchange rate mount until the currency depreciates. Contractionary balance sheet effects then set in as domestic firms face a drop in their nominal net worth. If capital inflows are driven by exogenous risk appetite, these fluctuations can assume the form of shock-independent endogenous cycles. An exogenous increase in risk appetite increases the volatility of the cycle. We find that financial account regulation can help reduce macroeconomic volatility and that the larger the risk appetite, the more financial account regulation is required to achieve this.
F36|Time-Varying Exchange Rate Risk Premium|We characterize the exchange rate risk premium on the context of a small open economy with controlled floating exchange rate regime. The data set includes 100 observations on case of Vietnam over 01/2011-04/2019. The risk premium is varying over time. And it is determined by output growth rate, inflation rate, foreign capital inflows and liquidity supply. As one application, the existence of time varying risk premium reduces the effectiveness of foreign exchange market intervention by forward contract.
F36|Looking through conduit FDI in search of ultimate investors – a probabilistic approach|This paper presents a novel computational method to determine the distribution of ultimate investors in bilateral FDI stock. The approach employs results from the probabilistic theory of absorbing Markov chains. The method allows for the estimation of a bilateral matrix that provides inward positions by ultimate counterparts for over 100 recipient countries, covering 95% of total FDI stock and including many developing countries. Reconstructing the global FDI network by ultimate investors enables a more accurate and complete snapshot of international production than do standalone bilateral FDI statistics. This has considerable implications for policymaking. It also provides more nuanced context to some contemporary developments such as the trade tensions between the United States, China and others, as well as Brexit
F36|Business cycles,bilateral trade and international financial intergration : Evidence from Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)|This paper identifies the determinants of synchronization of business cycles in ECOWAS because it allows decision-makers to better target their economic policies. It is relevant given the willingness of ECOWAS heads of state to create a single currency by 2020. Indeed, conducting actions in the direction of the synchronization of business cycles is important because the asymmetries of the cycles observed within a monetary union determine its sustainability. Unlike previous studies in this area, it is innovative as it takes into account international financial integration. In addition, it proposes new measures to increase the quality of results. Finally, it takes into account the structure of trade by analyzing inter-regional links. The results show that bilateral trade and financial openness are determinants of the synchronization of business cycles in the region. However, they show that, trade channel dominates financial openness channel. In addition, the results show that the weakness of intra-community trade doesn’t constitute a barrier to monetary union.
F36|A European safe asset to complement national government bonds|This paper expands the growing literature on common safe assets in the context of the euro area financial system by employing credit risk simulation techniques to investigate the properties of different safe asset models and their impact on national bond markets. The paper explores in particular the E-bonds model, whereby a supranational institution would raise funds in the markets and provide bilateral senior loans to Member States corresponding to a fixed proportion of GDP, complementing the issuance of national government bonds, without risks of mutualisation. The main findings are that E-bonds could reach a volume of 15 to 30% of euro area GDP with a high degree of safety while becoming the reference safe asset for the banking sector, capital markets and monetary policy operations in the euro area. As regards the impact on remaining national bonds, such volumes would be consistent with Germany maintaining its top credit rating. The average funding costs of Member States would remain broadly stable, while marginal funding costs would tend to experience limited increases, which should enhance market discipline.
F36|The Deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union|This article seeks to guide the reader through the developments in the process of EMU deepening, clarifying the economic arguments and identifying the choices made by the decision makers, which led to the current institutional design. In addition, a critical analysis of the different proposals under discussion is made, aiming at identifying the most efficient way, in a long-term perspective, to ensure the proper functioning of the monetary union.
F36|Explaining Monetary Spillovers: The Matrix Reloaded|This paper examines whether euro area unconventional monetary policies have affected the loss-absorbing buffers (that is the resilience) of the banking industry. We employ various measures to capture the effect of the broad array of programmes used by the ECB to implement balance sheet policies, while we control for the effect of conventional and negative (or very low) interest rate policy. The results suggest that, above and away from the zero-lower bound, looser interest rate policy tends to weaken our measure of euro area banks' loss-absorbing buffers. On the contrary, further lowering interest rates near and below the zero lower bound seems to strengthen (or weaken less) such buffers, which points towards non-linearities arising in the vicinity of the lower bound. Moreover, balance sheet easing policies enhance bank level resilience overall. However, unconventional monetary policies seem to have increased the fragility of banks in the member states hardest hit by the 2011 sovereign debt crisis. In fact, the evidence presented in this paper suggest that the resilience gains of unconventional monetary policies have accrued mostly to banks headquartered in the so-called core euro area countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Netherlands). Finally, unconventional monetary policies seem to have enhanced more the resilience of banks that were relatively stronger, i.e. that were in the higher deciles of the distribution of loss-absorbing buffers.
F36|Access to finance constraints in adopting latest technologies for business production in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)|The small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play crucial role in supporting the economies of developing countries. However, with globalization and open market trends, SMEs need to compete with new entrants to maintain their market share and growth. The degree of technology adaptation and level of process sophistication help the SMEs to achieve their targeted level of growth through improvement of business effectiveness and efficiency. Access to finance is a critical success factor in such endeavor and supports the SMEs to alleviate growth constraints. This paper presents research data on the degree that access to finance impacts the abilities of SMEs to grow through improvement of process sophistication for enhanced business production. The raw data was gathered from over 400 firms independently using one unified assessment tool over a period of five years. This data is then analyzed using inferential statistics through one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate and compare the average scores associated with the research variables. Furthermore, the post hoc analysis is applied to assess the extent and direction of variation in the scores and moderated across different years. The results showed that the adopted level of process sophistication is positively correlated with the availability of technology with limited role played by access to finance. These relationships are discussed and analyzed in the context of local market growth, sophistication, financial capabilities, and financial facilities. The research aims to assist SME stakeholders and governing bodies in recognizing the impact of changes on macroeconomic scale from SMEs growth and sustainability perspectives.
F36|Foreign currency loan conversions and currency mismatches|This paper examines the effect of currency conversion programs from Swiss franc-denominated loans to other currency loans on currency risk for banks in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Swiss franc mortgage loans proliferated in CEE countries prior to the financial crisis and contributed to the volume of non-performing loans as the Swiss franc strongly appreciated during the post-crisis period. Empirical findings suggest that Swiss franc loan conversion programs reduced currency mismatches in Swiss francs but increased bank exposure in other foreign currencies in individual countries. This asymmetric effect of conversion programs arises from the loan restructuring from Swiss francs to a non-local currency and the high level of euro mismatches in the CEE banking system.
F36|The Vietnamese financial economy: reforms and development, 1986-2016|In an age of reform, Vietnam’s financial systems have come to a critical stage in which the quality of policy-making, independence of the central banking operations and over-risk controls will ultimately be required if the country is set to move forward in a sustainable fashion. Analysts may have different views about Vietnam’s financial economy, but all agree that it has evolved and grown fast over the past three decades. The next course of development will depend on how Vietnamese society views raison d’être of its financial systems and financial health. But the process will much depend on the economic growth of the economy as a whole. Failing to support a sustained growth puts VFS’s existence at risk as economic growth helps mitigate higher risk-taking behavior and contain instability in less competitive markets.
F36|Securitisation special purpose entities, bank sponsors and derivatives|This paper documents the use of derivatives by securitisation special purpose entities (SPEs), also known as financial vehicle corporations (FVCs), domiciled in Ireland using transaction-level data established by the European Market Infrastructure Regulation. We show that these entities primarily engaged in interest rate derivatives over the period of 2015–2017. We find that larger entities that already engage in international capital markets are more likely to have derivative exposures. We also show that entities sponsored by banks and non-bank financial institutions are relatively more likely to engage in derivative markets. The characteristics of these bank sponsors are important in determining SPEs’ engagement in derivative markets. SPEs’ heavy reliance on debt finance coupled with their strong interconnectedness with bank sponsors underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and macroprudential surveillance of their derivative activities.
F36|Multinational Banks in Regulated Markets: Is Financial Integration Desirable?|We set up a two-country, regional model of trade in financial services. Competitive firms in each country manufacture non-traded consumer goods in an uncertain productive environment, borrowing funds from a bank in either the home or the foreign market. Duopolistic banks can choose their levels of monitoring of firms and thus the levels of risk-taking, where the risk of bank failure is partly borne by taxpayers in the banks\' home countries. Moreover, each bank chooses the allocation of its lending between domestic and foreign firms, while the bank\'s overall loan volume is fixed by a capital requirement set optimally in its home country. In this setting we consider two types of financial integration. A reduction in the compliance costs of cross-border banking reduces aggregate output and increases risk-taking, thus harming consumers and taxpayers in both countries. In contrast, a reduction in the costs of screening foreign firms is likely to be eneficial for banks, consumers, and taxpayers alike.
F36|The Double-Edged Sword of Global Integration: Robustness, Fragility & Contagion in the International Firm Network|We estimate global inter-firm networks across all major industries from 1981 through 2016 and provide the first empirical tests for both robust (beneficial) and fragile (harmful) network behavior, relating firms' health with global integration. More connected firms are less likely to be in distress and have higher profit growth and equity returns, but are also more exposed to direct contagion from distressed neighboring firms and network level crises. Our analysis reveals the centrality of finance in the international firm network and increased globalization, with greater potential for crises to spread globally when they do occur.
F36|Exchange Rate Exposure and Firm Dynamics|This paper develops a firm-dynamics model with endogenous currency debt composition to study financing and investment decisions in developing economies. In our model, foreign currency borrowing arises from a trade-off between exposure to currency risk and growth. There is cross-sectional hetero- geneity in these decisions in two dimensions. First, there is selection into foreign currency borrowing, as only productive firms employ it. Second, there is heterogeneity in firmsâ€™ share of foreign currency loans, driven by their potential growth. We assess econometrically the pattern of foreign currency borrowing using firm-level census data on Hungary, calibrate the model and quantify its aggregate impact.
F36|Skewed Credit and Growth Dynamics after the Global Financial Crisis|A large empirical literature finds that financial development is beneficial for economic growth, although some recent evidence suggests otherwise. The paper contributes to the financeâ€“growth literature by examining the role of credit growth skewness and long-run growth. Earlier literature found that credit growth skewness is negatively associated with economic growth. It revisits this relationship using a large and recent panel dataset that encompasses Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economies and the impact of the global financial crisis. While the results reconfirm an association between credit skewness and growth, the relationship is more nuanced than previously thought. It finds that the beneficial effects from lower skewnessâ€”systemic financial risksâ€”were evident only prior to 2000. The findings help explain why boomâ€“bust dynamics were positively associated with economic growth in emerging markets in the past and why the growth of advanced economies has been sluggish since the global financial crisis.
F36|Cross-Border Portfolio Investment and Financial Integration in Asia and the Pacific Region|We examine the developments of cross-border portfolio assets and liabilities in Asia and the Pacific region over the period 2001–2017. Rapid increases in both portfolio foreign assets and liabilities have taken place particularly after the 2008–2009 global financial crisis. These cross-border portfolio investments have the following characteristics. First, equity has been a dominant source of foreign liabilities notwithstanding efforts to develop bond markets in the region. One exception is Australia, where foreign liabilities have been largely in the form of debt securities. Limited capital inflows to debt securities issued by emerging Asia may be attributable to the early stages of bond market development. Second, in contrast, debt securities have remained dominant as foreign assets held by the region. This mostly reflects Japan’s preference toward debt securities. Other Asian and Pacific economies have invested more heavily in foreign equity. Third, the region’s assets and liabilities linkages have remained overwhelmingly strengthened against the United States and Europe. Nonetheless, the post-crisis period has witnessed greater financial integration within the region. The intraregional linkages have been deepest between Hong Kong, China and the People’s Republic of China (PRC), where the former has become a major financier of equity issued by the latter. Singapore increasingly plays a role as an equity investor toward the PRC, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and other ASEAN economies. Albeit from the low level, the intra-ASEAN integration has been noticeable. Fourth, Japan with the largest abundant domestic capital has remained predominantly exposed to the United States and Europe. Within the region, debt securities issued by Australia have increasingly attracted Japan’s capital. To conclude, intraregional financial integration has risen at the center of the PRC with growing linkages with Hong Kong, China and Singapore.
F36|The growing impact of US monetary policy on emerging financial markets: Evidence from India|Much research has been devoted to studying the international spillover effects of US monetary policy. However, a lot of the focus has been on the recent unconventional monetary policies undertaken by the Federal Reserve. Combining high frequency financial market data with a time-varying parameter approach we show that US monetary policy decisions have had significant effects on the Indian stock markets well before the use of unconventional policy tools and that these effects have gotten stronger over time. In addition to the conventional channel of surprise changes in the policy rate, we find that US monetary shocks are also transmitted through an uncertainty channel, which is especially important for announcements about large scale asset purchases (quantitative easing). Using firm level stock prices, we also show that the higher sensitivity of the aggregate response is uniform across the stock market and is not driven by the increased exposure of any specific industry to US monetary policy. Instead, our results suggest that it is driven by the portfolio decisions of foreign institutional investors and the exchange rate becoming more sensitive to US monetary policy.
F36|Pregatirea României pentru aderarea la Uniunea Europeana|Romania’s lead-up to the accession to the European Union lasted quite a long time (1991-2007). The first steps had been taken by the conclusion and the enforcement of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (1990) and the Association Agreement (1993) which paved the way for the transition to higher forms of cooperation and integration for expanding the domains and improving these forms. An important step for the accession was the negotiation for transposing and implementing the EC legislation in Romania, to be followed by economic, institutional and administrative changes and restructuring, which needed significant efforts. The wish of the majority of the Romanian citizens in favour of the country’s accession to the EU had a positive impact on the European Communities, which offered a substantial aid provided that the new candidate fulfils some requirements for ensuring the political, economic, institutional, legal and administrative compatibilities and all obligations of an EU member. The main actions taken by Romania, by the EU officials and by the EU member countries are presented below.
F36|Examining Time-Varying Integrity And Interrelationships Among Global Stock Markets|This paper examines co-movements and interrelationships among 6 emerging and 5 developed stock market returns between period 2001- 2017. First, principal components are extracted from returns. Results show that, for the period analyzed, there is no strong global stock market integration and there isn't any change in patterns of correlations of returns except short-term disturbances in global financial crisis time. Second, partial least squares regression models are used for predicting each stock market returns with other stock markets' current and all markets' up to three month lagged returns. Results identify divergence between developed and emerging markets and greater number of latent transmission channels among former ones. Findings indicate a strong integrity among global stock markets is not yet appeared and considered together with previous studies, today's international market structure can be attributed to last two decades of 20th century. China stock market has a disparate position than all other stock markets and deserves further interest.
F36|Oca And East Asian Monetary Union: Analyzing Asymmetry Of Shocks|There have been studies applying OCA criteria to East Asia and they have focused largely on evaluating the economic conditions for regional monetary integration in East Asia. Many of their studies find that at least some of the Asian countries meet major OCA criteria. This paper investigates the feasibility and desirability of a common currency arrangement in East Asia applying a structural VARs methodology to asymmetric shocks. We examine the issues of asymmetric responses to external shocks which is one of the most frequently used criteria for evaluating the costs and benefits of joining a common currency versus having an independent currency.The results suggest that a sub-group of East Asian countries are plausible candidates for adopting a single currency. Regarding asymmetry of supply shocks, we find that eight East Asian economies (Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand) are possible candidates for a currency union (EA 8), and EA 5 for demand shocks. Supply disturbances are highly and significantly correlated among these countries and correlations of real GDP growth rates corroborate the analysis of supply disturbances.
F36|Balance sheets after the EMU : an assessment of the redenomination risk|The probability of a partial or complete break-up of the euro has risen over the last years. Such an event could create a balance sheet problem for economic agents, since the redenomination process could introduce significant currency mismatches between the asset and liability sides. We propose a new assessment of this redenomination risk, by country and by main institutional sector, for two scenarios: a single country exit and a complete break-up. Our main conclusion is that, even though the problem has to be taken seriously, its order of magnitude should not be exaggerated. Only a few sectors are at significant risk: public debts of Greece and Portugal, financial sectors of Greece, Ireland and Luxembourg. In particular, the consequences for the nonfinancial private sector should be manageable. We provide policy recommendations aiming at limiting the risk ex ante, and mitigating the consequences ex post.
F36|Bilateral Capital Flows: Transaction Patterns and Gravity|Holdings of cross-border bilateral assets are highly responsive to information frictions, market size, transaction costs, and trade ties. But empirical support using transactions data are constrained by the lack of comprehensive bilateral capital flows data covering large sample of economies for several years across investment and investor types. One expects that as information frictions weaken, transaction costs decline, and trade links strengthen, financial transactions between two economies will rise. This paper tests this hypothesis. Using bilateral Financial Accounts data from the Regional Balance of Payments Statistics of 10 advanced economies—yielding an unbalanced panel with 182 country pairs—for 2000-2016, the results provide strong evidence on the significance of information frictions, bilateral trade, transaction costs, and market size on bilateral capital flows. However, the findings show varying sensitivities of domestic and foreign investors to information asymmetries and trade ties. Moreover, investors appear to be more responsive to domestic transaction costs and foreign market size effects, than the converse. This study demonstrates an application of using bilateral capital flows data in revealing the patterns of international financial market segmentation still prevailing in cross-border financial transactions.
F36|Bilateral Capital Flows: Gravity, Push, and Pull|Using bilateral capital flows data from 10 advanced reporting economies—with over 186 bilateral country pairs—for 2000 to 2016, this paper provides strong evidence on the significance of gravity factors, including distance and bilateral trade ties, in explaining cross-border financial asset flows. This finding is new to the capital flows literature that consider push and pull factors. In addition, this study offers new evidence of regional contagion as bilateral capital flows decrease more for country pairs with closer geographic proximity (or with less information frictions) than those that are farther apart when global risk aversion rises. These findings have policy implications on the importance of information frictions, bilateral trade ties, and regional cooperation on bilateral financial asset flows.
F36|Clear and Close Competitors? : On the Causes and Consequences of Bilateral Competition between Banks|We interview 361 European bank CEOs to identify their banks’ main competitors. We then provide evidence on the drivers of bilateral bank competition, construct a novel competition measure at the locality level, and assess how well it explains variation in firms’ credit constraints. We find that banks identify another bank as a main competitor in small-business lending when their branch networks overlap, when both are foreign owned or relationship oriented, or when the potential competitor has fewer hierarchical layers. Intense bilateral bank competition increases local credit constraints, especially for small firms, as competition may impede the formation of lending relationships.
F36|II rilancio delle principali politiche economiche dell|Dalle fine del 2015 la Commissione e il Parlamento europei hanno presentato ai governi de-gli Stati membri e al piÃ¹ generale dibattito politico una serie di documenti di proposta e di riflessione circa la prossima riforma politico-istituzionale dellâ€™UE. Tra questi documenti alcuni riguardano lâ€™approfondimento dellâ€™UEM, il futuro sistema di finanziamento dellâ€™UE e la semplificazione dellâ€™accesso ai fondi dellâ€™UE, con particolare riferimento a quelli strutturali e dâ€™investimento. In questo studio sâ€™intende illustrare sommariamente, quanto distintamente i tre menzionati documenti, giacchÃ© si tratta di provvedimenti riguardanti le piÃ¹ rilevanti politiche economi-che europee, con lâ€™obiettivo di metterne in luce i principali caratteri di novitÃ rispetto alla normativa attualmente vigente, ritenuta non pienamente soddisfacente da molti studiosi e policy-maker a livello internazionale.
F36|Il discorso del Presidente Juncker sullo stato dell'Unione per il 2017|A settembre di ogni anno il Presidente della Commissione europea pronuncia dinanzi al Parlamento europeo il discorso sullo stato dellâ€™Unione, in cui egli fa il punto della situazione per lâ€™anno appena trascorso e illustra le prioritÃ per lâ€™anno successivo. In effetti, il 13 settembre 2017 il Presidente Juncker ha pronunciato il suo terzo discorso sullo stato dellâ€™Unione che viene qui sommariamente esaminato assieme ad alcuni altri documenti e a dei provvedimenti che sono stati adottati in tale occasione. Oltre ai resoconti sullâ€™applicazione delle decisioni giÃ assunte e sullâ€™attuazione delle politiche comuni, sono stati presentati alcuni testi di vario genere, tra cui in particolare la lettera di intenti, ad accompagnamento della â€œtabella di marciaâ€ da seguire per giungere ad unâ€™Unione piÃ¹ unita, piÃ¹ forte e piÃ¹ democratica prima delle prossime elezioni europee. Il discorso di questâ€™anno appare particolarmente importante giacchÃ© in esso il presidente Juncker svela la sua visione sul futuro dellâ€™Unione europea.
F36|Assessing the degree of international consumption risk sharing|This paper examines the extent of risk sharing for a group of 50 industrial and developing countries. The analysis is based on a model of partial consumption insurance whose parameters have the natural interpretation of coefficients of partial risk sharing even when the null hypothesis of perfect risk sharing is rejected. Results show that rich countries exhibit higher degrees of risk sharing than developing countries, and that the gap has widened over time. Other things equal, the degree of risk sharing is higher in smaller, more financially-open economies and in those possessing flexible exchange rate regimes.
F36|Internationalization and firm valuation: New evidence from first offshore bond issuances of US firms|Does internationalization affect firm valuation? To answer this question, literature mainly considers firms from around the world internationalizing by issuing equity in the USA, whereas the current study focuses on US firms that internationalize by issuing debt in overseas markets. This paper provides evidence on theories of internationalization and capital structure, finding that overseas corporate debt offerings have a positive short-term effect on US firms' valuations. The effect varies in firm characteristics, timing, and the location of the issue. Additionally, firms with a strong need for external funds and growth prospects accelerate their offshore public debt market entry.
F36|Capital Inflows, Equity Issuance Activity, and Corporate Investment|We use issuance-level data to study how equity capital inflows that enter emerging market economies affect equity issuance and corporate investment. We show that foreign inflows are strongly correlated with country-level issuance. The relation reflects the behavior of large issuers issuing in domestic equity markets and that of firms issuing in international markets. Those larger, more liquid, and highly valued firms are the ones more likely to raise equity when their country receives capital inflows. To identify supply-side shocks, we instrument capital inflows into each country with exogenous changes in other countries’ attractiveness to foreign investors. Shifts in the supply of foreign capital are important drivers of increased equity inflows. Instrumented inflows lead a subset of firms (large domestic issuers and foreign issuers) to raise new equity, which they use mainly to fund investment. Corporate investment increases between one-tenth and four-tenths the amount of foreign equity capital entering the country.
F36|Trilemma-Dilemma: Constraint or Choice? Some Empirical Evidence from a Structurally Identified Heterogeneous Panel VAR|Abstract We use a heterogeneous panel structural VAR approach to study the role of international financial integration in determining the effectiveness of monetary policy under different exchange rate regimes. In particular, we use the extent to which a country’s monetary policy is able to create temporary deviations from uncovered interest parity as a policy-relevant measure of the degree to which the country is effectively integrated with international financial markets, and then correlate this measure to our estimates of the ability of monetary policy to induce temporary movements in commercial bank lending rates. We find that regardless of whether a country pursues fixed or floating exchange rates, the impact of monetary policy shocks on bank lending rates is diminished as the country becomes financially more integrated with the world economy. This is a direct implication of Mundell’s trilemma for countries with fixed exchange rates, but not for floaters. For floaters, we find that the weaker effects on domestic interest rates under high integration are accompanied with stronger effects on the exchange rate. This also holds true for monetary shocks originating in “core” countries. These results provide a possible reconciliation between Rey’s “dilemma” and Mundell’s famous trilemma: because higher financial integration increases exchange rate volatility in response to foreign monetary shocks, countries in the periphery that seek to avoid such volatility are more likely to pursue monetary policies that shadow those of the core as they become more financially integrated with the core.
F36|A mechanism to regulate sovereign debt restructuring in the euro area|A missing element in the architecture of the euro area is a mechanism for an orderly restructuring of unsustainable sovereign debt. Clear rules for creditor participation in case of overindebtedness would strengthen market discipline and enhance the effectiveness of crisis assistance. We propose a novel two‐stage mechanism that allows for postponing the crucial distinction between liquidity and solvency crises and is part of the assistance provided by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). At the onset of a programme, the framework includes an immediate maturity extension if the debt burden is high. If post‐crisis debt turns out to be unsustainable, the debtor country can negotiate a deeper debt restructuring. In addition, we introduce a gradual transition phase into the new regime. As current debt matures, it is replaced by a new class of bonds with Creditor Participation Clauses (CPC), which are subject to the new rules as mentioned above.
F36|Cheap Talk? Financial Sanctions and Non-Financial Activity|Sanctions restrict cross-border interactions and, therefore, not only put political and economic pressure on the target country, but they also adversely affect the sender country. This paper examines the effect of financial sanctions on the country imposing them. In particular, we analyze the business responses of German non-financial entities to the imposition of sanctions on 23 countries over the period from 1999 through 2014. Examining highly disaggregated, monthly data from the German balance of payments statistics, we find four main results. First, German financial activities with sanctioned countries are sizably reduced after the imposition of sanctions, with strong reductions in the scope of cross-border activities (i.e., the extensive margin) and less robust results for total financial flows which is consistent with the concept of ‘smart sanctions’. Second, firms doing business with sanctioned countries tend to be disproportionately large, making them largely immune to the reduction in business opportunities with selected partners. Third, firms affected by sanctions expand their activities with non-sanctioned countries, some of which display close trade ties to the sanctioned country. Fourth, we find no effect of sanctions on broader measures of firm performance such as employment or total sales. Overall, we conclude that the economic costs of financial sanctions to the sender country are limited.
F36|Georgia at the crossroads of economic development|In the last decade of XX century, has expanded the area of capital movements, which included the former socialist countries. Thus, the countries that are attracting some of the centers of the capital and at the same time, participate in the export of capital, it is impossible not to have engaged in a global economy. Our country has been greatly involved in the processes of globalization. At the same time, Georgia's future development will depend on how the country is adapting to globalization with the need for policy implementation, the political, economic and organizational actuating levers. In this regard, the need for more emphasis on the intellectual forces of international finance - financial institutions with their own interests, the use of integrated approaches to economic development, high rates of achievement, social and economic policy harmonization, social inequality mitigation. Finally, the orientation of foreign economic priorities have to be organic in conjunction with the ongoing processes, it must define the strategic objectives of the national economy.
F36|Britain & Africa: heading for the Brexit rocks|High-flying illusions on the part of the proponents and grim predictions of the sceptics characterize the controversy about Brexit. The article analyses five issues at stake for the Post-Brexit relationships between Britain, the EU and Africa with a focus on the Commonwealth Sub-Saharan Africa: market access, FDI, aid, security and partnership . The British government’s vision of a ‘Global Britain’ relies heavily on a reinforced co-operation with Commonwealth nations. However, most likely this would be possible only at the expense of the poor in Africa and elsewhere. Concerning security cooperation with Africa, London apparently exaggerated its defence input in order to enhance its bargaining position with the EU. It will be crucial for both the EU and the UK to find post-Brexit agreements to stem irregular migration and the growth of jihadist groups and terrorism. In a nutshell, the analysis of these different policy fields shows that expectations of Brexiteers and African politicians alike concerning an enhanced, partner-like Post-Brexit Commonwealth relationship are largely unfounded.
F36|Foreign Currency Bank Funding and Global Factors|The literature on drivers of capital flows stresses the prominent role of global financial factors. Recent empirical work, however, highlights how this role varies across countries and time, and this heterogeneity is not well understood. We revisit this question by focusing on financial intermediaries' funding flows in different currencies. A portfolio model shows that the sign and magnitude of the response of foreign currency funding flows to global risk factors depend on the financial intermediary's pre-existing currency exposure. Analysis of data on European banks' aggregate balance sheets lends support to the model predictions, especially in countries outside the euro area.
F36|Bank loan supply during crises: the importance of geographic diversification|We classify a large sample of banks according to the geographic diversification of their international syndicated loan portfolio. Our results show that diversified banks maintain higher loan supply during banking crises in borrower countries. The positive loan supply effects lead to higher investment and employment growth for firms. Diversified banks are stabilizing due to their ability to raise additional funding during times of distress, which also shields connected markets from spillovers. Further distinguishing banks by nationality reveals a pecking order: diversified domestic banks are the most stable source of funding, while foreign banks with little diversification are the most fickle. Our findings suggest that the decline in financial integration since the recent crisis increases countries’ vulnerability to local shocks.
F36|Are Banking and Capital Markets Union Complements? Evidence from Channels of Risk Sharing in the Eurozone|"The interplay of equity market and banking integration is of first-order importance for risk sharing in the EMU. While EMU created an integrated interbank market, ""direct'' banking integration (in terms of direct cross-border bank-to-real sector flows or cross-border banking-consolidation) and equity market integration remained limited. We find that direct banking integration is associated with more risk sharing, while interbank integration is not. Further, interbank integration proved to be highly procyclical, which contributed to the freeze in risk sharing after 2008. Based on this evidence, and a stylized DSGE model, we discuss implications for banking union. Our results show that real banking integration and capital market union are complements and robust risk sharing in the EMU requires both."
F36|Financial Globalization and Bank Lending: The Limits of Domestic Monetary Policy?|We empirically analyze how bank lending reacts to monetary policy in the presence of global financial flows. Employing a unique and novel dataset of the funding modes and currency composition of the full population of Norwegian banks in structurally identified regressions, we show that the efficiency of the bank lending channel is affected when banks can shift to international funding and thus insulate their costs of funding from domestic monetary policy. We isolate the effect of global factors from domestic monetary policy by focusing on the deviation of exchange rates from the prediction of (uncovered and covered) interest rate parity. The Norwegian banking sector represents an ideal laboratory since the exogenous exchange rate dynamics allows for a convincing identification of the relation between lending and global factors.
F36|Cheap talk?

This paper examines the effect of financial sanctions on the country imposing them. In particular, we analyze the business responses of German non-financial entities to the imposition of sanctions on 23 countries over the period from 1999 through 2014. Examining highly disaggregated, monthly data from the German balance of payments statistics, we find four main results. First, German financial activities with sanctioned countries are sizably reduced after the imposition of sanctions, with strong reductions in the scope of cross-border activities (i.e., the extensive margin with fewer firms and fewer asset categories) and less statistically robust results for total financial flows (sum of inflows and outflows) which is consistent with the concept of 'smart sanctions'. Second, firms doing business with sanctioned countries tend to be disproportionately large, making them largely immune to the reduction in business opportunities with individual partners. Third, firms affected by sanctions expand their activities with non-sanctioned countries, some of which display close trade ties to the sanctioned country. Fourth, we find no effect of sanctions on aggregate variables of firm performance such as employment or total sales. Overall, we conclude that the economic costs of financial sanctions to the sender country are limited.
F36|Intraday effect of news on emerging European forex markets: An event study analysis|We analyze the impact of euro zone/German and U.S. macroeconomic news announcements and the communication of the monetary policy settings of the ECB and the Fed on the forex markets of new EU members. We employ an event study methodology to analyze intraday data from 2011–2015. Our comprehensive analysis of the wide variety of macroeconomic information during the post-GFC period shows that: (i) macroeconomic announcements affect the value of the new EU country exchange rates, (ii) the origin of the announcement matters, (iii) the type of announcement matters, (iv) different types of news (good, bad or neutral) result in different reactions, (v) markets react not only after the news release but also before, (vi) when the U.S. dollar is the base currency the impact of the news is larger than in the case of the euro, (vii) announcements on ECB monetary policy result in stronger effects than those of the Fed, (viii) temporary inefficiencies are present in new EU country forex markets, (ix) new EU country exchange rates react differently to positive US news during the EU debt crisis compared to the rest of the period.
F36|Political Tension and Stock Markets in the Arabian Peninsula|This note investigates the effects of the recent political tensions in the Arabian peninsula on the linkages between the stock markets of the leading GCC countries by estimating a VAR-GARCH (1,1) model at a weekly frequency. The results indicate that the June 2017 crisis lowered stock market returns and generally led to greater volatility spillovers within the region. This evidence supports the need for further financial integration and suggests fewer portfolio diversification opportunities for investors in the GCC region.
F36|The Impact of Business and Political News on the GCC Stock Markets|This paper investigates the impact of business and political news on stock market returns in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. For this purpose, it employs a Markov switching model including a separate index for each of the two categories of news considered. The results indicate the importance of news as drivers of GCC stock returns, with business news playing a more substantial role; further, news released in the largest financial markets in the regions are found to have significant cross-border effects.
F36|The KOF Globalisation Index – revisited|Abstract We introduce the revised version of the KOF Globalisation Index, a composite index measuring globalization for every country in the world along the economic, social and political dimension. The original index was introduced by Dreher (Applied Economics, 38(10):1091–1110, 2006) and updated in Dreher et al. (2008). This second revision of the index distinguishes between de facto and de jure measures along the different dimensions of globalization. We also disentangle trade and financial globalization within the economic dimension of globalization and use time-varying weighting of the variables. The new index is based on 43 instead of 23 variables in the previous version. Following Dreher (Applied Economics, 38(10):1091–1110, 2006), we use the new index to examine the effect of globalization on economic growth. The results suggest that de facto and de jure globalization influence economic growth differently. Future research should use the new KOF Globalisation Index to re-examine other important consequences of globalization and why globalization was proceeding rapidly in some countries, such as South Korea, but less so in others.

F36|Global Financial Cycles and the Exchange Rate Regime: A Perspective from Emerging Markets|This paper examines the claim that exchange rate regimes are of little relevance in the transmission of global financial conditions to domestic financial and macroeconomic conditions. Our findings suggest that exchange rate regimes do matter, at least for emerging market economies. The transmission of global financial shocks to domestic variables is magnified under fixed exchange rate regimes relative to more flexible regimes. For advanced economies, however, the jury is still out, as the recent paucity of truly fixed regimes among these economies poses a challenge for estimating the effect of exchange rate flexibility.
F36|The Search for a Euro Area Safe Asset|"This paper evaluates four approaches to creating ""safe assets"" or asset portfolios for the euro area: (1) a diversified portfolio of senior tranches of sovereign debt (""national tranching""); (2) a senior security backed by a diversified pool of national sovereign debt (""ESBies""); (3) debt issued by a senior financial intermediary, backed by a diversified pool of national debt (""E-bonds""); and (4) debt issued by a euro area budget or a leveraged wealth fund, based on member state contributions or dedicated direct revenue sources. None of these approaches envisages explicit guarantees by member states, and all could potentially produce safe assets in sufficient quantities to replace euro area sovereign bond holdings in euro area banks. At the same time, the four approaches differ across several important dimensions. A euro area budget or wealth fund could create the largest volume of safe assets, followed by ESBies, E-bonds, and national tranching. A euro area budget or wealth fund is also likely to have the lowest impact on the structure and liquidity of national bond markets, while national tranching would have the largest impact. ESBies and E-bonds occupy an intermediate position. ESBies and potentially bonds issued by a euro area budget would offer their holders greater protection from deep national defaults than the other two proposals. Both ESBies and national tranching would avoid cross-country redistribution by construction, whereas E-bonds and a euro area budget could have significant distributional consequences, depending on their design. E-bonds are unique in that they would raise the marginal cost of sovereign debt issuance at higher levels of debt, thereby exerting fiscal discipline, without necessarily raising average debt costs for lower-rated borrowers."
F36|Foreign currency bank funding and global factors|The literature on drivers of capital flows stresses the prominent role of global financial factors. Recent empirical work, however, highlights how this role varies across countries and time, and this heterogeneity is not well understood. We revisit this question by focusing on financial intermediaries' funding flows in different currencies. A portfolio model shows that the sign and magnitude of the response of foreign currency funding flows to global risk factors depend on the financial intermediary's pre-existing currency exposure. Analysis of data on European banks' aggregate balance sheets lends support to the model predictions, especially in countries outside the euro area.
F36|Are banking and capital markets union complements? Evidence from channels of risk sharing in the eurozone|EMU was a major step towards deeper financial integration among member states. However, diversification of equity portfolios remained limited while banking integration surged. We argue that the nature of banking integration is of first-order importance for understanding the patterns and channels of risk sharing. While EMU was associated with the creation of an integrated interbank market, as witnessed by an explosion in cross-border interbank flows, “real” banking integration (in terms of cross-border bank-to-real sector flows or banking-consolidation) remained limited. But we find that real banking integration is associated with more risk sharing, while indirect integration via interbank flows is not. Further, indirect banking integration proved to be highly procyclical, which contributed to the freeze in risk sharing after 2008. Based on this evidence, and a stylized DSGE model that allows us to explain these patterns in the data, we discuss implications for banking union. Our results show that real banking integration and capital market union are complements and robust risk sharing in the EMU requires both.
F36|What are the consequences of global banking for the international transmission of shocks? A quantitative analysis|The global financial crisis of 2008 was followed by a wave of regulatory reforms that affected large banks, especially those with a global presence. These reforms were reactive to the crisis. In this paper we propose a structural model of global banking that can be used proactively to perform counterfactual analysis on the effects of alternative regulatory policies. The structure of the model mimics the US regulatory framework and highlights the organizational choices that banks face when entering a foreign market: branching versus subsidiarization. When calibrated to match moments from a sample of European banks, the model is able to replicate the response of the US banking sector to the European sovereign debt crisis. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that pervasive subsidiarization, higher capital requirements, or ad hoc monetary policy interventions would have mitigated the effects of the crisis on US lending.
F36|Quantitative Easing, Collateral Constraints, and Financial Spillovers|The steady application of Quantitative Easing (QE) has been followed by big and non-monotonic effects on international asset prices and international capital flows. These are difficult to explain in conventional models, but arise naturally in a model with collateral. This paper develops a general-equilibrium framework to explore QE’s international transmission involving an advanced economy (AE) and an emerging market economy (EM) whose assets have less collateral capacity. Capital flows arise as a result of international sharing of scarce collateral. The crucial insight is that private AE agents adjust their portfolios in different ways in response to QE, conditional on whether they are (i) fully leveraged, (ii) partially leveraged or (iii) unleveraged. These portfolio shifts of international assets can diminish or even reverse the effectiveness of ever-larger QE interventions on asset prices. The model provides a simultaneous interpretation of several important stylized facts associated with QE.
F36|Credit risk of foreign bank branches and subsidiaries in Argentina and Uruguay|The paper presents both theoretical and empirical analysis to explain the differences in credit risks between branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks. Using a model with costly monitoring and asymmetric information (from the perspective of host country regulators and parent banks), we show theoretical evidence that the optimal amount of monitoring increases with the size of foreign affiliates (relative to their parent banks), regardless of whether their legal form is of a branch or subsidiary. In the case of small affiliates, we argue that there is a conflict of interest between parent banks and regulators, the former of which prefer to operate with riskier and ring-fenced subsidiaries, and the latter of which prefer better-monitored and co-insured branches. Using bank-level data on Argentina and Uruguay prior to their financial crises of 2001-02, we find that (i) larger foreign branches have lower ratios of non-performing loans than foreign subsidiaries and smaller branches and (ii) branches headquartered in more developed economies had fewer non-performing loans.
F36|Time-varying cointegrating regression analysis with an application to the long-run interest rate pass-through in the Euro Area|This paper study the mechanism of transmission between the money and the retail credit markets stated in terms of the long-run relationship between the harmonized interest rates for different credit categories and for a subset of countries of the EMU (European Monetary Union). This mechanism, known as the interest rate pass-through (IRPT) phenomenon, has been analyzed in many empirical studies using a variety of econometric techniques, for different samples of countries and periods of time, and the general conclusion is that the pass-through seems to be incomplete in the long-run. Except for a few recent works, the analysis is performed on the basis on a time-invariant long-run relationship which may not be appropriate in this case and could condition this result. To evaluate the robustness of these findings we extend the analysis through a non-linear model for the long-run relationship between the money and the retail markets that incorporates in a very flexible form, and with minimum requirements on tuning parameters, the nonlinearity in the form of time-varying parameters. To that end we follow the approach initiated in Bierens (1997) and also propose some new tools to test for the existence of a stable time-varying cointegration relationship. The results obtained seems to support the former evidence of an incomplete pass-through.
F36|Markups and Productivity under Heterogeneous Financial Frictions|We incorporate heterogeneous financial frictions in a setting of monopolistically competitive firms with endogenous markups. Before producing, firms must pledge collateral to obtain a bank loan, needed to cover part of production costs. Firms differ both in productivity and in their cost of raising collateral. Firm-specic financial frictions, together with productivity, therefore figure in the equilibrium expressions of prices and markups. We validate our theoretical results on a representative sample of European manufacturing firms surveyed during the financial crisis. Guided by our model we retrieve from balance-sheet data firm-specic measures of access to finance, total factor productivity and markups, and then use these variables to estimate our equilibrium equations structurally. Consistent with our model, we show how heterogeneity in access to finance explains part of the dispersion of prices and markups, even after controlling for firms' productivity and size. In the aggregate industry equilibrium, the amount of collateral required by banks significantly affects the cost pass-through to prices.
F36|The More the Merrier? The Reaction of Euro Area Stock Markets to New Members|The adoption of the euro is a crucial turning point for the economy of any EU member and the culmination of a long process of exchange rate management and macroeconomic convergence. But how does the prospect of euro area enlargement play out in the countries that have already adopted the euro? Are new members seen as a way to expand the club of like-minded countries, or are they perceived as a threat to stability, either because there exists a moral hazard risk from the side of old members to adopt riskier behavior on behalf of new members or vice versa? This paper looks at the effects of the news of the euroâ€™s adoption event in new members on the stock returns of nineteen euro area countries, employing both an event study methodology and APARCH modeling to capture and test the form of responses of European financial market volatility. Our results show that markets were indeed pleased when new members joined the euro area, with negative responses due solely to local conditions rather than euro area-wide travails. In our most interesting finding, the expansion of the euro actually helped to dampen local market volatility in the post-crisis period in the founding member states, while euro adoption quelled volatility both pre- and post-crisis for non-founding members.
F36|The True Size of the ECB: New Insights from National Central Bank Balance Sheets|The balance sheet of the European Central Bank (ECB) represents a very small fraction (onetenth) of the reported balance sheet of the Euro Area system as a whole. This paper presents evidence that the effective size of the ECB’s balance sheet is massively higher than this, and indeed is significantly higher even than the reported balance sheet of the Eurosystem as a whole. We point to strong evidence that most NCBs (especially those of the larger countries) effectively act on autopilot, as branches of a near-monolithic institution which we term the “Mega-ECB”. The lending behaviour of the “Mega-ECB” appears to have been driven primarily by the borrowing needs of the distressed countries of the EU’s southern periphery.
F36|Estimating the contagion effect through the portfolio channel using a network approach|This work studies the contagion risk through the portfolio investment channel using network analysis and simulation on cross-country bilateral data. The importance of the portfolio channel in the transmission of financial shocks reflects the high interconnectedness of the global financial system, which diminished in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, but has resumed in recent years. The network representing cross-country portfolio investments turns out to be highly concentrated around the main financial centres, which act as global hubs connecting nodes that are not directly linked. Using a network simulation model based on the assumption that international investors rebalance their portfolios after an idiosyncratic shock, reducing investments in countries they are overexposed to, we find that contagion effects may be significant even when the shock originates in a peripheral country. In addition, the model suggests contagion risk has risen since the global financial crisis, owing to the increasing centralization of the portfolio investment network and the greater financial integration of emerging economies.
F36|Looking through cross-border positions in investment funds: evidence from Italy|Motivated by the increasingly large weight of foreign investment funds on the portfolio of Italian residents, this paper provides an estimate of the composition, by instrument and by issuer country, of Italy’s portfolio assets after “looking through” cross-border positions in investment funds. Our main findings suggest that removing the statistical opacity arising from cross-border positions in investment funds has a significant impact on the composition of Italy’s portfolio investments. After “looking through” foreign funds’ holdings, the share of debt securities on portfolio assets, which is equal to 40 per cent in the unadjusted data, rises to 75 per cent. The country composition of external portfolio assets also fundamentally changes in the direction of increasing its geographical diversification. The United States becomes Italy’s main destination country; the shares of France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain also increase, while that of Luxembourg, where most of the foreign investment funds are domiciled, drastically falls.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F36|Unwinding external stock imbalances? The case of Italy’s net international investment position|This paper is a case study of an (almost complete) adjustment of Italy’s external stock imbalance. After reaching a peak of around 25 per cent of GDP in early 2014, Italy’s net external debtor position has steadily decreased, reaching less than 7 per cent of GDP at the end of 2017. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, it reviews the main developments in Italy’s net international investment position (NIIP) since 1999. Second, it reports a baseline projection of Italy’s NIIP over a medium-term horizon, as implied by current account balance forecasts. Since this projection ignores the role of valuation adjustments, the study also provides an analysis of their sensitivity to a set of potential movements in exchange rates and equity or bond markets.
F36|Exchange Rates and the Working Capital Channel of Trade Fluctuations|Global value chains (GVCs) figure prominently in global trade and lie at the intersection of two important themes. The first is the financing requirement for working capital. The second is the prevalence of dollar invoicing in global trade.
F36|Firms' credit risk and the onshore transmission of the global financial cycle|We investigate the role of firms' credit risk in the onshore transmission of international bond market conditions. We show that reductions in the global price of risk, measured by the excess bond premium, encourage more international bond borrowing by smaller and younger firms. Due to informational asymmetries, these firms pay a higher credit spread. Thus their funding costs, and consequently their international borrowing, are more tightly linked to the global price of risk. The funds borrowed in response to favourable market conditions cause their balance sheets to deteriorate; over a three-year horizon, leverage increases, in support of capital expenditure, and cash holdings increase. Our results reveal a micro-level link between rising global risk appetite and the gradual build-up of domestic vulnerabilities.
F36|The cross-border credit channel and lending standards surveys|This paper argues that a measure of lending conditions - Senior Loan Officer (SLO) surveys - offers important insights into the monetary transmission mechanism. Using a Global VAR (GVAR) and SLO survey data from 16 countries, we document bank lending standards' significant role in explaining the dynamics of domestic credit conditions. Changes in lending attitudes lead to spillovers of financial conditions to other advanced and emerging market economies. We also examine the interaction of unconventional monetary policies (UMPs) and lending attitudes by using an external high frequency instrument. Looking through this lens of UMPs, we see that expansionary monetary policy led to a lowering of domestic credit standards which amplified the impact of the initial monetary stimulus. However, we also find evidence that the need to resort to UMPs also brought about a decline in lending demand, raising questions about whether the signaling channel of monetary policy unintentionally worked at cross purposes by sapping the full effectiveness of these policies. The varied experiences in the United States and euro area draw attention to the relative importance of bank intermediation in determining the strength of the bank lending channel of monetary policy.
F36|Financial Globalization and Bank Lending: The Limits of Domestic Monetary Policy?|We empirically analyze how bank lending reacts to monetary policy in the presence of global financial flows. Employing a unique and novel dataset of the funding modes and currency composition of the full population of Norwegian banks in structurally identified regressions, we show that the efficiency of the bank lending channel is affected when banks can shift to international funding and thus insulate their costs of funding from domestic monetary policy. We isolate the effect of global factors from domestic monetary policy by focusing on the deviation of exchange rates from the prediction of (uncovered and covered) interest rate parity. The Norwegian banking sector represents an ideal laboratory since the exogenous exchange rate dynamics allows for a convincing identification of the relation between lending and global factors.
F36|Why exports adjust: missing imported inputs or lack of credit?|This paper examines the role of imported intermediate inputs and credit constraints on exports adjustment. For identification, we study an episode of capital controls on outflows that exogenously restricted firms’ ability to pay for imports and the large-scale credit crunch that followed the imposition of controls in Greece in June 2015. Exploiting within-firm variation across sectors, we find that lack of imported inputs explains the drop in exports at the intensive margin, while lack of long-term credit is associated with adjustments at the extensive margin. Multinationals overcome liquidity constraints because of access to parents’ internal funds, but not import constraints because of stronger linkages for specialized inputs abroad. Our findings point to a novel result: the importance of both channels – real and finance – in jointly determining trade adjustment, and the different implications for the margins of trade

F36|Reduced cross-border lending and financing costs of SMEs|This paper investigates how the withdrawal of banks from their cross-border business impacted the borrowing costs of European firms since the crisis. We combine aggregate information on total and cross-border credit with firm-level survey data for the period 2010–2014. We find that the decline in cross-border lending led to a deterioration in the borrowing conditions of small firms. In countries with more pronounced reductions in cross-border credit inflows, the likelihood of a rise in firms’ external financing costs increased. This result is mainly driven by the interbank channel, which plays a crucial role in transmitting shocks to the real sector across borders.

F36|Skewed Credit and Growth Dynamics after the Global Financial Crisis|A large empirical literature finds that financial development is beneficial for economic growth, although some recent evidence suggests otherwise. We contribute to the finance–growth literature by examining the role of credit growth skewness and long-run growth. Earlier literature found that credit growth skewness is negatively associated with economic growth. We revisit this relationship using a large and recent panel dataset that encompasses Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economies and the impact of the global financial crisis. While our results reconfirm an association between credit skewness and growth, the relationship is more nuanced than previously thought. We find that the beneficial effects from lower skewness—systemic financial risks—were evident only prior to 2000. Our findings help explain why boom–bust dynamics were positively associated with economic growth in emerging markets in the past and why the growth of advanced economies has been sluggish since the global financial crisis.
F36|Is Panama Really Your Tax Haven? Secrecy Jurisdictions and the Countries They Harm|Secrecy jurisdictions provide services that enable the residents of other countries to escape the laws and regulations of their home economies, evade tax, or hide their legally or illegally obtained assets. Recent offshore leaks offer only a limited and biased view of the world of financial secrecy. In this paper we quantify which secrecy jurisdictions provide secrecy to which countries and assess how successful countries are in targeting these jurisdictions with their policies. To that objective we develop the Bilateral Financial Secrecy Index (BFSI) and estimate it for 86 countries by quantifying the financial secrecy supplied to them by up to 100 secrecy jurisdictions. We then evaluate two major recent policy efforts by comparing them with the results of the BFSI. First, we focus on the blacklisting process of the European Commission and find that most of the important secrecy jurisdictions for EU member states have been identified by the lists. Second, we link the results to data on active bilateral automatic information exchange treaties to assess how well-aimed are the policymakers’ limited resources. We argue that while low-secrecy jurisdictions’ gains are maximized if a large share of received secrecy is covered by automatic information exchange, tax havens aim not to activate these relationships with countries to which they supply secrecy. Our results show that so far, some major secrecy jurisdictions successfully keep their most prominent relationships uncovered by automatic information exchange, and activating these relationships may thus be an effective tool to curb secrecy.

F36|Official debt restructurings and development|Despite the frequency of official debt restructurings, little systematic evidence has been produced on their characteristics and implications. Using a dataset covering more than 400 Paris Club agreements, this paper fills that gap. It provides a comprehensive description of the evolving characteristics of these operations and studies their impact on debtors. The progressive introduction of new terms of treatment gradually turned the Paris Club from an institution primarily concerned with preserving creditors’ claims into an instrument to foster development in the world’s poorer nations, among other objectives. Our study finds that more generous restructuring conditions involving nominal relief are associated with an acceleration of per capita GDP growth and with a reduction in poverty and inequality. We also find that countries receiving nominal relief tend to receive lower aid flows subsequently, the opposite being the case for countries receiving high reductions in the net present value of their obligations, but no nominal haircuts.
F36|Cross-Border Bank Flows and Monetary Policy|We analyze the impact of monetary policy on bilateral cross-border bank flows using the BIS Locational Banking Statistics between 1995 and 2014. We find that monetary policy in the source countries is an important determinant of cross-border bank flows. In addition, we find evidence in favor of a cross-border bank portfolio channel. As relatively tighter monetary conditions in source countries erode the net worth and collateral values of domestic borrowers, banks reallocate their claims toward safer foreign counterparties. The cross-border reallocation of credit is more pronounced for banks in source countries with weaker financial sectors, which are likely to be more risk averse. Lastly, the reallocation is directed toward borrowers in safer countries, such as advanced economies or economies with an investment grade sovereign rating. By highlighting the effect of domestic monetary policy on foreign credit, this study enhances our understanding of the monetary policy transmission mechanism through global banks.
F36|Sovereign - bank risk interconnections during the Greek financial crisis and the role of the Italian debt|The Greek crisis has brought to light the strong nexus between the credit risks of European banks and their sovereign. We study this phenomenon in Germany, France, Italy and Spain by estimating the conditional correlations between sovereign and bank CDS bond spreads over the period 2006-2015. A trivariate time-varying regime switching correlation analysis, the STCC-GARCH, is implemented to associate the state shifts to the dynamics of the so-called â€œtransition variableâ€ . We start selecting as transition variable the first difference of the spread between Greek and German sovereign bond yields. We then expand the model â€“ via a DSTCC-GARCH parameterization - and introduce a second transition variable, representing the influence of the Italian sovereign debt. There is a clear evidence of significant changes in the correlations structure due to the evolution of the Greek crisis and to the sustainability of the Italian debt, which in turns impinges on the tenability of the euro project. The role of Italy on the nexuses of France and Germany increases after 2011.
F36|Towards a Marxist theory of financialised capitalism|In the rapid growth of the literature on financialisation, the term risks becoming meaningless (‘take x, add finance’). This contribution first reviews this literature, highlighting characteristic empirical features at the macroeconomic level and their variegation across different institutional contexts, then turning to meso- and micro-level multidisciplinary studies of how processes of financialisation have manifest in the transformed behaviour of firms, states and households, as well as in the changing mode of provision of public services and the appropriation of the commons. Marxist attempts to theorize the essences of financialisation are examined and found wanting. Two proposals are made in the spirit of advancing this project. First, financialisation as cyclical process must be disentangled from financialised capitalism as secular stage. Second, it is argued that the emergence of financialised capitalism as a new stage within mature capitalism is linked with the central role played by finance in the internationalisation of the circuit of production.
F36|Divergence between the core and the periphery and secular stagnation in the Eurozone|In this paper, we provide empirical evidence about the widening divergence between the macroeconomic performances of core eurozone countries and peripheral economies. We note that, while core economies operate close to full employment, there are evident signs of secular stagnation, i.e. widespread long-term unemployment and reduced growth potential, in the periphery. In such a context, we stress that the unconventional monetary policy implemented by the European Central Bank since 2015 has proved largely ineffective to stimulate investment demand and economic recovery in the periphery. More than this, it may even deepen the existing gap between core and peripheral countries. We suggest that a reform of EU industrial policy, which put emphasis on the productive development of underdeveloped regions in the euro area, stands out as the best strategy against the eurozone core-periphery divide and for improving the functioning and effectiveness of EU macro policies.
F36|Influence of regional cycles and personal background on FOMC members’ preferences and disagreement|This paper sheds some new light on the determinants of FOMC members’ monetary policy preferences. For that purpose, we use a new dataset of macroeconomic indicators for the Fed districts, as well as preferences revealed by FOMC members in the Transcripts, to compute a desired interest rate for each individual member. First, we find that FOMC members react to the regional unemployment rate. Second, individuals holding a Master or Bachelor degree, and issued from either the central bank, or from the private or public sector have a higher propensity to disagree on the dovish side, while women tend to disagree on the hawkish side. These findings provide further insights for central bank watchers about the upcoming policy decisions that are likely to be implemented by the FOMC, following the composition of its committee and the evolution of regional cycles.
F36|Assessing the sustainability of external imbalances in the European Union|We assess the sustainability of the current account (CA) balance, net international investment position (NIIP) and net external debt (NED) in a sample of 22 EU countries using two complementary approaches. First, we employ time‐series stationarity tests of current account balance‐to‐GDP ratios as well as cointegration tests of exports and imports of goods and services. Second, we assess the level of trade balance that stabilises the NIIP and the NED. We find that there is sustainability of the CA balance in eight countries, NIIP in five countries and NED in 10 countries, whereas there is evidence of a lack of sustainability in five debtor nations and three creditor nations. Both approaches are consistent with each other given the relationship between flows and stocks, the existence of structural breaks, and valuation effects via exchange rate and interest rate changes.
F36|Quel impact de la libéralisation du compte capital sur le développement financier en Tunisie ? Les enseignements d'un modèle ARDL|On s’intéresse dans cet article à l’impact de la libéralisation du compte capital sur le développement financier en Tunisie, sur la période 1986-2014. En s’appuyant sur un modèle ARDL on estime les effets de court terme et de long terme des principaux déterminants du développement financier. Les résultats confirment en particulier l’existence d’une relation de cointégration/long terme qui lie positivement le développement financier au PIB par tête, à l’ouverture commerciale et à l’ouverture du compte capital, et négativement au taux d’inflation et à la mauvaise gouvernance/corruption Ces conclusions sont largement confirmées par des tests de robustesse qui reposent en premier lieu sur des méthodes d’estimation différentes (DOLS et FMOLS), et en second lieu sur une mesure alternative de l’ouverture du compte capital/financière (mesure de jure de Chinn et Ito, 2008). This paper addresses the empirical question of whether capital account openness/financial liberalization can help explain financial development in Tunisia over the 1986-2014 period. Various estimates were made by the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model. Estimates show that the positive effect of capital account opening on financial development is much more important in the long term than in the short term, and these positive effects surpass those obtained for trade openness. Moreover, the results confirm the negative impact of corruption on the Tunisian financial system. Complementarily, robustness tests are realized. They confirm our previous results, on one side with DOLS and FMOLS alternative methods and on other side with an alternative measure of capital account openness proposed by Chinn and Ito (2008).
F36|The responses of BRICS Equities to China's Slowdown: A Multi-Scale Causality Analysis|Growth in China has been slowing in 2015 below its long-run average. This worsening outlook has been synchronized among emerging markets with sharp slowdown. The paper looks at the responses of four BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa) stock markets to deepening worries over slowing growth in the world’s second-largest economy. To properly examine the peculiarities of these spillovers, we carry out relatively new methods that rise in signal theory: the causality testing-based Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and the frequency domain causality test. These techniques allow capturing hidden factors driving uncertainty spillovers within BRICS stock markets. The results support robust evidence that the severity of China’s slowdown impact was not uniform across BRICS equities. In particular, South Africa hasn’t been rattled as badly as Brazil, Russia and India (in this order). The intensity of bilateral trade and investment relationships, the position of market in terms of regulation and securities exchanges, the financial system efficiency, the gold’s role as safest haven and the distribution of companies belonging to cyclical and defensive industries in overall stock market indices have been put forward to explain the heterogeneous BRICS responses.
F36|Time varying integration amongst the South Asian equity markets: An empirical study| In this paper, we examine the dynamic nature of equity market integration for the South Asian countries. The daily data for local equity indices are used from 6 January 2004 to 31 March 2015. Copula GARCH models and Diebold and Yilmaz methodology have been employed to study the inter-temporal process of equity market integration. Empirical results show that the sample countries of the region exhibit very little or no levels of integration between them. Equity portfolio flows within the South Asian region reconfirms this trend for low integration in the region. Further, trend analysis of the fundamental determinants of financial integration for the SAARC countries was performed and the same was compared with its neighbouring regional economic bloc in Asia i.e. ASEAN + 6. It indicated that SAARC countries have to show sincere political commitment and require collaboration in efforts of policy realignment to work on their governance parameters, improve on their trade linkages and trade tariffs and develop their equity market infrastructure to achieve higher levels of financial integration. The paper contributes to the International Finance literature, especially dealing with regional economic blocs and has important implications for policy-makers, portfolio managers and academia.
F36|Non-linear pattern of international capital flows|Abstract In a two-country OLG model with interest rate wedges capturing financial frictions, international capital flows can follow a non-linear pattern, depicted as a U-shaped curve, by first decreasing and then increasing in growth. The turning point of the curve is determined by the world average growth rate and these interest rate wedges. The model developed in this paper can reconcile different theories (i.e, the implications of the neoclassical growth model, up-hill capital flows, and the allocation puzzle) on the pattern of international capital flows.
F36|Guaranteed Success? The Effects of Export Credit Guarantees on Firm Performance|Many countries offer government-backed export credit guarantees to domestic firms. We investigate the effects of such guarantees on firm exports, jobs and value added. Using uniquely detailed and exhaustive transaction-level panel data on guarantees and granular information on trade as well as on exporters and foreign-buyers, we perform difference-in-difference matching estimations. We find that guarantees improve firm performance. However, the effects are strikingly heterogeneous across firm size and response variables. Using guarantees increases the firm-destination probability to export and the value of exports by 18 and 172 percent, respectively, but does not generally increase jobs and value added. Smaller firms benefit the most in terms of exports. Overall, the evidence suggests a causal link from guarantees to firm export performance.

F36|Capital inflows, equity issuance activity, and corporate investment|This paper uses issuance-level data to study how equity capital inflows that enter emerging market economies affect equity issuance and corporate investment. It shows that foreign inflows are strongly correlated with country-level issuance. The relation especially reflects the behavior of large firms, defined as those with large market value of equity. To identify supply-side shocks, capital inflows into each country are instrumented with exogenous changes in other countries'attractiveness to foreign investors. Shifts in the supply of foreign capital are important drivers of increased equity inflows. Instrumented contemporaneous and lagged capital inflows lead large firms to raise new equity, which they use to fund investment. The results indicate that inflows imply more than a transfer of equity ownership from domestic to foreign investors. Foreign purchases of equity have financial and real consequences for firms.
F36|Debt Overhang, Rollover Risk, and Corporate Investment: Evidence from the European Crisis|We quantify the role of financial factors that have contributed to sluggish investment in Europe in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 crisis. Using a big data approach, we match the firms to their banks based on banking relationships in 8 European countries over time, obtaining over 2 million observations. We document four stylized facts. First, the decline in investment in the aftermath of the crisis can be linked to higher leverage, increased debt service, and having a relationship with a weak bank-once we condition on aggregate demand shocks. Second, the relation between leverage and investment depends on the maturity structure of debt: firms with a higher share of long-term debt have higher investment rates relative to firms with a lower share of long-term debt since the rollover risk for the former is lower and the latter is higher. Third, the negative effect of leverage is more pronounced when firms are linked to weak banks, i.e., banks with high exposure to sovereign risk. Firms with higher shares of short-term debt decrease investment more relative to firms with lower shares of short-term debt even both set of firms linked to weak banks. This result suggests that loan evergreening by weak banks played a limited role in increasing investment. Fourth, the direct negative effect of weak banks on the average firm's invest- ment disappears once demand shocks are controlled for, although the differential effects with respect to leverage and the maturity of debt remain.
F36|International Spillovers and ‘Ex-ante’ Efficient Bailouts|We study how cross-country macroeconomic spillovers caused by sovereign default affect equilibrium bailouts. Because of portfolio diversification, the default of one country causes a macroeconomic contraction also in other countries. This generates a self-interest for these other countries to bailout the defaulting country. A novel insight of the paper is that bailouts could be efficient not only ex-post (after the debt has been issued) but also ex-ante (before the issuance of the debt). Although anticipated bailouts create the typical moral hazard problem leading countries to issue more debt, this may correct for the under issuance of public debt that would result from the lack of cross-country policy coordination.
F36|What are the consequences of global banking for the international transmission of shocks?: a quantitative analysis|The global financial crisis of 2008 was followed by a wave of regulatory reforms that affected large banks, especially those with a global presence. These reforms were reactive to the crisis. In this paper we propose a structural model of global banking that can be used proactively to perform counterfactual analysis on the effects of alternative regulatory policies. The structure of the model mimics the US regulatory framework and highlights the organizational choices that banks face when entering a foreign market: branching versus subsidiarization. When calibrated to match moments from a sample of European banks, the model is able to replicate the response of the US banking sector to the European sovereign debt crisis. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that pervasive subsidiarization, higher capital requirements, or ad hoc policy interventions would have mitigated the effects of the crisis on US lending.
F36|The internationalization of the Renminbi and the evolution of China’s monetary policy|This paper explores the evolution of monetary policy in the context of the distinct path China and the PBoC have adopted in fostering the international role of the renminbi. Instead of focusing on the PBoC’s negotiation of the impossible trinity of flexible exchange rates, capital mobility and independent monetary policy, the paper highlights the challenges the PBoC faces as it promotes the use renminbi, in international lending in particular, while simultaneously seeking to contain and discipline the inherent instability and potentially disruptive logic of finance.
F36|Financial Globalisation and Economic Growth in South Asia|The paper examines the relationship between financial globalization and growth. While the existing literature suggests divergent conclusions and mostly in the case of de-veloped countries, there is dearth of such studies in the case of developing countries, and South Asia is not an exception. Here, an attempt has been made to study the relationship between financial globalization and growth in seven South Asian countries namely Bhu-tan, Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Following the framework suggested by Bekaert et al. (2005) and with the help of Panel VAR and Panel causality (in GMM framework) models, the study concludes that the causation from financial globalization to growth in the region appears to be weak. Rather there appears a reverse causation running from growth to financial globalization. This suggests that it is the domestic macroeconomic policies (fiscal prudence, strong domestic financial sector and better growth policies) that act as pull factors for foreign capital. At the individual country level, the results are found to be divergent. The study finds that output growth appears to cause financial globalization in countries such as India, Paki-stan, Maldives, and Nepal. However, in countries such as Sri Lanka and Bhutan, it clearly suggests that foreign capital has a significant positive impact on output growth. In Bang-ladesh, the impact seems to be through indirect channel, where foreign capital seems to have disciplining impact on domestic financial markets, which in turn causes output growth. Similar indirect channel is found in the case of Sri Lanka and this is in addition to the direct channel of financial globalization causing growth.
F36|Building a stronger and more integrated Europe|Europe’s economy is finally growing robustly. These positive developments provide an opportunity to renew efforts to meet the long-term challenges facing the European Union (EU). The EU’s record on reducing regional income disparities is mixed and this explains some of citizens’ discontent with the European project. Reforming cohesion policy by focusing spending more on items with long-term growth benefits and clear spillovers across borders, including human capital and infrastructure investment could further support income convergence. Higher co-funding rates and less burdensome administration of the cohesion and structural funds could encourage greater spending effectiveness. Sustained improvements in living standards are held back by weak productivity and investment in many countries. Reviving the single market project, by removing remaining barriers in services, energy, digital and transport can help to spur long-term growth. Deepening the single market and faster adoption of digital technologies will create new jobs but put at risk others, perhaps in lagging regions. The EU can help lagging regions catch up by reforming cohesion policy and facilitating firm creation through the removal of barriers across the single market. It can also support better those who lose out from globalisation and are displaced by technological change by making access to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund easier and broadening its scope not only to help workers displaced by globalisation or an economic crisis, but also due to other reasons such as automation. This Working Paper relates to the 2018 OECD Economic Survey of the European Union. (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-european-union-and-euro-area.htm)
F36|Assessing the extent of contagion of sovereign credit risk among BRICS countries|This paper contributes to the literature of sovereign credit risk contagion by conducting a counterfactual analysis on credit risk spillovers among BRICS countries. The conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR) methodology is used to this end. Moreover, the paper makes use of the generalised forecast error decomposition to assess the contribution of state variables in the CoVaR of each of the BRICS countries conditioned by China, the biggest economies of the BRICS. The findings of this paper show that credit risk distress in China affects the most all countries sovereign credit risk in the BRICS grouping. Moreover, the channel through which credit risk distress in China affect other BRICS country is not homogenous.
F36|International Capital Flows in Club of Convergence|We explain U-shape pattern of international capital inflows by one multi-country OLG economy and one cross-section data sample. The theory proves that capital inflows are decreasing on distance to frontier, which is measured by ratio of domestic productivity level over United States’ level. The evidences not only confirm the theory but also reveal that growth is decreasing on distance to frontier for club of convergence but increasing for club of unconvergence. Therefore, Neo-Classical growth model’s implication, that capital inflows are positively correlated to growth, applies for club of convergence. However, Allocation puzzle, that capital inflows are negatively correlated to growth, works for club of unconvergence. The turning point of U-shape pattern is the productivity growth rate at world technology frontier.
F36|Efectos de desbordamiento sobre los mercados financieros de Colombia. Identificación a través de la heterocedasticidad<BR>[Spillovers effects on financial markets of Colombia. Identification through heteroskedasticity]|La investigación cuantifica y analiza los efectos de los choques originados en los mercados estadounidenses sobre los principales mercados financieros colombianos. Para cumplir con este objetivo se emplea la información diaria de los mercados de dinero, bonos, acciones y tipo de cambio entre Colombia y EE.UU. durante el periodo de Enero 2003 y Enero 2015. La metodología utilizada es un modelo VAR estructural que emplea la heterocedasticidad que existe en los datos para la identificación y la estimación de los coeficientes de transmisión financiera. Se encuentra que los mercados estadounidenses generan efectos overall spillovers significativos sobre el mercado accionario colombiano. A su vez, los resultados reflejan la posición dominante del mercado de bonos estadounidenses como el motor de los efectos de desbordamiento.
F36|Economic regimes and stock market performance in Nigeria: Evidence from regime switching model|The paper analyzes volatility spillover between exchange rate and stock market in “turbulent” and “calm”, otherwise, “bull” and “bear” periods in the Nigerian stock market from 1st January, 2010 to 31st December, 2017 using a regime heteroskedastic Markov switching model in line with Kim (1993). The approach allows regime shift in both mean and variance of a series where failure to allow for regime shift leads to an overstatement of persistence of the variance, Lamoureuex and Lastrapes (1990). Results from preliminary investigations reveal that both stock returns and exchange rate series are characterized with non- normal distribution, presence of unit root and ARCH effects. Further, evidence of two regimes, that is, bear and bull markets, was established with higher persistence, that is, high transition probabilities, in the bear as against the bull market at 0.9455 and 0.8686, respectively. However, duration of stay in the regime is higher in the bull market (regime 2) than in the bear market (regime 1) at 5958.12 days and 18.406 days, respectively. Further, analysis of volatility spillover between exchange rate and stock returns reveals that returns increases due to appreciation in the exchange rate in the bear market and diminishes in response to exchange rate depreciation in the bull market. Thus, adverse economic conditions leading to exchange rate volatility diminishes stock market returns by increasing investors’ risk perception, especially in the bull market. No doubt, the findings are important to investors, regulators and monetary authorities.
F36|An FDI-driven approach to measuring the scale and economic impact of BEPS|This paper explores the link between foreign direct investment (FDI) and the BEPS (base erosion and profit shifting) practices of multinationals (MNEs). It puts the spotlight on the outsize role of offshore investment hubs as major players in global corporate investment, a role that is largely due to MNEs’ tax planning, although other factors contribute. The paper shows that tax avoidance practices enabled by FDI through offshore hubs are responsible for significant leakage of development financing resources. In policy terms, these findings call for enhanced cooperation and synergies between international tax and investment policymaking.
F36|Euro area sovereign yield spreads as determinants of private sector borrowing costs|We regress long-term private sector interest rates on a money market rate, a term premium and credit risk. As a contribution to the current debate about European safe assets, our interest is in quantifying domestic spillover effects from euro area sovereign bond spreads. Panel estimates show significant, albeit rather small long-run effects. Our findings indicate large cross-country differences but no evidence that the effect has become stronger over time. Using linear country-specific estimates, we find the effect to be significant in only some countries, the size of the maximum effect exceeding the average one more than three-fold. For one country, we also find a highly significant asymmetrical effect with positive spread changes having greater impact on private-sector borrowing costs than negative ones. Overall, we conclude that contagion costs in the euro area are substantial and will remain so until an effective form of European safe assets is created.
F36|“Together forever? Good and bad market volatility shocks and international consumption risk sharing: A tale of a sign”|Recent literature has shown that international financial integration facilitates cross-country consumption risk sharing. We extend this line of research and demonstrate that the decomposition of financial integration into good and bad plays an important role. We also propose new measures of countries’ capital market integration, based on good and bad volatility shocks, as well as country specific indices of consumption risk sharing. We document a decoupling of individual consumption growth from global risk sharing after episodes of negative cross-spillovers, and a recoupling after positive spillovers. Our results support current views in the literature that advocate for an asymmetric treatment of good and bad volatility shocks, in order to assess the macroeconomic dynamics that follow risk episodes. They also challenge previous views in the literature that present capital market integration (without differentiating between positive and negative shocks) as a prerequisite for higher international consumption risk sharing. Overall, they cast doubts on the actual scope for consumption risk sharing across global financial markets.
F36|Capital Account Liberalization and the Composition of Bank Liabilities|Using a sample of almost 600 banks in Latin America, we show that capital account liberalization lowers the share of equity and raises the share of interbank funding in total liabilities of the consolidated banking system. These shifts are mostly due to large banks; smaller banks, instead, increase their resort to retail funding by offering higher average de- posit interest rates than larger banks. We also find significant differences in the behavior of foreign banks and of banks with seemingly greater information opacity. These findings have positive implications for macro-prudential regulation.
F36|The KOF Globalisation Index â€“ Revisited|In this paper we present and describe the revised version of the KOF Globalisation Index, a composite index measuring globalisation for every country in the world along the economic, social and political dimension. The original index was introduced by Dreher (2006) and updated in Dreher et al. (2008). This second revision of the index introduces the differentiation between de facto and de jure measures along the different dimensions of globalisation, the differentiation between trade and financial globalisation within the economic dimension of globalisation and time-varying weighting of the variables entering the index. Finally, the revised version incorporates several additional variables in the construction process. At the aggregate level, we show that a bidirectional relationship between de facto and de jure globalisation exists.
F36|Capital market imperfections and trade liberalization in general equilibrium|This paper develops a new international trade model with firm-specific credit frictions and endogenous borrowing costs in general equilibrium. We highlight new implications of globalization when general equilibrium effects on capital markets are present. In particular, we show that globalization increases the share of financially constrained firms and affects producers very differently depending on their exposure to credit frictions. While the positive effect of globalization dominates for unconstrained firms, higher borrowing costs and tougher competition especially hurt credit-rationed producers. We show that these new adjustments increase the heterogeneity among firms and reduce welfare gains from trade. Our theory is consistent with new empirical patterns from World Bank firm-level data. We show that credit frictions are positively related to the degree of product competition and to the variance of sales across firms.
F36|Smooth Breaks And Nonlinear Mean Reversion In Real Interest Parity: Evidence From East Asian Countries|This study aims to explore the empirical validity of the real interest rate parity (RIP) hypothesis for East Asian countries using Japan as the base country. To this end, we employ the recently proposed unit root tests of Christopoulos and Leon-Ledesma (2010) that account for both multiple smooth structural breaks of unknown form and nonlinear mean reversion in the series. Our empirical results uncover overwhelming evidences in favor of the RIP hypothesis for the whole countries in our sample. More specifically, through a Fourier approximation, it is observed that all real interest rate differentials display a mean reverting behavior around an infrequently smooth-breaking mean, with the breaks being in accordance with the financial reforms and economic crises witnessed by the countries. Moreover, the degree of mean reversion appears to vary nonlinearly with the size of real interest rate appreciations and depreciations.
F36|The impact of market structure of the banking sector on the growth of bank loans in the EU after the global financial crisis|The aim of this research is to investigate the issue of asymmetry of the credit market determinants of bank loans (corporate, consumer, and residential mortgage loans) between the CEE-11 countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Rumania) and the other countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg, Germany, Portugal, Sweden, United Kingdom, Malta, and Cyprus) after the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2007–09. For the analysis, we used annual bank-level data, which are collected from the Bankscope-Orbis database and interest rates for different loans from the European Central Bank and macroeconomic data on GDP growth. Panel data includes commercial banks, savings banks, and cooperative banks that were operating in the EU countries from the period 2010–2016. Using the methodology of panel regression, this study finds differences of the determinants of the growth of loans for two groups of countries after the global financial crisis. Panel data analysis of CEE-11 countries against other EU countries also finds differences between determinants of different types of bank loans.
F36|What drove the corporate bond markets in Asia after 1995?|We investigate the development of corporate bond markets in 10 Asian countries from 1995 to 2014. Using data on outstanding value and total issue of bonds by financial and non-financial companies, we confirm that macroeconomic and institutional factors are related to the depth of the corporate bond market. We show that creditor rights and institutional quality are important in explaining the size of outstanding value and issuance of corporate bonds. Furthermore, we determine a strong positive association between the level of domestic credit and the outstanding value and issue of corporate bonds. From the results, we surmise that there is a positive relationship between the development of the corporate bond market and the banking sector. These findings indicate that increased demand for bank loans induced the issuance of bonds by financial institutions, which, in turn, might have led to the development of corporate bond markets in Asia. Finally, we document that the development of corporate bond markets might have helped mitigate the outcome of the financial crisis of 2008 in Asia.
F36|Disentangling euro area portfolios: new evidence on cross-border securities holdings|This paper presents a detailed set of new, quantity-based indicators of financial integration in the euro area. The indicators are based on granular data from securities holdings statistics and help us disentangle the main drivers of the portfolio changes observed since the financial crisis. Three key developments since the crisis stand out. First, we find that financial integration in equity is less than that in the debt market, although the equity market was the main contributor to the partial recovery in financial integration observed since mid-2012. Second, we observe a gradual shift in cross-border investment activity from the banking sector towards other non-bank financial entities. In particular, our results show that euro area banks significantly decreased their investment in debt securities issued by banks in other euro area countries and that this decrease explains around 55% of the decline in financial integration in the debt market observed since the crisis. Finally, we find that the sharp decrease in financial integration between 2009 and 2012 was mainly driven by foreign investor flight from government debt securities, a trend that has since reversed.

F36|Monetary policy and cross-border interbank market fragmentation: lessons from the crisis|We present a two-country model with an enhanced banking sector featuring risky lending and cross-border interbank market frictions. We find that (i) the strength of the financial accelerator, when applied to banks operating under uncertainty in an interbank market, will critically depend on the economic and financial structure of the economy; (ii) adverse shocks to the real economy can be the source of banking crisis, causing an increase in interbank funding costs, aggravating the initial shock; and (iii) asset purchases and central bank long-term refinancing operations can be effective substitutes for, or supplements to, conventional monetary policy.
F36|FH Puzzle in the Eurozone: A time-varying analysis Preliminary Draft|The aim of this paper is to reexamine the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle in a dynamic framework. We estimate a time-varying saving-investment relationship for a group of 17 countries panel, paying special attention to Eurozone members but including some relevant OECD countries as well for the period 1970-2016. The main advantage of our empirical approach is that it captures the dynamics of the FH coe_cient, highly consistent with increased _nancial integration. Global risk and country size are relevant elements to unpuzzle the savings-investment correlation. The inclusion of time-varying estimates reveal certain heterogeneity among EMU countries on the way and the circumstances under which their domestic investment would be constrained by savings retention.
F36|Asset Purchase Bailouts and Implicit Guarantees|This paper shows that bailouts of private agents can optimally take the form of asset purchases, even if this also means paying off external asset holders, in the presence of borrowing constraints and asymmetric information on liquidity needs. The combination of these two ingredients make direct compensation through loans and/or net transfers imperfect. Thus, when more constrained agents are also more exposed to the asset, the compensation through asset purchases becomes desirable. Anticipating these purchases, private agents engage in a collective bet on the defaulting asset, leading to an equilibrium implicit guarantee, where even an intrinsically worthless asset can be traded at a positive price.
F36|Explaining International Business Cycle Synchronization: Recursive Preferences and the Terms of Trade Channel|Abstract The business cycles of advanced economies are synchronized. Standard macro models fail to explain that fact. This paper presents a simple model of a two-country, two-traded-good, complete-financial-markets world in which country-specific productivity shocks generate business cycles that are highly correlated internationally. The model assumes recursive intertemporal preferences (Epstein-Zin-Weil), and a muted response of labor hours to household wealth changes (due to Greenwood-Hercowitz-Huffman period utility and demand-determined employment under rigid wages). Recursive intertemporal preferences magnify the terms of trade response to country-specific shocks. Hence, a productivity (and GDP) increase in a given country triggers a strong improvement of the foreign country’s terms of trade, which raises foreign labor demand. With a muted labor wealth effect, foreign labor and GDP rise, i.e. domestic and foreign real activity comove positively.
F36|Financial stability assessment of EU candidate and potential candidate countries|This paper reviews and assesses financial stability challenges in countries preparing for EU membership i.e. Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey. The paper focuses on the period since 2014 and on the banking sectors that dominate financial systems in this group of countries. It identifies two main near-term challenges applying to most of them. The first relates to credit risk, which remains substantial despite some progress in reducing the burden of non-performing loans on banks’ balance sheets in the period under review. However, progress so far is limited, partly owing to structural impediments. The second relates to the still high share of foreign exchange denominated loans and deposits, which poses an indirect credit risk in the case of lending to unhedged borrowers and impairs the monetary transmission channel. In addition, profitability is worth monitoring going forward, as it remains subdued in many countries given high provisioning needs and a lacklustre credit growth and low interest rate environment. These concerns are generally met with a solid shock-absorbing capacity, as exemplified by robust capital and liquidity buffers. JEL Classification: F31, F34, F36, G15, G21, G28
F36|Large net foreign liabilities of euro area countries|Over recent years, several euro area countries have registered large and persistent net foreign liabilities. This paper examines the risks arising from these external stock imbalances, the prospects for their smooth unwinding and the menu of policy options. The paper demonstrates that external stock imbalances remain a source of vulnerabilities in the (former) programme countries and, to a lesser extent, the euro area countries in central and eastern Europe. The net foreign liabilities of these economies stand at levels that are typically associated with an increased susceptibility to external crises. Mechanical projections indicate that the net foreign liabilities of the (former) programme countries will remain at elevated levels over the next decade despite some gradual adjustments, while those of the central and eastern European (CEE) countries could return to more sustainable levels more quickly. There are also vulnerabilities related to the composition of external positions, most notably the unfavourable debt-equity mix in the (former) programme countries. However, the long maturity of public external debt – which is often owed to official creditors – and, in the CEE countries, the prevalence of stable foreign direct investment should mitigate external sustainability risks. Furthermore, the net payments associated with the external positions of the euro area debtor countries are relatively low at the current juncture, although the burden could increase markedly if euro area interest rates were to normalise again. Against this backdrop, a timely and well-designed policy response would provide critical support to the orderly unwinding of the remaining external stock imbalances in the euro area. An optimal policy mix would consist of measures simultaneously fostering GDP growth and sustainable current account improvements in the debtor economies, in particular reforms aimed at enhancing productivity growth and export performance.

F36|Mercantilism and China's hunger for international reserves|This paper is motivated by the popular view that the surge in China's foreign exchange reserves is due to a distortionary exchange rate policy aimed at keeping the real exchange rate undervalued to support export-led growth. It undertakes an in-depth empirical investigation to quantify how much “mercantilist” and “precautionary” motives have contributed to the reserve build-up in China during 1998Q4-2011Q4. A substantial problem is that theory is consistent with employing two vastly differing approaches to defining and estimating the role of mercantilist reserve accumulation. A priori, either method could generate misleading results. The study shows, however, that the distinction between the two approaches is immaterial in China's case. The results suggest that mercantilism accounts for less than 10% of reserve accumulation. Precautionary motives and other factors seem to be the dominant determinants of the surge in China's international reserves.
F36|Bank lending, crises, and changing ownership structure in Central and Eastern European countries|We examine the interactions of bank lending dynamics, ownership structures, and crisis phenomena in the banking systems of Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. Using a panel dataset of more than 400 banks for the period from 1994–2010, we show that the impact of ownership structure on a bank’s lending activities in CEE countries was conditional upon the type of crisis, namely, whether it was a host, home, global, or simultaneous crisis. In contrast, our evidence indicates that bank-specific characteristics, such as deposit growth and profitability ratios, are significant determinants of credit growth during both normal economic times and crisis periods, regardless of the crisis type. Moreover, we provide indirect evidence of the benefits of banking sector diversification dependent upon the criterion of parent banks’ country of origin.
F36|The welfare gains from macro-insurance against natural disasters|This paper uses a dynamic optimization model to estimate the welfare gains that a small open economy can derive from insuring against natural disasters with catastrophe (CAT) bonds. We calibrate the model by reference to the risk of earthquakes, floods and storms in developing countries. We find that the countries most vulnerable to these risks would find it optimal to use CAT bonds for insurance if the cost of issuing these bonds were significantly smaller than it is in the data. The welfare gains from CAT bonds range from small to substantial depending on how insurance affects the country's external borrowing constraint. The option of using CAT bonds may bring a welfare gain of several percentage points of annual consumption by enhancing the country's ability to borrow. These large gains disappear if the country can opportunistically default on its external debt.
F36|How are Africa's emerging stock markets related to advanced markets? Evidence from copulas|The finance literature provides ample evidence that diversification benefits hinges on dependence between assets returns. A notable feature of the recent financial crisis is the extent to which assets that had hitherto moved mostly independently suddenly moved together resulting in joint losses in most advanced markets. This provides grounds to uncover the relative potential of African markets to provide diversification benefits by means of their correlation with advanced markets. Therefore, we examine the dependence structure between advanced and emerging African stock markets using copulas. Several findings are documented. First, dependence is time-varying and weak for most African markets, except South Africa. Second, we find evidence of asymmetric dependence, suggesting that stock return comovement varies in bearish and bullish markets. Third, extreme downward stock price movements in the advanced markets do not have significant spillover effects on Africa’s emerging stock markets. Our results, implying that African markets, with the exception of South Africa, are immune to risk spillover from advanced markets, improves the extant literature and have implications for portfolio diversification and risk management.
F36|The sources of contagion risk in a banking sector with foreign ownership|Foreign-dominated banking sectors, such as those prevalent in Central and Eastern Europe, are susceptible to two major sources of systemic risk: (i) linkages between local banks and (ii) linkages between a foreign parent bank and its local subsidiary. During and after the global financial crisis, the second source of risk has been stressed by local regulators. Using a nonparametric method based on extreme value theory, we analyze interdependencies in downward risk in the banking sectors of the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, and Turkey during 1994–2013. We find that the risk of contagion from a foreign parent bank to its local subsidiary is substantially smaller than the risk between two local banks.
F36|Trade creation, trade diversion and imbalances in the EMU|The aim of this paper is to provide a unified explanation for the mixed evidence on the euro effect on trade and the development of imbalances in the European Monetary Union (EMU). It is argued that the two phenomena are the result of trade creation and trade diversion effects generated by the euro introduction and by globalisation-induced changes in trade patterns. Trade creation and trade diversion effects are estimated as structural changes in the relation between trade flows and financial opening, growth, prices, and measures of globalization. While most of these effects point to the increase in imbalances, financial opening is found to positively affect intra-EMU trade. On the other hand, GDP growth and global changes in production technology reduced intra-EMU trade. The results suggest that policies aimed at rebalancing the EMU should be strengthened and supported by measures aimed at improving the competitiveness of the single market as a whole.
F36|Testing the dependency theory on small island economies: The case of Cyprus|This paper empirically tests the validity of dependency theory in the small island setting of Cyprus, to establish whether a periphery/patron relationship exists between each of the island's two economies and their respective mainland partners of Greece and Turkey. Using data for the 1978–2013 period, we first test for the necessary condition, i.e. whether there is a long-run cointegrating relationship in the economic development of the Republic of Cyprus (RC) and Greece, and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) and Turkey. We then test for the sufficient condition, i.e. whether periphery-economy per capita income series to be weakly endogenous, while those of patron economies are weakly exogenous. Our results indicate strong dependency within the periphery/patron economy pairs of the RC/Greece and the TRNC/Turkey. Further, we show that economic growth in the periphery economies is largely driven by that of the patron economies. Using a Markov-switching vector autoregressive (MS-VAR) model of the short-run business cycle, we demonstrate that the RC/Greece and the TRNC/Turkey co-move in the short-run, and that business cycles with each pair are synchronized. The policy implications of these findings are then discussed.
F36|Return and volatility spillovers effects: Evaluating the impact of Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect|This study investigates the impact of the recently introduced Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect. Using high frequency data and dynamic forecasting techniques, we find that the new Stock Connect does contribute to the increasing importance of the Chinese mainland stock market and economic activity. A weak and unstable cointegration relationship is found after this event. Additionally, the Stock Connect has also increased the conditional variance of both stock markets. We observe a leading role of the Shanghai stock market to the Hong Kong stock market in terms of both mean and volatility spillover effects after the Stock Connect. Our study indicates that the opening up of stock markets in China could enhance the leading power, influence the risk level and improve the market efficiency of the Chinese mainland stock market, since the volatility spillover effect from Shanghai to Hong Kong is strengthened. Besides, our results have important policy implications, especially on how policy makers should deal with the increased market interconnectedness and for portfolio managers in choosing potential hedging instruments. The success of Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect provides valuable operational experience for the forthcoming Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect which could further improve the market efficiency in China.
F36|Capital market liberalization: Optimal tradeoff and bargaining delay|Host and investing countries are faced with a tradeoff between growth and volatility arising from capital flows. The host country seeks capital inflows for high growth, yet worries about accompanying volatility so much that it limits capital market opening due to its financial weakness. However, the investing country solicits quick and safe returns from capital outflows by requesting wide foreign openness. It is often observed that one side’s push for opening encounters the other side’s reluctance. We examine how this conflict of interest is resolved for international compromise equilibrium through sequential bargaining between the two sides with private valuations of capital flows. We find that openness bargaining can end up with strategic delay after information revelation. This finding sheds light on certain puzzles in international finance.
F36|The home bias of the poor: Foreign asset portfolios across the wealth distribution|This paper documents how the share of foreign stocks in US household portfolios rises with the ratio of financial wealth to non-financial income. This is both because wealthier households are more likely to participate in foreign asset markets, and because portfolio shares of participants increase with financial wealth but decrease with non-financial income. A simple, standard two-country general equilibrium model shows that hedging of terms of trade movements and non-financial income risk produces non-trivial heterogeneity in portfolios across the wealth and income distribution within countries that is qualitatively in line with this evidence.
F36|Is the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle still with us? National saving-investment dynamics and international capital mobility: A panel data analysis across EU member countries|This paper investigates the degree of financial integration and international capital mobility by analysing the dynamics of national saving-investment relationships. We interpret the relationship between national saving and investment in the long run as reflecting a solvency constraint and focus on the short-term saving-investment relationship to assess the degree of capital mobility. We apply the Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (PARDL) model proposed by Pesaran et al. (1999) using data for 14 EU member countries from 1970 to 2013. Our empirical results suggest that there exists a close relationship between saving and investment in the long run that is consistent with the existence of a solvency constraint that is binding for each country in the long run. We also find that the parameter for the error-correction term is always highly significant, which supports the choice of an error-correction formulation. Moreover, we show that the parameter estimated for the error-correction term, i.e. the speed of adjustment to the long-run equilibrium, varies with the sample period considered. The estimated speed of adjustment becomes smaller in absolute terms as more recent data are included in the sample, which indicates that deviations from long- run equilibrium current accounts have become more persistent over time, signalling some degree of capital mobility.
F36|Bank productivity growth and convergence in the European Union during the financial crisis|This paper examines the bank productivity growth and integration process for the 28 EU countries during three main phases of the financial crisis: the U.S. subprime crisis (2007–2008), the global financial crisis (2009–2010) and the sovereign debt crisis (2010–2012). We extend the Malmquist Productivity Index by applying an additive two-stage DEA model. This allows us to explore the sources of growth in different stages of production. Furthermore, we assess the integration of European banks by analyzing the β-convergence and σ-convergence of the two-stage Productivity Index. Our results show a productivity growth during the U.S. subprime crisis, but a consistent decline during the global financial crisis. The loss of competitiveness of the European banking system is due to the drop in growth of the performance stage and technical change. Finally, we find a strong convergence pattern during the financial crisis, mainly driven by the catch up process of some Eastern countries and the drop in performance of Western countries.
F36|Central banks and macroeconomic policy choices: Relaxing the trilemma|Macroeconomic policy choices in open economies are constrained by the trilemma according to which the objectives of exchange rate stability, monetary independence and capital mobility cannot be attained jointly. This paper shows that foreign exchange interventions provide an effective instrument to relax the trilemma. An active reserve policy allows central banks to pursue independent monetary and exchange rate policies when the capital account is liberalised.
F36|Foreign bank subsidiaries' default risk during the global crisis: What factors help insulate affiliates from their parents?|This paper examines the association between the default risk of foreign bank subsidiaries in developing countries and their parents during the global financial crisis, with the purpose of determining the size and sign of this correlation and, more importantly, understanding what factors can help insulate affiliates from their parents. We find evidence of a significant and robust positive correlation between parent banks’ and foreign subsidiaries’ default risk. This correlation is lower for subsidiaries that have a higher share of retail deposit funding and that are more independently managed from their parents. Host country bank regulations are also associated with the extent to which shocks to the parents affect the subsidiaries’ default risk. In particular, the correlation between the default risk of subsidiaries and their parents is lower for subsidiaries operating in countries that impose higher capital, reserve, provisioning, and disclosure requirements, and tougher restrictions on bank activities.
F36|Cross-border mergers and acquisitions: The importance of local credit and source country finance|We study host and source country finance and the interplay between the two in determining the incidence and intensity of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) into the U.S. We find that states adopting interstate banking deregulation attract a greater number and higher total volume of cross-border M&A deals. We also document a positive impact of source country financial depth on the incidence of cross-border M&As and uncover a substitution effect between local and source country bank finance. The effects are larger for deals where cash is used as the method of payment as well as for firms that are more dependent on external finance, and smaller for publicly traded firms.
F36|European equity market integration and joint relationship of conditional volatility and correlations|We analyse the integration patterns of seven leading European stock markets from 1990 to 2013 using daily data and mismatched monthly macroeconomic data. To study the mismatch of data frequencies we use the DCC-MIDAS (Dynamic Conditional Correlation – Mixed Data Sampling) technique developed by Colacito, Engle and Ghysels (Journal of Econometrics, 2011). We benchmark European integration patterns against the German stock market. The reported integration patterns show a clear divide between large and (relatively) small equity markets' short run and long run return correlations: the small markets display higher short run European convergences than the large markets and vice versa. The across-the-board divergence from Greek risk, during the crisis period, is the most unambiguous conclusion of our study. During this period, cross-country joint relationships of conditional variances and return correlations – a ‘convergence of risks’ resulting in global/regional contagious spillovers – are typically positive. Only exceptions are the German stock market's joint relationships.
F36|The real effects of financial (dis)integration: A multi-country equilibrium analysis of Europe|Using data from 15 European Union economies, we quantify the real effects of supply-side frictions due to the financial disintegration of European countries since the 2008 financial crisis. We develop a multi-country general equilibrium model with heterogeneous countries and destination-specific financial frictions. Financial institutions allocate capital endogenously across countries, determining the cost of capital to firms and the wealth of nations. The cost of financial disintegration is reduced access to capital for firms which results in lower output. Financial disintegration leads to a 0.54% fall in output in Europe since the crisis. We also estimate benefits of further financial integration.
F36|Co-movement of Africa’s equity markets: Regional and global analysis in the frequency–time domains|This paper examines regional and global co-movement of Africa’s stock markets using the three-dimensional continuous Morlet wavelet transform methodology. The analyses which are done in segments investigate co-movements with global markets; bilateral exchange rates expressed in US dollars and euro; and four regional markets in Africa. First, we find evidence of stronger co-movements broadly narrowed to short-run fluctuations. The co-movements are time-varying and commonly non-homogeneous — with phase difference arrow vectors implying lead–lag relationships. The presence of lead–lag effects and stronger co-movements at short-run fluctuations may induce arbitrage and diversification opportunities to both local and international investors with long-term investment horizons. The findings also reveal that some African equity markets are, to a degree, segmented from volatilities of the dollar and euro exchange rates. Thus, inferring that, ceteris paribus, international investors may diversify their portfolio investments across those markets without worrying about the effects of currency price volatility.
F36|Tail dependence and information flow: Evidence from international equity markets|Bhatti and Nguyen (2012) used the copula approach to measure the tail dependence between a number of international markets. They observed that some country pairs exhibit only left-tail dependence whereas others show only right-tail. However, the flow of information from uni-dimensional (one-tail) to bi-dimensional (two-tails) between various markets was not accounted for. In this study, we address the flow of information of this nature by using the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC–GARCH) model. More specifically, we use various versions of the DCC models to explain the nexus between the information flow of international equity and to explain the stochastic forward vs. backward dynamics of financial markets based on data for a 15-year period comprising 3,782 observations. We observed that the information flow between the US and Hong Kong markets and between the US and Australian markets are bi-directional. We also observed that the DCC model captures a wider co-movement structure and inter-connectedness compared to the symmetric Joe–Clayton copula.
F36|Financial integration in small Islands: The case of Cyprus|The following paper assesses the degree to which two small island economies, the Republic of Cyprus (RC) and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), are financially integrated with their respective ‘motherlands’ of Greece and Turkey. Specifically, we investigate whether there is a long-run relationship between the RC and Greece and between the TRNC and Turkey, in terms of inflation, interest rates, money supply, and foreign direct investment (FDI). The paper contributes to the literature by examining financial integration in the unique case of Cyprus, where two separate, small economies each operate in a monetary union with their respective mainland partners. The results of our analysis indicate the strong integration of the financial markets of the TRNC and Turkey, and of the RC and Greece. We also demonstrate that financial-market indicators in the TRNC and the RC are largely driven by mainland-partner economies, further advancing the literature on financial integration.
