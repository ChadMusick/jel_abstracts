L63|The Personnel Requirements and Costs of New Military Space Organizations|In this report, CBO considers five ways in which the Department of Defense (DoD) might be reorganized to increase its focus on space. The Administration has proposed three of themâ€”creating a new military service within the Air Force, a new combatant command, and a new development agencyâ€”but has provided few details.
L63|Implementation of wampac security and stability improvement of power grids with systems|In this paper, due to the importance of extensive monitoring, protection and control systems as well as the importance of hybrid systems, both the AC and DC sectors have been attempted to make the implementation of the WAMPAC system more transparent to these types of networks. As a general rule, the main purpose of using extensive monitoring, protection and control systems is to consider the stability and security of power systems. Therefore, in this paper, the above principles are considered and, with respect to the sample network, the relevant strategies have been implemented, and the simulation results point to improving security and stability in the power grid.
L63|Peeling Away the Layers: Impacts of Durable Tariff Elimination|We demonstrate that durable MFN tariff elimination affects trade patterns through several layers, which generates non-linear impacts. First, complete tariff elimination results in a large additional trade gains over and above tariff reductions. Second, commitment to durable tariff elimination, through WTO bindings, further boosts both imports and exports of ITA members. The unique setting of the WTO Information Technology Agreement (ITA) allows us to identify these effects of non-discriminatory trade policies because (i) ITA constitutes a quasi-natural experiment as several “passive” signatories joined it as an unavoidable part of pursuing of a larger policy objective, and (ii) ITA's partial coverage of the IT sector provides a natural control group for cross-product identification. Commitments under the ITA spurned development of a downstream IT export sector in “passive” signatories.
L63|Peeling Away the Layers: Impacts of Durable Tariff Elimination|We demonstrate that durable MFN tariff elimination affects trade patterns through several layers, and magnitudes of effects are sizable. The WTO Information Technology Agreement’s (ITA) unique setting allows us to overcome the challenges associated with identifying effects of non-discriminatory trade policies due to two reasons: (i) ITA constitutes a quasi-natural experiment of several “passive” signatories joining the agreement as an unavoidable part of pursuing a larger policy objective, and (ii) ITA’s partial coverage of the IT sector provides a natural control group for identification based on cross-product variation. Our analysis finds novel nonlinear impacts of tariff liberalization: Complete tariff elimination results in large additional trade gains - over and above tariff reductions - especially for intermediate goods. The commitment to durable tariff elimination, through WTO bindings, adds a further two layers, boosting both imports and exports more than equivalent unilateral reforms. This commitment spurned development of a downstream IT export sector in “passive” signatories.
L63|Impact of counterfeiting on the performance of digital technology companies|Counterfeiting activities target companies in various sectors, including digital technology companies, defined as companies that produce and/or commercialize at least one physical product that incorporates a digital technology, excluding the merchandising related to the company brands. Counterfeiting is a fraudulent activity that potentially damages the economic and innovation performance of companies and can pose major threats to global competition and economic growth. However, the actual impact of counterfeiting on the performance of companies has not been tested empirically, due to methodological problems, including the lack of data on counterfeiting at the firm-level. Furthermore, prior theoretical studies have speculated that counterfeiting could have in part a beneficial effect on the performance of companies, due to indirect advertising, calling for empirical investigations to shed light on the issue. The goal of the present study is to provide empirical evidence on the impact of counterfeiting on both the economic and innovative performance of digital technology companies at the firm-level and on the global scale. To this aim, a new database was created combining data on counterfeiting activities during 2011-2013 (OECD-EUIPO, 2016) with financial information and patent data from 2009 to 2015. The result is a firm-level database that enables unprecedented analyses on the impact of counterfeiting on performance of digital technology companies. About 9% of the seizures of counterfeits that were illegally traded across borders during 2011 2013 involved goods commercialized by digital technology companies, equivalent to about the 9.1% of the total value of seizures. Collectively, about 11% of companies affected by illegal international trade of counterfeits are digital technology companies. The majority of these (58%) are big corporations with Operating Revenues greater than USD 1 bn. These account for 77% of the number of total seizures, and 84% of the value of seizures related to the digital technology companies. SMEs, defined as those with Operating Revenues up to USD 50 million, represent 21% of digital technology companies targeted and account for 5% of total seizures and 6% of the total value of seizures. The industries mostly targeted are electronics (both consumers’ electronics and electronics for industrial use), automotive and digital media. The digital technology products commercialized in frauds of IPRs include computer hardware and electronic components, batteries, sensors, autoparts, optical instruments, videogames, and recording of movies and motion picture. About 34% of digital technology companies affected by international trade of counterfeits are located in the EU28 or EFTA, 41% are located in North America, 23% are located in Asia. Within the EU28, UK, Germany, France and Italy are the countries hosting the largest number of targeted digital technology companies. Within the EU28, Germany and UK, followed by Belgium and Ireland, are the most-common country of destination of seized counterfeits. The overwhelming majority of seized goods related to digital technology companies is imported from Asia. 51% of these are imported from China, 41% comes from Hong Kong, China, 3% from Singapore. Other economies of provenance account each for less than 1% of the seizures. The vast majority (93%) of seizures affecting digital technology companies are due to violations of trademarks, and only a minority are due to violations of design models (4%), and copyrights (2%). Less than 1% of the seizures are due to violations of patents. However, seizures enacted in defence of patents are those that have the highest mean value. The analysis of infringed companies with respect to a control samples of non-infringed companies indicates that counterfeiting targets specifically highly profitable companies, with high propensity to innovate. Indeed, digital technology companies are more likely to become target of counterfeiting when they have larger Operating Revenues, and when they perform at a higher level in terms of profitability (return on total assets), prior to the window of observation. Target companies also have on average larger patent portfolios, prior to the observation of counterfeiting activities. Digital technology companies located in EU28 are on average less likely than companies located outside of EU28 to be the target of counterfeiting activities. Results from impact analyses indicate lower growth rates of operating profits for digital technology companies targeted by counterfeiting with respect to control samples of firms not affected by counterfeiting. In particular the econometric models provide evidence of a negative impact of counterfeiting on both EBITDA (Earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation) and EBIT (Earnings before interest taxes). This result is robust across different estimation methods, model specifications and time windows. The data reveals only a weak negative impact on operating revenues, with limited statistical confidence. Conversely, there is no significant evidence that counterfeiting affected the investment in Fixed Assets of targeted firms with respect to the control sample. The results about the negative impact of counterfeiting activities on operating profits are in line with reports of greater costs incurred by these companies to enact anti-counterfeiting strategies, reported in prior descriptive literature. These practices include the broadening of product ranges, with fewer scale-economies and the enactment of anti-infringement procedures, such as ‘conspicuous packaging’, more screening and origin certifications, development of licensing downstream retailers and direct self-enforcement aimed at limiting the circulation of counterfeits. Results do not provide support for the existence of indirect positive spillover effects, as hypothesised by the theoretical literature, according to which infringed companies might benefit from an advertising effect due to the greater diffusion of brands from the counterfeiting activities. Indeed, at least for what concerns digital technology companies, there is no evidence of any positive effect of infringement on sales of original products. The digital technology companies that were affected by counterfeiting on average increased their patent portfolios during the observation period, but less than the digital technology companies that were not affected by counterfeiting. However, the result is not robust to the inclusion of control variables and to the adoption of alternative measures of innovation performance (Intangible Assets). It certainly merits further research, once more data on counterfeiting become available. Overall, the results indicate that counterfeiting activities harm the economic performance of targeted digital technology companies, by eroding their operating profits. The effect on innovative performance is negative, but still inconclusive due to insufficient dataset, and cannot exclude that counterfeiting may harm the propensity to innovate of digital technology companies. The analysis rules-out the existence of any positive spillover from counterfeiting.
L63|Structure and comparison of the electronics and motor vehicle value chains in East Asia|This paper explores the structure of the electronics and the motor vehicle value chains in East Asia. Trade in value added analysis and its decomposition method are applied to the inter-country input–output data of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The method of value chain mapping has been introduced to illustrate the upstream and downstream transactions of goods and services along the value chain. The result of the analysis shows that the electronics industry has a greater vertical specialisation (VS) share than the automotive industry. The decomposition analysis reveals that the Korean industries were strongly integrated into the Chinese value chains, whereas the Thai industries continued to be overwhelmingly dependent on Japan, albeit, with increased linkages with neighbouring Southeast Asian economies. Moreover, value chain mapping demonstrated that China has increased its presence not only as an export platform for multinational firms but also as a consumer of final goods―especially for the Korean industries.
L63|Measuring Moore’s Law: Evidence from Price, Cost, and Quality Indexes|“Moore’s Law” in the semiconductor manufacturing industry is used to describe the predictable historical evolution of a single manufacturing technology platform that has been continuously reducing the costs of fabricating electronic circuits since the mid-1960s. Some features of its future evolution were first correctly predicted by Gordon E. Moore in 1965, and Moore’s Law became an industry synonym for continuous, periodic reduction in both size and cost for electronic circuit elements. This paper develops develops some stylized economic facts, reviewing why and how this progression in manufacturing technology delivered a 20 to 30 percent annual decline in the cost of manufacturing a transistor, on average, as long as it continued. Other characteristics associated with smaller feature sizes would be expected to have additional economic value, and historical trends for these characteristics are reviewed. Lower manufacturing costs alone pose no special challenges for price and innovation measurement, but these other benefits do, and motivate quality adjustment methods when semiconductor product prices are measured. Empirical evidence of recent changes to the historical Moore’s Law trajectory is analyzed, and shows a slowdown in Moore’s Law as measured by prices for the highest volume products: memory chips, custom chip designs outsourced to dedicated contract manufacturers (foundries), and Intel microprocessors. Evidence to the contrary, which relates primarily to Intel microprocessors is reviewed, as are economic reasons why Intel microprocessor prices might behave differently from prices for other types of semiconductor chips. A computer architecture textbook model of how chip characteristics affect microprocessor performance is specified and tested in a structural econometric model of microprocessor computing performance. This simple econometric model, using only a small set of explanatory chip characteristics, explains 99% of variance across processor models in performance on commonly used performance benchmarks. This small set of characteristics should clearly be included in any hedonic model of computer or processor prices. Most of these chip characteristics also affect chip production cost, and therefore have an additional rationale for inclusion in a hedonic model that is separate from their demand-side effects on computer performance metrics relevant to users.
L63|Application of Artificial Neural Networks in Cold Rolling Process|Rolling is one of the most complicated processes in metal forming. Knowing the exact amount of basic parameters, especially inter-stand tensions can be effective in controlling other parameters in this process. Inter-stand tensions affect rolling pressure, rolling force, forward and backward slips and neutral angle. Calculating this effect is an important step in continuous rolling design and control. Since inter-stand tensions cannot be calculated analytically, attempt is made to describes an approach based on artificial neural network (ANN) in order to identify the applied parameters in a cold tandem rolling mill. Due to the limited experimental data, in this subject a five stand tandem cold rolling mill is simulated through finite element method. The outputs of the FE simulation are applied in training the network and then, the network is employed for prediction of tensions in a tandem cold rolling mill. Here, after changing and checking the different designs of the network, the 11-42-4 structure by one hidden layer is selected as the best network. The verification factor of ANN results according to experimental data are over R=0.9586 for training and testing the data sets. The experimental results obtained from the five stands tandem cold rolling mill. This paper proposed new ANN for prediction of inter-stand tensions. Also, this ANN method shows a fuzzy control algorithm for investigating the effect of front and back tensions on reducing the thickness deviations of hot rolled steel strips. The average of the training and testing data sets is mentioned 0.9586. It means they have variable values which are discussed in details in section 4. According to Table 7, this proposed ANN model has the correlation coefficients of 0.9586, 0.9798, 0.9762 and 0.9742, respectively for training data sets and 0.9905, 0.9798, 0.9762 and 0.9803, respectively for the testing data sets. These obtained numbers indicate the acceptable accuracy of the ANN method in predicting the inter-stand tensions of the rolling tandem mill. This method provides a highly accurate solution with reduced computational time and is suitable for on-line control or optimization in tandem cold rolling mills. Due to the limited experimental data, for data extraction for the ANN simulation, a 2D tandem cold rolling process is simulated using ABAQUS 6.9 software. For designing a network for this rolling problem, various structures of neural networks are studied in MATLAB 7.8 software.
L63|Comparison between ideal and estimated pv parameters using evolutionary algorithms to save the economic costs|Micro grids are now emerging from lab modules sites into commercial markets, driven by technological improvements, falling costs, a proven track record, and growing recognition of their benefits. Their main contribution is to improve reliability and resilience of electrical grids, to manage the addition of distributed clean energy resources like wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) generation to reduce fossil fuel emissions, and to provide electricity in areas not served by centralized electrical infrastructure. In between, the popularity of photovoltaic panel is not deniable. In this paper, the ideal and practical electrical model of PV is being discussed. Due to significant role of the PV parameters, they are assessed by several heuristic methods and the results are compared. Hence an optimal method for parameter estimation is discussed that can be used in micro grid simulations to reach to an optimal quiescent working condition.
L63|Low-temperature Technology of Receiving Hf and Y Oxides|In this work is given low-temperature plasma anodizing and magnetron sputtering technologies of receiving Hf and Y metals oxides, metal-insulator-semiconductor structure based on received oxides and research of oxides electro-physical parameters. Traditional technology of receiving oxide layers is carried out at a high temperature (1300K). High-temperature technological processes result in diffusion of unwanted impurities, increased surface roughness, worsened adhesion and uncontrolled growth of oxide films take place. In addition to the selection of oxides, it is important to decrease their formation temperature. Low temperature (600K) technologies are plasma anodizing and magnetron sputtering technologies, stimulation of which is carried out with ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation directly during formation process of oxide layers. Using abovementioned technology formation temperature of oxide layers decreases and formation rate increases. As a result high quality oxides are received. As a base materials where used p-type Si with specific resistance of 10 Ohm×cm, (100) surface orientation and sapphire wafers with (0001) surface orientation, thickness 400µm. Using C-V method was measured inversion voltage, charge in oxide, dielectric constants and density of energy states in the oxide-semiconductor interface. Using current-voltage characteristic was measured leakage current and x-ray analysis was done.Measurement results showed that received oxides can be used as active layers in memristor.
L63|Deutsche Elektroindustrie trotzt unsicherem weltwirtschaftlichem Umfeld – Chancen durch Digitalisierung|Vor dem Hintergrund einer gedämpften weltwirtschaftlichen Entwicklung war die konjunkturelle Entwicklung in der deutschen Elektroindustrie 2016 tendenziell nur leicht aufwärts gerichtet.

L63|Innovation and recurring shifts in industrial leadership: Three phases of change and persistence in the camera industry|This study examines factors underlying three phases of change or persistence in industrial leadership in the sector of interchangeable-lens cameras over the past century. During this period there were two major phases of leadership change, both associated with the emergence of innovations involving major discontinuities in the industry’s core technologies. First, Japan won market leadership from Germany in the mid-1960s after commercializing the single-lens reflex (SLR) camera that replaced the previously dominant German rangefinder camera. Second, in the late-2000s, Japanese latecomer firms and a Korean firm developed Mirrorless cameras, which allowed them to capture the majority of market share from the incumbent Japanese leaders. We also examine the long period (about 60 years) between these two phases of change, during which leading Japanese firms were able to sustain their market leadership despite the digital revolution from the 1980s to 1990s. This paper explores the factors influencing these contrasting experiences of change and persistence in industry leadership. The analysis integrates several aspects of sectoral innovation systems – i.e., windows of opportunity associated with technology, demand, and institution – as well as the strategies of incumbents and latecomer firms. The conclusions highlight the complex and diverse combinations and importance of the factors that help explain the patterns of shifts in leadership.
L63|How Fast are Semiconductor Prices Falling?|The Producer Price Index (PPI) for the U.S. suggests that semiconductor prices have barely been falling in recent years, a dramatic contrast to the rapid declines reported from the mid‐1980s to the early 2000s. This slowdown in the rate of decline is puzzling in light of evidence that the performance of microprocessor units (MPUs) has continued to improve at a rapid pace. Over the course of the 2000s, the MPU prices posted by Intel, the dominant producer of MPUs, became much stickier over the chips' life cycle. As a result of this change, we argue that the matched‐model methodology used in the PPI for MPUs likely started to be biased after the early 2000s and that hedonic indexes can provide a more accurate measure of price change since then. MPU prices fell rapidly through 2004 on every price measure we present, with the PPI declining at an even quicker pace than the hedonic indexes. However, from 2004 to 2009, our preferred hedonic index fell faster than the PPI, and from 2009 to 2013 the gap widened further, with our preferred index falling at an average annual rate of 42 percent, while the PPI declined at only a 6 percent rate. Given that MPUs currently represent about half of U.S. shipments of semiconductors, this difference has important implications for gauging the rate of innovation in the semiconductor sector.
L63|ICT Services and their Prices: What do they tell us about Productivity and Technology?|This paper reassesses the link between ICT prices, technology, and productivity. To understand how the ICT sector could come to the rescue of a whole economy, we extend a multi-sector model due to Oulton (2012) to include ICT services (e.g., cloud services) and use it to calibrate the steady-state contribution of the ICT sector to growth in aggregate U.S. labor productivity. Because ICT technologies diffuse through the economy increasingly via purchases of cloud and data analytic services that are not fully accounted for in the standard narrative on ICT's contribution to economic growth, the contribution of ICT to growth in output per hour going forward is found to be substantially larger than generally thought--1.4 percentage points per year. One reason why the estimated contribution is so large is that official ICT asset prices are found to substantially understate the productivity of the sector. The model developed in this paper also has implications for the relationship between prices for ICT services and prices for the capital stocks (i.e., ICT assets) used to supply them. In particular, ICT service prices may diverge from asset prices and capture productivity gains from ICT asset management by the sector.

L63|Spin-Outs and Patterns of Subsequent Innovation: Technological Development of Laser Diodes in the US and Japan|By exploring the technological development of laser diodes in the US and Japan, this study examines how the existence or absence of an entrepreneurial strategic choice for spin-outs influences patterns of subsequent technological development. The results show that spin-outs could hinder the subsequent development of existing technology when that technology is still at a nascent level, because the cumulative effects of technological development could disappear if research and development personnel left their parent firms in order to target different sub-markets.
L63|Commercialization Strategy and IPO Underpricing|This paper studies the interplay between two defining features of technology-based firms: licensing as a commercialization strategy and the reliance on equity financing. Within the context of an IPO, we argue that the technology commercialization strategy of a firm going public affects information asymmetries and, therefore, IPO underpricing. In particular, we theorize that underpricing will be higher when a firm’s technology commercialization strategy is more based on licenses. We also posit that the size of the patent portfolio will mitigate this effect. Our results from a sample of 130 IPOs in the U.S. semiconductor industry confirm these predictions.
L63|Impact of new technologies on the organization of global value chains (1): dynamic transformations within global value chain typology|This paper is one of two articles that consider the impact of new technologies on the organization of global value chains (GVCs). The current paper considers value chains in two representative industries, namely, the automotive industry and electronic equipment industry, and the other forthcoming paper will examine the apparel industry and material processing industry. The study draws on the analytical framework developed by Gereffi et al. (2005), who presented a GVC typology and mechanism of value chain transformation.
L63|Prices of high-tech products, mismeasurement, and the pace of innovation|Abstract Introduction Two recent papers have made compelling cases that mismeasurement of prices of high-tech products cannot explain the slow pace of labor productivity growth that has prevailed since the mid-2000s. Does that result indicate that mismeasurement of high-tech products has limited implications for patterns of economic growth? The answer in this paper is “no.”. Results We demonstrate that the understatement of price declines for high-tech products in official measures has a dramatic effect on the pattern of multifactor productivity (MFP) growth across sectors. In particular, we show that correcting this mismeasurement implies faster MFP growth in high-tech sectors and slower MFP advance outside the high-tech sector. If MFP growth is taken as a rough proxy for the pace of innovation, our results suggest that innovation in the tech sector has been more rapid than the rate that would be inferred from official statistics (and less rapid outside high-tech). Conclusion These results deepen the productivity puzzle. If the pace of innovation in high-tech sectors has been more rapid than indicated by official statistics, then it is perhaps even more puzzling that overall labor productivity growth has been so sluggish in recent years.
L63|Disclosure Rules and Declared Essential Patents|Many standard setting organizations (SSOs) require participants to disclose patents that might be infringed by implementing a proposed standard, and commit to license their “essential” patents on terms that are at least fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND). Data from these SSO intellectual property disclosures have been used in academic studies to provide a window into the standard setting process, and in legal proceedings to assess the relative contribution of different parties to a standard. We develop a simple model of the disclosure process to illustrate the link between SSO rules and patent-holder incentives, and examine the model's core predictions using a novel dataset constructed from the disclosure archives of thirteen major SSOs. The central message of the paper is that subtle differences in the rules used by different SSOs can influence which patents are disclosed, the terms of licensing commitments, and ultimately long-run citation and litigation rates for the underlying patents.
L63|The use of IT tools for knowledge management in companies|Research background: Knowledge management is currently one of the most important factors determining the company's market position. It depends not only on the skilful use of resources, but also on obtaining a synergistic effect. To manage knowledge, managers must possess not only the appropriate resources of knowledge, but also must have determined management structure with the assistance of the IT tools. Purpose of the article: The purpose of the article was to present how the modern enterprise knowledge management process is supported by information technology. For this purpose, was summarized selected indicators characterizing the use of ICT in various types of enterprises in the country. It assumed that it is important not only the equipment the companies with information technology tools, but also the degree of use of these tools. Methodology/methods: In this paper was used data published by the Central Statistical Office (GUS), Eurostat, the World Data Bank and Gartner Group. The analyzed indicators of ICT usage are presented in Polish enterprises divided according to the type of activity and size (small, medium, large). National indicators were related to the values occurring in the EU. Findings: Usage of ICT in Poland reaches ratios much lower than the average for the European Union. Large differences in the use of information technology occurs in individual groups of companies. Larger companies have reached a much higher degree of saturation of IT tools than smaller objects. For example, the number of Polish enterprises with computers was 94.7%, in the case of large companies it is 99.8%. Even greater discrepancy relates to access to the Internet. You may also notice differences in each province. Introduction of modern technologies related to computer science and computers (eg. cloud computing, big data, social media, e-commerce etc) enables effective knowledge management in companies. The indicators show that the management team appreciates the importance of knowledge and consistently invests for its development.
L63|K-Chains: A New Class of Blockchains and Related Turing Machines Based on Quantum Mechanics|Quantum Mechanical principles have brought about a revolution in the way we perceive our world and use technology. One of the possible impacts and usage of Quantum mechanics is in the field of economics. Quantum mechanics can be applied to build a new class of Blockchain systems. This paper explores that possibility. It deals with how Quantum Mechanics can be best implemented to bring into existence a new class of Blockchain systems. These Quantum Blockchains (called K-Chains) will have several advantages like possible Faster-Than-Light (FTL) communication of Transactions, Unlimited network capacity and the revolutionary prospect of an Off-line Blockchain which will not need to be connected to the internet for transactions to occur. Extrapolation of this likelihood can lead to the designing of Quantum Turing Machines which are based on Quantum Blockchain (K-Chain) Technology. Real time information and communication systems spanning distances across light-years will most likely be probable. This can allow Mankind to instantly exchange value and information across vast distances of space almost instantly. The paper starts by briefly explaining the basics of Blockchains, cryptocurrencies and relevant Quantum mechanical concepts. Then we discuss how Quantum mechanics can be amalgamated with Blockchain Technology to achieve K-Chains. Later we will delve into the various impediments that make achieving a Quantum Blockchain (K-Chain) difficult with present day hardware technology. The paper concludes by discussing the various aspects of Quantum Technology, Blockchain Systems and the possibilities of constructing a Blockchain based Quantum Turing Machines.

The results obtained from numerical model of head frontal velocity show a good compliance with experiment results and greatly help analyzing the pattern of fluid movement in different scales.
L63|Robot path planning in a dynamic and unknown environment based on Colonial Competitive Algorithm (CCA) and fuzzy logic|Robot path planning has been one of the favorite areas for many Machine Learning researchers from the past up to date. The trajectory designed for a robot can be simple or complex. The robot must pass through obstacles which are either movable or fixed. One of the considerable ways for robot path planning in the dynamic and unknown environment is a combination of Evolutionary algorithm and Fuzzy logic. There are different kinds of evolutionary algorithms such as Genetic algorithm, Ant Colony algorithm, Colonial Competitive algorithm, etc. A new approach has been proposed in this paper for robot path planning in the dynamic and unknown environment based on both the Colonial Competitive algorithm and fuzzy rules. The implemented results of the proposed method present its superiority over previous methods which used only fuzzy logic method.
L63|Are consumers forward looking? Evidence from used iPhones| This study examines the impact of planned obsolescence – the introduction of new models to make existing models obsolete – on secondary markets for mobile phones. Using data of over 320,000 used iPhones listings on Thailand’s largest online marketplace, we document that iPhone prices decrease with age, around 2.8–3.2% for each passing month. We find no evidence that the price decline accelerates after launches of new models (i.e. obsolescence), lending support to the view that consumer in durable goods markets are rational and forward looking.

Is considered characteristics of technological process, during which was selected optimal technological route. Separately considered titanium (TiO2), hafnium (HfO2) and zirconium (ZrO2) dioxides structural features, as an interesting materials for receiving nanodevices, like field effect transistor. On the received structures was measured C-V characteristics, thickness, surface roughness, optical launch spectrums and x-ray structure analysis was realized.
L63|Semantic metadata in the publishing industry – technological achievements and economic implications|Abstract This paper discusses the adoption of new data management practices, known as Linked Data, by publishing companies from a strategic management perspective. It investigates the role of semantic metadata in the creation and exploitation of so called Linked Data ecosystems and discusses organizational effects on business and value creation processes stimulated by the technology. The theoretical assumptions are complemented by two case studies that provide insights how publishing companies use Linked Data technologies to diversify their business, strategically position themselves within emerging business ecosystems and adapt to the affordances of advanced data management practices. The analysis reveals that despite of differences in the adoption strategy both publishing companies have identified Linked Data technologies as the core of their innovation strategy having a profound impact on existing business practices and new strategies of value creation.
L63|Fission, forking and fine tuning|Perhaps because we live in the age of the Internet and social networks, everyone seems agreed that innovation is all about recombination. Although not fully dissenting from this consensus, and perhaps in the end affirming it in an important way, I want to draw attention to some apparently different mechanisms of innovation, both suggested by Adam Smith: subdivision (or differentiation) and fine-tuning. On the surface at least, these – especially the second – do not appear to be processes of recombination. I will attempt to elucidate what I mean by these concepts and try to think about how they fit together with recombination in a full Smithian account of innovation. Whether innovation proceeds from the top down or the bottom up depends crucially on the structure of complementary stages in the process of production. Especially if it takes place in a non-modular way, recombination may require unified decision rights, implying the vertical integration of complementary stages of production, in order to overcome the dynamic transaction costs of change. But the processes of subdivision and differentiation may also require changes in decision rights in order to overcome dynamic transaction costs. I illustrate these points with a case study of three generations of an American family of inventor-entrepreneurs in electricity and electronics.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L63|Information Value and Interregional Input-Output Structure|This paper establishes an economic theory of information value and volume that differs from Shannon’s mathematical theory of communication (Shannon, 1948). The economics of information should be recognized as an important frontier field of economics to explore the 4th industrial revolution including Internet of the things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). However, we need to construct an fundamental way to analyse information flow and stock. Because of this, the value of information goods as a non-market or market good is measured as agents’ willingness to pay (WTP) for travel and telecommunication from the overall viewpoint of transportation and telecommunication economics. And we construct an economic model for analysing the information flow between head and branch offices. This firms’ total profit is maximized by optimally imputing the amount of time which employees devote to collecting and processing internal and external information. Here, factors of production are internal and external information flows and stock information. Finally we propose information inputoutput table explaining inter-regional information flow of the sample economic model.

L63|Agglomeration of Invention in the Bay Area: Not Just ICT|We document that the Bay Area rose from 4% of all successful US patent applications in 1976 to 16% in 2008. This is partly driven by the increase in the prevalence of information and communication technology; however, even for patents unrelated to information and communication technology, we see a disproportionate increase in the share of US patents from the Bay Area. We interpret this growth as a trend to coagglomeration in invention across technologies, and explore different dimensions of this trend.

Rather than become a regional Philips hub with the support of its parent, as intended in the 1960s, it was absorbed by addressing changes in Australian trade policy and increased Japanese imports. The parent company’s establishment of regional supply centres in Europe and Asia left no role for the small Australian production facilities in the company’s global structure. Production and employment at Philips Australia were scaled back drastically during the 1970s.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L63|Managing Political Imperatives: Strategic Responses of Philips in Australia, 1939-1945|The Australian subsidiary of Dutch MNE Philips came under secret service surveillance and faced risk of government takeover as enemy property during World War II. It was also excluded from government contracts for communications equipment, while forced to reduce civilian production. These threats to its assets and operations required the firm to develop an adaptive corporate strategy in order to minimise political risk and also take advantage of opportunities that war production offered. This case study offers a rich insight into the processes an MNE employs to pursue dynamic strategic responses to host country political imperatives, confirming hypotheses of Ring et al. (1990). It demonstrates the relevance of historical cases to substantiating theory in strategic management.
L63|True Investment-GDP Ratio in a World Economy with Investment in Information & Communication Technology|The nominal investment-GDP ratio is playing a key role in the economic debate in the US and in the EU. However, this analysis is largely misleading as a rising share of overall investment is in the form of ICT investment: The price of ICT investment goods has been falling for decades so that it is adequate to consider the “real effective” investment-GDP ratio calculated on the basis of real ICT investment relative to real GDP. The gap between the two ratios is about 3-6 percentage points for the USA and Germany, and indeed some other EU countries, so that effective investment-GDP ratios in both the United States and Germany are seriously underestimated if nominal-GDP ratios are used – as the DIW, Berlin, did for Germany and other EU countries. There are, of course, critical implications for the debate about how large the investment gap is in Germany, France, Italy, Spain and other countries; this analysis is also highly relevant for the issue of overcoming slow growth and high unemployment rates. As regards Germany, there is only a small private investment gap, while that gap is much larger in Italy and Spain – judging by the real effective investment ratio of 2007 compared to the previous periods. In countries where the real effective investment-output ratio is quite different from the nominal investment-GDP ratio, the implication is that the savings rate and the current account position in the uses side of GDP in the System of National Accounts also need to be recalculated. The IMF should take the new methodology into account for the debate about international current account imbalances.
L63|Die wirtschaftliche Dynamik in der Stadt Dresden|Die Stadt Dresden ist schon seit den 1990er Jahren einer der wichtigsten Wachstumsmotoren für den Freistaat Sachsen. Die Dynamik der hier ansässigen Hochtechnologiefirmen hat Dresden zu einem bedeutenden Wirtschaftsstandort werden lassen. Die starke Spezialisierung des Verarbeitenden Gewerbes auf die Hochtechnologiesektoren bringt jedoch auch Probleme mit sich. Die Abhängigkeit dieser Märkte von der weltweiten Konjunktur macht die Stadt anfällig für globale Schwankungen. Dieser Artikel ana - lysiert das Wirtschaftswachstum der Stadt Dresden und kommt zu dem Schluss, dass die starke Aus - richtung auf den Halbleitersektor weiterhin dazu führt, dass Dresden an den Chancen auf weltweiten Wachstumsmärkten teilnehmen kann. Auf die Beschäftigung haben etwaige Schwankungen kaum Auswirkungen, da der sehr große Dienstleistungssektor stabilisierend wirkt.

L63|Die nordrhein-westfälische Metall- und Elektroindustrie im Jahr 2015|Mit ihren rund 3,8 Millionen Beschäftigten ist die Metall- und Elektroindustrie (M+E-Industrie) die größte Industriebranche in Deutschland. Davon waren 2015 allein mehr als 700 000 Personen in mehr als 5 700 Betrieben in Nordrhein-Westfalen tätig. Die Produktion in der nordrhein-westfälischen M+E-Industrie ist im vergangenen Jahr um 1,3% zurückgegangen. Insgesamt war die Produktion in den Betrieben der Metall- und Elektroindustrie in drei der vergangenen vier Jahre rückläufig. Insgesamt deuten die Ergebnisse aus dem ersten Quartal 2016 auch nicht darauf hin, dass sich der Konjunkturverlauf im laufenden Jahr für die M+E-Industrie in Nordrhein-Westfalen deutlich verbessern wird. Ein Verharren auf dem Niveau des Vorjahres wäre im Lauf dieses Jahres bereits ein kleiner Erfolg. Die weitere Entwicklung wird dabei von verschiedenen Unsicherheitsfaktoren beeinflusst, die vor allem die stark vom Außenhandel abhängige M+E-Industrie betreffen. Dazu zählen die ungewisse Entwicklung Chinas und anderer Schwellenländer ebenso wie die Entwicklung der Preise für Öl und andere Rohstoffe. Einflussfaktoren sind auch politische Prozesse, insbesondere die Entwicklung in der EU, infolge des Referendums in Großbritannien, sowie in den Krisenregionen im Nahen und Mittleren Osten.
L63|Competition, Product Proliferation and Welfare: A Study of the U.S. Smartphone Market| We consider a structural model of demand and supply where firms endogenously offer vertically differentiated products and exercise second-degree price discrimination. We apply this model to the smartphone industry and quantify the welfare effects of price discrimination and competition. We use counterfactual simulations to assess how the welfare changes when each firm only offers its highest-quality product. We also study the market outcomes such as price, product variety and welfare if later entrants in the market entered earlier.
L63|The Information Industry: Measuring Russia By International Standards|Structural changes influenced by ICT are having an impact on production processes and the release of products in the information and communication technology (ICT) sphere and content (on the level of individual enterprises) and are resulting in the pursuit of new approaches to socio-economic development, to increase the competitiveness of the country and to participate in the international division of labour. In order to identify development priorities and prospects in the information industry we therefore need a clear understanding of what the information industry is, what its boundaries are, what forms of economic activity make up this economic segment, and which products form the corresponding market. This working paper summarizes the results of a study to ‘measure’ the information industry as a segment of the economy producing goods and services linked to ICT and content. Methodological approaches are proposed to establish the ‘Information industry’ definitions based on the Russian Classification of Economic Activities (OKVED) and the Russian Classification of Products by Economic Activities (OKPD) in line with international standards and recommendations by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Key indicators of the development of the information industry are also tentatively calculated for Russia and compared with countries abroad. The content of this paper is based on research results commissioned by the Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation and the outcome of evaluations and testing at a round table on the subject ‘IT industry: problems of classification and application’ round table (2014) and a session of the statistics section of the Central House of Scientists at the Russian Academy of Sciences on the subject of ‘Developing the “Information industry” and “IT industry” definitions based on the OKVED2 and OKPD2’ (http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/rosstat/sec/tez-abdr.doc). The paper was also supported by the Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) and the subsidy granted to the HSE by the Government of the Russian Federation for the implementation of the Global Competitiveness Program.

L63|Selecting and Designing European ICT Innovation Policies|"This report analyses the peculiarities of innovation in Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), an ecosystem composed of various layers: from infrastructure to applications and content, and including end users. The report observes that innovation is becoming more open and collaborative in all layers, with various degrees of R&D intensity (greater at lower, physical layers); a prevalence of system goods with platforms and complementors mostly competing ""for"" rather than ""in"" the market; pervasive network effects coupled with relatively low entry barriers; short product life-cycles; and a high degree of co-evolution and co-dependency across and between layers. The nature of the ICT ecosystem determines a growing need for flexible, adaptive regulation, and the adoption of new policy instruments such as prizes and challenges. Policies should aim to create an environment favourable to the development of new, welfare-enhancing business models and avoid hindering the entrance of new players"
L63|Will Domestic Imitative Threats Influence High-Tech Imports? Evidence from Taiwan|In contrast to existing empirical studies focusing on the relationship of foreign patent rights protection and exports, this paper investigates how a country's high-tech importation is influenced by domestic imitative threats. Using a panel data of four high-tech industries in 1989-2003 and the augmented gravity model, we conclude that reducing imitative threat increased Taiwan's importation of high-tech products.

This study explores how the technology company Logitech attempted a transition from a mature life-cycle company in computer peripherals to a growth company in the music, tablet, and gaming industries. We show that stock price correlates with accounting performance differently across the companyâ€™s life cycle.
L63|Network structural properties for cluster long-run dynamics: evidence from collaborative R&D networks in the European mobile phone industry|In a recent literature, the structural properties of knowledge networks have been pointed out as a critical factor for cluster structural changes and long-run dynamics. Mixing evolutionary economic geography and network-based approach of clusters, this contribution aims at capturing and discussing the particular influence of hierarchy (degree distribution) and assortativity (degree correlation) in the innovative capabilities of clusters along the industry life cycle. We test our propositions in the field of the mobile phone industry in Europe from 1988 to 2008. We use EPO PATSTAT and OECD REGPAT to capture cluster trends, and R&D relations from European Framework Programs to capture knowledge networks and their evolving structural properties. Our findings provide new insights to understand the organization of clusters over time to perform along the industry life cycle.
L63|Firm patenting activity, metropolitan innovative environment and their effects on business survival in a high-tech industry|This paper distinguishes between internal (produced within the firm) and external (produced by other firms) knowledge and studies the effects of both knowledge types on survival in a cohort of computer and electronic product manufacturing companies started in 1991 in the continental US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). Estimation results suggest that innovative companies face lower hazard but this effect seems to be driven by company’s initial characteristics, as producing more knowledge measured by successful patent applications does not translate into a higher likelihood of survival. In contrast, an innovative environment decreases survival likelihood in the whole sample, yet this result appears to be driven by non-patenting establishments. In the subset of non-patenting firms an innovative environment has a strong negative effect on survival whereas no significant relationship is identified in the subset of innovative firms.
L63|Financialisation of wages and works councils’ policy: Profit sharing in the German metalworking and electrical engineering industries|Profit sharing wages are of growing importance in Germany. They are indicating a nascent trend of financialisation of wages. However, little is known about the regulation of profit sharing wages especially on plant level and the way they affect the policies of works councils. Plant level wage policy is a subject of codetermination according to the German Works Constitutions Act, and wage policy has always been one of the most crucial topics of works councils’ activities. What is the role works councils play regarding the negotiation and regulation of profit sharing wages? What is the collective interest they define and pursue in this respect? And what are the effects of wage financialisation on the legitimacy of works councils? These questions are analysed with respect to the development of profit sharing wages in the German metalworking industry. Based on a variety of research methods, our analysis shows that profit sharing wages are a source of legitimacy for the works councils. In many cases the works councils, usually regarded as victims of financialisation, are actively striving for the financialisation of wages in their companies. However, they have to cope with the problem that profit sharing nowadays is based on a redistribution of income between capital and labour, between firms and between different categories of employees.
L63|Tomorrow’s Paradox: Refining Knowledge by Smarter Information and Communications Technologies while Humans Tend to Become a Limited Factor of Performance|The paper analyzes some challenges of the exponential development ofInformation and Communications Technologies (ICT)in the Information society (IS) toward Knowledge Based Society (KBS), focusing on the premises of strange evolutions of the inherent interactions between humans and ICT smart machines along the complex and dynamic processes of generating knowledge and refining knowledge, caused by the natural limits of humans. The analysis reveals the detailed mechanisms which could lead to abnormal or paradox situations when ICT smart machines could/should replace humans. The paradox could appear when using such new technologies to replace human in order to avoid the consequences of routine stress, fatigue but especially the lack of responsibility in specific applications. Also, the analysis approaches the main consequence of “data deluge” (overwhelming data“products”), as for an optimal efficiency for IS/KBS, all these “products” of ICT must be highly “processed” in order to provide useful knowledge and eventually refined knowledge, but, naturally, the analysis try to answer to the question to what extent smart machines could/should replace humans. The paper main conclusion is that the paper title (Tomorrow’s paradox ...) is intended to generate an alarm signal about the abnormal situation where humankind is almost arrived, as we have to create such “smart machines” which could help us to get knowledge and refined knowledge designated to fight against ourselves, i.e. to avoid the consequences of a large diversity of aberrant behaviour generated by the average person or exception individuals.
L63|Information And Communications Technologies Go Greener Beyond Iot- Behind Is All The Earth|The paper is approaching the systemic analysis of the context of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) exponential evolution, as driving power of the transformation of the Information society (IS) toward Knowledge Based Society (KBS), foccusing on a smart management of ICT/IS/KBS evolution, where the essential is to deeply analyze, update the solutions, refine knowledge and responsibly react to challenges/implications, in order to correct the negative consequences of such complex and mass processes at Earth scale. The analysis approached the actual point of ICT development, dominated by Cloud Computing, Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT), starting from the premises created by “COPs21” Paris Conference context including ICT latest figures on carbon footprint and IoT emergent expansion – which show that Internet traffic is increasing with 40% / year, which would lead, without corrections, as ICT could consume in 10 years 60 percent of the Earth’s energy production. The author opinion is that the actual “machine” trend, focussed on striving for performance, must be balanced by a greener approach aiming power efficiency and carbon footprint reduction, including a concrete approach based on relevant issues as: Identifying incertitude/risk complex and complicated mechanisms, generated by the exponential speed of ICT development in IS/KBS and generally on Earth ecosystem; Developing greener ICT capable to induce greener solutions in all fields of activity; Designing new integrated models, algorithms and technologies for information analysis to cope with all consequences of IoT, Cloud computing, Big Data. The paper main conclusions include the priority to fight the main difficulties generated by the extreme speed of changes induced by ICT exponential pace of development, which create such complex consequences but does not allow humankind the necessary time to real time react, with the immediate approach of this “impossible” mission as being twofold: rethink and adapt (slow) the ICT pace and on the other hand create the instruments to help us find the balance between the designed ICT pace and the capacity to cope with it!
L63|Information and Communications Technologies Go Greener Beyond IOT- Behind Is All the Earth, Part 2|The paper presents a systemic analysis of the context, implementation and consequences of „greener” Information and Communications Technologies (ICT). The presented context reveals the necessity to carefully „observe” the fast and complex processes of ICT development, in order to identify real-time solutions to compensate all their (unwanted) consequences in the future and shows that it is reasonably to suppose that building greener ICT while extending IoT as a network of networks at Earth scale has to go beyond ... energy savings. The analysis covered the desired consequences of greener ICT as coming from two main directions: directly from all processes of production and utilization of ICT (products and services); indirectly from the whole diversity of applications of ICT as imbedded in practically all areas of humankind activity fields. The analysis focused on identifying the most important directions where energy savings are significant for ICT carbon footprint, but more than this, on ways ICT could generate, for humankind life on Earth and generally for Information society (IS) toward Knowledge Based Society (KBS) evolution, benefic effects that could be also considered „green” or environment friendly for the humankind ecosistem, although they could not be quantified as energy savings. Based on United Nations definition, the author considered that sustainable processes in social and economic are also green forms of development, extending the environment to the ecosystem of humankind life on Earth. The analysis presented also the two main directions for the „greener” ICT/IoT implementation, mainly for energy savings, as improvements of technologies, architectures, components, devices, algorithms, methods and protocols. The other side is generated by a diversity of methods to provide a green behaviour of ICT/IoT use.The essential aspect is that the effect of those technologies will be multiplied by the number of expected IoT networks/devices, this way appearing the huge relevance and consequences of greener ICT in the IoT era. The paper also approached some evaluation/measuring aspects referring to the the greener ICT processes. A special attention, in the second section of the paper, is given to learning from green ICT, as going beyond energy savings, where the main consequence is given by the changes of business models, with sustainable progress for humankind, representing one of the most dramatic non-energy savings consequences of ICT (green) evolution in IS/KBS. The analysis concluded that Big Data, Cloud and Analytics could be the main vectors of this transformation, but here the point paper analyzed is even further forecasting: how to manage the design and use of those technologies in order to leverage the generation of above mentioned green consequences by ICT/IoT. Last but not least, the analysis pointed that humankind have to beware of ICT exponential development negative consequences as “ICT dependence”, physical/intellectual activity fading and excessive resources consumption.
L63|Developing Information and Communications Technologies with More Artificial Intelligence, Using Artificial Intelligence, When Internet of Things is “Intelligence Everywhere” Part 1|The paper is approaching the systemic analysis of the emergency of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems and generally of AI in the context of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) exponential evolution and proliferation, as main driving factor of the transformation of the Information society (IS) toward Knowledge Based Society (KBS). The paper analysis presents the AI premises to be a potential revolutionary step in ICT development, having, naturally, challenges of the same scale, because of the complex convergence of the state-of-the art AI technologies with Internet of Things (IoT) networks (IoT is “intelligence everywhere”!) and Big Data, applying with exponentially pace/performance at Earth scale. Security, ethical, moral or legal rules are identified as the prominent challenges of the exponential pace/performance and planetary expansion of AI/ICT, addressed to humankind in IS toward KBS on Earth. Among the challenges, security is first, because the benefits of the AI/ICT progress have got such a huge level and horizontal expansion in autonomous systems and processes, as our lives depend dramatically on their reliable and safe operation .Consequently, the solution is not to stop AI/ICT progress, but to use our actual intelligence and refined knowledge in order to‘’build robots we can trust’’ and generally ICT we can trust.From security point of view, developing ICT with more artificial intelligence, using artificial intelligence could create sensible risks against the essential requirements on ethical, moral or legal rules. In detail, the analysis confirms that in the (actual or next) stage of AI/ICT development we can lose the safe limit of control for AI, when imbedded ‘’intelligence’’ (as performance and technology level) is pushing us to think that we can trust in higher or total (100%) autonomy of the new AI systems only because the technology can support that (level of autonomy)! Paper proposition is that the essence of “fight” (against advanced AI vulnerabilities) strategy has to be the plenary use of the only (long term) advantage human could have over AI (machine): the imagination potential. Consequently, when developing advanced AI/ICT (especially advanced robots), we have to use the most advanced refined knowledge plus our imagination maximum potential, aiming with priority two main objectives. First we must be sure that human subjective criteria are cleared (know yourself) by refined knowledge based on security, ethical, moral or legal rules. Then, analyse all possible scenarios of “fight” (against advanced AI vulnerabilities). Technically we can win the “fight” (against advanced AI vulnerabilities) only if applying the advantage of using similar refined knowledge, but exceeding by human (unlimited) imagination the analysis advanced AI could perform based on learning processes it could have passed. The analysis concludes with the crucial importance of models and algorithms the specialists could use to apply the more and more performant available technology, because this amazing AI/ICT performance and proliferation at planetary scale are the main premises to create functional vulnerabilities (risks) unless backing solutions to timely compensate them are provided by appropriate models and algorithms.
L63|Secure Web-Based Communication Framework For Smart Home Systems Designed For The Elderly And Disabled|As a result of the increasing awareness about common daily problems of the elderly and disabled in recent years, novel technology solutions have been designed and developed. Thanks to smart homes which involve a set of various sensors and devices to make the daily lives of the elderly and disabled easier and provide remote monitoring ability to the family members, nowadays the elderly and disabled stay in their houses instead of assisted-living centres. On the other hand, elderly and disabled people living alone may be exposed to potential security threats. In this study, a framework is proposed in order to achieve secure communication over the Internet. In the proposed framework, information to be transferred is first encrypted using RSA algorithm and then sent to the recipient. For security reasons, after the recipient reads the encrypted information, traces of the communication should be removed. For this objective, before the transfer, the sender determines how many seconds the message will be available to the recipient via a link. When the recipient receives the link, he/she can open the message with the secret key. After the predefined time, the message is deleted from the database used by the framework. The framework can be used to enable confidential messaging between smart home inhabitants and people they would like to communicate. The framework can easily be integrated into smart home control panels or web-based interfaces of smart home systems.
L63|Price Setting and Rapid Technology Adoption: The Case of the PC Industry|We examine how the confluence of competition and upstream innovation influences downstream firms’ profit-maximizing strategies. We focus on personal computers and use two novel data sets to describe the dramatic fall in both price (27% at an annual rate) and sales of a computer over its product cycle. Further, we document that computers are typically sold for only four months before being replaced by a higher-quality product. To explain these facts, we develop and calibrate a vintage capital model that combines a competitive market structure with an exogenous rapid rate of innovation.
L63|Sticky Spots on Slippery Slopes: The Development of the Integrated Circuits Industry in Emerging East Asia|This paper draws from an evolutionary study of 36 integrated circuit (IC) production firms to examine the role of institutions and intermediary organizations in supporting technological upgrading in the integrated circuit industry in emerging East Asia. The evidence shows that IC firms in Korea and Taiwan have reached the technology frontier to show that they are deeply rooted on the slope of competition. IC production has also become sticky in Singapore and China where the provision of grants and government-industry coordination have attracted participation in the high value added activities of wafer fabrication, IC design and supportive R&D activities. Although IC production in Malaysia has enjoyed functional upgrading, particularly since 2005, its capacity to follow the path of Singapore and China will depend heavily on the dismantling of ethnic considerations by the government in the promotion of the industry. IC production is not sticky at all in the countries of Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia because of a lack of institutional deepening. Consistent with the global production network approach, the successful experiences examined in this paper show that the development of institutions and intermediary organizations through effective coordination between governments and industry is critical to stimulate technological upgrading in the IC industry.
L63|New Techniques For Implementing Online Virtual Laboratories|This work describes a practical method for the design and development of online virtual laboratories using low costs electronics and software applications. Such virtual labs are needed in any education institution that desires to offer good quality teaching services for their students and can be integrated inside e-learning platforms. A practical example is included in this research and makes use of communication technologies together with microcontroller performance, possible due to high availability of many forms of Internet-enabled modules, which generated in the last years in the so-called “Internet of Things” (IoT) – a global network of sensors and smart devices communicating with each other. These smart platforms capture data from different sensors and transmit it over Internet for further processing or interpretation, and graphical results can be embedded into a Moodle course, as a laboratory teaching resource, thus expanding the e-learning services. The case study presented is the author’s e perimentation in laboratory space and can be easily replicated for further research
L63|“…then came Cisco, and the rest is history”: a ‘history friendly’ model of the Local Area Networking industry|We study the role that switching costs, compatibility, and mergers and acquisitions play in influencing the evolution of a multi-market industry. By looking at the case of the Local Area Networking industry, we propose a ‘history friendly model’ to replicate its evolution during the 1990s. Our model explains how a firm can start from a dominant position in one of the existing markets and exploit switching costs and compatibility to enter a new market. Mergers and acquisitions also play an important role as the new market is pioneered by a start-up, which is soon acquired by the dominant incumbent. As a result of the acquisition, the acquiring firm becomes the leader also in the new market. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
L63|Cost- and Price Dynamics of Solar PV Modules|This paper develops a model framework and a corresponding empirical inference procedure for estimating long-run marginal cost in industries where production costs decline over time. In the context of the solar photovoltaic module industry, we rely on firm-level financial accounting data to estimate the long-run marginal cost of PV modules for the years 2008 -2013. During those years, the industry experienced both sharp price declines and significant expansions of manufacturing capacity. By comparing the trajectory of average sales prices with the long-run marginal cost estimates, we are in a position to quantify the extent to which actual price declines were attributable to excess capacity as opposed to reductions in production costs. While we find a significant effect attributable to excess capacity for some quarters in our sample period, the dynamics of this industry also points to a rate of cost reductions that is even faster than the 80% learning curve which has described the trajectory of average sales prices over the past three decades.

En particular, es necesario analizar no solo los determinantes de las ganancias sociales derivadas del uso del espectro, sino la disponibilidad de infraestructura para prestar el servicio y la percepción de los gobierno respecto al origen de dichas ganancias. A continuación se presenta un análisis detallado de estos elementos y su influencia en las decisiones de asignación del espectro.
L63|México: políticas industriales y producción de bienes y servicios de tecnologías de la información y la comunicación|En este estudio se investiga hasta qué punto el auge digital ha repercutido en la actividad productiva, la manufactura (bienes tic) y los servicios tic, además de sus potenciales ramificaciones en el resto de la economía mexicana. Se utilizan las matrices de insumoproducto (mip) y se hace referencia a las del Brasil y los Estados Unidos de América. México se ha rezagado, especialmente en la producción de bienes tic, y las cadenas productivas de esta actividad se han debilitado. El sector de servicios tic ofrece un potencial mucho mayor que el aprovechado hasta ahora, con la ventaja de incorporar comparativamente mayor valor agregado y con grandes posibilidades de diversificación. Se considera primordial encontrar políticas industriales más efectivas enfocadas en los sectores de bienes y servicios tic, lo que constituye un desafío, sobre todo si se observan países como el Brasil con enfoques más proactivos, pero con resultados mixtos.
L63|Mexico: industrial policies and the production of information and communication technology goods and services|This study investigates the extent to which the digital boom has had repercussions on productive activity, in terms of both manufacturing (ict goods) and services (ict services), in addition to its potential ramifications in the rest of the Mexican economy. Input-output matrices are used and compared to those of Brazil and the United States. Mexico has fallen behind, particularly in the production of ict goods, and the productive chains of this activity have weakened. The ict services sector offers much greater potential than has been exploited thus far, with the advantage that it involves comparatively more value added and has major diversification possibilities. It is considered essential to find more effective industrial policies targeted on the ict goods and services sectors; but the experience of countries such as Brazil, which have applied more proactive approaches with mixed results, suggests that this will be challenging.
L63|Who should handle retail? Vertical contracts, customer service, and social welfare in a Chinese mobile phone market|Using data on mobile phone handset sales from a single retail store, we examine the impact of different retail responsibility designations and vertical contracts on seller service provision, firm profitability, and social welfare. During our sample, this store switched from retailer-managed retailing with linear pricing contracts to manufacturer-managed retailing with revenue-sharing contracts. We estimate consumer demand and manufacturer cost parameters. Demand estimates indicate a large positive shift that coincided with the vertical change, consistent with improved retail customer service. Welfare estimates suggest that consumers derived substantial surplus from the improved customer service in addition to that from lowered prices.
L63|Mapping digital businesses with big data: Some early findings from the UK|Governments around the world want to develop their ICT industries. Researchers and policymakers thus need a clear picture of digital businesses, but conventional datasets and typologies tend to lag real-world change. We use innovative ‘big data’ resources to perform an alternative analysis for all active companies in the UK, focusing on ICT-producing firms. Exploiting a combination of observed and modelled variables, we develop a novel ‘sector-product’ approach and use text mining to provide further detail on key sector-product cells. We find that the ICT production space is around 42% larger than SIC-based estimates, with around 70,000 more companies. We also find ICT employment shares over double the conventional estimates, although this result is more speculative. Our findings are robust to various scope, selection and sample construction challenges. We use our experiences to reflect on the broader pros and cons of frontier data use.
L63|China’s electrical equipment manufacturing in the global value chain: A GVC income analysis based on World Input-Output Database (WIOD)|This paper empirically analyzes China’s electrical equipment manufacturing industry in the context of global value chain (GVC) by using the GVC income approach and the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). Four major questions are addressed by measuring several different indicators. China is found to have comparative advantage and competitiveness in terms of its large share of value added contribution in the world electrical equipment manufacturing industry. However, such competitiveness is not sustainable. The paper also finds that the global financial crisis did have certain impact on the electrical equipment GVCs in general, but the impact is not necessarily negative and big.
L63|The Challange of China and the Role Deepening ASEAN Integration for the Philippine Semiconductor Industry|From a rising share in the global semiconductor market in the 1990s, which peaked at 7.7 percent in 1999, the standing of the Philippines has since weakened with shares declining to four percent in 2005 and 2.5 percent in 2012. Heavy reliance of the Philippine semiconductor industry on foreign capital, which was concentrated largely in the United States and Japan for the most part of the past two decades, had made it vulnerable to trade risks faced by these countries that resulted in significant downturns in exports in 2001 and 2009. The erosion in the worldwide market share for the Philippines was also associated with the phenomenal rise of China as a dominant global supplier in the 2000s for advanced packaging and test services. Lacking technological capability, the Philippine semiconductor industry was pushed farther down the lower tiers of back-end manufacturing as it struggled to compete in this market with China, which sustained a strong technological leadership. Unlike the more developed Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member countries of Singapore and Malaysia, which have demonstrated upgraded technological intensities and have more diversified international production linkages, the Philippines has failed to optimize the huge opportunity to tap into China’s large and growing semiconductor market and to attract Chinese capital inflow. Increased investments from Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore in the 2000s, alongside a deepening ASEAN integration and economic interdependence, have cushioned the negative impact of the global crisis on Philippine semiconductor trade. This paper recommends policy reforms for the Philippines to facilitate its transition to more knowledge-intensive, higher-value operations
L63|Working Paper 07-15 - De Belgische ICT in vogelvlucht - Economische betekenis en positionering t.o.v. de buurlanden|This study discusses the production and use of ICT in Belgium, and identifies its strengths and weaknesses in comparison with the neighbouring countries. It covers both ICT goods and services, noting that the production of services is almost seven times as high as the production of goods. In this study, the use of ICT is limited to their use as a production factor, but not as a consumption good. In the Belgian economy, ICT industries are characterized by their dynamism, with a high entry rate, a high labour productivity and a relatively strong profitability. Moreover, ICT services significantly contribute to foreign trade. ICT industries are closely linked with the Belgian economy. Compared to the neighbouring countries, however, ICT industries have a smaller share in the economy and a smaller share in the foreign trade of goods. Moreover, innovation in terms of patent applications is disappointing, and ICT capital has a relatively small and even diminishing contribution to economic growth. Within the Belgian ICT sector, telecommunications relatively stand out compared to the other ICT industries, with a relatively large share in the economy and services exports. They are the main user of ICT products, and can thus boost the development of ICT.
L63|The Firm Size Effect On Performance Due To Intangible Resources|The paper explores the effect of firm size on the relation between intangible resources and companies’ performance (ROA). The authors identify six types of intangibles: human resources and management capabilities, innovation and internal process capabilities and customer loyalty and networking capabilities. The study provides econometric justification using a database of more than 1400 European public companies. The time period for the investigated data covers ten years from 2004 to 2013. A dummy regression analysis was applied for empirical testing. The findings revealed that the size of a company matters with regard to the employment of intangible resources and for a performance based on intangibles
L63|The Role of Internet of Things for a Continuous Improvement in Education|This research is concentrated on the value that Internet of Things (IoT) can add to the education process, by using it in development of online virtual laboratories, which is a major requirement for any education system, in order to be qualitative and competitive. Practical experimentation is possible even with distance learning approach and today students may have access to a multitude of teaching resources, including IoT services used for various real world experiments. This is possible due to low costs and high performance of new electronic modules, on one hand, and the development of many high scalable web services, which permits data processing and communication over the Internet, on the other hand. The paper also presents an example of using IoT, by connecting an Arduino platform with the Xively web service, in order to read and display data received from a temperature sensor.
L63|Tourism Policy, a Big Push to Employment: Evidence from a Multiple Synthetic Control Approach|This paper investigates the impact of tourism policy on employment, using the Tourism Development Policy (TDP) implemented in the Argentinean province of Salta during the years of 2003 to 2010 as a case study. Following the Synthetic Control Method for comparative case studies, we use a combination of non-treated Argentinean provinces to construct a synthetic control province which resembles relevant characteristics of Salta before the TDP implementation. Given the dual focus of the evaluated policy -one specific sector in one province- we also construct a synthetic control for the tourism sector using a combination of other sectors for Salta, and other sectors from other provinces. This novel approach based on multiple dimensions of the donor pool allows us to test the robustness of the estimated impact. We find that TDP implementation increased tourism employment in Salta by an average of 11 percent per year, for an overall impact of around 112 percent between 2003 and 2013. The analysis also suggests that larger impacts of the TDP occurred from the second to the seventh years after policy implementation. Results are robust across a series of placebo tests and sensitivity checks.
L63|Productivity and Digitilization in Europe: Paving the Road to Faster Growth|This paper reviews the latest evidence on the contribution of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) – and the digital economy more broadly – on economic growth for Europe and the United States since the late 1990s until most recently. The paper provides estimates on the contributions from ICT to growth from three channels affecting the long-term growth performance of entire economies: 1) a productivity effect through the ICT-producing sector, 2) an investment effect from ICT-using industries through capital deepening, and 3) a productivity effect from an efficiency rise through the use of ICT which goes beyond the direct capital deepening effect. The study finds that the slowing of the total factor productivity growth rate in Europe reflects a failure to effectively adopt new technologies and innovation. It is also argued that the lack of rapid accumulation of intangible capital (such as information assets, innovative property, and economic competencies) constrains Europe's ability to accelerate and facilitate the innovation effects from digital technology. Finally, we discuss some policy implication emerging from our work, in particular the need to complete the Single Market in Europe to improve the productivity effects from the digital economy.
L63|Methods for the implementation of online virtual laboratories in electronics or automation|Online virtual labs are a requirement for a modern and efficient education. They can facilitate appropriate educational tools for the future development of any employee profile in Romanian or international economy. The paper presents some practical tools for the development of online virtual labs in the fields of electronics and automation. Our research will highlight the role of hardware-software resources available today at low prices and a large variety. An important role is played by the advent of modern electronics microcontrollers progress and development of modules and platforms that require little effort as programming and implementation. Thus, the paper presents a practical demonstration and deployment of such electronic laboratory platform to be accessed, monitored and controlled remotely by means of techniques and web services.

Benefits-costs perspective|Access of the persons with disabilities to services provided by the Internet is an important aspect of everyday existence of these people with special needs. In the particular case of blind people, the Internet offers unprecedented opportunities for an independent living, the fundamental challenge for any disabled person. In this paper we present some aspects of Internet accessibility via Text-To-Speech (TTS) technology, from a benefits-costs perspective. This assistive technology transforms into speech the texts gathered from accessing of web and email services of the Internet.
L63|Content aggregation by platforms: The case of the news media|"The digitization of content has led to the emergence of platforms that draw information from multiple sources. Policymakers are concerned that these new platforms threaten incentives for the production of original content. As a result, policymakers are contemplating regulations that would force aggregation platforms to pay or require an explicit ""opt-in"" for content providers. To understand the possible consequences and underlying rationale of such laws, we explore whether aggregation of content by a single platform encourages users to ""skim"" content or to investigate in depth. We study a contract dispute that led a major aggregator to remove information from a major content provider. We find that after the removal, users were less likely to investigate additional, related content in depth, particularly sources that were horizontally or vertically differentiated.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
L63|Ict Professional Skills And Ict Career – Republic Of Moldova Case Study|Actuality: Developing professional skills in ICT is a key factor that determines the development of the ICT sector from Moldova. In 2014 ISDI and StarNet launched the initiative of establishing a network of centers of excellence in ICT outside the capital of the country. The initiative is based on a pre-feasibility study conducted by the ISDI team during December 2014 – February 2015. The aim of the article is to analyse the results of the pre-feasibility study, with a focus on surveys and discussions held with representatives of public authorities, teachers and pupils from 6 visited districts. The article presents some of the results of the visits made by ISDI team and an analysis of international and local situation in the area of ICT professional skills. The methodology comprises several research methods: data analysis (statistical and pre-feasibility study period), statistical review, descriptive method, comparative method, case studies. Results: It was performed an analysis of the international and European experience in e-skills field. Survey results and discussions shows that pupils want new extracurricular activities in their localities in the area of ICT. Teachers and public servants support the idea of creating centers that would allow students to develop their ICT professional skills.
L63|Problems Of Transition From Classical Dedicated Ict System To Cloud Computing|Technological solutions, which most of ICT processes are still based on in business systems, are classical desktop systems and client-server systems. Some typical characteristics of such systems are poor utilization of processing possibilities, overcapacity of storage systems, data and application redundancy, relatively high security as well as relatively low portability and scalability. The paper deals with advantages and shortcomings of the conceptual model of capital expenses and operational expenses of classical ICT systems compared to the cloud computing with an emphasis on the problem of demands defi nition and their valuation, as well as ICT capacity utilization. Also, the costs of classical and potential cloud computing options are investigated, especially in the context of total costs of ownership. The paper has revealed a problem of precise historical data availability for different kinds of ICT expenses. The model and TCO have been analysed on the case of one big Croatian company.
L63|R&D Activity And Core Business Efficiency On The Example Of Technology Companies|Taking as a basis for discussion the Schumpeter’s innovation theory, this paper analyses the relationship between enterprises activity in the field of research and development, and their efficiency at the core business level. This analysis was performed in two ways – with the assumption shift in time between research and development activities and companies business efficiency, and without it – using the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. The sample was accounted for 252 companies from the technology sector, whose shares are traded on NYSE or NASDAQ, and the analysis time period consisted of three years (2011–2013). The results obtained in the course of analysis generally indicate lack of strong relationship between distinguished categories. A noticeable, but only at moderate level, positive correlation was found in both considered approaches only in respect of the relationship between the intensity of expenditures on research and development or y/y change of these expenditures and gross margin on sales. Therefore, it seems to be relevant to extend this research at least in such directions as: identification and characterization of factors determining efficiency of companies research and development activities, as well as examination considered relationship taking into account business diversity within the sector and wider time shift between realized research and development activities and various measures of core business efficiency.
L63|Global products price differential between countries in the context of European Union trade regulations. The case of e-commerce markets|In the age of globalization, development of economic integration, trade liberalization, Internet and technological progress particularly in ways of distribution, we may expect that global homogeneous products will have equal price in the common currency on every market around the world. Despite the fact that in the modern world economy there is a high opportunity to make the law of one price work, in reality we can observe price differences between countries. This paper concerns the problem of that price differential with the aim of analysing its causes. The hypothesis assumes that the law of one price does not work as an absolute model. Therefore, the possible causes of global homogeneous products price differential between national markets are broadly understood transaction costs. Their major component are the costs of trade regulations towards third countries made by economic integrations such as EU. Research methodologies used in the paper focus on simplified cause and effect relationship analysis based on quantitative and qualitative variables. Selected mobile devices offered on national e-commerce markets were used as an example of modern homogenous global products distributed on close to the perfect competition market. The research is supported by information from wide range of academic and scientific publications in Polish and English about world trade economy, macroeconomics, international business and economic integration. The sources are complemented by detailed papers which concern the law of one price as well as empirical data. The conclusions prove that the law of one price does not apply to the examples used in the paper. The theory and my own research shows, according to the hypothesis, that trade regulations have significant impact on increasing the prices of the same global product on those regulated markets. Value Added Taxes and certifications of compliance of mobile devices with EU standards are the most substantial among trade regulations. It was also pointed out that pricing to market, fluctuation of exchange rates and direct costs such as transport, can also have influence on price differentials of homogenous global products between countries.

We will evaluate some opportunities for several segments in the Brazilian economy by breaking down investment into several activities while we simultaneously evaluate the Brazilian capital goods industry’s ability to benefit from these mentioned opportunities. Data from IBGE and MDIC will be used in this study and also from Capital Flow Tables (CFT) and from BNDES’ operations and estimates of future investments.
L63|The Information Society Towards the Knowledge Based Society Driven by the Information and Communications Technologies - From the Internet of Things to the Internet of… Trees (Part 1)|The paper approaches an emergent field of the information and communications technologies (ICT), the Internet of things (IoT). ICT development optimization, as the driving force of the information society (IS) toward knowledge based society (KBS), due to IoT expansion consequences, is analyzed. The paper analyses are focused on the emergence and challenges of the Internet of Things. Consequently, IoT is associated with the Internet World, in fact our today World, where everything is going to be connected with everything, by the information flood , IoT being a combination of practically infinite informational (usually wireless) links and things (from books to cars, from electrical appliances to food). This paper estimation is confirmed and detailed through further definitions and analyses, based on references as EU and ITU reports, as a natural approach of the emergence and challenges of the Internet of Things. Paper analyses also presents the implications of the ever-changing issues of IS/KBS, which have to be analyzed, but more exactly continuously re-considered, on an updated/ regularly basis and with adequate instruments, criteria and resources. This way the paper shows that , the real complications, a „challenge” for the necessary new models and algorithms, come in the complex phases of processing data to extract information and then analyze information to refine knowledge finally used to take ... decisions at ... Earth scale! Starting from a Harvard University pilot project of tracking the global warming consequences on university green (trees) ecosystem by a local area network of sensors, the paper proposes to further analyze what should we must do in order to extend and generalize the pilot objectives to IS/KBS at Earth scale, but more than this, to identify which would be the equivalent of trees, then forest and then ... Internet! The paper main conclusion is that the solution of the above challenges could be given by considering the fundamental issues of refining knowledge, i.e. to dynamically analyze (on a check and act basis) all the data, in the data deluge of ICT/IoT, but such an approach will not efficiently work, because too much data will block our control systems of decisions, unless adequate criteria for systemic analyze and knowledge refining will be identified.
L63|The Information Society Towards the Knowledge Based Society Driven by the Information and Communications Technologies - From the Internet of Things to the Internet of… Trees (Part 2)|The paper analyzes the Internet of things (IoT) evolution, in the context of the information and communications technologies (ICT) exponential development, as the main factor of the information society (IS) transformation toward knowledge based society (KBS). For starting the analysis of the IoT evolution a life example was taken, where, after 40 years of carrier evolution, people who benefited from a high level of knowledge, in a special class of mathematics at the high school, had also a special opportunity which also had a remarkable role in leveraging their capacity of progress/success: the connectivity provided by the teacher in the high level working atmosphere of that class. The example conclusion is that connectivity and the access to a knowledge core are the main features for IoT model and premises. The analysis covered the definition sphere, the technological frame and the expansion consequences estimation for the IoT amazing evolution, as part of the ICT exponential development in IS/KBS. The analysis results include the evaluation of IoT, as the most prominent wave in Internet evolution and a global infrastructure (network of networks) for the information society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting practically everything by deploying „sensors” from land to water and space, from industry to home, from trees to cows and from the skin to the heart of individual. Among the IoT expansion consequences, the IoT will provide a huge amount of data that could be turned into information and then in knowledge. The most complex part of the analysis led to the conclusion that only after refining information we can get new knowledge and then include it in the wisdom heritage of humankind, irrespective the application field of IoT. The refined knowledge contributes, as an added value, to the individual education as leveraging his intellectual capacity and eventually the creative potential which then is coming back to support IoT/ICT/IS/KBS development closing … the circle. The author concludes that the analysis provided just an estimate of the visible circle, but, as we are going forward, the real circle is changing and further analysis is necessary (i.e. to be continued).
L63|The Information Society Towards the Knowledge Based Society Driven by the Information and Communications Technologies - From the Internet of Things to the Internet of … Trees (Part 3)|The paper approaches the premises, applications, technologies and the main requirements of an emergent field of the information and communications technologies (ICT), the Internet of things (IoT), as an extension of the people’s need to communicate, which will bring, of course, a lot of data and unprecedented opportunities to improve life in the information society (IS) toward knowledge based society (KBS) context. The paper analysis shows that the main role of IoT is to collect data/information from life and environmental experience, helping people to optimize all Earth processes and finally add new value for a better and longer life for actual and next generations. One of the benefits of such a way to develop IoT is the „outcome economy”, like an expression of the intermediate steps to optimize IS/KBS, as the products and services (at most from ICT but not exclusively) will be designed and implemented to provide specific (costumized) results. The paper identifies two main categories of IoT applications, one (A) being focused on collecting and processing data concerning the operation/existence of a „thing”/device in order to optimize that thing/device operation/existence („things” could include industrial machines, home appliances, cars, toys, animals or ... trees). The second category (B) is focussed on individual/human body, in order to collect personal data useful for that person (generally for health, but not exclusively) or for entities interested in person’s behaviour. Both categories of IoT applications are further analyzed with relevant examples and revealing their main implications. The second section of the paper analyzes the means to develop IoT on a rational base, showing that communications, as main part of ICT, must provide the „smart” support for developing IoT and generally optimize not only the „things” existence/operation, but the IoT as „network of networks” too. An important issue on developing such IoT complex systems is that it supposes a set of requirements to be accomplished, in order to reach the optimizations goals with efficiency on long term. The main requirement is an infrastructure to connect the World IoT devices, including broadband (high speed) communications support (wireless, optical fiber, satellite, cable), optimized to the application specific traffic. Other analyzed requirements include IPv6 necessary addresses and new technologies for the energy (electric power) support. Predictive analytics will be in fact one of the main features of future IoT, intended to support optimization and added value, as generally it is not a problem to make software, but it is a huge challenge to make new performant algorithms for the optimization of the complex processes in IS/KBS. Including privacy, confidentiality and the intellectual property issues, the security requirements for IoT will be prominent and very difficult to comply, due to the complexity of interoperability conditions in a planetary network of networks. For implementing performant and complex IoT applications, the main ICT features which are required include: sensing and data collection capability; layers of local embedded processing capability;wired and/or wireless communication capability; software to automate tasks and enable new classes of services; remote network/cloud-based embedded processing capability; full security across all data and signal path. The paper main conclusion is that, in spite of the amazing performance of the automation/optimization processes implemented by „machines”, the risk of altering the human principles and values, by hazard or design errors, will increase and deep analyses and research must be further performed in order to assure a consistent and secure development of IoT applications for optimizing IS/KBS on long term.
L63|Facing IoT - The New Giant Wave of the Information and Communications Technologies Development|The paper main goal is to systemic analyze an emergent field of the information and communications technologies (ICT), the Internet of things (IoT). Starting from premises as the mass proliferation and the „giant wave” of IoT in the larger context of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) exponential evolution in the Information society (IS) toward Knowledge Based Society (KBS), which penetrates and transform almost anything, the paper identifyed and analyzed the essential implications/conditions of IoT development at Earth scale: the main driving factors(DFAC), resources(RES) and challenges(CHA). For DFAC, a systemic criteria, generally for ICT evolution and then for IoT development, would be to follow simplicity and essential needs rules when expanding, because despite all expected benefits of any application, especially when large numbers are expected, negative consequences could refer to Earth resources fading, climate changes (CO2 footprint at planetary scale), humankind healthy/secure evolution or World social unbalances. A special focus is on health, because despite the real amazing achievements IoT could bring, considering the actual ones, we have to watch the IoT development as some products/services and facilities could directly or indirectly harm humankind healthy evolution. For RES and CHA, the technical essential implications/conditions of developing IoT at Earth scale are analized. Here IoT as a Big network of networks, Big Data processing, the survival of Moore Law and power/energy sources were analyzed pointing the corresponding main challenges and solutions perspectives. Finally, among the big „Questions” concerning the main challenges of IoT development, the paper adresses the complex field of educational consequences, concluding on the tremendous influence of IoT/ICT in IS/KBS on humankind evolution and emphasizing the capacity to optimally use the technological progress (first considering the Internet) and the creative potential – which eventually influences innovation and...ICT.
L63|R&D spillovers and information exchange: a case study|R&D spillovers can be viewed to arise as a result of a voluntary information exchange between firms. In this paper we extend this theory of R&D spillovers to a context where the spillover effect is on R&D dollars and occurs in a vertical relationship. We show how the exchange of information is more likely to take place in industries with a more extensive product differentiation. Our model predicts that the maximum incentives to exchange information can be found from the vertically related industries. Finally, we present a historical case study on an information-exchange agreement between Micronas and Micro Power Systems so as to support the predictions of the model.

L63|Overseas factories, domestic employment, and technological hollowing out: a case study of Samsung’s mobile phone business|Analysing the case of Samsung Electronics’ mobile phone business, this paper examines the effects of establishing factories abroad on domestic jobs and the issue of technological hollowing out. The offshoring of mobile phone assembly to China, India, Brazil and Vietnam did not result in a reduction of domestic jobs. On the contrary, Samsung’s domestic employment increased from 5960 persons in 2002 to 20,500 in 2012. This increase mainly reflects a net increase in high-paying jobs (R&D, engineering, design, marketing) while the number of low-paying jobs (assembly) remained stagnant. To cope with possible technological hollowing out, Samsung kept its core engineers/technicians in a special unit, instead of firing them, whenever domestic assembly lines were reduced or foreign lines were established. They were kept inside the so-called “global manufacturing technology center,” with the number of its employees increasing from 80 in 2006 to more than 1103 in 2011. These employees visit overseas factories to conduct activities such as maintenance, monitoring, re-modeling of assembly lines, and automation. In terms of strategy, Samsung engages in offshoring, but not outsourcing. This is in contrast to Apple which does both offshoring and outsourcing by contracting with Foxconn.

L63|The layers of the IT Agreement's trade impact|"The WTO's plurilateral Information Technology Agreement (ITA) reduced tariffs to zero on many IT products. This paper presents a comprehensive study of its trade impacts by incorporating recent insights from both the global value chain (GVC) and time in trade literatures. Inserting tariffs directly into the gravity equation breaks the ITAs impact down into four layers. Import demand elasticities are found to be non-linear: Tariff reduction (layer 1) has relatively small impacts, while complete tariff elimination (layer 2) has high impacts, especially for intermediate goods. Beyond that, ITA accession has positive non-tariff effects on both imports (layer 3) and exports (layer 4). These commitment effects suggest that higher trade policy certainty affects investment and sourcing decisions in favour of signatories: Their ITA exports performed better relative to other ICT and machinery exports, unlike non-members. But ""passive signatories"" - which joined mainly as a by-product of a larger policy objective - reaped the most benefits. Featuring a smaller ITA sector upon accession, their final good exports increased also in absolute terms due to downstream GVC integration. However, such impacts are strongly heterogeneous with respect to countries' geographical remoteness, education levels, business environment and institutions. China stands out with especially strong post-accession export increases, also extending to intermediate goods."
L63|Defacto and Deeded Intellectual Property: Knowledge-Driven Co-Evolution of Firm Collaboration Boundaries and IPR Stragtegy|"Research on intellectual property has focused on formal legally recorded rights that we call deeded, most often measured by granted patents. Meanwhile, other ""defacto"" IP (mainly purposive secrecy and natural excludability) has become more important because of the increasing closeness of commercial technologies to cutting edge science. A ""corporate-academic"" model has developed and become institutionalized over the last three decades which emphasizes attracting the best and brightest scientists, providing them with a commensurate increase in autonomy including initiation of bench-level collaborations with top university scientists in which valuable tacit knowledge is transferred in both directions. We provide suggestive evidence that both firm and university scientists learn from these collaborations, e.g., both types of scientists experience sharply higher patenting rates once they have engage in university-firm collaborations. We propose and test two indicators of adoption of the corporate-academic model, whether or not the firm has ever: (a) co-authored an article with a university scientist and (b) applied for (an eventually granted) patent with non-patent references, where these references are used importantly to cite scientific articles and other scientific materials. Both were robustly positive and statistically significant across four measures of U.S. high-tech firm success (publishing, patenting, obtaining venture capital, and going public) for six broad S&T areas (bio/chem/med, information technology, nanotechnology, semiconductors, other science, and other engineering). Star scientists publication as or with firm employees, SBIR grants received, and citation-weighted patents and articles all played comparatively supporting roles in the empirical estimates. We concluded that the most successful high-tech firms have adopted a strategy of operating near the edge of the scientific envelope where high levels of tacit knowledge provide substantial natural excludability reducing or preventing entry of imitators."

Using unique data from the iPhone application ecosystem, we examine how the development of ""killer apps"" (apps appearing in the top grossing rank) varies by market and app characteristics. We find that previous app experience and no updating increase the likelihood of becoming a killer game app, while more updates increase the likelihood of becoming a non-game killer app. Development opportunities, level of competition, and demand preferences are possible drivers of the opposing innovation process results in game and non-game markets."
L63|Price, Quality, and Variety: Measuring the Gains from Trade in Differentiated Products|This paper explores the gains from trade in differentiated products from three channels: decreases in price, improvements in quality, and increases in variety. Using data on Indian imports of computer printers from 1996 to 2005, a period of trade liberalization, I find that quality was the leading source of welfare gains. Consumers would require a 65 percent decrease in all 1996 prices to be as well off as they were with the quality available in 2005. The contribution of price was slightly smaller, while variety lagged farther behind. These effects varied across buyers, as gains were largest for small businesses.
L63|From Hierarchy to Market: the Changing Industrial Organization of Epistemic Communities During Hong Kongs Transition to a Cashless Society (1965-2005)|This paper documents how computer technology modified retail financial markets in Hong Kong in the period from the 1960s to the early 2000s. The forty years after the deployment of Hong KongÕs first computer in 1965, saw a dramatic change in retail banking technology as Hong Kong moved towards being a cashless society. Prior to that pivotal year, none of the colonyÕs banks used computers whilst retail customers accessed their liquid balances via cash and cheques and only during banking hours. Over time, the ways in which people spent money became more diverse and transformed with the advent of technologies such as the ATM, point of purchase debit card terminals, the Octopus chip, and mobile phone payments. One could construct a straightforward narrative arc that links the acquisition of HSBCÕs first computer in 1967 to the proliferation of electronic payment systems in the twenty-first century. Such a narrative, however, would obscure an important discontinuity in the history of retail payment technology. In the early stages of Hong KongÕs transition to the cashless society, the relevant technologies were installed and managed within the boundaries of large financial intuitions such as HSBC. The second episode discussed in this paper is the successful launch of a micro-payments solution called ÒOctopusÓ. Initially designed as a transport payments card, cash balances stored within a smart chip grew outside financial institutions to become the leading payment solution in small value transactions. Over the course of the period covered by this article, the industrial organization of the relevant technologies transformed as the provision of much of the technology for retail payments had been outsourced to non-bank, non-financial institutions. In other words, the industrial organization of the relevant technologies had been transformed. This paper seeks to account for this shift in the organization of payments technology by drawing on literature around the boundaries of the firm as well as the theory of the firm as an epistemic community. It will be suggested that this process of vertical disintegration (i.e., a shift from hierarchy to markets) took place because of changes in the underlying conditions in Hong KongÕs economy.
L63|Information & communication technology and true real GDP: economic analysis and findings for selected countries|The expansion of information & communication technology (ICT) is continuing in OECD countries and the world economy – partly due to the ongoing fall of relative ICT prices. The continuing absolute fall of ICT prices and ICT capital prices, respectively, is not adequately considered in the standard analysis of ICT. In the study presented here the ICT investment-GDP ratio is calculated in real terms and it is shown that this ratio is higher (order of magnitude is about 2 percentage points) than the nominal investment-GDP ratio which is misleading the ICT sector, policy makers and society at large. Moreover, we take an innovative look at the digital time budget of private households in selected OECD countries. Assuming that 10 % represents the relevant share of the time budget the digital value-added of private households stands for an unrecorded digital value-added of 2–5 % of gross domestic product; with a share of 20 % of the household’s internet time budget devoted to value-added the hidden internet value-added in the US would be in the range of 4.7–10.4 %. Hence the overall understimation of the ICT sector’s contribution to GDP is considerable and therefore changes in official statistical analysis and the System of National Accounts are required.

L63|ICT Modernization in Central and Eastern Europe|The paper characterizes main trends in ICT implementation and diffusion in the CEE countries in terms of market volume, its dynamics, economic development and ICT trade integration within the EU market. This gives support to the hypothesis of gradual closing up of technology gap in ICT sector between the CEE and the ‘old’ EU countries in the course of the ongoing process of integration and catching up. The second part of the paper delivers a detailed account of the modernization level achieved in Poland and other CEE countries in particular ICT segments and score rankings as against other EU countries. The focus is on the relationship between NRI index, as a measure of ICT development, and GDP per capita, competitiveness and productivity. Finally, the level of ICT services in CEE is assessed, in particular, in the area of broadband, mobile telecommunication, and e-services.

Policymakers thus need a clear sense of the size and characteristics of digital businesses, but this is hard to do with conventional datasets and industry codes. This paper uses innovative ‘big data’ resources to perform an alternative analysis at company level, focusing on ICT-producing firms in the UK (which the UK government refers to as the ‘information economy’). Exploiting a combination of public, observed and modelled variables, we develop a novel ‘sectorproduct’ approach and use text mining to provide further detail on the activities of key sector-product cells. On our preferred estimates, we find that counts of information economy firms are 42% larger than SIC-based estimates, with at least 70,000 more companies. We also find ICT employment shares over double the conventional estimates, although this result is more speculative. Our findings are robust to various scope, selection and sample construction challenges. We use our experiences to reflect on the broader pros and cons of frontier data use.
L63|Deutsche Elektroindustrie – moderate Wachstumserwartungen für 2014|Eine Analyse von Andreas Gontermann, ZVEI, Frankfurt am Main, zeigt, dass ein Mangel an Aufträgen 2013 das größte Produktionshemmnis für die deutsche Elektroindustrie war. Die globale Wirtschaftsleistung sowie auch die Investitionstätigkeit in den Industrieländern haben sich im vergangenen Jahr schwächer entwickelt als im Jahr davor. Der Welthandel ist laut IWF 2013 um weniger als 3% gewachsen. Im inländischen Geschäft haben vor allem Unsicherheiten im Zusammenhang mit dem politischen Management der Energiewende belastet. 2014 sollte die deutsche Elektroindustrie aber wieder moderat zulegen.
L63|Markets with technological progress: pricing, quality, and novelty|Abstract New and old products differ in two respects: quality and newness. Whereas a higher quality of a new product always benefits consumers, the newness itself benefits some consumers, but not others, and for some, it is even a disadvantage. We capture these features in a Hotelling model of OverLapping Innovators (HOLI model), entailing a sequence of static Hotelling games of horizontal product differentiation (newness), that we extend by vertical product differentiation (quality). In this model, the firms compete on quality and price.
L63|Semiconductor industry cycles: Explanatory factors and forecasting|This paper aims to suggest the best forecasting model for the semiconductor market. A wide range of alternative modern econometric modeling approaches have been implemented, and a large variety of criteria and tests have been employed to assess the out-of-sample forecasting accuracy at various horizons. The results suggest that if a VECM can be an interesting source of information, the Bayesian models are superior forecasting tools compared to univariate and unrestricted VAR models. However, for decision makers a spectral method could be a useful tool, which can be easily implemented. In addition, MS-AR models make it possible to obtain valuable forecasts on turning-points in order to adjust the programming of heavy capital and research investments.

L63|Digital infrastructure and physical proximity|The notion of proximity is increasing in popularity in economic and geographic literature, and is now commonly used by scholars in regional science and spatial economics. Few academic works, however, have explored the link between regional development and proximity relations. This comprehensive book redresses the balance with its assessment of the role of, and obstacles caused by, proximity relations in regional development processes.
L63|I vettori dell’innovazione nei cluster europei dell’ICT|L’articolo analizza la concentrazione spaziale dei brevetti Ict in Europa, il ruolo delle risorse locali e dei fattori sociali nella promozione dell’innovazione. L’analisi empirica ha evidenziato che le agglomerazioni territoriali dell’innovazione nel settore Ict sono prevalentemente connesse a due variabili fondamentali: la disponibilità di capitale umano qualificato e il ruolo dell’organizzazione nelle incumbent firms. Queste due risorse sembrano potenziare i processi innovativi attraverso differenti dinamiche, strutturando due diversi modelli di innovazione a livello locale.
L63|Atanasoff’s invention input and early computing state of knowledge|This article investigates the dynamic relationship between a single pursue of an invention and the general US supply of similar activities in early computing during the 1930-1946 period. The objective is to illustrate how an early scientific state of knowledge affects the efficiency with which an theoretical effort is transformed into an invention. In computing, a main challenge in the pre-industrial phase of invention concerns the lack of or scattered demand for such ground-breaking inventions. I present historiographical evidences of the early stage of US computing providing an improved understanding of the dynamics of the supply of invention. It involves solving the alignment between a single inventor’s incentives to research with the suppliers of technology. This step conditions the constitution of a stock of technical knowledge, and its serendipitous but purposeful organisation.
L63|How Do Geographical and Organisational Proximity Influence the Relational Pattern of MNCs’ Global Innovation Networks: An In-depth Case Study|This paper explores the influencing mechanism of geographical and organisational proximity/distance on the intra-firm relations and external linkages in multinational companies’ (MNCs) global innovation networks (GINs). It adopts an in-depth case study method and employs social network analysis to study the relational pattern of the case GINs and to understand how the relations are organised and why they are organised in a certain pattern. It is found that the intra-firm relations of both case MNCs’ GINs are similarly organised in a global way. The external linkages in the two case GINs are organised in different ways (global vs local) which depend on the dominant knowledge is science-based or engineering-based. Two influencing mechanisms, namely complementary effect and conditional reinforcing effect, are found and discussed. Evidences in practice are identified.
L63|Models of Innovation in Global ICT Firms: The Emerging Global Innovation Ecosystems|This report focuses on the changing models of innovation adopted by some of the largest and most innovative global ICT companies in the world, including Apple, BT, Google, Microsoft, Skype, Telefonica and Vodafone. One of the main contributions of this report is to demonstrate that, in order to understand these innovation models, it is necessary at the same time to understand the dynamics of innovation at sector level. Beginning with an analysis of the innovation process in the ICT ecosystem, the author drills down into the company global innovation ecosystems that have been created by these global companies. In addition, he explores some of the implications that proliferating company global innovation ecosystems have for government policy. He concludes that whilst innovation is changing the world, changing global circumstances are in turn transforming the innovation model in companies, both large and small, around the world.
L63|Dynamics in ICT cooperation networks in selected German ICT clusters|High innovation capability is indispensable for generating economic growth in developed economies. Cooperations in the innovation process are entered into by companies for reasons of risk diversification or costs and often considered to be an efficient strategy to increase a company’s knowledge basis. Regional economic literature very often believes that regional agglomeration of companies, i.e. cluster formation, will also lead to increased local networking, i.e. also to cooperations between companies or between company and research institutes in the innovation process. A social network analysis of the two German ICT regions performed with patent data was able to show that cluster formation coincides with a dynamic increase of cooperations measured by joint patent applications. However, the cooperations are characterized by integration of extra-regional companies and research institutes rather than being intraregional. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014
L63|Metropolitan innovation, firm size, and business survival in a high-tech industry|This paper contributes to the growing body of business survival literature that focuses on regional determinants of the hazard faced by firms. Using parametric survival analysis, we test the effects of regional innovation on exit likelihood in the US computer and electronic product manufacturing during the 1992–2008 period. The novelty of our approach is in conditioning the effects of metropolitan innovation on firm size. Estimation results suggest a negative relationship between metropolitan patenting activity and survival of firms that started with 1–3 employees. This effect decreases if companies grow. Establishments with more than 4 employees at start-up are insensitive to metropolitan innovation, although size of firms that started with 4–9 employees improves their survival chances. These findings indicate that local knowledge spillovers do not translate into lower hazard. The negative relationship indicates either a creative destruction regime or decisions of entrepreneurs to shut down existing ventures in order to pursue other opportunities.

L63|How did the Japanese Employment System Change?Investigating the Heterogeneity of Downsizing Practices across Firms|Beyond the general issue of institutional change at the aggregate level, some studies have shown that the diversity of Japanese firms has increased since the late 1990s, both in terms of performance and organization. This paper contributes to this literature by investigating the evolving employment practices at the firm level. In mobilizing a database of listed manufacturing firms, we focus on the evolution of the speed of downsizing between the 1990s and the 2000s. A specificity of our paper is that we do not limit our analysis to the introduction of individual effects but we rather resort to a Bayesian estimation procedure, which yields to (firm-specific) individual forecasts of the parameters of the adjustment process modelled with random coefficients. The first major result we get is a decreasing average speed of downsizing, contrary to what is found in a simple estimation with individual effects. Second, we confirm the increasing heterogeneity of Japanese firms between the 1990s and the 2000s, through a rising dispersion of the speed of downsizing. Third, we are able, from a descriptive viewpoint to identify some characteristics of firms with different speed of downsizing.

L63|Being efficient to stay strong in a weak economy. The case of calabrian manufacturing firms|The aim of this work is to study the efficiency of firms operating in Calabria, a small and economically-lagging Italian region. The analysis is carried out by estimating a stochastic production frontier for an unbalanced panel of manufacturing firms which are observed over the 1998-2006 period. Results show that the efficiency score is, on average, about 60%. A declining trend is observed over the last three-year period, 2004-2006. Moreover, firm efficiency increases with firm age and when firms export. Inconclusive evidence is found for the role of investments in ICT and R&D. This is not very surprising given that private effort in technological activities is extremely low in Calabria (private R&D intensity was less than 0.075% of regional GDP in 2010).
L63|High Power Two- Stage Class-AB/J Power Amplifier with High Gain and Efficiency|This paper presents a hybrid Broadband power amplifier which provides high drain efficiency. AB and J, Two Classes of power amplifier are described using GaN HEMT with matching networks together with input and output compact elements. Using Load Pull method, the best input and output network in the central frequency of 3GHz for output power of 40dBm, 10dB high gain and high efficiency of 80%, has been designed. After describing the design of each of the amplifiers and comparing their performance, the proposed circuit, two-class AB/J are discussed to be the target of the circuit design, reducing the input power to achieve high efficiency output power and gain. Input and output matching proposed circuit elements in terms of theory and simulation are compared, and the results of both investigations were similar. Also, the fundamental harmonic and the second harmonic in the 0.5GHz bandwidth have the desirable amplitude of the output signal.
L63|Information and communications technologies are learning from nature’s “research” to push the performance limits|The paper analyzes the way information and communications technologies (ICT) faces the actual challenges for their development, starting from the fact that science and technology power is generally recognized as the main factor of human kind progress in the last centuries, but ICT have a huge role in refining the dynamic legacy knowledge -the support of developing information society (IS) toward knowledge based society (KBS). ICT premises to enable “the technology power to do more good than bad” in the IS/KBS, exceeding the ICT field and lending a power instrument of analysis and management for actual most complex decision processes on Earth, are also analyzed, as not few literature discussed the two edge force of science and technology. On the other hand, the paper analyzes the actual context where ICT must bring new approaches/innovations, answering to the major challenge of pushing the performance limits and then expanding them to all other scientific and technological fields, especially in this crucial phase of apogee/decline they are facing because of soon reaching physical limits of conventional semiconductor technologies and Earth resources fading. The paper main conclusion, after presenting some actual technological examples and premises, is that using the million years nature’s research in living things is perhaps the best way to identify some ideas for the long expected revolutionary optimal technologies humankind and Earth need.
L63|Context Aware Communications and IT - A New Paradigm for the Optimization of the Information Society towards the knowledge Based Society (Part 1)|The paper approaches an emergent field of the information and communications technologies (ICT), the context-aware communications and information technology (CACIT). The way CACIT generates a new paradigm for the ICT development optimization, the driving force of the information society (IS) toward knowledge based society (KBS), due to CACIT features and influence factors, is analyzed. The analysis reveals that CACIT has a huge potential, as it is based on the incommensurable expansion force of digital space (DS), which is generated by the digital technologies (DT) associated mainly with ICT. In order to identify the development mechanisms of CACIT, the paper first identifies the DS features and driving factors, where human imagination plays a prominent role, as DS covers practically all humankind activity fields and this way the applications are limited only by the Earth resources and DT limits, which is not the case of imagination. An important result of the analysis is the identification of the CACIT main evolution steps, starting from the early human context-aware communications based on the five senses, which are still driving the actual principal development directions of the applications. On the other hand, although the paper space does not allow a detailed analysis of the CACIT main classes of applications and developing principles, some relevant examples of such CACIT classes are presented, where healthcare is a zero priority (largely analyzed) which turns back the benefit of CACIT to its main inspiration source represented by the people. Other analyzed relevant classes of CACIT include the GPS applications and the management of moving objects or living things (cars, trucks, cows etc.) based on GPS and wireless communications. The paper main conclusion is that CACIT will essential contribute on large scale to the optimization of IS/KBS by a multitude of criteria, including time, Earth resources, healthcare and ... the creative potential – which then will also leverage...human imagination.
L63|Context-Aware Communications and IT - A New Paradigm for the Optimization of the Information Society towards the knowledge Based Society (Part 2)|The paper continue the analysis (made in Part1) of an emergent field of the information and communications technologies (ICT), the context-aware communications and information technology (CACIT). Important results of the analysis include the identification of the main CACIT development purposes/applications as expansions/ additions for human senses (including vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch and sensation of temperature, gravity, acceleration , magnetic/electric field, approach of environment objects), health (vital signs, health parameters, mood, schedule, habitus etc.) or social relations (available relations/persons, group activity, communication etc.). Results refer also to the most important and dynamic fields for IS/KBS, where CACIT applications will continue to be extended with the exponential pace of ICT, will include available interesting applications context (hot spots, emergency, health, commercial, financial, entertainment etc.). The paper also presents CACIT main evolution steps, starting from the early human context-aware communications based on the five senses and ends to the most complex applications where the borders between CACIT and ICT are blurring, as the added information they collect from environment (context) dramatically improves this way the force (efficiency) and the development potential of the original CIT resource. The main conclusion reveals the improvement of humankind perception by the smart behaviour in any nature context or activity, enabling adaptation, intelligence and efficiency, but, on the other hand, shows that CACIT has a huge potential to improve intrinsic ICT applications, as communications or computing-aware systems.
L63|Agglomeration economies and firm R&D efforts: an analysis of China’s electronics and telecommunications industries|China is on the way toward an innovation-oriented economy as well as a manufacturing powerhouse. R&D investments play a central role in improving China’s industrial competitiveness. This study conducts empirical analysis to test the role of agglomeration economies in R&D efforts using plant-level data of the electronic and telecommunication equipment manufacturing industry in 2007. Statistical results suggest that both localization and urbanization economies significantly affect firm R&D. Downstream sectors are the major driving force of business R&D. Downstream firms are more likely to generate externalities than upstream ones. Upstream and midstream agglomerations even generate negative externalities due to preemption.

L63|Micromachining - Review of Literature from 1980 to 2010|Trend of miniaturization of products and consequently its components nowadays can be evident in almost every production field. To accomplish requirements imposed by miniaturization micromachining proved to be a satisfied manufacturing technique. Herein the term micromachining refers to mechanical micro cutting techniques where material is removed by geometrically determined cutting edges. The aim of this review article is to summarize existing knowledge and highlight current challenges, restrictions and advantages in the field of micromachining.
L63|Vertical Integration and Exclusivity in Platform and Two-Sided Markets|This paper measures the impact of vertically integrated and exclusive software on industry structure and welfare in the sixth-generation of the US video game industry (2000-2005). I specify and estimate a dynamic model of both consumer demand for hardware and software products, and software demand for hardware platforms. I use estimates to simulate market outcomes had platforms been unable to own or contract exclusively with software. Driven by increased software compatibility, hardware and software sales would have increased by 7 percent and 58 percent and consumer welfare by $1.5 billion. Gains would be realized only by the incumbent, suggesting exclusivity favored the entrant platforms.
L63|Of Smart Phone Wars and Software Patents|Among the main criticisms currently confronting the US Patent and Trademark Office are concerns about software patents and what role they play in the web of litigation now proceeding in the smart phone industry. We will examine the evidence on the litigation and the treatment by the Patent Office of patents that include software elements. We present specific empirical evidence regarding the examination by the Patent Office of software patents, their validity, and their role in the smart phone wars. More broadly, this article discusses the competing values at work in the patent system and how the system has dealt with disputes that, like the smart phone wars, routinely erupt over time, in fact dating back to the very founding of the United States. The article concludes with an outlook for systematic policymaking within the patent system in the wake of major recent legislative and administrative reforms. Principally, the article highlights how the US Patent Office acts responsibly when it engages constructively with principled criticisms and calls for reform, as it has during the passage and now implementation of the landmark Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011.
L63|A theory of the availability and level of consumer protection in online and mobile payments for public economic services|The mainstay of the paper is formed by an analysis of the factors that influence the community use of mobile payment for e-Government services, the use of mobile payment for the exchange of government goods and services, the types of e-Government services for which mobile payment is suitable, and real and perceived risks associated with mobile financial services. This paper presents a theory of the level of consumer protection and especially the availability of online payment systems and mobile public economic services, and highlights the use of Internet technology to provide effective and efficient public services. We underline the need to configure citizen-centric government services, accessibility challenges associated with the use of mobile, and diverse and transient nature of mobile technology use.
L63|A Model of Technological Progress in the Microprocessor Industry|This paper develops a model of technological progress in the microprocessor industry that connects the seemingly disparate engineering and economic measures of technological progress. Technological progress in the microprocessor industry is driven by the repeated adoption of higher quality vintages of capital equipment produced by the upstream semiconductor equipment industry. The model characterizes the optimal adoption decision of a microprocessor firm and the resulting rate of technological progress. In conjunction with parameters estimated using a new dataset of the microprocessor industry, the model suggests explanations for the acceleration in technological progress during 1990-2000 and the subsequent slowdown.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L63|ICT and Economic Development:Conclusion from IO Analysis for Selected ASEAN Member States|The impact of information and communications technology (ICT) on economic performance has been an interesting issue in economics. There are at least three key points that can be learnt from the previous literatures regarding ICT and country’s economic performance. First, more developed countries are expected to benefit greater than less developed countries. Second, the impact of ICT will depend on the intensity of ICT utilization. Third, the size and structure of ICT sector of country’s economy does matter. The main contribution of this paper is to evaluate those three points by conducting comparative analysis based on Input-Output (I-O) Table from four ASEAN Member States, namely Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. ASEAN is used because it is one of the regional associations that have a large income gap among its members. The results suggest that more developed countries (which are measured by income per capita) do not always benefit greater than less developed countries from ICT development. The magnitude of ICT impact on the economy depends on the intensity of ICT utilization and the structure of ICT sector
L63|ICT Investment and Internationalization of the Russian Economy|In this paper the influence of ICT investments on the international activities of Russia is analyzed. Firstly, ICT investments are considered as a factor of the international competitiveness of the Russian economy (in comparison with some other countries). Dynamics of both export volumes and openness of national economies are used as the main criteria for comparison. Then, the role of ICT in the development of international activities on the regional level is analysed. Cluster analysis is performed for the set of data on the Russian regions. Finally, the accession of Russia to the WTO is considered in the context of the development of the ICT sector and the international activities of the Russian economy.
L63|Are Ex Ante and Ex Post Licensing Agreements Useful Instruments to Lessen Uncertainty in R&D?|In the last decades, technologies became more complex which increased the degree of uncertainty in R&D. To overcome the uncertainty, firms frequently engage in R&D collaborations, e.g., Research Joint Ventures (RJVs), and licensing agreements. While RJVs are well explored in the literature, very little is known about the use of licensing agreements. Building on a novel database which includes licensing agreements in the semiconductor industry between 1989 and 1999, we estimate a bivariate probit model with self-selection. Our estimation results highlight the fact that firms’ relatedness in technology and product markets determine their choices to engage in ex ante and ex post licensing agreements. Our study provides evidence that the decision to engage in ex ante and ex post licensing is formulated with regard to uncertainty in R&D. While ex ante licensing agreements serve as a useful mechanism to insure against uncertainty in R&D, ex post licensing agreements rather serve as an instrument to resolve uncertainty in R&D. Hence, licensing agreements are appropriate instruments to lessen R&D uncertainty.
L63|Deutsche Elektroindustrie – Rückblick 2012 und Ausblick 2013|Eine Analyse von Andreas Gontermann, ZVEI, Frankfurt am Main, zeigt, dass 2012 für die deutsche Elektroindustrie insgesamt ein eher verhaltenes Jahr war. Produktion und Umsatz haben sich leicht rückläufig entwickelt. Die Exporte haben hingegen eine weitere Rekordmarke erzielt, und die Beschäftigung befindet sich auf einem Zehnjahreshoch. 2013 dürfte die deutsche Elektroproduktion wieder moderat wachsen. Vor allem aufgrund ihrer Innovationskraft bleiben die mittel- bis langfristigen Aussichten für die Branche weiterhin günstig.
L63|Deutsche Elektroindustrie – Erwartung zunehmender Dynamik im Jahresverlauf|Die deutsche Elektroindustrie ist kaum besser in das Jahr 2013 gestartet, als sie 2012 hinter sich gelassen hat. Zwischen Januar und Februar dieses Jahres haben die Bestellungen ihren Vorjahresstand noch einmal um 3% unterschritten. Gleichzeitig sind die preisbereinigte Produktion und der Umsatz jeweils um 5% gegenüber Vorjahr zurückgegangen. Die Branchenentwicklung bleibt damit, nach Ansicht von Andreas Gontermann, ZVEI – Zentralverband Elektrotechnik- und Elektronikindustrie e.V., Frankfurt am Main, vorerst verhalten.
L63|Understanding Innovation in Production Networks in East Asia|ï»¿This paper explores the â€œblack boxâ€ of innovation in the electronics production network in East Asia through a mapping exercise of technological capabilities and an econometric analysis of exporting in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (PRC), Thailand, and the Philippines. Technology-based approaches to trade offer a plausible explanation for firm-level exporting behavior and complement the literature on production networks. The econometric results confirm the importance of foreign ownership and innovation in increasing the probability of exporting in electronics. Higher levels of skills, managersâ€™ education, and capital also matter in the PRC as well as accumulated experience in Thailand. Furthermore, a technology index composed of technical functions performed by firms (to represent technological capabilities) emerges as a more robust indicator of innovation than the research and development (R&D) to sales ratio. Accordingly, technological effort in electronics in these countries mostly focuses on assimilating and using imported technologies rather than formal R&D by specialized engineers.

L63|Inventory change, capacity utilization and the semiconductor industry cycle|This paper aims to investigate the relationship between inventory change and the industry cycle in a deeper way. The nonlinear, two-state, trivariate, Markov regime-switching model developed in this paper which includes inventory change, capacity utilization and chip sales not only obtains satisfactory out-of-sample forecasts of the probability of the industry being in recession, but also, through the regimes identified by the model, provides interesting stories of dynamics within the industry and new evidence that the change in semiconductor inventory is in fact countercyclical with respect to chip sales.
L63|The magnitude of innovation by demand in a sectoral system: The role of industrial users in semiconductors|How relevant is innovation by demand compared to innovation by other actors in a sector? In quantitative terms, this is a yet unanswered question. The current study fills this major gap in the literature on industry studies. By taking a sectoral system perspective, this study is able to highlight the magnitude of innovation by intermediate user firms in a high technology sector: semiconductors. Using a combination of different datasets – patents, co-patents, R&D alliances and new ventures in semiconductors – this study proposes a novel quantitative approach to assessing the magnitude of innovative activity by user firms. The study reaches several findings. First, the magnitude of innovation by user firms, as measured by patents, is high in both absolute and relative terms compared to semiconductor firms and other actors in the sector. Second, the distribution of patents among different demand segments is highly uneven. Third, innovative user firms are highly heterogeneous in terms of size, diversification and vertical integration. Fourth, collaboration in R&D and co-patenting activity in semiconductors take place not just between user firms and semiconductor firms, but also among user firms themselves. Fifth, innovative user firms are quite active in entrepreneurial activity in semiconductors and their new ventures, on average, survive longer than spin-offs or other start-ups.
L63|Knowledge patterns and sources of leadership: Mapping the semiconductor miniaturization trajectory|This article examines the technological capabilities that national organizations generated and accumulated throughout the long-term evolution of the miniaturization trajectory, the main direction of technological change in the semiconductor industry. Having built an original dataset of patents granted between 1976 and 2008, and using three algorithms for the analysis of citation networks, we first map the pattern of technological knowledge underlying the advancement of the miniaturization trajectory. We identify three different dimensions of that pattern and characterize them in terms of distinctive knowledge properties. Second, we analyse the geographical and organizational distribution of the knowledge pattern. The results provide evidence of significant differences in the technological capabilities of national organizations, as revealed by the magnitude and properties of the technological knowledge that those organizations generated over time. We find, inter alia, that while US organizations remained strong throughout the whole time period, the capabilities of European organizations were considerably eroded in the most recent years by the emergence of latecomer Asian countries like South Korea and Taiwan.
L63|Poli tecnologici meridionali, sviluppo e politiche industriali|The paper investigates the main characteristics of the most relevant high-tech industrial districts (or clusters) located in the South of Italy and analyzes the public policies that aim to support their development. Section one, which draws on a wide survey to describe both the start-up process and the growth pattern of these industrial clusters, highlights that several factors, in particular the presence of a large firm, the availability of specific human capital and the existence of dense networks between firms and research centres, play a central role in shaping their evolution patterns. Section two assesses the industrial and technology policies, stressing their limits and implementation difficulties. The third and last section suggests how the policymakers can make use of these insights to foster and improve the development of high-tech industrial districts.
L63|Price and Quality Dispersion in an Offshoring Market: Evidence from Semiconductor Production Services|This paper studies price and quality differences across international intermediate input suppliers. We develop price measures that account for (i) differences in product characteristics, (ii) unobserved quality differences, and (iii) pure (frictional) price dispersion across suppliers. Using uniquely detailed transaction- level data from the semiconductor industry, we document large average price differences across suppliers for observationally identical products, and find that price differentials close over the product life cycle. We interpret this finding in a model where buyers face costs of switching suppliers. The theory demonstrates how to use the observed price dynamics to adjust prices for unobserved quality differences across suppliers. The results of this analysis reveal that pure price dispersion and unobserved quality differences are both important in this market. These two features make it difficult to construct constant-quality import price indexes, which generally assume away pure price dispersion. We document the resulting upward bias in standard price indexes, develop a quality-adjusted index for semiconductor fabrication, and propose a general method for bounding the true constant-quality price index.

L63|Les stratégies de forum-shopping et de law-shopping en droit de la concurrence : Applications aux contentieux entre AMD et Intel (2000-2010)|A long-term litigation has opposed AMD to Intel, the dominant firm in the chips market. The first reproached the second pricing practices aiming at excluding it from the market on another basis than a competition on the merits. Intel was accused of implemented an anticompetitive strategy through its retroactive loyalty rebates, which incited PC constructors to accept tacit exclusive supply contracts. Our purpose does not consist in assessing the anticompetitive nature of such schemes or in evaluating to what extent they are detrimental to consumer welfare. We propose to consider the judicial strategy implemented by AMD. It lodged several complaints in numerous jurisdictions. Complaints were filled abroad (Japan, Republic of Korea, European Union), in some US States, before the Antitrust Division of the DoJ, before the FTC and through the private enforcement of the Sherman Act. Economic literature, especially the Chicago School, highlights, for ages, the risk of misuses of Antitrust Laws in order to impair competition. Such nuisance suits could take benefit from multiple, parallel of sequential complaints before different courts. Being successful in a first dispute before a more favorable or a less exigent (in terms of standard of proof) judicial arena could favor the plaintiff in a second trial or incite the defendant to accept to settle the dispute. Our paper analyzes the different between AMD and Intel in the perspective of such forum shopping strategies and tries to evaluate their consequences in terms of collective welfare.
L63|Information Technology And Productivity Growth In Islamic Countries|The aim of this research is the study of information and communication technology effects on productivity in Islamic countries. We have applied a balanced panel data model. Hausman (1978) test shows that we should apply fixed effects model. We have estimated our model for Islamic countries for the period of 1990-2010. The results show that gross domestic product, openness, human capital, capital formation, labor force and information and communication technology have positive impact on productivity. Therefore, these countries can increase their productivity with augmentation of expenditures on ICT.
L63|Formation of supply chain collaboration and firm performance in the Thai automotive and electronics industries|This paper examines factors that encourage firms to go into supply chain collaborations (SCC) and relationships between SCC and supply chain performances (SCP), using a questionnaire survey on Thai automotive and electronics industries in 2012. OLS regression results show firms established supplier evaluation and audit system, system of rewards for high-performance supplier and long-term transactions with their supply chain partners under a competitive pressure are more closely cooperate with these partners on information sharing and decision synchronization. Instrumental variables regression indicates SCC arisen from competitive pressure, supplier evaluation and audit, a system of rewards for high-performance supplier and long-term relationship causally influence SCP such as on-time delivery, responsiveness to fast procurement, flexibility to customer need, and profit.
L63|Supply chain collaboration and responsiveness : a comparison between Thai automotive and electronics industries|This paper examines factors that promote firms to develop supply chain collaborations (SCC) with their partners and relationships between SCC and supply chain operational performances (SCOP), using a questionnaire survey on Thai automotive and electronics industries in 2012. This paper also carries out a comparative study on these questions between the electronics and automotive industries. Two-stage least squares (2SLS) regressions verifY that supplier evaluation and audit is a foundation for firms to share information and synchronize decision makings with their partners, and that such SCC are significantly related to SCOP indictors such as on-time delivery, fast procurement, and flexibility to customer need irrespective of industry type. On the other hand, competitive pressure motivates only electronics firms to develop sec in order to be more innovative.
L63|Platforms and firm capabilities : a study of emerging global value chains|"This paper discusses globalization’s impact on production and distribution systems in emerging economies. On one hand, globalization has resulted in an increasing number of multinational corporations to adopt a platform strategy for their customers in emerging markets. On the other hand, developing countries have witnessed the integration of an increasing number of traditional marketplaces into a powerful distribution system, characterized as a specialized market system. Consequently, an unique industrial organization has developed in emerging economies, regarded as emerging global value chains (EGVCs). They comprise a large number of small firms together with a small number of large platform providers and display the ""market"" type general governance patterns. Firms in EGVCs are more likely to realize functional upgrading and grow into strong lead firms."
L63|Regional determinants of ICT new firm formation|The role of regional determinants in new entrepreneurs’ location decisions is analyzed in the French information and communication technologies (ICT) sector. As we focus on the emergence of this industry, our dataset includes every new ICT firm in France in the period 1993–2001. We find evidence for the positive effect of co-location with incumbent ICT firms and some effect of knowledge spillovers. The effects of agglomeration, entrepreneurial capital and human capital are mixed. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2013
L63|Aspects Concerning the Adoption Cloud Computing Services by Companies|"Companies' need to streamline their costs, especially in the current crisis, has led to the search for solutions to reduce the expenses with specialized personnel, licenses purchase, investment in equipment, amortization of these costs and other expenses related to their maintenance. The complex informatics systems, often expensive, especially SMEs, are desired as possible investment in the future. One solution may be the adoption ""cloud computing"" technology and the companies will pay only the services they need when they need. The concept of ""cloud computing"", provides a number of economic advantages to any company regardless of size, but their fears in adopting such services are related to compliance with the legal regulations, security, data recovery for business continuity in the event of losses due to some technical problems."
L63|Price and quality dispersion in an offshoring market: evidence from semiconductor production services|We study cross-country differences in price and quality in the market for semiconductor wafer manufacturing services. Using a proprietary transaction-level data set, we document i) substantial constant-quality price differences across suppliers, and ii) shifts toward lower priced suppliers. Chinese producers on average charged 17% less than leading Taiwanese producers for otherwise identical products and increased their market share by 14.7 percentage points. The extent of cross-country price dispersion is also diminishing over a product's life. A model with costs of switching suppliers is consistent with these pricing dynamics and can sustain realistic quality-adjusted price dispersion.
L63|Quantifying the Impacts of Digital Rights Management and E-Book Pricing on the E-Book Reader Market| The demand for electronic books (e-books) and the e-book readers are complementary. On the one hand, the emergence of e-book readers such as Amazon's Kindle has triggered the recent growth of the e-book market. On the other hand, several issues in the e-book market can affect the future of the e-book reader market. Considering this complementarity, this paper quantifies the impact of digital rights management (DRM) and discounted e-book pricing on the demand for e-book readers. We collect conjoint survey data to estimate a random coefficient demand model using a hierarchical Bayesian method. Our counterfactual experiments suggest two things. First, Kindle's and Nook's market shares would increase by dropping DRM. Consumer welfare would increase seven percent if all e-book readers dropped DRM. Second, an increase in e-book prices would increase iPad's market share at the expense of that of Kindle and Nook. Consumer welfare would decrease 6 to 10 percent if Kindle's and Nook's e-book prices went up by 50 percent.
L63|Study Information Decision Underlying|The paper aims to study the different types of information used in decision making. We also analyzed the levels of aggregation, management and softwares that process these types of information. The study started from the fact that data underlying the decision are increasingly complex, and the management should focus on the essence of the decision process and not on the structure and complexity of data. The author clarifyies the concept of information in relation to the data. At the end of the paper the author proposes an approach for analysis data underlying the decision.
L63|Technological and market capabilities and competitiveness in the Brazilian computer industry:a case study|The computer market in Brazil is dominated by domestic private companies that compete with large multinational companies. This study aims, based on the case of Positivo Informatics, to discuss how national companies can compete in complex markets accumulating technological and non-technological competences. The theory on technological paradigms allows dividing the world computer industry into two groups: the companies that master the paradigm core, responsible for pushing forward the technological frontier; and the companies whose competences are focused on complementary elements of the paradigm. The analysis of Positivo Informatics shows that the elements providing it with competitiveness do not depend on its technological competences. The elements that keep the industry competitive are derived from the expansion of consumption among lower classes and company specialization in this population. We conclude that, in Brazil, the computer industry keeps being competitive without developing technological competences.
L63|High Tech and Mezzogiorno: Industrial Development and Public Policies|We study six high tech areas in the Mezzogiorno through in-depth field research. The starting point of these industrial systems is always the opening of a large new plant owned by a large firm. Other large firms follow, together with new locally-owned small and medium enterprises. These developments are due only in part to subcontracting,qualified human capital being the key issue (with a circular causal relationship with firm good performance), together with new research activities, both inside the firm and in cooperation with the local Universities. Public policies are crucial. However, the effectiveness of national industrial policies has declined, with growing uncertainties for the future.
L63|Foreign Investments and Local Development: The ICT System in the Province of L’Aquila|"The ICT production system that can be identified in the Province of L’Aquila consists of two segments: the remains of the L’Aquila electronic hub, which has been in crisis since the eighties, and the Marsican area, dominated by the Micron plant. Both clusters were generated by the ""extraordinary intervention"" policies for the Mezzogiorno, and are exposed to strong international competition in the challenging circumstances brought about by the 2009 earthquake. Firms in the system have fruitful relations with the University of L’Aquila and other research centres, but their links with the local economy are weak. Regional policies aim at creating an innovation pole led by Micron."
L63|The Pace Of The Development In Communications And Information Technologies Is Driving The Information Society To Yesterdayâ€™S Incredible Steps|The paper presents an analysis of the detailed mechanisms and models implied in the actual development of communication and information technologies (CIT), as the main factors which determine the pace of (CIT) and its major consequences on Information Society (IS.) The main issues of analysis are focused on identifying some deep links between CIT developmentâ€™s models and pace, on one hand, and IS radical progress steps, on the other hand. The prominent result of this analysis is reflected in a 3-dimensional global influence (volume of changes) on IS as model: horizontal diversity of activity fields, vertical/depth of the changes in the field and time - by the period and speed of the generated influence. On the issue of CIT development the paper includes the new approach of the 3-D transistor, developed by Intel and other important players, because this model comes with the extension from the planar model (2 dimensions) to the spatial 3-D model and so the number of transistors on chip could be radically increased, as an essential support for the integration capacity on the chip (the storage capacity) that must face the exadata era by speed, memory and computing power. Among conclusions, the paper points the CIT mechanism and pace which determine, by refining data and producing new knowledge, premises for optimized solutions, irrespective the application but especially where the efficiency and the radical progress in the field were difficult to obtain or long time expected.
L63|Omni-Channel Retailing|Since the advent of the internet, shopping has been a key component in its commercial use and usefulness. Products and services such as books, clothing, household goods, theatre/cinema tickets and holidays were some of the original offerings. Over time the range of products and services available has been extended significantly. However in the last few years it is not the product set that is the area of dynamism, but the ways in which retailers and shoppers are using the internet to purchase goods and services. The most recent expression of this is Omni-Channel Retailing as coined by the John Lewis Partnership (JLP) in the UK.
L63|The Exponential Development Of The Information And Communications Technologies A Complex Process Which Is Generating Progress Knowledge From People To People|The information and communications technologies (ICT) are characterized by an exponential development which is unique in industry and has unprecedented consequencies in the entire society. The papers analysis is focused on the features of this exponential development, which is for decades ruled by Moores Law, but some premises of a slower pace are also presented. Among the presented features, a systemic one is the large, often said ubiquitous, spreading and use of the ICT components, products and services over the whole humankind life and Earth including all other industries . Another feature is the essential contribution of ICT to the evolution of the human society as information society (IS) and to the transformation of IS towards the future knowledge based society. The paper also presents the driving basics of the ICT, consisting in some characteristic models, where the main is the inherent convergence between the communications and the information technology. Another major feature of the ICT models consists of scalable, flexible, reproductible and highly multiplying (logic reusing) digital processing algorithms, software and techniques, which support the open design, implementation and functionality of the ICT components, products and services. The analysis concluded that the global effect of ICT development could be expressed as a 3 dimensional process and it acts as a systemic liant for these dimensions by the knowldege involved in all human activities leveraged by ICT. Finally, the paper analyzed the most relevant systemic exemples of the ways ICT development generates refined knowledge. In a systemic approach, the exa-scale supercomputers targets, including human genom, wiring model of the human brain, artificial intelligence and spatial projects are considered. The main papers conclusion is that ICTs exponential development leverages the generation of the refined knowledge in IS/KBS, for the peoples well and mankind progress on Earth and beyound.
L63|The Code Division Multiple Access From Complicated To The Actual Mobile Communications Standards And Beyond|The paper approaches one of the most important technologies of the modern communications the Code Division Multiple Acces (CDMA), which has a huge influence on the actual mobile communications networks (3G, 4G) and beyond. The paper presents CDMA from a dual point of view, as a powerful technology for the most dynamic communications networks, cellphone broadband mobile communications, but on the other hand revealing that CDMA represents also one of the information and communications technologies (ICT) that could inluence people and their ways of thinking, as a model. Some interesting aspects covered by the paper present important moments and contributions in the spectacular evolution of CDMA, in USA, Romania and generally manifest in the World, as CDMA is an inherent feature of the spread-spectrum systems (SSS) of communications (first and long time used only for secure military communications) and both CDMA and SSS were very skeptical perceived by the civilian specialists and the industry, because they were long time considered too complicated for commercial use. One of the papers points stress the deep significance of the CDMA/SSS evolution, as a long fight against all the challenges, a process where the knowledge, the innovation and the passion were the main ingredients of the final succes a huge achievement for ICT and the information society (IS). One the same line, the papers conclusions refer to the power of CDMA to leverage the mankind activity, by technological concrete consequences and also as a model to manage the resources - from time and electromagnetic spectrum to anything people must share on Earth.
L63|The Information Management The Essence Of Using Communications And Information Technologies To Develop The Knowledge Based Society|The paper presents the role of information as the main vehicle communications and information technologies (CIT) use to leverage every activity fields and every individual life in the information age stage of the human being evolution. Then the information management (IM) is resulting as the logical approach for the systemic optimization of the complex processes humankind encounters in developing the information society (IS) toward knowledge based society (KBS). For optimizing the economical and social environment on Earth and face the fast evolutons of CIT, IM must carefully use, step by step, 3 basic ingredients: accurate data, then relevant information and then refined knowledge. The paper analyzes the most important and difficult to optimize added value of IM, as generating refined knowledge is the main target of the process that starts with creating data, then extracting information and eventually using this information in a complex process, where people, in a legal, economical and social context will use it, creating new/refined knowledge. The paper emphasizes that, as a solution for stable growing, learn and go on is the way the humankind have to chose in the complicated context of such complex forces of the progress like CIT, resulting that the education remains the main ingredient, the key factor of exploiting these forces. The paper conclusions are finding that simple education is no more enough in the IS/KBS context, when the humakind is at the information age , every human being must be school educated, but, beyond the already old term of continue education , he/she must be educated to learn every day from the IS/KBS context, in order to survive and grow. As CIT products and services became ubiquitous as the water and electricity , people must learn every day to use them and their useful optimization principles, like IM. Finally it resulted that we need more and more IM every day, but it is important to notice that IM means much more that we already know about information and about management , even if we add as main ingredient CIT.
L63|Telecommunications Infrastructure and Economic Growth: An Application for Different Income Groups|The aim of this study is to research the relationship between the telecommunication infrastructure and economic growth for countries which have different income levels. Along with this purpose, the data collected from 138 countries at total in five different income groups is used with covering the period of the years 1991-2009. As a method, the dynamic panel data analysis which composes the facilities of the cross sectional analysis and the time series analysis is used. The findings indicate that the information and telecommunication technologies are statistically positive and significant determinants of growth for all income groups except for the high income non-OECD group. This positive effect is higher in the low income groups.
L63|Mobile Phone Data and Urban Analysis: An Exploratory Space – Time Study|This paper discusses the value that data from mobile phone providers can bring into urban analysis. The novel argument is that the pervasiveness of mobile phone telephony has transformed mobile phones from a communications device to a tool for socio-spatial research. Put simply, mobile phone providers can potentially gather relevant data on a very refined spatio-temporal scale for every 85 out of 100 inhabitants in the world. Such data can include basic information about personal communication patterns, interactions and mobility which can enable researchers to better understand spatial human behavior, the predictability of which is well documented. These advances that have mostly taken place in the complexity science domain, which largely focuses on individual behavioural patterns, can also result in applications in the spatial analysis domain. This paper has two aims. Firstly, we critically discuss the existing state of the art of urban analysis based on big data from mobile phone operators. Based on this review, the paper takes a methodological turn to present some preliminary urban analysis results using data from a mobile phone operator in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
L63|Accessibility of Cities in the Digital Economy|See also the article in Cities (2013). Volume 30, pages 59-67. This paper introduces a new measure to approach the accessibility of places in the frame of the digital economy. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and the Internet are not equally spread around places and this heterogeneity affects spatial configuration. Despite the wide societal changes due to ICTs and the extensive interest in accessibility studies, these two themes have not yet come together in order to study the digital accessibility (DA) of places. Adopting an infrastructural perspective and a potential accessibility framework, a DA measure â€“ embedding different types of impedance distance functions â€“ is calculated for cities in Europe. Spatial Interaction Model and Complex Network Analysis are employed to calibrate and validate the DA results. The outcome of this approach is a new urban hierarchy which reveals a core-periphery pattern in Europe owing to digital accessibility.
L63|Going Soft: How the Rise of Software-Based Innovation Led to the Decline of Japan's IT Industry and the Resurgence of Silicon Valley| This paper documents a systematic shift in the nature of innovation in information technology (IT) toward increasing dependence on software. Using a broad panel of U.S. and Japanese publicly listed IT firms in the period 1983 to 2004, we show that this change in the nature of IT innovation had differential effects on the performance of the IT industries in the United States and Japan, resulting in U.S. firms increasingly outperforming their Japanese counterparts, particularly in more software-intensive sectors. We provide suggestive evidence that human resource constraints played a role in preventing Japanese firms from adapting to the documented shift in IT innovation. © 2013 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
L63|Kleine und mittlere Unternehmen der Informations- und Kommunikationswirtschaft in Nordrhein-Westfalen|Die vorliegende Studie untersucht den IKT-Sektor in Nordrhein-Westfalen anhand von Sonderauswertungen der amtlichen Statistik des Umsatzsteuerpanels sowie der Daten einer eigenen Unternehmensbefragung. Dabei erweist sich dieses Bundesland als Standort mit einem weitgehend prosperierenden IKT-Unternehmensbestand. Die Quote der schnell wachsenden IKT-Unternehmen ist dort sogar deutlich höher als in anderen Teilen Deutschlands. Das Gros der IKT-Unternehmen zählt zudem zu den Innovationsaktiven und erzielt mittelfristig - meist in Folge eigener Investitionen in die Forschung und Entwicklung (FuE) - substanzielle Innovationserfolge. Jedoch hemmt der sich verschärfende Fachkräftemangel bereits heute die Innovationstätigkeit. Bislang gelingt es nur wenigen IKT-Unternehmen, geeignete Partner zu finden, um mittels FuE-Kooperationen Innovationshürden zu überwinden.
L63|An Analysis of Demand-based Factors for Broadband Migration|This paper explores the factors that influence the users’ decision to migrate from narrowband to broadband services. Data used were obtained from web questionnaire surveys in Japan and the annual Internet User Profile Survey of the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC) in Thailand. The economic, technological and demographic factors were analyzed by using a mixed logit model. The results suggest that price, as a proxy for economic factor, is an important factor in a developing country. In Thai case, lowering the price of broadband services to 50% would increase the probability of the users migrating to broadband by more than 5%. Demographic factors including income, location, and internet experience also contribute to the decision, but their impacts are smaller than that of price. Contrary to previous studies, speed is not a statistically significant factor.
L63|Green ICT dynamics: key issues and findings for Germany|The role of information and communication technology (ICT) is discussed both with respect to economic growth and green global modernization. ICT stands for the most innovative sector in the EU and the USA. High productivity growth and digital product innovations are characteristics of this sector; at the same time, ICT products are considered to be an enabling technology in other sectors. While digital technological progress may be anticipated—including the expansion of the Internet—to contribute to raising efficiency and more green economic growth, there are considerable risks of rebound effects in the ICT sector. The findings for the impact of an expansion of green ICT in Germany show small significant effect on output and relatively more important effects on the reduction of greenhouse gases. Hence the simulation results from the PANTA RHEI model suggest that green ICT dynamics could be a useful element of sustainable development in Germany and the EU, respectively.

L63|TIC y productividad en las industrias de servicios en Colombia|Resumen: Este trabajo analiza los determinantes de la productividad laboral en las empresas de servicios de Colombia. En particular, se examina la relación entre las tecnologías de la información y de la comunicación -TIC- (en términos de inversión y uso) y la productividad. El estudio encuentra que en conjunto, la inversión en TIC y el uso de las TIC incrementan la productividad laboral en un 18% en promedio, aproximadamente. La evidencia empírica sustenta la hipótesis de que los recursos tecnológicos de las TIC (tanto inversiones en equipo como uso de TIC), junto con el capital no TIC, la capacitación, el porcentaje de capital extranjero y el porcentaje de empleados permanentes son los recursos más importantes que impactan positivamente sobre la productividad de las empresas de servicios de Colombia. Abstract: This paper analyzes the determinants of labor productivity in the services firms of Colombia. In particular, we examine the relation between information and communication technologies -ICT- (in terms of investment and use) and productivity. The study finds that ICT investment and use jointly increase labor productivity in about 18% on average. The empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that ICT technological resources (both in equipment investment and ICT use), together with non-ICT capital, training, and the proportion of foreign capital and permanent workers are the main determinants of productivity increase in the Colombian services firms
L63|Promoción de la competencia en la telefonía móvil de Colombia|Existe evidencia estadística de débil presión competitiva en el sector de servicios de telefonía móvil en Colombia. Se observan menores velocidades de mejoramiento en indicadores clave (reducción de precio del minuto, penetración) en comparación con los promedios mundiales y los de países de desarrollo económico similar entre 2008 y 2010. Además, más de la mitad de la población del país debe gastar más del 5% de su ingreso mensual para pagar un plan prepago útil. Aunque la telefonía móvil presenta avances en aumento de cobertura, su desempeño relativo en el contexto mundial no es destacable. La estructura de industria tiene un número de competidores común en el mundo (cuatro), pero con un índice de concentración de usuarios muy alto en un operador dominante que no enfrenta competencia efectiva. En la próxima subasta del espectro para 4G en Colombia, los bloques en frecuencias AWS(Advanced Wireless Systems) y 2,500 Mhz, tienen un valor económico superior para el operador móvil dominante. Esta ventaja, conocida como foreclosure value, es la diferencia de la valoración de la firma dominante sin y con competidores adicionales. La ventaja permitiría hacer ofertas agresivas que concentraría la posesión del espectro. Además, en presencia de costos sustanciales de preparación de ofertas, cualquier señal del operador dominante de desear quedarse con todos o algunos bloques de espectro puede disuadir la participación de otros operadores en la subasta. Después de adjudicado el espectro, su acaparamiento reduciría aún más la débil presión competitiva existente y empeoraría su desempeño. Este documento contribuye al diseño del formato de subasta de bloques para 4G con el objetivo de aumentar la presión competitiva en el sector de telefonía móvil en Colombia. Las reglas de participación y el formato de la subasta deben estimular competencia durante su proceso (reduciendo la posibilidad de colusión), facilitar el descubrimiento de precios, aumentar el ingreso del estado y lograr una estructura de industria menos concentrada. Para ello, se propone una subasta Anglo-Holandesa de tres bloques pareados, con reserva para nuevos entrantes en un bloque, limitación a un bloque nuevo en posesión de cualquier operador, y el uso de créditos en las pujas para los operadores y potenciales entrantes en los otros dos bloques. Este formato debe acompañarse de una revisión de los cargos de terminación (usando cargos asimétricos temporalmente), así como de obligaciones de cobertura, de acceso del espectro a terceras partes y de prohibición de venta del espectro durante un plazo fijo. La mejora de la competencia reducirá los precios, permitirá ofrecer servicios más sofisticados y promoverá la innovación.
L63|Una estimación de la adulteración y la falsificación de bebidas alcohólicas en Colombia|"""El objetivo de este trabajo es realizar un diagnóstico y estimación del tamaño del mercado de las bebidas alcohólicas adulteradas y falsificadas, esto es, conocer mejor su estructura de funcionamiento, la cadena completa de producción, distribución y comercialización, entre otros temas. Esta labor se adelantó, por un lado, a partir de un trabajo de campo con entrevistas a profundidad con los principales actores del mercado de las bebidas alcohólicas legales, un estudio de caso para las ciudades de Bogotá, Cali y Medellín, donde se entrevistó a las fuerzas de ventas de distribuidores de bebidas alcohólicas y se realizaron grupos focales con tenderos y, por otro lado, se midió la magnitud de esta actividad ilegal a partir del cálculo de la oferta residual de alcohol etílico en la economía colombiana (es decir, una medición en particular para las bebidas derivadas de la caña de azúcar). Adicionalmente se estimaron los costos fiscales (i.e. en las finanzas nacionales y departamentales) y las implicaciones para el gasto en salud y en recreación de los recursos dejados de percibir por concepto de la adulteración y/o falsificación de bebidas alcohólicas."""
L63|Desarrollo económico territorial : el caso del cluster Tic, Medellín y Valle de Aburrá : propuesta de fomento y consolidación de la industria de contenidos digitales|Resumen: La ciudad de Medellín bajo su estrategia Comunidad Cluster, reconociendo los beneficios potenciales de impulsar la industria TIC promovió en 2011 un Cluster para este sector. La presente investigación pretende aportar al proceso de institucionalización del Cluster a través de propuestas para el fomento de Contenidos Digitales, una de sus áreas estratégicas, focalizando en contenidos audiovisuales, animación y videojuegos. El documento se plantea desde la perspectiva del desarrollo económico territorial. En primera instancia, se determinaron parámetros, desde el enfoque teórico, para el diseño de las estrategias. Luego, se realizó una caracterización de la industria. Dada la poca información y de acuerdo a la metodología del enfoque se obtuvieron fuentes primarias que permitieron perfilar el sector y sentar bases para las estrategias. Se logró determinar que, aunque las condiciones actuales no son favorables, un trabajo en red de los actores relacionados (empresarios, instituciones), que fortalezca la estrategia Cluster, permitiría generar condiciones de mayor competitividad para consolidar una industria de contenidos digitales que destaque el potencial local. Abstract : The city of Medellín, under the Cluster Community strategy and recognizing the potential benefits of promoting the ICT industry, created the Cluster for this sector in 2011. This study aims to contribute to the process of institutionalization of this cluster by making proposals for fostering digital contents, one of its strategic areas, with a focus on audiovisual contents, animation and videogames. The paper approaches the subject using territorial economic development. First, we ascertain parameters for strategy design from a theoretical perspective. Then, we characterized the industry given the lack of information and to make a profile of the sector and set the basis for the strategies. We determined that, although current conditions are not favorable, a network of the related agents (businesses, institutions) would create greater conditions for competitiveness, so as to consolidate a digital contents industry that highlights the local potential.
L63|Do Exporting Firms in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China Innovate?|With international trade spluttering amidst the Great Recession, there is renewed interest in the factors driving firm-level export performance in Asiaâ€™s super exporterâ€”The Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (PRC). While early studies suggested that innovation was important, there has been little research on opening up the black box of technology at firm-level in the PRC. This paper undertakes econometric analysis of innovation, learning, and exporting in automobiles and electronics firms in the PRC using a large-scale dataset to identify the most appropriate innovation proxy. Drawing on recent literature on innovation and learning in developing countries, it tests two alternative proxies : (i) a technology index (TI) to capture a variety of minor activities involved in using imported technologies efficiently; and (ii) the research and development (R&D)-to-sales ratio, which represents formal technological efforts to create new products and processes, often at world frontiers. A higher TI (representing minor technological activities) increases the probability of exporting in both industries, while the R&D-to-sales ratio was not significant. Foreign ownership, technical manpower, and the characteristics of the general manager/chief executive officer also matter. The findings suggest that the PRCâ€™s remarkable success in the export of automobiles and electronics since initiating an open-door foreign direct investment (FDI) policy in 1978 is linked to technology transfer from multinationals; systematic investments in and upgrading of minor technological activities (like search, engineering, quality management, and design); and human capital. As the PRCâ€™s per capita income rises over time, however, formal R&D activities are likely to become more important to sustain competitiveness and technological upgrading in automobiles and electronics.

L63|On the (In) Effectiveness of Policies to Promote Broadband Diffusion in Europe (2003-2010): An Econometric Assessment|This paper presents an updated empirical assessment of the relative effectiveness of intra-platform and inter-platform competition in terms of broadband diffusion in Europe between 2003 and 2010. It relies on an econometric analysis of 18 European countries. To approximate two forms of competition within a same platform, we distinguish between service-based access and facility-based access. The first type requires less investment from entrants than the second which allows entrants to differentiate their product. Our results update and validate earlier studies. We show that service-based intra-platform competition brought by access regulation is still not an accelerating factor of broadband diffusion (or investment) in Europe. In contrast, we find that both facility-based intra-platform competition brought by access regulation and inter-platform competition brought by the deployment of non-DSL technologies effectively fuels broadband diffusion. In sum, many EU countries may have underestimated the potential payoff of stimulating product differentiation through inter-platform and service-based intra-platform competition for the diffusion of broadband in Europe.

L63|ICT in developing countries: Are language barriers relevant? Evidence from Paraguay|We investigate the role of language barriers on both computer adoption and Internet connection in Paraguay, a country in which about 40% of the population is monolingual in Guaraní, 50% bilingual and 6% monolingual in Spanish. Our empirical results show that the ICT diffusion process is highly heterogeneous, reflecting pre-existing inequalities in other socioeconomic dimensions. Parametric estimations also suggest that the Guaraní language constitutes an important cultural barrier to the ICT diffusion in the country. This situation illustrates the cultural barriers that developing countries may face in using ICT.
L63|What difference does dynamics make? The case of digital cameras|When the well-known BLP model is applied to products with rapid technological changes and declining prices it tends to yield implausible results. A sequence of increasingly sophisticated dynamic demand models, most recently Gowrisankaran and Rysman (2009, hereafter GR), have been developed to overcome these problems. We apply both models to new data on the US digital camera market. In addition, we demonstrate that the GR model can be specified as a BLP model plus an additional set of terms. This suggests that a dynamic model can be estimated as a BLP model plus a non-parametric function which is less computationally demanding. As a first step to implementing this semi-parametric approach we estimate a BLP model augmented with age as a proxy for the non-parametric component. We find that demand for digital cameras is more elastic when demand dynamics is accounted for in both the dynamic model and the BLP model with the age proxy. This suggests that the market is more competitive though the results are consistent with firms engaging in intertemporal price discrimination. Merger simulations predict the lowest price and quantity changes using the GR model.
L63|Knowledge spillovers and firm performance in the high-technology industrial cluster|This paper attempts to empirically investigate the mechanisms underlying growth in Hsinchu high-tech clusters. We emphasize knowledge spillovers as one of the potential factors contributing to agglomeration benefits. This paper sheds light on the impact of external and internal spillovers on firm performance in Hsinchu high-tech clusters. The empirical results provide supporting evidence that the external R&D spillover is statistically significant in explaining net sales of firms in Hsinchu high-tech clusters.
L63|Les stratégies de forum-shopping et de law-shopping en droit de la concurrence : Applications aux contentieux entre AMD et Intel (2000-2010)|A long-term litigation has opposed AMD to Intel, the dominant firm in the chips market. The first reproached the second pricing practices aiming at excluding it from the market on another basis than a competition on the merits. Intel was accused of implemented an anticompetitive strategy through its retroactive loyalty rebates, which incited PC constructors to accept tacit exclusive supply contracts. Our purpose does not consist in assessing the anticompetitive nature of such schemes or in evaluating to what extent they are detrimental to consumer welfare. We propose to consider the judicial strategy implemented by AMD. It lodged several complaints in numerous jurisdictions. Complaints were filled abroad (Japan, Republic of Korea, European Union), in some US States, before the Antitrust Division of the DoJ, before the FTC and through the private enforcement of the Sherman Act. Economic literature, especially the Chicago School, highlights, for ages, the risk of misuses of Antitrust Laws in order to impair competition. Such nuisance suits could take benefit from multiple, parallel of sequential complaints before different courts. Being successful in a first dispute before a more favorable or a less exigent (in terms of standard of proof) judicial arena could favor the plaintiff in a second trial or incite the defendant to accept to settle the dispute. Our paper analyzes the different between AMD and Intel in the perspective of such forum shopping strategies and tries to evaluate their consequences in terms of collective welfare.
L63|A Study of the Performance Improvement of Bill of Material Document Sign Flow System|Due to information and network communication technology have a great improvement; electronic management flow system already can be easily implemented. It operates sufficiently with members in-groups and enhances total operational efficiency, flexibility, lean and agility of enterprise. Electronic management flow system has some important properties: information transfer, automatic flow and operation management and control. Those properties can help company to reduce cost, shorten lead time, increase productivity, and achieve a good total quality management (TQM). In the same time, it also can help company to create business competitive advantage. This study focused on the performance improvement of bill of material (BOM) documentation sign flow in A-company. To enhance efficiency and effectiveness of BOM documentation sign flow, A-company passes through information department to integrate relative documents sign of other departments to make an electronic sign program to achieve cost reduction and speed-up efficiency of BOM document sign since 2005. This case uses BOM document release to study the benefits of electronic documentation sign in product engineering department.

Electronic education, on one hand, is able to decrease the needs related to Global Village theory and globalization and on the other hand, is able answer the question in different areas of traditional education. The gift of this educational method in 21st century is equal education for all people in different geographical areas, without concerning space and time limitation, and removing knowledge gap and training knowledge-based people.
L63|Innovating global value chains : creation of the netbook market by Taiwanese firms|This paper explores the process of creation of the netbook market by Taiwanese firms as an example of a disruptive innovation by latecomer firms. As an analytical framework, I employ the global value chain perspective to capture the dynamics of vertical inter-firm relationships that drive some firms in the chain to change the status quo of the industry. I then divide the process of the emergence of the netbook market into three consecutive stages, i.e. (1) the launch of the first-generation netbook by a Taiwanese firm named ASUSTeK, (2) the response of the two powerful platform leaders of the industry, Intel and Microsoft Intel, to ASUSTeK’s innovation, and (3) the market entry by another powerful Taiwanese firm, Acer, and explain how Taiwanese firms broke the Intel-centric market and tapped into the market-creating innovation opportunities that had been suppressed by the two powerful platform leaders. I also show that the creation of the netbook industry was an evolutionary process in which a series of responses by different industry players led to changes in the status quo of the industry.
L63|ICT and productivity in service industries in Colombia|This paper analyzes the determinants of labor productivity in the services firms of Colombia. In particular, we examine the relation between information and communication technologies –ICT– (in terms of investment and use) and productivity. The study finds that ICT investment and use jointly increase labor productivity in about 18% on average. The empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that ICT technological resources (both in equipment investment and ICT use), together with non-ICT capital, training, and the proportion of foreign capital and permanent workers are the main determinants of productivity increase in the Colombian services firms

L63|Restarting the Growth Engine in Finland|Impressive productivity performance during the last decades has weakened since 2007, reflecting the 2008-09 recession but also a poor performance in important sectors, like the information and communication technology sector. Reforms to raise long term productivity growth need to be pursued. Current project-based R&D-support and business subsidies seem inefficient and should be scaled back and remaining support should focus on addressing externalities in terms of the creation of high productive jobs and R&D spillovers. A R&D tax credit could provide higher flexibility, equity and efficiency than current targeted support. Capital taxation should be streamlined to improve incentives for entrepreneurship and growth. The performance of the higher education system could be improved through allocating more R&D funding and teaching resources based on quality rather than block grants. Productivity performance could be enhanced by exposing sectors like health provision, network industries and retailing to more competition through lowering government dominance in provision and loosening planning restrictions. This Working Paper relates to the 2012 OECD Economic Survey of Finland (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/finland). Relancer le moteur de la croissance en Finlande Les remarquables performances en matière de productivité des dernières décennies ont fléchi depuis 2007, du fait de la récession de 2008-09 mais aussi des médiocres résultats obtenus dans des secteurs essentiels, comme celui des technologiques de l’information et des communications. Les réformes visant à renforcer la croissance de la productivité à long terme doivent se poursuivre. Sous leur forme actuelle, le soutien à la R-D sur la base de projets et les subventions aux entreprises paraissent inefficients et devraient être revus à la baisse, et les autres mesures de soutien devraient essentiellement se concentrer sur les externalités du point de vue de la création d’emplois hautement productifs et des retombées de la R-D. Un crédit d’impôt au titre de la R-D pourrait offrir davantage de flexibilité, d’équité et d’efficience que le soutien ciblé actuellement mis en oeuvre. La taxation du capital devrait être rationalisée de manière à renforcer les incitations à l’entreprenariat et à la croissance. Les performances du système d’enseignement supérieur pourraient être améliorées en allouant à la R-D des ressources de financement et d’enseignement sur des critères qualitatifs plutôt que sous la forme de subventions globales. Les performances en matière de productivité pourraient être améliorées en ouvrant davantage à la concurrence des secteurs tels que les soins de santé, les industries de réseau et le commerce de détail en réduisant la place prépondérante du secteur public dans leur fourniture et en assouplissant les restrictions en matière d’aménagement du territoire. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l'Etude économique de l'OCDE de Finlande 2012 (www.oecd.org/eco/etudes/finlande).
L63|Mergers & acquisitions and innovation performance in the telecommunications equipment industry| The worldwide telecommunications equipment industry has experienced an enormous number of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). This article examines the innovation determinants of M&A activity and the consequences of M&A on technological potential and innovation performance. We extend the resource-based theory in elucidating external technology sourcing and provide empirical evidence on the keen reliance of the equipment firms on M&A as a technology sourcing strategy for the period 1988--2004. Employing the matching propensity score approach, this study provides evidence that mergers realize a significant growth in the innovation performance of firms. The postmerger innovation performance, in turn, is driven by both the prior success of in-house R&D commitment and the deterioration of internal technological capabilities at acquiring firms.

L63|Wireless Network Security|The idea of wireless communication sounds good. The main reasons are increased mobility and cost reduction for infrastructure development. Although in the past, securing a wireless network proved to be a challenge to which companies did not respond yet, today there are many standard protocols that are able to offer improved security. A security policy must establish a compromise between the flexibility level of the IT services and the level of security desired. Within a wireless network environment it is paramount that organizations develop and implement security policies specific to wireless technology in order to ensure optimum security. A well-planned wireless security policy is an important step in a methodical implementation of wireless networking (security mechanisms of the 802.11 standard).

L63|Observing The Information And Communications Technologies Competition With The Time|The paper analyzes the opportunity to estimate, at the moment of years passage, the contribution of information and communications technologies (ICT) to the challenging aspects of society evolution, which is presented as a competition with the time, as mankind have to face the fading of resources on Earth, among other factors which will determine the future. In the above context the paper presents the main challenges and their links with time, as the fast pace of the ICT evolution is strongly influencing the progress of Information Society (IS) toward the Knowledge Based Society (KBS), providing complex approaches, instruments and concepts for an optimal development of all activity fields. The paper analysis includes the ways these ICT new approaches tend to have a leveraging role in the IS processes, first including innovation and refined knowledge generation. Finally the paper shows how ICT network centric and cognitive approaches, including further implications of their products, services and principles in IS, represent long term and powerful instruments to optimize the resources management in the complex competition with the time, as time is measuring the fading of resources on Earth with a pace depending of our wisdom to define and implement the mankind stable â€œprogressâ€ .
L63|Sähkö-, elektroniikka- ja tietotekniikka-ala. Tuotantoketjut hajautuvat, osaamistarpeet muuttuvat|There is a deep structural transformation going on In the Finnish electrical, electronics and IT services sector. The main reason is a major turning point in ICT due to diminishing production and employment in mobile telecom industry where large amount of high-skill jobs will disappear in the next few years. The main reasons are major shift in global markets and dispersion of supply and value chains. However, at the same time when mobile ICT industry is experiences decline in production and employment IT services sector is growing. New ICT related jobs are created also in mechanical and electrical engineering industries as these industries are integrating increasingly software, intelligence and services in their products. The structural transformations in electronics and ICT pose major challenges to educational system and make it difficult to foresee future skill requirements.
L63|Do Exporting Firms in the People’s Republic of China Innovate?|This paper assesses factors driving firm-level export performance in Asia’s super exporter—The People’s Republic of China (PRC). While early studies suggested that innovation was important, there has been little research on opening up the black box of technology at firm-level in the PRC, the author undertakes econometric analysis of innovation, learning, and exporting in automobiles and electronics firms in the PRC using a large-scale dataset to identify the most appropriate innovation proxy. Drawing on recent literature on innovation and learning in developing countries, it tests two alternative proxies: (i) a technology index (TI) to capture a variety of minor activities involved in using imported technologies efficiently; and (ii) the research and development (R&D)-to-sales ratio, which represents formal technological efforts to create new products and processes, often at world frontiers.
L63|Determinants of Firmsâ€™ Liquidation and Acquisition in the Indian Electronics Industry|This study examines the determinants of firmsâ€™ liquidation and acquisition in the Indian electronics industry during the period 1990â€“2006. It is argued that liquidation and acquisition are alternative modes of exit. Therefore, these modes of exit might have different determinants. To explore this possibility, a multinomial logistic (MNL) regression model is estimated using cross-sectional data of 540 firms. We find that the effects of age, size, leverage, innovative competence and profitability are significant for the likelihood of liquidation. In contrast, the effect of profitability was found insignificant for the likelihood of acquisition. Moreover, the effects of size and leverage are dissimilar across the exit modes, that is, large firms are more likely to be liquidated but less likely to be acquired, and high leverage firms are more likely to be liquidated but less likely to be acquired. The findings of this study show that the determinants of liquidation and acquisition modes of exit are different in the Indian electronics industry.JEL Classification: C25, G33, G34, L63
L63|New Technologies in remittances sending: Opportunities for mobile remittances in Africa|Mobile remittances have a high development potential as they hold the promise of providing quick, easy and cheap money transfers. In Africa mobile phone usage has increased sharply and mobile banking providers are extending their services, enabling greater opportunities for mobile remittances. The rise of mobile banking in Africa, however, differs substantially across countries, mainly due to a lack of financial infrastructure. Consequently, the opportunities that mobile banking offers for mobile remittances vary geographically. The services provided do not always meet the needs of remittance senders and the African remittances market is generally under-acknowledged as an important market by providers. Restrictive financial regulations play a key role as well. Mobile remittances have the potential to become an important and revolutionary tool for remittances sending in Africa. Effective policies should therefore address the limitations in the regulatory and financial infrastructure for mobile banking to become the foundation for mobile remittances.
L63|La industria de los PCs en los mercados del continente americano: estimación de demanda y poder de mercado| Esta investigación aporta una visión panorámica del escenario competitivo de la industria de los PCs en los mercados del continente americano con mayor volumen de ventas. En él se describen los cambios producidos por el proceso de migración hacia la portabilidad que caracterizó el período 2005 - 2007. A partir de la estimación de un modelo de elección discreta Logit con coeficientes aleatorios, se recuperan los costes marginales a nivel de producto. A su vez, se desarrolla un análisis regional del ejercicio de poder de mercado por grupos de marcas basado en el Índice de Lerner, que revela que los cambios observados fueron gobernados principalmente por variaciones en la elasticidad-precio de la demanda. En particular, la incorporación de consumidores con una mayor elasticidad en el fragmento de portátiles en Latinoamérica podría explicar bajos niveles de poder de mercado (márgenes) en un contexto de precios a la baja y aumento de la demanda.

Web technologies have been changed in the last years, because they adopted the richness of the desk- top applications. Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) support many features of a classical desktop application, offering a “rich user experience” based on a state user interaction. Rich Internet Appli- cations provide advanced features such as direct object manipulation and animations that can enrich the user’s experience. This article discusses some aspects of designing user interfaces for modern software applications and the technologies used in the RIA context.
L63|Disclosure of Intellectual Capital in Annual Reports: An Exploratory Study of Indian IT Corporations|"Knowledge, innovation, information technology, and people are the key contributories in the future of any organization, and IC is the key driver of market value in the ""knowledge"" economy. Voluntary disclosure of IC information in the annual reports is done by a few leading corporations. The omission of IC information, therefore, may adversely influence the quality of decisions made by shareholders, or lead to material misstatements. This study attempts to provide an insight into the ""narrative"" style of IC disclosures done by the Indian corporations. In order to survey the recent IC disclosure scenario, we conducted a study of 16 Indian IT corporations in which the ""content analysis"" was done on their 2007 to 2009 annual reports. The results of this study confirmed that IC disclosure by these IT corporations is almost negligible and its disclosure had not received any preference from the mentors of these corporations. IC reports may initially be used for ""internal"" management purposes; but an ""external"" stakeholder-focus of IC report should be the ultimate goal."

L63|Product line pricing in a vertically differentiated oligopoly|This paper examines the joint pricing decision of products in a firm's product line. When products are distinguished by a vertical characteristic, those with higher values of that characteristic will command higher prices. We investigate whether, holding the value of the characteristic constant, there is an additional price premium for products on the industry and/or the firm frontier, that is, for the products with the highest value of the characteristic in the market or in a firm's product line. We also investigate the existence of price premia for lower-ranked products and other product line pricing questions. Using personal computer price data, we show that prices decline with the distance from the industry and firm frontiers, even after holding absolute quality constant. We find evidence that consumer tastes for brands is stronger for the consumers of frontier products (and thus competition between firms weaker in the top end of the market). There is also evidence that a product's price is higher if a firm offers products with the immediately faster and immediately slower computer chip (holding the total number of a firm's offerings constant), possibly as an attempt to reduce cannibalization. Finally, a product's price declines with the time it is offered by a firm, suggesting intertemporal price discrimination.
L63|Industrial Upgrading and Global Recession : Evidence of Hard Disk Drive and Automotive Industries in Thailand|ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿This paper illustrates the upgrading experiences of the automotive and hard disk drive (HDD) industries in Thailand, chosen because of their outstanding export performance in the developing world. An understanding of their upgrading experiences can shed some light on the ongoing debate regarding the relative importance of international production networks (IPNs) and industrial clusters (ICs) and their implications for prudential industrial policy. The impact of the recent global recession is also discussed in this paper. There is evidence of industrial upgrading in both the automotive and HDD industries. Yet one primary policy challenge still remains, that is, the limited role of indigenous suppliers in the multinational enterprise (MNE) production networks. This limited role is, to a certain extent, related to the overall incentive structure. Where these two industries differ is in their mode of networking, that is, whether they are part of an IPN or an IC. In the case of the automotive industry, industrial clustering has been observed and has reached a level where the local content of a locally manufactured vehicle is approaching 100%. In the case of the HDD industry, industrial clustering has naturally occurred and reached a certain level. Even though the current global economic crisis has severely affected each industryâ€™s production and exports, the â€œhollow outâ€ scenario is unlikely to apply to either. In other words, Thailand should remain a base of production and exports for MNEs, a situation which points to the need for continual industrial upgrading. Three policy-related conclusions are drawn in this paper. Firstly, the limited linkages between MNE affiliates and indigenous suppliers point to the need for a comprehensive study probing the potentially distorting effect of the cascading tariff structureâ€”a key theme of tariff policy for the past three decades. Despite consecutive governmentsâ€™ efforts since the mid-1990s to neutralize the tariff structure, it is clear that much remains to be done. Secondly, the choice between an IPN and an IC is a purely private sector decision, driven by the nature of the particular industry. There is also the possibility of coexistence between IPNs and ICs. Industrial clustering can be a developmental outcome rather than a pre-condition of technological upgrading. Finally, to promote industrial upgrading process, the government should emphasize policies that strengthen the supply-side capabilities of local firms and create an investment climate that encourages further upgrading activities.

L63|The impact of the Eurosystem's covered bond purchase programme on the primary and secondary markets|This paper provides an assessment of the impact of the covered bond purchase programme (hereafter referred to as the CBPP) relative to its policy objectives. The analysis presented on the impact of the CBPP on both the primary and secondary bond markets indicates that the Programme has been an effective policy instrument. It has contributed to: (i) a decline in money market term rates, (ii) an easing of funding conditions for credit institutions and enterprises, (iii) encouraging credit institutions to maintain and expand their lending to clients, and (iv) improving market liquidity in important segments of the private debt securities market. The paper also provides an overview of the investment strategy of the the Eurosystem with regard to the CBPP portfolio. JEL Classification: E22, L63, L86, O3, O47
L63|Dynamic competition in technological investments: An empirical examination of the LCD panel industry|When are technological laggards more likely to try to catch up with leaders? We offer empirical evidence on firm-level data of plant investments in the TFT-LCD panel industry, where technological competition has been intense and dynamic. We find that the followers' level of technology has a non-monotonic effect on technology-improving investments, with intermediate followers the most apt to invest in catch-ups. This result is a puzzle given the existing theory on technology race. We also find that followers' catch-up investments increase with the capacity of the leader that employs the state-of-the-art technology. These results are robust to variations in specification and alternative accounts of effects. We discuss our findings and contributions in light of the technology race literature.
L63|A Dynamic Analysis Of Cooperative Research In The Semiconductor Industry| The paper has two objectives. The first is to construct a dynamic model of research joint ventures (RJVs) in which firms competing in the product market cooperate in investing to improve generic manufacturing technology. The second objective is to analyze cooperative research led by SEMATECH in the semiconductor industry using the dynamic model. The estimation consists of two stages. In the first stage, consumer demand is estimated using product level data, and state variables are constructed to reflect a technological advance and an evolution of firms' competitiveness in the product market. In the second stage, research expenditure level and firms' value functions are computed for every combination of the state variables as solutions to the dynamic model. I also compute firms' research expenditures for competitive research by making firms unilaterally invest in research. The results show that in RJVs firms' research expenditures go down to one fifth of what they would spend in competitive research. Lower research expenditure results in higher net profits in RJVs, although variable profits are similar in all regimes. RJVs are also more likely to generate higher consumer surplus than competitive research. This is because, while consumers benefit from more frequent introductions of higher quality products in competitive research, they occasionally pay higher prices than they do in RJVs for the same quality products. The net effect is that consumers are hurt more by higher price in competitive research than by less frequent introductions of new products in RJVs. Firms also make different research decisions for the same changes in the product market conditions, depending on whether they cooperate or compete in research<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L63|Foreign Manufacturing Multinationals and the Transformation of the Chinese Economy: New Measurements, New Perspectives|What is the relationship between foreign manufacturing multinational corporations (MNCs) and the expansion of indigenous technological and managerial technological capabilities among Chinese firms? China has been remarkably successful in designing industrial policies, joint venture requirements, and technology transfer pressures to use FDI to create indigenous national champions in a handful of prominent sectors: high speed rail transport, information technology, auto assembly, and an emerging civil aviation sector. But what is striking in the aggregate data is how relatively thin the layer of horizontal and vertical spillovers from foreign manufacturing multinationals to indigenous Chinese firms has proven to be. Despite the large size of manufacturing FDI inflows, the impact of multinational corporate investment in China has been largely confined to building plants that incorporate capital, technology, and managerial expertise controlled by the foreigner. As the skill-intensity of exports increases, the percentage of the value of the final product that derives from imported components rises sharply. China has remained a low value-added assembler of more sophisticated inputs imported from abroad--a “workbench” economy. Where do the gains from FDI in China end up? While manufacturing MNCs may build plants in China, the largest impact from deployment of worldwide earnings is to bolster production, employment, R&D, and local purchases in their home markets. For the United States the most recent data show that US-headquartered MNCs have 70 percent of their operations, make 89 percent of their purchases, spend 87 percent of their R&D dollars, and locate more than half of their workforce within the US economy--this is where most of the earnings from FDI in China are delivered.
