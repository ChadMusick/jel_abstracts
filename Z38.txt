Z38|Global Tourism and Waves of Terror: Perspectives from Military Expenditure|This study complements existing literature by investigating how military expenditure can modulate the effect of terrorism externalities on tourism. The geographical and temporal scopes are 163 countries and the period 2010-2015. The empirical evidence is based on negative binomial regressions. Terrorism externalities are measured in terms of terror-related incidents, injuries, fatalities and damaged properties. We find that military expenditure significantly lessens the destructive impact of these terror-related incidents in order to induce positive net effects on tourism. This finding is robust to all measurements of terrorism. Homicides and violent demonstrations reduce tourists’ arrivals whereas the rate of incarceration of convicted offenders has the opposite effect. The analysis is extended to income levels and regions in order to provide more opportunities for policy implications. Justifications for differences in these comparative tendencies are discussed.
Z38|Tourist arrivals, energy consumption and pollutant emissions in a developing economy–implications for sustainable tourism|Sustainable tourism management policies should aim at maximising economic benefits from tourist arrivals while minimizing associated adverse impacts on the environment. This study assesses the short-run and long-run relationships between tourist arrivals, per capita economic output, emissions, energy consumption and capital formation, citing Nepal as a specific case study. We developed four hypotheses and tested them using time-series econometrics based on the autoregressive distributed lag model and Granger causality tests. The results provide strong evidence of an economy driven tourism sector where expansion in economic output leads to expansion in tourist arrivals. More tourist arrivals, in turn, generate positive impacts on gross capital formation. Energy consumption negatively affects tourist arrivals, calling for increased attention towards improving energy efficiency and energy diversity. We conclude that national policies to increase tourist arrivals should be integrated with national energy and environmental policies in order to facilitate the transition towards a sustainable tourism sector.
Z38|Tourism and insecurity in the world|The study assesses the role of forces of law and order in modulating the insecurity-tourism nexus in 163 countries for the period 2010 to 2015. Policy syndromes or insecurity dynamics include: violent crime, access to weapons, political instability and perception of criminality while the policy variables of forces of law and order are captured with “security officers & police” and “armed service personnel”. The empirical evidence is based on Negative Binomial regressions. The findings show that the policy variables can be effectively used to crowd-out the negative incidence of policy syndromes on tourist arrivals. The results are contingent on net effects (from conditional and unconditional effects), insecurity dynamics and thresholds. A threshold is an inflexion point at which the unfavorable unconditional effect from a policy syndrome of insecurity on tourist arrivals is completely neutralized by policy variables of forces of law and order. Policy implications are discussed.

Z38|A Substantial Discount on Ski Passes: A Synthetic Control Analysis|The synthetic control method serves as an appropriate and promising approach to do quantitative comparison research. However, the method is rarely used in the context of tourism. We fill this research gap by applying the method to the case of a Swiss mountain destination. Alpine tourist destinations have suffered from a declining demand in the last decade. Fewer tourist visit ski resorts. Consequently, the tourism industry in these destinations is under pressure to seek for solutions to face this falling demand. Saas-Fee, a Swiss mountain destination particularly hard hit by the decline of visitors has come up with an innovative offer: A substantial price discount on ski passes. In this present study, we aim to estimate the causal effect of the price discount in Saas-Fee. We adopt the synthetic control method to analyze the impact of the destinations’ policy on tourism demand. Further, we perform placebo tests on all units in our donor pool to evaluate the significance our results. Finally, we show how to assess the assumptions of the synthetic control method in the context of tourism.

Z38|South Asia: Formulating Services Sector Policies for Development, A Policy Perspective|This paper analyses the current development in trade in services in South Asia. South Asia’s language heritage, strong traditions of higher education, computer savvy diaspora and embrace of modern telecom infrastructure, have all contributed to services being a large part of the region’s GDP, with an increasing contribution to their export baskets. Countries in South Asia have formulated aggressive policies to promote the development of trade in services, with a focus on Information Technology and Communication, Professional services, Tourism and Travel, and Healthcare services. It was found that each country in the region has targeted specific niche markets to develop and to increase global exports and outreach. While some countries have formulated ‘Vision Documents” for their economy, others have devised specialized programs for “Priority Sectors”. This study divides the general policy themes under specific categories: (i) Skill development programs, (ii) nation-wide connectivity and digitization plans, (iii) initiatives to boost technology and entrepreneurship, with a focus on start-ups and intellectual property rights (IPRs), (iv) and export and brand promotion policies. This paper then highlights the best practices in the region and provides recommendations to develop a more competitive services sector. This research was undertaken to obtain an in-depth analysis of current policy making to promote the development of services for domestic and trade purposes, as well as assessing the impact of these policy tools. Such findings were primarily based on desk-based research from publicly available information sources combined with discussions with key stakeholders as well as an informed interpretation of the findings.
Z38|A dynamic perspective on destination governance success: The case of an emerging network in the Dolomites|Development and competitiveness of tourism destinations have been often associated by previous literature to the effectiveness of destination governance. However, a thorough understanding of relevant dimensions explaining destination governance success, both from theoretical and analytical perspectives, is still lacking. With this paper the authors contribute to advancing the theory on destination governance, particularly focusing on the issue of governance success from a dynamic perspective. The theoretical and analytical framework proposed is based on the most recent developments of network governance studies and proposes an investigation of micro-dynamics to understand governance evolutionary paths towards successful or unsuccessful outcomes. The theoretical and analytical framework is applied to the case of an emerging network of stakeholders of an Alpine destination, the Comelico area. The analysis of the case, developed through an action research approach, allowed to identify both static (commitment and competences) and dynamic (framing and mobilizing) relevant dimensions in explaining successful or unsuccessful outcomes for emerging tourism destinations.
Z38|Tourism and Social Media in the World: An Empirical Investigation|The study examines the relationship between tourism and social media from a cross section of 138 countries with data for the year 2012.The empirical evidence is based on Ordinary Least Squares, Negative Binomial and Quantile regressions. Two main findings are established. First, there is a positive relationship between Facebook penetration and the number of tourist arrivals. Second, Facebook penetration is more relevant in promoting tourist arrivals in countries where initial levels in tourist arrivals are the highest and low. The established positive relationship can be elucidated from four principal angles: the transformation of travel research, the rise in social sharing, improvements in customer service and the reshaping of travel agencies. This study explores a new dataset on social media. There are very few empirical studies on the relevance of social media in development outcomes.
Z38|Finding Needles in Haystacks: Artificial Intelligence and Recombinant Growth|Innovation is often predicated on discovering useful new combinations of existing knowledge in highly complex knowledge spaces. These needle-in-a-haystack type problems are pervasive in fields like genomics, drug discovery, materials science, and particle physics. We develop a combinatorial-based knowledge production function and embed it in the classic Jones growth model (1995) to explore how breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) that dramatically improve prediction accuracy about which combinations have the highest potential could enhance discovery rates and consequently economic growth. This production function is a generalization (and reinterpretation) of the Romer/Jones knowledge production function. Separate parameters control the extent of individual-researcher knowledge access, the effects of fishing out/complexity, and the ease of forming research teams.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Z38|Contemporary Drivers of Global Tourism: Evidence from Terrorism and Peace Factors|This study examines the effect of terrorism and peace on tourist destination arrivals using a panel of 163 countries with data for the period 2010 to 2015. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments and Negative Binomial (NB) regressions. Our best estimators are from NB regressions from which the following main findings are established. First, political instability, violent demonstrations and number of homicides negatively affect tourist arrivals while the number of incarcerations positively influences the outcome variable. Second the effects from military expenditure, â€œarmed service personnelâ€ and â€œsecurity officers and policesâ€ are not positively significant. Managerial implications are discussed.

Z38|Mitigating externalities of terrorism on tourism: global evidence from police, security officers and armed service personnel|In this paper, we investigate the role of security officers, the police and armed service personnel in dampening the effect of terrorism externalities on tourist arrivals. The temporal and geographic scopes are respectively 2010-2015 and 163 countries. Four terrorism measurements are used. They include the number of: incidents, injuries, fatalities and property damages. The main findings indicate that armed service personnel can effectively be used to modulate the damaging influence of all four terrorism externalities in order to achieve a positive net effect on tourist arrivals. Conversely, the corresponding moderating role of security officers and the police is not statistically significant. Moreover, violent demonstrations and homicides have a harmful effect on tourist arrivals while the number of incarcerations displays the opposite effect. Policy implications are discussed.

Z38|Hosting a Mega-Event: Is it Good or Bad for the Economy? General Equilibrium Models as a Litmus Paper Test|Hosting mega-events has long been regarded as an opportunity for economic growth, creating long-lasting benefits and attaining international recognition. Recently, both the scientific community and the public opinion at large have turned much more skeptical about the impact of mega-events. Why is it that some events appear successful and other disasters? Why the perception of impacts has changed over time? To answer these (and other) questions, there is a need to go beyond the simple narratives and “stylized facts”, to undertake some serious scientific investigation, based on verifiable data and testable models. Despite the fact that most recent studies use the same modeling tool, namely some Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, results are sometimes contradictory, thereby hindering the trustiness of the economic analysis for policy guidance. In this paper, we show that results are different because assumptions are different and because the range of effects considered is different, even when the same model is employed. Furthermore, some critical hypotheses are not often clearly stated. We advocate some kind of standardization in the process of model building for the economic assessment of mega-events. Only a transparent and replicable model exercise can serve as a “litmus paper”, to ascertain whether hosting a mega-event is good or bad for an economy.
Z38|Sustaining nature-based tourism in Iceland|Iceland has been experiencing a tourism boom. The number of tourists visiting annually quadrupled between 2010 and 2016 and shows continued strength. The tourism sector is now the major export earner and is also creating new jobs and supporting new businesses. The government budget has also benefitted from high tax revenues. The surge in tourism supported growth after the crisis and the sector has become a major pillar of the economy. But, the breakneck growth of tourism has created a number of challenges. Growing pains have emerged as accommodation supply has lagged in the wake of unexpectedly large number of tourists, contributing to pressure on the local housing market. The environment, particularly in some popular sites, has also come under pressure. The government has reacted to these environmental and social impacts and has worked with the industry to agree on a path forward. Sustaining a nature-based tourism for Iceland will require more coordinated policy across government and a long-term strategic plan that builds on Iceland's strengths. Protecting the unique environmental attractions of Iceland - while mitigating adverse social impacts - will lay the basis for the healthy development of a new important sector. This working paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of Iceland (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-iceland.htm).
Z38|The Creation Of A New Tourist Destination In Low Density Areas: The Boticas Case|The goal of this paper is to contribute to identify a set of resources and tourism products, which can enhance the development and sustainability of tourism in the low density municipality of Boticas, located in the north east of Portugal. Therefore, this paper tries to: i) produce a first analysis of the tourism potential of the municipality of Boticas; and ii) identify different perceptions of different stakeholders regarding the tourism potential of Boticas. To this end, the content analysis of semi-structured interviews conducted in 2014 to local and regional social and political stakeholders were used. Likewise, in 2015 two focus groups were conducted with main local stakeholders. The results highlight three main facts: first, there are unexplored tourism resources with potential to attract certain niches of tourist demand; second, the region has been investing in the diversification of its supply of leisure and recreational activities, as well as available tourism equipment; and third, the region is facing serious difficulties in creating a local and regional stakeholder network in order to provide an integrated promotion of tourism. We conclude by identifying few policy recommendations on development issues for the municipality of Boticas or other rural areas presenting similar constraints.
Z38|Zahlungsbereitschaften für deutsche Erfolge bei den Olympischen Winterspielen 2014 in Sotschi und die Austragung Olympischer Spiele in Deutschland|In diesem Beitrag werden erstens positive Zahlungsbereitschaften für sportliche Erfolge der deutschen Mannschaft bei den Olympischen Winterspielen 2014 in Sotschi untersucht und zweitens die positive oder auch negative Zahlungsbereitschaft für die Austragung Olympischer Spiele in Deutschland. Wichtige positive Faktoren der Zahlungsbereitschaft für einen vorderen deutschen Platz im Medaillenspiegel sind Interesse am Wintersport, das Verfolgen der Winterspiele, die Einschätzung einer hohen nationalen Bedeutung eines guten Abschneidens und ein eher niedriges Einkommen (1.000 bis 2.000 € statt über 4.000 €). Signifikant negativ in den Schätzungen sind interessanterweise eigenes Sporttreiben, eine höhere Identifikation mit der deutschen Mannschaft und ein mittleres Alter. Hochgerechnet auf Deutschland ergibt sich eine aggregierte Zahlungsbereitschaft von 2,7, 1,6 bzw. 1,0 Mrd. € für einen ersten, zweiten oder dritten deutschen Platz im Medaillenspiegel, während für eine einzige Goldmedaille in der jeweiligen Lieblingssportart die aggregiert Zahlungsbereitschaft bei 5,2 Mrd. € läge. Für eine Austragung Olympischer Spiele in Deutschlang gibt es aggregiert eine positive Zahlungsbereitschaft von 6,7 Mrd. €, der jedoch Kompensationsforderungen in Höhe von 3,1 Mrd. € gegenüberstehen, was zu einem positiven Saldo von 3,6 Mrd. € führt.
Z38|Willingness to pay and accept for hosting Olympic Games in Germany|This empirical study investigates whether and how much individuals are willing to pay for hosting Olympic Games in Germany. Moreover, it is examined for the first time what individuals are willing to accept to host Olympic Games in their own country if they do not like that. Furthermore, this study identifies determinants that influence the willingness to pay (WTP) including the willingness to accept (WTA) for hosting Olympic Games in Germany. WTP minus WTA is positively driven by the felt national importance of the German Olympic team doing well. Socio-economic factors such as gender, age and income influence this measure in significant ways, too. The extrapolation of the individual WTP and WTA shows that, in the net aggregate, the German population is willing to pay €3.57 billion for hosting the Olympic Games in Germany.
Z38|A Model For The Transition Towards The Sustainable Management Of Tourism Destinations In Ireland|Tourism destinations depend upon complex development, planning, management and stakeholder involvement. The sustainable management of tourism requires consideration due to the contribution it makes to environmental, cultural/social and economic issues. However tourism destination management is not a straight forward process. Organisations tasked with developing tourism need to be aware of the sensitive issues which may affect the local community. This papers draws on previous doctoral research into both the demand and supply of sustainable tourism in Ireland. Additional analysis from research into the levels of sustainable management of tourism destinations in Ireland was also used to construct a model to help in the transition towards sustainable management of tourism destinations (SMTD). Future tourism policy making may be enhanced by the implementation of the model for the transition towards the sustainable management of tourism destinations.
Z38|The Role Of The Regional Development Association Of Nationalities Along The Mura (Muramenti Nemzetisegi Teruletfejlesztesi Tarsulas) In The Croatian-Hungarian Cross Border Cooperation With A Special Attention On Tourism|Despite the intensification of cross-border relations, it has been experienced that Euroregions were not able to achieve effective cooperation so far. The main reasons can be detected due to multi-heterogeneity, plural recruitment of interests and disinterest due to the lack of resources. To solve this problem, Regulation (EC) No 1082/2006 on a European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC) was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, thus the organization of EGTC have been created (MARTINEZ, A. A. 2014). The analysed local government association made continuous efforts in the last 25 years to develop the Croatian and Hungarian areas. This cooperation was based on trust as well resulting in the creation of the Mura Region EGTC which we believe will result in a quality change in terms of economy and tourism development as well. This is possible because the EGTC functions as a quasi-enterprise, being a legal entity as well and so it is able to tender not only the national sources but directly from Brussels. It is also a unique situation at this organisation that while in the Carpathian Basin the cross border relations are mainly based on Hungarian-Hungarian relations, in this case the Croatian-Croatian partnership is dominating. In addition, size and existing daily inter-ethnic relations contribute to the high level of success (BALI, L.-FITOS, G. 2012). The Mura Region EGTC was registered by the Croatian and Hungarian partners in June 2015 to strengthen the social-economical cohesion with the improvement of accessibility on the micro level and the evolving of eco-touristic developments for less environmental impacts. The Mura Region provides unique natural environment and a rather complex potential for tourism (CSAPO, J. 2014). Unfortunately the quantity and quality of the infrastructure demands further investments to satisfy different needs of the tourists. Creating a good relationship for cooperation and permanent search for financial resources are essential tasks for local governments. This study aims to demonstrate the formation, programming activity and future potential of the Mura Region EGTC pointing out recommendations of further development directions by presenting past and relevant present projects and analysing their multiplier effects. The research is completed with detailed legal analysis and interviews with municipal leaders.
Z38|Impacts Of Green Marketing Strategies On Benefits Of Hotels: The Case From Serbia|It is believed that tourism slowly and silently destroys environment, therefore implementing green technologies and responsible business behavior are among the most trending issues in contemporary tourism. Implementing Environmental Management System and quality standards ISO14000 and ISO14001 in hotels in Serbia are still at the early stage. The main goal of this study was to investigate the major obstacles for implementation of business based on ecological awareness and to assess to what extent the Green Marketing Strategies have influence on the image of the hotels, relations with the local community, competitiveness on the market, profitability and satisfaction of employees. The sample comprised 20% of the total number of hotels in Serbia which are known to use any form of â€˜greenâ€™ marketing. The results confirm that the process of implementation of sustainable marketing strategies is at a very low scale (M=2.89). The regression analysis shows that the most beneficial are the satisfaction of employees and profitability. Furthermore, the results show that there are no differences in the implementation of such strategies regarding the hotels location, categorization and capacity, whereas certain benefits of green marketing vary in relation to location and the capacity of the hotel.
Z38|Local Authority Planning Provision Of Policies And Guidelines For Event Management: An Irish Perspective|This paper examines the role local authorities play in planning for event management on a global scale. More specifically it focuses on assessing the local authority planning provision of policies and guidelines to responsibly manage the process of event management in the Republic of Ireland. This research utilised a quantitative methodology in the form of a content analysis approach. This approach allowed for a valuable cross representation of results in relation to local authority planning for event management in Ireland. Analysis revealed a lack of adoption and integration of planning policies and guidelines within local authorities nationwide. This has implications for the sustainability and longevity of the event industry in Ireland. As such the need to understand the importance of developing and implementing sustainable planning systems for the event industry in Ireland by local authorities cannot be ignored. This paper concludes that while the lack of adoption of planning systems by local authorities in Ireland is worrying, regulating and implementing sustainable planning systems nationwide can improve it.
