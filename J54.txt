J54|Why Isn't Uber Worker-Managed? A Model of Digital Platform Cooperatives|Thanks to algorithmic management, the digital platform sector does not require sophisticated governance structures and labour intensity tends to be higher than in traditional sectors. So, why aren’t usually digital labour platforms worker cooperatives? We develop a simple model to study the comparative viability of a worker-managed (WM) via-app labour platform firm vis-à-vis a capital-managed (CM) counterpart. Firms compete over workers by choosing the optimal size and (CM firms only) the pay policy. Given the size of the market, we show that WM platforms maximize per-capita incomes over a middle range interval of firm size. At the equilibrium size, viability of WM firms may be impeded by the costs of the external capital, no matter how low, which enable CM firms to pay a wage premium. The worker payoff in CM firms is higher in the presence of higher unit revenues and network effects (which improve the ability to pay of WM firms, thereby stimulating pay competition between platforms) and lower when WM platforms need to charge new members a fee to overcome free-riding problems faced by those who fund the initial investment. The model also shows that the conditions for worker buyouts are weaker than those required for WM platform creation from scratch, and that group incentive mechanisms allow WM platforms to better pursue quality improvements than CM firms, when digital techniques make the cost of effort relatively low.
J54|Italian cooperatives: an analysis of their economic performances, employment characteristics and innovation processes based on combined used of official data|Researchers and policymakers have identified the need to accurately and quantitatively evaluate cooperatives and their economic, social and employment effects, as well as their evolution over time, in a way that is as reliable as possible and not subject to interpretation. This need was also manifested in the adoption by the 20th International Conference of Labour Statisticians of the Guidelines Concerning Statistics of Cooperatives, which aim to facilitate the development of a set of statistics on cooperatives that can be compared at the international level. This study provides informative insights and analyses based on a unified statistical representation of the structure, economic performance and profiles of cooperatives—including cooperative groups— within the Italian economy. Through the integration of several official statistical data sources released by the Italian National Institute of Statistics with the Cooperative Register managed by the Ministry of Economic Development, on the one hand, the paper highlights the peculiarities of cooperatives compared to other companies; on the other hand, it analyses in depth the composition of the cooperative sector with respect to both economic and structural variables.
J54|Workers BuyOut: why employee-owned enterprises are more resilient than corporate business in time of economic and financial crisis? The case of Emilia-Romagna Region|The Workers BuyOut (WBO) is an economic and social phenomenon that has developed since the beginning of the 2008 financial and economic crisis and is still growing. In Italy, its roots can be traced back to the 1970s and today journalists and politicians are publishing reportages and books on this phenomenon. Inside the Italian scientific community, also some economists have dedicated accurate but rare studies to the topic. Nevertheless, the WBO has not yet become the focus of a precise and in-depth research by sociologists, despite its evident social relevance. The present paper is the result of a sociological investigation carried out by the authors and aims at illustrating this phenomenon through the lens of organizational analysis. It is structured in five sections: a general introduction; a description of the phenomenon at the national level, through the analysis of its normative grounds and its quantitative dimensions; a more detailed description of the WBO in EmiliaRomagna Region; a focus on the case study of one firm that turned into a successful WBO; a critical conclusion, highlighting the main incentives and obstacles for the full development of WBO experiences.
J54|Do Employee Share Owners Face Too Much Financial Risk?|A major theoretical objection against employee ownership is that workers become inadequately diversified and exposed to excessive financial risk. Recent theory concludes that 10-15% of a worker's wealth portfolio can be prudently invested in employer stock provided the rest of the portfolio is properly diversified. This paper analyzes employee share ownership in U.S. family financial portfolios using data from the 2004-2016 Survey of Consumer Finances. We find that 15.3% of families with private-sector employees had employer stock in their portfolio, with a median value of $6,000 and a median percent of family net worth of 3.1%. About one in five (19.2%) of the families with employer stock exceed the 15% threshold. This may be overstated given that the 15% threshold pertains to purchased stock and not to stock granted with no sacrifice by the employee. A higher percentage of families exceed the threshold for stock bought directly than for stock in pension plans. The analysis shows that employee ownership appears to generally add to, rather than substitute for, other wealth, which lessens the financial risk. We also find that families with employer stock are found to express more tolerance of financial risk, have higher self-rated knowledge of personal finances, and are more likely to understand the value of diversification. While financial risk does not appear to represent a substantial problem in practice for most employee share owners, a small minority may face excessive risk. We conclude with approaches to address excessive financial risk in company stock when it appears.
J54|The Economic Preferences of Cooperative Managers|A growing body of research has been investigating the role of management practices and managerial behaviour in conventional private firms and public sector organizations. However, little is known about managers’ behavioural profile in noninvestor-owned firms. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive behavioural characterization of managers employed in cooperatives. We gathered incentive-compatible measures of risk preferences, time preferences, reciprocity, altruism, and trust from 196 Uruguayan managers (half of them employed in worker cooperatives) and 92 first-year undergraduate students. To do this, we conducted a high-stakes lab-in-the-field experiment in which participants played a series of online experimental games and made incentivised decisions. The average payoff in the experiment was approximately 2.5 times higher than the average local managerial wage in the private sector. Our key findings are that (1) the fraction of risk loving subjects is lower among co-op managers compared to conventional managers, and (2) co-op managers appear to be more altruistic than their conventional counterparts. Interestingly, we do not observe significant differences between the two groups across other preference domains, such as impatience, trust, and reciprocity.
J54|Personal Attitudes, Job Characteristics and Health|Using a new German individual data set, we investigate the influence on health with respect to personal traits measured by the Big Five, collegiality, commitment and job characteristics. Among the Big Five conscientiousness, agreeableness and emotional stability correlate positively with good health. Job characteristics like activities combined with substantial decision authority, no physically demanding tasks, pleasant environmental conditions, little time pressure and no necessity of multitasking affect health in the same direction. If employees get help if needed from their colleagues and if they do not feel unfairly criticized by others in the firm, they usually have no health problems. For mental health, all Big Five items are influential whereas no statistical significance could be found for the number of days workers were absent due to sickness except in cases of neuroticism.
J54|New Pay: Welche Anreize funktionieren überhaupt noch?|Die Arbeitswelt wandelt sich hin zu komplexeren und interaktiveren Tätigkeiten. Dabei wächst die Bedeutung von Wissen und intrinsischer Motivation, während die Messbarkeit von Leistungen anhand einfacher Zielindikatoren zurückgeht und individuelle leistungsorientierte Vergütungsbestandteile Fehlanreize setzen können, wie neuere Erkenntnisse aus der Verhaltensökonomie belegen. Deshalb müssen Vergütungsmodelle den Anforderungen der modernen Arbeitswelt gerecht werden und entsprechend verändert werden. Für die Zukunft bieten sich vor allem drei Bausteine bei der variablen Vergütung an: erstens eine Vergütung, die am Firmen- oder Teamerfolg ansetzt anstatt individuellen Erfolg zu prämieren; zweitens Entlohnungs- und Arbeitsgestaltungsmodelle nach dem Cafeteria-Prinzip mit individuellen Wahlmöglichkeiten; und drittens können Kapitalbeteiligungen neben dem verteilungspolitischen Aspekt die Motivation steigern, ohne viel Detailsteuerung zu benötigen.
J54|Skin or Skim? Inside Investment and Hedge Fund Performance|"Hedge fund managers contribute substantial personal capital, or ""skin in the game,"" into their funds. While these allocations may better align incentives, managers may also strategically allocate their private capital in ways that negatively affect investors. We find that funds with more inside investment outperform other funds within the same family. However, this relationship is driven by managerial decisions to invest capital in their least-scalable strategies and restrict the entry of new outsider capital into these funds. Our results suggest that skin in the game may work as a rent-extraction mechanism at the expense of fund participation of outside investors."
J54|Employment protection regimes in worker co-operatives: dismissal of worker members and distributive fairness|This paper discusses the possibility of strong employment protection in co-operatives (exclusion of dismissal) and of the imposition of a minimum wage equal for all worker members in worker co-operatives. It maintains that the worker co-operative has unique features in its ability to reach employment stabilization. It shows, both theoretically and with reference to existing empirical evidence, why and how worker co-operatives are able to overcome the lay-off of workers, strongly reducing employment fluctuation when compared to other organizational forms. The development of more thorough and radical regimes of employment protection and distributive justice fulfil satisfaction of basic needs, workers’ right to work and to keep the job position. While stricter constraints on layoffs can cause inefficiencies (e.g. make it more difficult to dismiss under-performing workers), they also serve an insurance function against unemployment, favor the accumulation of firm-specific human, relational and social capital, and can increase performance in the medium to long run. Voluntary resignation, not involuntary layoff would the dominant mechanism allowing allocation of labor resources to the most productive occupations.
J54|Un análisis del desempeño comparado de empresas recuperadas, otras empresas gestionadas por sus trabajadores y empresas convencionales en Uruguay|In the recent economic crisis experienced by many developed countries in the last decade and during the past crisis at the beginning of the 21st century in Argentina and Uruguay we could observe the emergence of the phenomenon of the so-called recovered firms (RFs) or employee buyouts of failed capitalist firms (CFs). While it is obvious that one of the objectives sought by these workers is to keep their jobs, it is not clear how the subsequent performance of these firms is. Are the RFs more likely to fail than other worker managed firms (WMFs) or than the CFs? Do the RFs workers perceive a higher wage than their peers in other WMFs or in CF? This analysis is based on a linked employer-employees panel data set from the Uruguayan social security administrative records. The main findings are that the RFs survive longer than other WMFs or than CFs. However, the RFs workers receive a wage substantially lower than their peers with similar observable characteristics in other WMFs or in CFs. This wage differential is explained partially because of a drain process of the more qualified and younger workers who did not participated in the workers takeover.
J54|Employer-Employee Profit-Sharing and the Incentives to Innovate when the Dismissal Regulation Matters|We develop a simple incomplete-contract model of the relationship between worker participation to revenue sharing and innovation performance of firms, under firing regimes with different stringency. Stronger worker participation to profits is shown to increase innovation probability when employer-side hold-up is prevented by stringent layoff regulation and the human capital matters signicantly. Vice-versa, under a strict layoff regulation, when the financial capital is relatively more important, the effects of worker participation devices may be reduced or inverted. Our results may help in understanding why there is no one-size-fits-all optimal strategy in the design of worker financial participation mechanisms for knowledge-intensive productions
J54|The contribution of the non-profit sector in narrowing spatial inequalities: Four cases of inter-institutional cooperation in Italy|In this chapter we illustrate how the public sector might fail in narrowing spatial inequalities, and how both underdeveloped markets and urgent territorial needs create in peripheral areas robust individual incentives to turn into non-profit activities or even household production. In all those situations, a well-developed non-profit sector can offer marginalized or excluded social groups a legal and ethical opportunity to obtain a decent income by offering rewards (monetary or non-monetary) in exchange for volunteering, allowing households to afford the cost of living. Laying on the results of the analysis, we discuss four cases of successful cooperation among SSE institutions by one side, and the private and the public sector on the other. In all those cases, the private and the public sector decided to facilitate the development of the non-profit sector by contracting out part of the production process to reduce costs and achieve a higher level of effectiveness. The result was successful because the non-profit sector did not incur in the opportunistic behaviors that might affect profit-oriented activities. Therefore, we suggest how local inter-institutional cooperation among the SSE, the private and the public sector should become the norm rather than the exception, in order to achieve at the same time a higher level of equitable and sustainable development and well-being.
J54|La dynamique de changement des formes de gouvernance : le cas français (2000-2014)|(VF)Cet article se donne pour objectif d’examiner une dimension cruciale et pourtant méconnue de la gouvernance des entreprises. Nous étudions la dynamique de la gouvernance des sociétés cotées françaises (SBF 120) sur une longue période d’observation (2000-2014) qui englobe les principales réformes françaises. Plus précisément, nous analysons les variables susceptibles d’influencer la stabilité de la structure de gouvernance. Pour cela, nous mobilisons des modèles de durée multi-états de type semi-markovien afin d’analyser à la fois la durée et les transitions d’une forme de gouvernance à une autre des sociétés cotées françaises. Nos résultats montrent que la stabilité de la structure de gouvernance est essentiellement liée aux caractéristiques personnelles du dirigeant en poste, à la performance de l’entreprise et la structure actionnariale. Cependant, un examen approfondi par type de transition montre l’influence multiple et parfois contrastée de certaines variables. (VA) The aim of this article is to examine a crucial and yet unknown aspect of corporate governance. More precisely, we analyze the variables which are likely to influence the stability of the governance structure of French listed companies (SBF 120 index). We study the dynamics of corporate governance over a long period of observation (2000-2014), which encompasses the main French reforms. We use duration models based on Markovian-type processes to examine both the transitions from one form of governance to the other, but also the duration and therefore the stability of the forms of governance of listed French companies. Our results show that the stability of the corporate governance structure is linked to the personal characteristics of the CEO, the performance of the company and the shareholder structure essentially. However, a thorough examination by type of transition shows the multiple and sometimes contrasted influence of some variables. Our article brings a new light on the dynamics of the governance of French listed companies.
J54|Where Does Profit Sharing Work Best? A Meta-Analysis on the Role of Unions, Culture, and Values|In this article we re-examine the relationship between group-based profit sharing and productivity. Our meta-regression analysis of 313 estimates from 56 studies controls for publication selection and misspecification biases and investigates the impact of firm level unionisation and national differences in values and culture. Profit sharing is positively related to productivity on average, with a stronger relationship where there is higher unionisation and in countries where honesty is less highly valued and there are higher levels of individualism. The latter two results suggest profit sharing works best in settings where cooperation does not naturally occur. The positive effect of profit sharing on productivity is larger in cooperative firms and in transition economies.
J54|Does Employee Stock Ownership Work? Evidence from publicly-traded firms in Japan|This paper provides novel evidence on the effects of employee stock ownership (ESO), using new panel data on Japanese ESO plans for a highly representative sample of publicly-traded firms in Japan (covering more than 75% of all firms listed on Tokyo Stock Exchange) over 1989-2013. Unlike most prior studies, we focus on the effects of changes in varying attributes of existing ESO—the effects on the intensive margin. Our fixed effect estimates show that an increase in the strength of the existing ESO plans measured by stake per employee results in statistically significant productivity gains. Furthermore, such productivity gains are found to lead to profitability gains since wage gains from ESO plans are statistically significant yet rather modest. Our analysis of Tobin's Q suggests that the market tends to view such gains from ESO plans as permanent. We further find that increasing the stake of the existing core participants is more effective in boosting gains from ESO plans than bringing in more employees into the trust. Reassuringly, our key results are found to be robust to the use of instrumental variables to account for possible endogeneity of ESO plans. Finally, we explore possible interplays between ESO plans and firm characteristics such as ownership structure and firm size/age. First, the positive effects on productivity, profitability, wages and Tobin's Q are found to become larger as the proportion of powerful institutional investors and foreign investors rises, implying that the growing importance of such powerful outside shareholders may be reducing the adverse managerial entrenchment effect of ESO plans. Second, productivity gains from ESO plans are found to be more limited for smaller and younger firms. We interpret the finding as evidence in favor of the institutional complementarity view that ESO plans are an integral part of the Japanese High Performance Work System (HPWS)—a complementary cluster of human resource management practices which are more pervasive among larger and older firms in Japan.
J54|Producers to Markets Alliance. Informe Final. Estudio de Línea de Base|Este documento presenta los principales resultados del Estudio de Línea de Base para el Programa Producers to Markets Alliance –PMA- financiado por la Agencia para la Cooperación Internacional del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos –USAID- y elaborado por FEDESARROLLO. The Producers to Markets Alliance (PMA) pretende aumentar la competitividad y los ingresos sostenibles de por lo menos 75.000 productores localizados en 40 municipios de 10 departamentos en 7 corredores e incluidos en las cadenas productivas de cacao, cafés especiales, caucho, leche y frutas y hortalizas, mediante el aumento en el valor de las exportaciones y de las ventas de las organizaciones de productores a los compradores finales del sector privado en alianzas al interior de las cadenas productivas seleccionadas y superando obstáculos derivados de las deficiencias en infraestructura, especialmente en mantenimiento de vías terciarias y sistemas de riego, con especial énfasis en jóvenes, mujeres y minorías étnicas, con una visión de aprendizaje y gestión del conocimiento. Para realizar el Estudio de Línea de Base del Programa Producers to Markets Alliance –PMA- se llevó a cabo un análisis cuantitativo basado en la aplicación de 94 encuestas a asociaciones de productores (censo), 653 encuestas a productores de 7.363 productores asociados a ellas, y 34 encuestas a municipios incluidos en el Programa; los instrumentos de recolección se diseñaron con base en Talleres de Expertos (TE) en cada una de las cadenas. Igualmente, se realizó un análisis cualitativo basado en la realización de 60 Entrevistas a Profundidad (EP): 30 a funcionarios municipales, 15 a presidentes de asociaciones y 15 a técnicos de campo, y en la realización de 15 Grupos Focales con productores (3 en cada una de las cadenas), con base en los cuales se realizó una codificación en Atlas.ti que permitió construir matrices HCR (Hallazgos, Conclusiones, Recomendaciones) para cada una de las cadenas bajo estudio. Finalmente, se aplicaron Métodos Mixtos (QCA). Todo lo anterior, se aplicó para las cinco cadenas bajo estudio: cacao, café, caucho, leche y frutas-hortalizas. La línea de base contiene una batería de indicadores para medir el desempeño de las asociaciones, de los productores y de los municipios que serán beneficiados por la estrategia del PMA. En esta sección se presenta un resumen de los indicadores que miden aspectos que son transversales a todas o a varias de las 5 cadenas productivas focalizadas. Todos los indicadores de desempeño de las asociaciones se pueden consultar en el Anexo No 1, los indicadores de desempeño de los productores en el Anexo 2 y los indicadores de desempeño de los municipios.
J54|EQUILIBRIUM UNEMPLOYMENT AS A WORKER INSURANCE DEVICE. Wage setting in worker owned enterprises|Extending Shapiro and Stiglitz’s (1984) analysis of unemployment as a worker discipline device, we evidence how an economy populated by worker owned firms (WOFs), by overcoming information asymmetry on the employee side in the presence of employer opportunism (as embodied in moral hazard, hidden action and abuse of authority), can decrease, not increase equilibrium wages, while employment is necessarily higher in the presence of WOFs. Within the Shapiro and Stiglitz framework, our analysis evidences that the non-shirking constraint (NSC) for WOFs is lower for any employment and wage level than in investor owned firms (IOFs). By factoring bi-later asymmetric information and opportunism in the employment relation, our model implies that the Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) results represent special cases in the wider analysis of equilibrium wages and employment in market economies. Relatedly, the potential for unemployment reduction and efficiency gain of worker ownership (as especially embodied in worker co-operatives, and employee-owned companies) has generally been understudied and empirical evidence coherent with this results need to be more thoroughly analysed.
J54|La « face cachée » de l’actionnariat salarié : Etude empirique sur l’indice SBF 120 (2000-2014) - The dark side of employee ownership in french listed companies, an enquiry on the SBF 120 between 2000 and 2014|(VF)L’actionnariat salarié se développe de manière inexorable et tend à faire des salariés des acteurs incontournables de la gouvernance des entreprises. Face à cette transformation importante de l’actionnariat, les recherches les plus récentes évaluent de manière ambivalente les effets de l’actionnariat salarié. Cet article se focalise sur un phénomène jusqu’à présent très peu étudié : l’actionnariat salarié significatif c’est-à-dire l’incidence d’une présence majeure voire majoritaire des salariés dans le capital et au sein des organes de gouvernance. Nos résultats démontrent un effet négatif de l’actionnariat salarié significatif sur la performance économique des entreprises. Cet effet est renforcé par la présence d’administrateurs salariés dans les instances de gouvernance. Nos tests économétriques sont basés sur la méthode d’estimations des GMM en panel dynamique qui permet de traiter les problèmes d’endogénéité. Notre étude quantitative examine les 120 plus grandes entreprises françaises sur une période d’observation inédite (2000-2014). (VA)Employee stock ownership is a growing phenomenon and nowadays employees tend to play a key role in corporate governance. Researchers have largely documented this shift in ownership and corporate governance processes and they show that employee ownership has mitigated effects. In this article, we focus on situation of ownership where employees have significant shares and occupy majority positions. We show that in these contexts, employee ownership has negative consequences on firm performance. These negative consequences are reinforced when employees are represented in board of directors. We applied the dynamic panel GMM model which appears particularly well suited to deal with potential endogeneity problem. Our data encompasses the largest French listed companies (SBF 120) form 2000 to 2014.
J54|What deters labor-owned firm creation? Evidence from Italian manufacturing sectors|We analyze the determinants of labor-owned versus capital-owned firm creation. We match firm-level information on a large sample of new manufacturing firms with available industry-level proxies of the main determinants of ownership structures according to existing economic theories. We estimate a logit model and quantify the empirical contribution of each argument to explain labor-owned versus capital-owned firm entry. Our results show that human capital specificity and workers heterogeneity largely explain labor-owned firm entry, while other dimensions, such as limited worker wealth, have a weaker statistical relevance. These findings are robust to different estimation methods and are unlikely to be affected by endogeneity concerns. Our results contribute to the general understanding of the endogenous dynamics of ownership rights distribution in manufacturing firms and to the elaboration of policy initiatives aimed at supporting cooperative modes of firm organization.
J54|Organizational Design with Portable Skills|Workers can move across firms and take with them portable skills. This has an impact on how firms are organized and allocate tasks across workers. To reduce mobility, a profit maximizing firm may inefficiently allocate talented workers on tasks that reduce their outside option. In the existing literature, asymmetric information about workers' talents makes this retention strategy profitable, although inefficient. In this paper we let workers' skills be observable across firms, but task allocation to be non-contractible. Inefficient assignment of tasks to workers persists in this environment. We show that by organizing a firm as an equity-partnership, in which the total profit is shared, the efficient task allocation can be implemented and profit increased. This result is attained through shifting control rights to workers that become partners and decide over task allocation. Both partners and workers are retained in equilibrium. This paper provides a new rationale for the widespread presence of partnerships in human-capital intensive industries.
J54|Ceding control: an experimental analysis of participatory management|Abstract We use an experiment to evaluate the effects of participatory management on firm performance. Participants are randomly assigned roles as managers or workers in firms that generate output via real effort. To identify the causal effect of participation on effort, workers are exogenously assigned to one of the two treatments: one in which the manager implements a compensation scheme unilaterally or another in which the manager cedes control over compensation to the workers who vote to implement a scheme. We find that output is between seven and twelve percentage points higher in participatory firms.
J54|Jevons’s Ideal Role for Labor Unions as a Form of Co-operation|This research examines the ideas about labor unions found in William Stanley Jevons's works. I focus on the collaborative role Jevons envisioned for these organizations as part of a broader cooperative vision between workers and capitalists. Even though Jevons was not a supporter of labor unions and regarded them as monopolies with limited power to increase wages, on the one hand, and with great potential for generating dead losses of wages due strikes, on the other, he did not consider indispensable their elimination as long as they were guided to co-operate with business. This study concludes that there is more than one form of co-operation in Jevons’s thought. One explicit, from capitalist to workers, via profit sharing, and a second one, implicit, through the collaboration of workers to capitalists via their participation in labor organizations different than traditional labor unions. A major implication of this scheme is that both forms of co-operation have to be present for it to be beneficial for both classes. The latter, however, would not ensure that they are equally beneficiated.
J54|Inequality as Lack of Co-operation in Economic Thought|This study is about the notion of co-operation by economic thinkers of the 19th century in the United Kingdom. It presents a comparison and contrast of their ideas as well as an analysis of the relationship between co-operation and economic and social inequality. Two approaches of such relationship are identified. First, an economic-centered view, found in Charles Babbage and William Stanley Jevons, where the benefits of co-operation are linked to profit sharing, the increase of productivity and the expansion of the economic system. Second, Robert Owen’s and John Stuart Mill’s ideas on co-operation, even though with different implications, are mainly socially-oriented. Here, it is possible to see a broader social concern that led them to suggest reforms that could have implications in terms of social (e.g., education and gender), and not only economic inequality. Marx’s analysis of co-operation does not belong to any of these approaches. In his view, under capitalism, the effect of some forms of co-operation may generate or reinforce inequality.
J54|The firm as a common. The case of the accumulation and use of capital resources in co-operative enterprises|Contemporary literature dealing with the governance of the exploitation of common-pool natural resources was initiated by Elinor Ostrom in 1990, and has been growing fast ever since. On the contrary, within the same research stream, the study of the presence and economic role of common resources in entrepreneurial-organizational is, to date, under-researched. This work endeavours some attempt to fill this gap by: first, spelling out a new-institutionalist framework for the analysis of the accumulation and governance of common capital resources within organizational boundaries; second, by considering co-operative enterprises as the organizational form that, on the basis of historical record, and of behavioural and institutional characteristics, demonstrated to be the most compatible with a substantial role for common and non-divided asset-ownership and with its governance thereof. The economic forces influencing the optimal level of self-financed common capital resources in co-operatives are enquired. Also their governance is brought under the spotlight, evidencing: (i) the constraints that need to be fulfilled, and the potential benefits arising out of their presence; (ii) the compatibility and mutual adaptability between democratic governance in co-operatives and the governance of non-divided assets.
J54|Equilibrium unemployment as a worker insurance device: Wage setting in worker owned enterprises|Worker cooperatives are shown to provide higher level of employment, higher employment stability and often greater wage volatility than similar investor-owned firms. A stylized fact that is nevertheless largely unexplained by the literature is the frequent evidence of lower wages in worker managed firms. To engage in the explanation of this fact, we use the Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) model on efficiency wages and unemployment as a discipline device. Given more efficient monitoring and the absence of wage premiums compensating the expected costs of contract failures, we show that efficiency wages in cooperatives are lower than in investor owned firms while employment is confirmed to be always higher. Our result is due to the informational advantage enjoyed by the firm’s owners, which imply a compensation requested by workers for employer opportunism, and to the role of horizontal control among workers, which reduces the equilibrium level of wages. We conclude that the S-S (1984) result, as applied to worker cooperatives, is a special case of a wider class of equilibria in the presence of contractual imperfections in the agency relation and that different ownership forms can differently impact the unemployment level.
J54|The non-profit sector as a foundation for the interaction among the social economy, the public sector and the market|The paper introduces a theoretical model to show how in a territorial framework characterized by spatial inequalities, the availability of goods and services decreases moving from central to peripheral areas. Specifically, private firms and public administrations might supply an insufficient level of goods and services in socially and/or physically remote areas due to lack of market size and higher distance costs. Peripheralization, therefore, often implies economic marginalization and political exclusion. Against this backdrop, non-profit organizations can foster local development rebalancing, or at least narrowing, economic and social inequalities, but a territorial dualism between a core linked to global patterns of development and marginalized peripheries left to autarchic forms of subsistence might emerge. To avoid territorial polarization and revive equitable and sustainable development, it is important to empower cooperative and social enterprises, as the latter exert a productive and distributive function that at the same time improves workers’ employability, facilitates market access for local initiatives, and raises the factor productivity of market activities.
J54|The quality of employment in the early labour market experience of young Europeans|Consistently with the empirical evidence and in contrast with Shapiro & Stiglitz (1984), we demonstrate that worker owned firms exhibit not only more wage flexibility and less employment volatility than investor owned firms, but also lower expected wages than the latter. This is due to the informational advantage enjoyed by the firm's owners relatively to the workers concerning some circumstances that affect the performance of the firm. We show this both in the case in which each investor owned firm offers labor contracts to single workers who act atomistically and in the case in which each investor owned firm negotiates labor conditions with its workers who act as a group (a ''union''). Finally, we show that differences in attitudes towards risk between investor owned firms and their workers are not necessary to explain the typical combination of state-independent wages and cyclical layoffs that characterizes most industries.
J54|Equilibrium unemployment as a worker insurance device: Worker insurance and wage setting in worker owned enterprises|Shapiro and Stiglitz model on efficiency wages shows that worker owned firms perform higher levels of wage and employment than in investor owner firms, but empirical evidence doesnâ€™t support the first result. Starting by the economic literature on workers cooperatives we extend the Shapiro and Stiglitzâ€™s analysis by introducing horizontal control among worker members and employer opportunism. Our results reconcile theory and empirical record showing how in cooperatives both unemployment and wages can be lower than in investor owned companies.
J54|Globalisierung und betriebliche Mitbestimmung|Der vorliegende Beitrag diskutiert verschiedene Szenarien zum Einfluss von Auslandsdirektinvestitionen auf die betriebliche Mitbestimmung in Deutschland. Vorliegende Studien sprechen dafür, dass die Funktionsfähigkeit betrieblicher Mitbestimmung in Betrieben mit ausländischen Eigentümern beeinträchtigt ist. Ein positiver Zusammenhang zwischen dem Vorhandensein eines Betriebsrats und der betrieblichen Produktivität sowie der Nutzung personalpolitischer Maßnahmen zur Steigerung der betrieblichen Leistungsfähigkeit lässt sich nur in Betrieben mit inländischen, nicht aber in Betrieben mit ausländischen Eigentümern nachweisen. Darüber hinaus sind kooperative Beziehungen zwischen Betriebsrat und Management in Betrieben mit ausländischen Eigentümern weniger wahrscheinlich als in Betrieben mit inländischen Eigentümern. Trotz der eingeschränkten Funktionsfähigkeit haben die Beschäftigten in Betrieben, die sich in ausländischem Eigentum befinden, ein erhöhtes Interesse an betrieblicher Mitbestimmung. Dies dürfte mit einer erhöhten Beschäftigungsunsicherheit und einem verstärkten Druck zur kurzfristigen Gewinnerzielung zusammenhängen.

Three different approaches are taken by the contributions to the special issue: one is theoretical, another is empirical and the last one is a case- based, qualitative perspective.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J54|Workplace democracy and job flows|This paper investigates the relationship between workplace democracy and job flows by comparing the behavior of worker-managed firms (WMFs) and conventional firms (CFs). The empirical analysis relies on high frequency administrative firm-level panel data from Uruguay over the period April 1996–July 2009. The main findings of the paper are that (1) WMFs exhibit much more stable job dynamics than CFs; (2) both types of firms have decreasing in age and increasing in size gross job creation profiles; (3) there are heterogeneous employment regimes within WMFs: job creation and destruction rates are high for hired workers and very low for members. This paper contributes to the literature on the role of institutions in shaping job flows. Our results have important implications for the understanding of the allocative efficiency effects of worker participation.
J54|Looking after number two? Competition, cooperation and workplace interaction|We look for cooperation in a real-world setting in which optometrists absent less frequently in two-chair than one-chair offices because of the externality such behavior imposes on their co-worker. We motivate our empirical analysis by developing a model of worker interdependence in which two workers can either compete or cooperate. We show that, relative to a single worker working in isolation, competition unequivocally increases absence whilst cooperation may increase or decrease absence. Our empirical analysis of a unique data set finds explicit support for cooperative behavior.
J54|Share capitalism and worker wellbeing|We show that worker wellbeing is determined not only by the amount of compensation workers receive but also by how compensation is determined. While previous theoretical and empirical work has often been preoccupied with individual performance-related pay, we find that the receipt of a range of group-performance schemes (profit shares, group bonuses and share ownership) is associated with higher job satisfaction. This holds conditional on wage levels, so that pay methods are associated with greater job satisfaction in addition to that coming from higher wages. We use a variety of methods to control for unobserved individual and job-specific characteristics. We suggest that half of the share-capitalism effect is accounted for by employees reciprocating for the “gift”; we also show that share capitalism helps dampen the negative wellbeing effects of what we typically think of as “bad” aspects of job quality.
J54|Does employee ownership improve performance?|Employee ownership has attracted growing attention for its potential to improve economic outcomes for companies, workers, and the economy in general, and help reduce inequality. Over 100 studies across many countries indicate that employee ownership is generally linked to better productivity, pay, job stability, and firm survival—though the effects are dispersed and causation is difficult to firmly establish. Free-riding often appears to be overcome by worker co-monitoring and reciprocity. Financial risk is an important concern but is generally minimized by higher pay and job stability among employee owners.
J54|Asset Impairment Accounting Decisions and Employee Downsizing in Japan|Given the long-term relationship between firms and employees, the literature suggests that managers enhance the informativeness of accounting numbers in anticipation of employee negotiations to inform their employees of the firm’s underlying economics. This study complements and extends the existing literature by investigating whether asset impairment losses play a signaling role in downsizing negotiations and whether variations in employee influence over firms lead to different impairment accounting practices. Specifically, using a large sample of Japanese firms operating in an environment where employee downsizing is difficult to implement, I find that asset impairment loss recognition mitigates the negative relationship between employee ownership and downsizing, suggesting that impairment losses signal firms’ future negative outlooks. In addition, the results suggest that impairment recognition is costly for managers and impairment losses reflect economic losses, consistent with the informative reporting hypothesis. Importantly, I also find that downsizing firms with strong employee bargaining power recognize asset impairment losses earlier around downsizing implementation than those with weak employee bargaining power, suggesting that such an accounting practice by downsizing firms with strong employee bargaining power elicits concessions from employees.
J54|Are Cooperatives More Productive Than Investor-Owned Firms? Cross-Industry Evidence From Portugal|We analyse empirically whether cooperatives and investor-owned firms differ in terms of productive efficiency. Using rich Portuguese panel data covering a wide range of industries, we apply two different empirical approaches to estimate potential differences in productive efficiency. The results from our benchmark random-effects model show that cooperatives are significantly less productive, on average, than investor-owned firms, both at the aggregate level and for most of the industries considered. However, the results derived from a System-GMM approach, which is our preferred empirical strategy, are much less conclusive, and we cannot conclude that cooperatives are generally less efficient that investorâ€ owned firms. With either approach, though, we find no evidence that cooperatives are more productive than investorâ€ owned firms in any industry.
J54|Traditionelle und neue intermediaere Akteure in den Arbeitswelten hochqualifizierter Solo-Selbststaendiger (Traditional and new intermediary actors in the labor markets of the highly-skilled solo self-employed)|Auf dem Arbeitsmarkt laesst sich eine wachsende Anzahl hochqualifizierter Solo-Selbststaendiger beobachten, fuer die angenommen wird, dass sie ihre Arbeitsbedingungen individuell aushandeln. In jedem Fall zeichnet sich deren Verguetung durch eine vergleichsweise hohe Heterogenitaet aus. Gleichzeitig laesst sich eine Verschiebung im Gefuege kollektiver Interessenvertretungsorgane beobachten, die sich darin zeigt, dass neben Gewerkschaften neue intermediaere Akteure (z.B. Agenturen, Genossenschaften) relevant werden. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist das Ziel des vorliegenden Beitrags, die Rolle traditioneller und neuer intermediaerer Akteure in den Aushandlungen der Arbeitsbedingungen, wie der Verguetung, von hochqualifizierten Solo-Selbststaendigen zu eruieren. Die empirische Basis des Beitrags bildet eine qualitative Studie mit Solo-Selbststaendigen sowie Vertretern/innen von Gewerkschaften, Berufsverbaenden, Agenturen und Genossenschaften in den Branchen Filmwirtschaft, IT-Dienstleistungen und Medizin. In der Analyse der Interviews wird deutlich, dass die hochqualifizierten Solo-Selbststaendigen ihre Verguetung nicht per se individuell aushandeln. Vielmehr wird die Aushandlung von Arbeitsbedingungen durch traditionelle und neue intermediaere Akteure gepraegt, die Beratungsangebote fuer Solo-Selbststaendige bereithalten und die Entwicklung und Verbreitung von Standards foerdern. (Solo self-employed people in Germany represent a growing part of the flexible workforce in knowledge-intensive services with highly heterogeneous income situations. This article challenges the common assumption that their working conditions are negotiated individually by exploring the role of traditional intermediary actors (unions, professional associations) and new intermediary actors (staffing agencies, cooperatives) in pay determination. The empirical basis is a qualitative interview study of solo-self-employed and representatives of unions, professional associations, staffing agencies and cooperatives in film, IT and medicine. The analysis illuminates the contribution of traditional and new intermediary actors to individual negotiations, but also to the development and diffusion of collective standards.)
J54|Resurrected, recovered, but still didn’t survive? A case study on the viability of employee-owned companies|While there have been high hopes about democratic governance structures in organizations recently, the empirical record of employee-owned companies (EOC) is rather bleak. Correspondingly, in the long-standing literature about EOCs, there seems to be a consensus regarding the rather limited viability of democratic organizational forms. Although the explanations, mainly based on microeconomic models, differ in the causal mechanisms explaining EOCs’ short average lifespan. In this paper, we challenge the conventional wisdom about the reasons for the limited viability of democratic organizational forms. We develop an alternative explanation for their normal failure by means of an in-depth case study that corresponds with the transformation expectation about EOCs into conventional firms. We analyze a German case which we were able to study over a long period of time including the end of the EOC (while the company survived the changes in ownership and corporate governance structures). Firstly, we show that classical explanations do not seem to be valid for this particular failure of democratic governance structures. Secondly, we try to explore alternative explanations for the institutionalized transformation expectation regarding EOCs. In order to overcome the shortcomings of microeconomic models of EOCs, we deploy a social-constructivist heuristic framework that is derived from the organizational theories of Niklas Luhmann und Karl E. Weick. Thus we focus on dynamic social sensemaking processes and decision-making processes at the organizational level at the same time. We stress the role organizational cognitive routines in EOCs play especially in their organizational environment, pointing to the social embedding of EOCs and to the historical trajectories of individual organizations as potential sources to explain the normal failure of EOCs. Our study also confirms the significance of both the ambivalence and ambiguity of sensemaking and the contingency in the decision-making process for the explanation of a phenomenon that looks, at first glance, rather causally determined.
J54|Las cooperativas no agropecuarias y la transformación económica en Cuba: políticas, procesos y estrategias<BR>[Non-agricultural co-operatives and economy trasformation in Cuba: Politics processes and estrategies]|La contribución de las cooperativas se ha puesto en evidencia desde la década del 70 como principal línea de desarrollo en la producción agropecuaria de Cuba. En contraste, el reconocimiento de las cooperativas urbanas ha sido tardío, aun cuando fuese percibida la necesidad de transformaciones basadas en la realización de la propiedad en diversos escenarios territoriales. El artículo analiza los procesos de reforma impulsados en Cuba desde la primera década de 2000 centrándose en las iniciativas tendientes a la promoción, constitución y desempeño de las cooperativas no agropecuarias (CNA). Se examina el potencial y limitaciones propias de las experiencias recientes para reflexionar sobre los procesos y transformaciones organizacionales desde la perspectiva de sus miembros. A modo de conclusión el análisis plantea interrogantes acerca de la aptitud de estas cooperativas para sustraerse del impacto de circunstancias anteriores y sobre su capacidad para consolidar estrategias diseñadas por los cooperadores que tiendan a fortalecer los principios de adhesión voluntaria y autonomía en que se fundan estas organizaciones.

Así, este trabajo analiza la influencia de la diversidad de género de los consejeros sobre la rentabilidad y el nivel de endeudamiento para una muestra de 5.199 cooperativas españolas. A diferencia de las sociedades capitalistas, estas organizaciones presentan una serie de peculiaridades en su gobierno, ya que los socios son a su vez principales, agentes y clientes. El estudio se centra en el contexto español, donde existe un debate abierto sobre la importancia de la gestión empresarial femenina impulsado, como en otros países, por la proliferación de legislación sobre la igualdad de género, siendo, además, España el país pionero en contar con una legislación específica sobre Economía Social. Los resultados muestran que las cooperativas con mayor representación femenina en su Consejo Rector presentan una mayor rentabilidad. Por otro lado, en aquellos consejos con un mayor porcentaje de mujeres muestran un menor nivel de endeudamiento.

J54|Equality Under Threat by the Talented: Evidence from Worker‐Managed Firms|Are high-ability individuals more likely to quit egalitarian regimes? Does the threat of exit by talented individuals restrict the redistributive capacity of democratic organizations? This paper revisits that long-standing debate by analyzing the interplay between compensation structure and quit behavior in the distinct yet underexplored institutional setting of workermanaged firms. The study exploits two novel administrative data sources: a panel of Uruguayan workers employed in both worker-managed and conventional firms; and a linked employer–employee panel data set covering the population of Uruguayan workermanaged firms and their workers from January 1997 to April 2010. A key advantage of the data is that it enables one to exploit within-firm variation on wages to construct an ordinal measure of the worker ability type. The paper's four main findings are that (1) workermanaged firms redistribute in favor of low-wage workers; (2) in worker-managed firms, high-ability members are more likely than other members to exit; (3) the hazard ratio of high-ability members is lower for founding members and for those employed by workermanaged firms in which there is less pay compression; and (4) high-ability members are less likely to quit when labor market conditions in the capitalist sector are less attractive. This paper contributes to the study of the interplay between equality and incentives that permeates many debates in public finance, comparative economic systems, personnel and organizational economics<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J54|Agri-food cooperative enterprises: From Ballestero to Bijman| Agri-food cooperative enterprises have developed significantly in the EU, and are expected to take on an even greater role in the European agri-food industry. Professor Ballestero’s theory and Decalogue for the agricultural cooperative enterprises are particularly relevant. We relate them to the well-known recent European Commission report on farming cooperatives in Europe, led by professor Bijman, and considered to be the largest study to date. Our analysis clearly shows the extent to which professor Ballestero’s theses are still completely valid today.
J54|Workers’ Participation In A Former Labour-Managed Economy: The Case Of Serbian Transition|It is well known that Serbia – along with the other Southeast European successor states of former Yugoslavia – emerged from a country recognized for its specific labour-managed institutional arrangement. The paper recalls the main premises of the literature on the labour-managed firm and the theoretical contributions on participatory forms of management that seem most relevant to a transition economy like Serbia’s. It proceeds to analyze the main changes that occurred in Serbia during transition to a market economy, illustrating some of its specific features and how privatization led to the conversion of workers self-management into property rights. In order to analyze the role of employees in decisionmaking, and more generally their current position in privatized and newly established private firms, a survey was undertaken in 2013 based on a questionnaire for managers in 69 Serbian firms. The survey suggests that internal relations in enterprises are relatively undeveloped, particularly regarding the distribution of responsibilities in decision making at various organisational levels, hampering the efficient fulfilment of firms’ objectives. It appears that decision-making processes are usually designed in such a way as to give an excessive role to the owner as the exclusive decision-maker. The position of workers seems to be particularly poor regarding their rights to be informed, to make proposals, and/or to participate in decision-making in general. Moreover, even traditional workers’ rights are neglected (unionization, collective bargaining etc.). The survey also suggests that in those firms with a more active role of workers, there is a higher degree of workers’ satisfaction and loyalty to the firm.
J54|The Challenges Of Contemporary Management|The purpose of this article is to present new challenges facing today's managers and the threats posed by contemporary management areas. This article shows that the broad field of science of management, is not a static, but dynamic, being under the influence of the situation prevailing on the markets, in the organization or the competence of managers. After presenting the essence of management, this paper presents the threats, currently occurring and require an appropriate response from management, as an area of study and managers.
J54|Le recrutement collégial. L'université comme partenariat à but non lucratif|Universities present some similarities with professional partnerships in law and accounting. Universities are close to being partnerships in a non-profit environment. In particular, the practice of co-option for the appointment of new teachers is similar to partnership rules according to which a new partner cannot be appointed without the consent of all the other partners. We compare co-option with other recruitment procedures such as delegation of recruitment to headhunters or the sale of academic positions at auction. Asymmetries of information, reputation, joint production of teaching and research and externalities in academic production, explain that co-option is the commonly adopted way of hiring new faculty. Still, the incentives to recruit the best candidate are weakened by free-riding, moral hazard, and the fact that academics do not invest their own wealth in the university. We explore some ways of realigning incentives to recruit good candidates in the framework of a collective co-option procedure in French universities. We end up by concluding that the key factor to improve the situation lies in the institution of the university president, who should be chosen to be more independent from the academic senate.

J54|Overcoming urban-rural imbalances: the role of cooperatives and social enterprises|The paper introduces a theoretical model to show how in a spatial framework characterized by urban-rural imbalances, the production of goods and services decreases moving from urban to rural areas. Specifically in rural and peripheral areas, the market and the public sector might supply an insufficient level of goods and services due to higher distance costs and lack of financial resources. Cooperatives and nonprofit organizations, i.e. social enterprises, are able to overcome distance costs and therefore spatial inequalities, by developing a productive and distributive function in marginalized areas, ensuring a fair and equal treatment among residents. Moreover, cooperatives and nonprofit organizations endorse the inclusiveness of the labor market, and raise peoples’ intrinsic motivation.
J54|Employer moral hazard and wage rigidity. The case of worker owned and investor owned firms|This paper studies wage and employment rigidity in a labor relationship in different organizational contexts. In investor owned firms, if the contract allows for flexible wages, the employer may have an incentive to opportunistically claim low demand and cut wages. Anticipating the employer's opportunism, workers may demand a fixed-wage contract, which may lead to inefficient layoffs in the presence of negative demand shocks. In contrast, in cooperatives, where the employer does respond to workers, the risk of employer's opportunism diminishes and results in an equilibrium characterized by more flexible wages and fewer layoffs. By developing these arguments we challenge the traditional explanation of workers’ preference for fixed wages based on risk aversion. To support our claim, we develop a principal agent model in which there is incomplete information on both sides of the employment relation. We model both the case of investor-owned firms and worker cooperatives.
J54|The labor supply of self-employed workers: The choice of working hours in worker co-ops|Workers in cooperatives are self-employed workers and, if they resemble employees in conventional workplaces, they care about the length of their working hours. In this paper, their choice of hours is characterized as a conventional labor supply decision and a familiar hours-wage relationship is derived. This is estimated using mill-year observations on the plywood co-ops in the Pacific Northwest. The results are compared with those from the work behavior of other self-employed workers and with working hours in capitalist plywood mills.
J54|Women Leaders and Social Performance: Evidence from Financial Cooperatives in Senegal|How do women leaders such as board members and top managers influence the social performance of organizations? This paper addresses the question by exploiting a unique database from a Senegalese network of 36 financial cooperatives. We scrutinize the loan-granting decisions, made jointly by the locally elected board and the top manager assigned by the central union of the network. Our findings are threefold. First, female-dominated boards favor social orientation. Second, female managers tend to align their strategy with local boards’ preferences. Third, the central union tends to assign male managers to female-dominated boards, probably to curb the boards’ social orientation.

L’esigenza di analisi e di approfondimento di tali istituti è emersa in occasione di alcuni incontri di formazione che si sono tenuti nel corso del 2015 con dirigenti, delegati e funzionari sindacali: si è trattato di un percorso di ricerca- azione costruito a partire da alcuni casi concreti, discussi e analizzati, che hanno consentito di toccare le problematiche che ogni giorno si presentano all’attenzione di chi ha il non facile compito di combattere il lavoro non pagato e le nuove dilaganti forme di competizione salariale ""al ribasso""."
J54|Shirking, Standards and the Probability of Detection|By relaxing the common efficiency wage assumption of exogenous shirking detection probabilities, we demonstrate how standards and efficiency wages are related. In a more general setting where the probability of detection depends upon the equilibrium effort level of non-shirkers, we show that the uniformly positive (negative) supply-side relationship between wages (unemployment insurance) and effort is no longer guaranteed. Profit maximization on the part of the firm, however, ensures that effort will depend positively (negatively) on wages (unemployment insurance) in equilibrium.
J54|Scale, Scope and Survival: A Comparison of Cooperative and Capitalist Modes of Production|This paper draws on a comprehensive data set from Portugal to investigate the activities, internal characteristics and survival prospects of cooperatives and capitalist enterprises. Consistent with theory, high levels of market concentration and low entry costs were shown to be conducive to cooperatives. Cooperatives were found to be, on average, older and to operate with a larger, more highly educated and more productive labour force than do their capitalist counterparts. Finally, we show that cooperatives have a markedly higher probability of survival than do capitalist enterprises due, in part, to differences in industry of operation and internal characteristics.

J54|Economic Democracy and Business Governance in Meadeâ€™s Works|The supposedly inefficient use of resources in producer cooperatives has been the object of eager debate among theorists for decades. This debate originated from the fact that Ward and Vanek, whose model had long been rated as a blueprint for the working of cooperatives, had reached the conclusion that their short-run behaviour was not Pareto-optimal. Their finding is highlighted by a downward sloping supply curve. The first solution suggested by Meade was differentiating the pay rates of workers assigned to the same jobs, in terms of fixing the incomes of new entrants at levels not exceeding the value generated by their work inputs. The Inegalitarian Cooperative does solve short-term problems, but fails to remove the odds faced by cooperatives when it comes to financing their investments and working capital. In later years, Meade proposes a new business form in order to deal with the last mentioned drawbacks. The business form concerned is the Discriminating Labour-Capital Partnership, whose microeconomic characteristics will be analysed in this paper. The issue discussed by Meade has great importance with regard to the current debate on social welfare because it provides a comprehensive reform of the fiscal and social policy by introducing, inter alia, a generalized and unconditional social dividend. The critical analysis of his works shows some weaknesses.
J54|Investment financing in cooperative firms|By general agreement, one of the main obstacles to the growth of producer cooperatives is difficult investment financing, due to inadequate Capitalisation levels and the resulting inability to lodge sufficient collateral with lenders. Moreover, worker-owned firms are considered not very reliable because they suffer from problems of moral hazard and insufficient commitment. Unfortunately, the literature on this issue is not extensive and has weaknesses that are highlighted in the paper. By means of its critical analysis, it is possible to provide evidence that the funding difficulties caused by the particular structure of cooperative firms can be effectively tackled by creating an institutional framework within which cooperatives would be offered a wider range of organizational options comparable to those open to traditional enterprises. Finally, it is proved that the willingness of the members to fund the operations of their cooperative with loan capital may not be enough to mobilize external credit. For member financings to persuade potential providers of funds to place trust in a firm, third-party claims must necessarily qualify as senior debt and be repaid before the claims of the partners are settled.
J54|Cooperative organizations as an engine of equitable rural economic development| Cooperatives represent an alternative to large-scale corporate farms and plantations as well as to independent unaffiliated small private farms. This paper presents a comparative modeling narrative on cooperative organizational formsâ€™ potential impact on equitable rural development. This speaks to issues of both increasing the size of the economic pie and how this income is distributed. The case is made the cooperatives can potentially generate higher rates of growth and more equitable growth, even in competitive economic environments. An important type of cooperative that is focused upon is one based on the linking of smaller farms into a cooperative. Economies economics of scale and scope as well in transaction costs can be captured by the cooperatives. Given cooperative governance, one would also expect higher levels of x-efficiency. Overall, cooperatives can generate relative high incomes to cooperative members, whilst remaining competitive with the traditional privately owned large farms. Critical to the success of the cooperative, is a set rules and regulation that place them on a level playing field with the privately owned farm. In addition, the implementation and practice of cooperative principles is key to the success of the cooperative farm and rural cooperatives, more generally speaking.
J54|The Governance’s Impact on the Decline of the Romanian Cooperative Sector|Taking into account the direction of the consumer cooperatives after 1989 and the decline registered as a consequence of a sum of factors – the decentralization of the control activity, the lack of interest of the local and central authorities in supporting the cooperative’s activity, the sideslips of our own legislation, which allowed the alienation of many cooperative’s patrimony etc – this paper sets out to analyze what was the governance’s impact on the de facto situation currently registered in that sector.

J54|Innovation and Performance of Enterprises: The Case of SMEs in Vietnam|Innovation is widely recognized as a key determinant of enterprise performance. It is, however, not clear how innovation affects performance of small-and-medium enterprises (SMEs) in transition economies. Based on data collected from surveys of SMEs in Vietnam from 2005 to 2011 this study shows that the human capital of owners/managers of SMEs, the quality of workers, and public physical infrastructure positively affect innovation and the performance of SMEs. More importantly, the study finds that innovation in products, production process, and marketing is a decisive factor for higher performance of SMEs in Vietnam.
J54|Unions and Collective Bargaining in the Wake of the Great Recession|"This paper provides the first definitive estimates of union density in Portugal, 2010-2012, using a unique dataset. The determinants of union density at firm level are first modeled. Next, we draw upon a very recent study of the union wage premium to provide summary estimates of the union wage gap for different ranges of union density. Since these estimates fully reflect the reality of an industrial relations system in which collective agreements are extended to nonunion workers and firms, the final issue examined is contract coverage. Although there has occurred a pronounced fall in the number of new extension agreements in recent years, this decline has been uncritically linked with a fall in coverage. We show that the number of workers covered by new and existing agreements has been largely unaffected by economic crisis. The reduced frequency of new agreements and extensions is viewed as an aspect of downward nominal wage rigidity in deflationary times (the counterpart of ""upward nominal wage rigidity"" in more normal times) rather than the immediate expression of a crisis in collective bargaining per se."
J54|Radical Routes and Alternative Avenues|In tumultuous times of financial crisis, capitalism is increasingly challenged as a desirable economic system. But are there any realistic alternatives to capitalism? Using theory and empirical research, this article offers one model of alternative business organization, focusing on not-for-profit cooperatives. If capitalismâ€™s distinctive features are private property, profit, and (intra-market) competition, cooperatives can, if designed intelligently, function without these features.
J54|Does a Democratic Management Model Enhance Performance through Market Orientation? Empirical Evidence from the Mondragon Industrial Group|A management model is a set of choices made by a firmâ€™s leadership regarding how objectives are defined, efforts are motivated, activities are coordinated and resources allocated, in short, regarding how the company will be run. Just as other types of businesses do, cooperatives need to create sustainable competitive advantages by adopting market-oriented management approaches. Mondragon Corporation achieves this in an alternative way relative to the conventional organizational and governance model, combining commitments to democratic principles, solidarity and competitiveness. Inspired by changes in the expectations of worker-members, new technological capabilities and the strategies of new competitors, Mondragon Corporation has designed a distinctive management model that can itself be a key driver of its competitiveness. The research presented here is focused on market orientation (MO), its relationships with a set of internal factors found in Mondragon cooperative enterprises, and their subsequent impact on business performance. Empirical results suggest that (1) Mondragonâ€™s management model increases organizational commitment, facilitating the adoption of MO and (2) a positive impact of MO on business performance. Practical and research implications are discussed.
J54|Editorial: The Cooperative Advantage for Community Development|Empirical evidence has shown that cooperatives are diverse organizations that efficaciously address a plurality of socio-economic needs. Cooperative organizations are effective in provisioning for myriad life needs, and do so in more democratic and sustainable ways than investor-owned firms. Rooted in the unique principles and values that distinguish them from other business types, cooperatives, in a nutshell, embody what has been called “the cooperative advantage”. This special issue of the Journal of Entrepreneurial and Organizational Diversity, “The Cooperative Advantage for Community Development”, was organized to highlight the myriad roles that cooperatives can and do have in protecting and developing communities, as well as the possible tensions and challenges that emerge in the process. Including seven articles from established and upcoming cooperative studies scholars, the special issue critically assesses diverse experiences of co-ops deployed for community development. Via papers engaged in case study approaches, political economy perspectives, critical historical research, and qualitative and quantitative methods, this special issue of JEOD critically reflects on and contributes to understanding the role of cooperatives in grounding bottom-up and locally based community development.
J54|Renewable Energy Cooperatives: A Review of Demonstrated Impacts and Limitations|Energy sectors of most industrialized countries are marked by a long history of state and corporate-owned and highly centralized energy generation (mostly from fossil-based sources) and distribution. Although technological developments and pressures from social/ecological movements resulted in an increased uptake of renewable energy (RE) technologies since the early 1990s, the application of these technologies have since predominantly taken place through largescale projects owned by corporate actors. In response, an increasing number of individuals and community groups have been forming renewable energy cooperatives (RE co-ops) in recent years to provide bottom-up and collective solutions to their local needs and global environmental issues. The goal of this literature review is to summarize the demonstrated impacts of RE co-ops in the economic, social and environmental realms. Thereby, their impact on community development and role in accelerating the transition towards a sustainable energy sector is assessed. Findings of this review show that successful RE co-ops generated positive outcomes for their members and the wider community while accelerating the social and perceptual dimensions of the global energy transition. However, it has also been revealed that RE co-ops’ success in generating positive impacts is often limited by various community-specific factors and by financial and perceptual barriers to their emergence and development.
J54|Argentina’s Worker-Recuperated Enterprises, 2010- 2013: A Synthesis of Recent Empirical Findings|Argentina’s empresas recuperadas por sus trabajadores (worker-recuperated enterprises, ERTs) are formerly investor- or privately-owned businesses in crisis ultimately taken over and re-opened by their employees, most commonly as worker cooperatives. Since 2002, the Programa Facultad Abierta (Open Faculty Program) of the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature at the University of Buenos Aires has carried out a series of national studies of Argentina’s ERTs. The aim of this article is to present the conclusions of the fourth survey of Argentina’s ERTs carried out by the Facultad Abierta. This survey focused on ERTs that emerged between March 2010 and December 2013, providing the most complete and up-to-date database of the characteristics of Argentina’s ERTs, and showing evidence of a wave of new worker-recuperated enterprises emerging in the postcrisis years, especially since 2010. The key findings presented in this article include: the political economic reasons for the emergence of ERTs; the characteristics of the growing ERT movement today as compared to earlier ERTs; the nature of the conflicts and issues leading to the creation of Argentina’s new ERTs; a critical analysis of new legal frameworks for ERT firms, comparing and contrasting them to older legal outlets for their formation; and the involvement of unions with Argentina’s ERTs.
J54|The Italian Road to Creating Worker Cooperatives from Worker Buyouts: Italy�s Worker-Recuperated Enterprises and the Legge Marcora Framework|This paper highlights the first phase of a research program, completed in late 2014 and early 2015 that homes in on worker-recuperated enterprises (imprese recuperate dai lavoratori) in Italy. The paper specifically focuses on Italy�s worker buyouts (WBOs) facilitated by its Legge Marcora (Marcora Law) framework�the form of worker-recuperated enterprises predominating in Italy. The paper first offers a definition of WBOs as a subset of workerrecuperate enterprises. It also reviews the most common scenarios from which WBOs emerge globally. It then overviews Italy�s Legge Marcora�s legal and financial framework, and situates the emergence of WBOs since the early 1980s as direct responses to market failure, business closures, rising unemployment, and, with the most recent WBOs, coinciding with the Great Recession and subsequent austerity measures that continue to negatively impact the country. The paper then discusses key findings from our research on WBO creation in Italy, touching on their most salient demographic and geographic particularities. Throughout the paper distinguishes Italy�s WBOs as exemplar because of their resilience in times of crisis, and the inclusion of multiple stakeholders in its WBO framework, namely: workers, the cooperative sector, and the state.
J54|Creación y destrucción comparada de cooperativas de trabajadores y empresas capitalistas en Uruguay|This paper revisits the question of why there are so few labor-managed firms in capitalist economies. We analyze the processes of creation (entries) and destruction (exits) of labor-managed firms, compare to capitalist firms. We focus on macroeconomic conditions changes that affect firms, favoring its creation or dissolution. And particularly if these changes affect labor-managed firms and capitalist firms differently. We use a panel data including the universe of worker cooperatives and a sample of 20% of Uruguayan capitalist firms, during the period 1996-2013. While part of the theoretical and empirical literature suggests that entries and exits of labor-managed firms follow a countercyclical pattern, we find evidence partially supporting this hypothesis. Furthermore our evidence suggests that creation and dissolution flows of this kind of firms are also driven by institutional factors.
J54|Workplace democracy in the lab| While intuition suggests that empowering workers to have some say in the control of the firm is likely to have beneficial effects, empirical evidence of such effects is hard to come by because of numerous confounding factors in the naturally occurring data. We report evidence from a real-effort experiment confirming that worker performance is sensitive to the process used to select the compensation contract. Groups of workers that voted to determine their compensation scheme provided significantly more effort than groups that had no say in how they would be compensated. This effect is robust to controls for the compensation scheme implemented, worker characteristics such as ability and gender, and possible sorting.
J54|Employee Stock Purchase Plans: Gift or Incentive? Evidence from a Multinational Corporation|Many large listed firms offer workers the opportunity to buy shares in the firm at discounted rates through employee stock purchase plans (ESPP). The discounted rate creates a gift exchange, where the firm hopes that workers who accept the gift reciprocate with greater loyalty and effort. But ESPPs diverge from standard gift exchange or efficiency wage models. Employees have to invest some of their own money by purchasing shares at the discounted rate to accept the gift. A sizeable number choose to reject the gift. In addition, the value of the ESPP gift varies with the share price and thus with the performance of the firm and the effort of workers in total. For workers who buy subsidized shares, an ESPP sets up a group incentive pay system analogous to profit sharing, all-employee stock options, or an employment ownership scheme that makes part of workers' compensation depend on company performance. Using data from the UK establishments of a multinational firm that places its ESPP at the heart of its employee compensation system, we compare the workplace behaviour of employees who join the ESPP with that of observationally equivalent workers who do not join the plan. We find that workers who purchase shares at subsidized prices work harder for longer hours and have lower quit and absence rates than workers who do not join the plan, but are no more involved in co-monitoring the performance of fellow employees than non-Plan members. We also find perceptions of peers' Plan participation influences workers' behaviour. ESPP joiners socialise more with colleagues outside work: this greater sense of social identity with colleagues, predicted under some gift exchange models, lowers their costs of work effort and may explain why they are more productive than those who do not join the ESPP. These findings highlight the distinct place of subsidized share purchase schemes in the spectrum of gift exchange and group incentive pay systems.
J54|Agricultural Cooperatives For Rural Development In Romania|The organic market has been increasing in the past couple of years and it is still expected to do so. However, even though the prices are higher on the organic market, farmers do not always manage to benefit from these better prices. Romania is a country with a high potential for organic agriculture as there are 14.8 million hectares of agricultural land out of which arable land represents 8.9 million ha. According to NIS (2012a p. 89), in 2011, 29.2% of the country’s population was employed in agriculture. However, most households in rural areas produce for mere survival due mainly to the highly fragmented land owning. Therefore there is an acute need for new development strategies in order to improve living standards in rural areas. This article describes business models of organic cooperatives in Nepal and Romania. Moreover it proposes a rural development initiative based on the creation of organic cooperatives and suggests thata NGOs could implement such a program.
J54|Female Managers in Hybrid Organizations: Evidence from Financial Cooperatives in Senegal|This paper brings new insights on gender interaction in the management of hybrid organizations. Our database comes from Union des Mutuelles du Partenariat pour la Mobilisation de l’Epargne et du Crédit au Sénégal (UM-PAMECAS), a Senegalese network made of 38 financial cooperatives providing 419,602 members with micro-loans. We use fixed-effect panel estimation to analyze the interplay of female/male-dominated boards with female/male managers. The regressions explain the average loan size and the proportion of loans granted to women. Our results show that male managers mitigate the social orientation of female-dominated boards. In contrast, female managers tend to enhance this orientation. More puzzling is the influence of female managers associated with male-dominated boards. In this case, the presence of a female manager increases the average loan size and reduces the proportion of loans granted to women. In sum, female managers tend to align their objectives on those of the local board even though their hierarchy is at the central level. They avoid as much as possible conflicts with their local board members.

J54|Industria-kooperatiba eredua ezbaian: Fagor etxetresnak kooperatibaren porrota| Fagor Etxetresnak euskal kooperatibaren gainbehera dugu aztergai. Munduko industria-kooperatibarik handienetako bat zen Fagor. Duela 50 urte baino gehiago fundatu zuten, eta funtsezkoa izan zen gerora Mondragon Korporazioa eratu zuten kooperatibak sortzeko. Azken hamarkadatan, Fagor tokiko kooperatiba biziki hazi zen nazioartean, eta etxetresnen merkatuko korporazio multinazional bilakatu zen. Merkatu kontzentratu eta gero eta globalagoan, 2007an, hamaika mila langile inguru zituen Fagorrek, sei herrialdetako hemezortzi fabrikatan banatuta. Geroago, ordea, kanpo- eta barne-faktoreen ondorioz, bere krisialdirik larrienari aurre egin behar izan zion, eta, azkenean, 2013an, Fagorrek porrot egin zuen. Kontuan izanik Fagor munduko kooperatiba nagusienetako bat zela, porrotak beste auzi orokor bat jarri du ezbaian:langile-kooperatiben ideragarritasuna. Horregatik, garrantzi handikoa da Fagorren gainbeheraren historia eta arrazoiak aztertzea.

Using this survey, we analyse workers’ attitudes towards financial participation with respect to their attitudes towards risk."
J54|Contracts, Job Security And Development Of The University|The research success of a university requires ecient recruiting. The talents of candidates are unobservable for administrators, and so they delegate hiring to the faculty who have better knowledge of the job market. Since professors dislike putting their own employment at risk, faculty, especially less productive, have an incentive to hire less productive candidates to insure against getting red themselves. I argue that both tenure and strict long-term administrative positions mitigate this problem, and allow one to hire better candidates.
J54|Networks And Organizational Analysis: Roles, Positions And Power Of Fragmentation Of Social And Commercial Relationships Redes Y Analisis Organizacional: Roles, Posiciones Y Poder De Fragmentacion De Las Relaciones Sociales Y Comerciales|"With the Cooperative Society of Agricultural Producers and Lombricultores of San Pedro TlapacoyÃ¡n, Veracruz, Mexico"", we observe a problem is the attitude and inter organizational relationships of the producers. Through indicators of social nets, we observe the position of actor inside the net of relationships and the relationships plays with more power of fragmentation in the net. The results indicate the importance of an actor is more in function of its position in the net that of the number of relationships that each member of the group of producers presents. We found that each actor plays different roles in the function of his individual interests and that social relationships present bigger power of fragmentation on commercial relationships."
J54|Employer Moral Hazard, Wage Rigidity, and Worker Cooperatives: A Theoretical Appraisal| We study the impact of employer's opportunism on wage rigidity in capitalist companies by arguing that the need to fix wages is crucially influenced by the asymmetric distribution of decision-making power and information in favor of the stronger contractual party — the employer, and against the weaker contractual party — employees. The capitalist entrepreneur can make decisions, whose negative consequences are borne by workers in terms of lower wages and more intense work pace. Excessive wage reductions in the face of negative exogenous shocks or too risky investment decisions represent the main instances of such opportunistic behavior. Fixed wages can represent workers' best response to the emerging risk of the employer moral hazard, but this implies a heightened risk of layoffs since wages and employment levels cannot be fixed at the same time. Besides discussing piece rate contracts, profit-sharing and codetermination as counterexamples, we observe worker cooperatives which depart from the presence of contrasting interests and private information in the principal-agent framework. Indeed, several empirical studies have shown greater employment stability and wage flexibility in worker cooperatives vis-à-vis the capitalist firm.
J54|Non-union worker representation, foreign owners, and the performance of establishments| Using German establishment data, this study provides the first econometric analysis on the interaction of establishment-level codetermination and foreign owners. Works councils are associated with higher productivity in domestic-owned establishments while they are associated with lower productivity in foreign-owned establishments. Our results conform to the notion that foreign ownership can involve strong tensions with the institutional patterns of the host country.

J54|Blockholding and organisational diversity: the case of a transition economy|We approached the issue of blockholding effectiveness and behaviour by studying some exemplary organisational transformations in the Republic of Srpska. We found two distinct clusters of blockholdings. The first cluster is worker-entrenched blockholdings, where most workers are unionised. The second cluster constitutes worker-liberal blockholdings, where most workers are not unionised. There are two distinct subgroups in this cluster. The vast majority of blockholdings in the first subgroup developed a prevailing role of the capital owner, heavyweight management and a less trained workforce. The second subgroup nurtures reciprocity of management and core workers’ cognitive assets, and is also the most productive.
J54|Zwischen Instrumentalisierung und Bedeutungslosigkeit. Mitarbeiter-Partizipation im organisationalen Kontext in Mittel- und Osteuropa|Im vorliegenden Band behandeln renommierte Autoren aus dem Bereich der Sozial- und Managementwissenschaften in deutsch- und englischsprachigen Beitraegen das Thema der Partizipation in Organisationen in gleichermassen konzeptueller wie empirischer Sicht. Waehrend sich die eher konzeptuell gehaltenen Beitraege dem Begriff und der Semantik der Partizipation sowie prominenten betrieblichen Partizipationspraktiken eher skeptisch naehern, widmen sich die staerker empirisch argumentierenden Beitraege der Vermessung und Beschreibung von Stand und Entwicklung der Institutionen und Praktiken der betrieblichen Partizipation in mittel- und osteuropaeischen Transformationslaendern. Waehrend im konzeptuellen Teil neben der betrieblichen Partizipation auch generelle gesellschaftliche Aspekte der Partizipation sowie der Bereich der Wissenschaft untersucht werden, fokussieren sich die empirischen Arbeiten auf die betriebliche Partizipation und ruecken dabei Transfer und Verbreitung verschiedener Partizipationsmodelle wie partizipative Fuehrung, Mitarbeitergesellschaften oder Arbeitnehmervertretungen ins Zentrum ihres Interesses. Und waehrend die konzeptuellen Beitraege tendenziell den Aspekt der Instrumentalisierung der Partizipation hervorheben, arbeiten die empirischen Beitraege eher ihre relative Bedeutungslosigkeit in den Laendern Mittel- und Osteuropas heraus. Der Band bietet auf diese Weise einem akademischen ebenso wie einem praktisch interessierten Publikum wichtige konzeptuelle und empirische Er-kenntnisse zur Rolle, zu Grenzen und Loesungsansaetzen von partizipativen Strukturen und Instrumenten im Kontext der Restrukturierung von Arbeit, Personal und Organisation im Transformationsprozess.
J54|Alienation and the Self-Managed Firm System|An analysis of Marxâ€™s alienation theory is the starting point for establishing if alienation would actually be cancelled in a system of self-managed firms. As Marx held that alienation comes at various degrees and is strongest in capitalistic systems with hired labor, the author argues that democratic firm management would doubtless reduce alienation in general, but not eliminate those forms that are specifically related to the division of labor, to scarcity, and the resulting need to work for oneâ€™s daily bread. The author closes his paper with a criticism of Bigoâ€™s approach to alienation in centrally planned economic systems and an analysis of capitalism as an inversed world.
J54|The Key Contradiction in Capitalist System|Which is the fundamental contradiction of capitalism: the capital-labor polarity or the contrast between socialized production and private appropriation? Those looking on the capital-labor polarity as the main contradiction will argue that socialism arises when the passage from a system controlled by capital owners to a system of worker-run firms sparks off the reversal of the usual capital-labor relation. Conversely, those who think that the key contradiction of capitalism is the contrast between socialized production and private appropriation will contend that the social order to rise from the ashes of capitalism is a centrally planned system. This paper reports arguments in support of the former option.
J54|Employee financial participation in businesses: Is it worth discussing?|This paper is an overview of the achievements in the area of employee financial participation (EFP) during the last fifty years. It addresses the question of the extent to which EFP is relevant in today’s world. EFP is distinguished from participation in management (industrial democracy), and the various types of EP are discussed. The major arguments for EFP are presented and discussed critically. The evolution of major forms of EFP, the scale of their operation in several advanced economies, and the legal and tax incentives for EFP are described. The efforts of European Union bodies to popularise this idea in all member countries are illustrated. Showing that EFP has become a broadly recognised principle of modern management in thousands of enterprises, we consider opportunities for disseminating these solutions on a wider scale, in particular in Poland. Finally, a number of directions for further research on financial participation are considered.
J54|The Economic Impacts of Self-Employment| Even as self-employment continues to increase, policymakers remain largely unaware of this trend and fail to see it as an opportunity for addressing enduring joblessness. In part, this is explained by limited data on the self-employed and by widespread perceptions that returns to self-employment are low; that the self-employed are merely patching together piecemeal work opportunities requiring limited skills; and that there are no local economic impacts or spillover benefits into other sectors. Contrary to these perceptions, recent studies suggest that self-employment has tangible positive economic impacts not only on wage and salary employment but also on per capita income growth and poverty reduction. This article synthesizes the pertinent emerging literature and assesses dynamics of the lags involved between self-employment shocks and subsequent employment growth.

J54|German Universities as State-sponsored Co-operatives|Most universities in Germany are public firms but they have many properties of co-operatives. The most important thereof are described and analysed together with the characteristics of state-sponsorship. The real companions of the university as a co-operation are its professors. The same is true for the faculty level, perhaps even more so. However, especially the students are also organised in a co-operative form as are the representatives of all membership groups together. The state is making some crucial reforms that transform this university model or may even destroy it. In any case, the change is slow, painful and open-ended.
