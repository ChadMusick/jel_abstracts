F60|Putting Global Governance in its Place|In a world economy that is highly integrated, most policies produce effects across the border. This is often believed to be an argument for greater global governance, but the logic requires scrutiny. There remains strong revealed demand for policy and institutional diversity among nations, rooted in differences in historical, cultural, or development trajectories. The canonical case for global governance is based on two set of circumstances. The first occurs when there is global public good (GPG) and the second under “beggar-thy-neighbor” (BTN) policies. However, the world economy is not a global commons, and virtually no economic policy has the nature of a global public good (or bad). And while there are some important BTN policies, much of our current discussions deal with policies that are not true BTNs. The policy failures that exist arise not from weaknesses of global governance, but from distortions of domestic governance. As a general rule, these domestic failures cannot be fixed through international agreements or multilateral cooperation. The paper closes by discussing an alternative model of global governance called “democracy-enhancing global governance.”

F60|Alignment of Multinational Firms along Global Value Chains: A Network-based Perspective|The multiple location choices of firms respond to a complex design of simultaneous and related goals. This paper reveals how the geographic coverage of French multinational firms is increasingly determined by Global Value Chains (GVCs) since the mid-1990s. I study the network structure of French multinationals using firm-level data, and of the Global Value Chains using the bilateral value added (VA) content of exports (from international Input-Output tables). The comparison of the two networks reveals an alignment of firms' plants along global value chains, supported by several econometric estimations including a multiple regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure and a panel OLS defined at the country-pair level. Multinationals have modified their foreign affiliates' locations to settle in countries engaged in sequential production, and this result holds when controlling for gravity-like location's determinants and raw international trade flows. Specifically, I report how MNEs are moving up the value chain, as their new locations turned to be more driven by an upstream alignment on GVCs (toward the VA source) rather than a downstream one (toward VA destination). Eventually, the GVCs' attraction increased after the 2008 crisis, even though GVCs were experiencing a slowdown. Therefore, firm's vulnerability to the dismantling of GVCs similarly increased.
F60|Country of Origin as a Constraint to Internationalization|Objective - Globalization has enabled the increase of competitiveness and opportunities for companies to sell their goods to worldwide consumers. Due to the wider range of products offered and increasing similarity of those products, the country of origin becomes an important variable when studying the evaluation process of foreign products. The origin of a product acts as a mark of quality, which ultimately influences the purchase intentions of consumers. When negative, this may act as a constraint on internationalization, making it difficult to accept a product from a certain origin. There is, therefore, a gap in how companies can mitigate and overcome a negative country of origin effect (COE). This study seeks to fill this gap and suggest strategies to overcome this issue. Methodology/Technique - The methodology applied in this study is the Grounded Theory. The data was collected from interviews with Portuguese entities, so different cases can be compared and discussed. Although Portugal's image has changed over time, there remains a stigma associated with it. The most recent financial and political crisis has damaged the perception of Portugal in the international sphere, hence, it has been selected for the formation of a negative COE. Findings and Novelty - Some firms currently have existing strategies to resist the negative effect of country of origin, such as improvement of brand awareness, credibility and international visibility. To achieve that, companies must adopt a wide set of strategies which involve both defensive and offensive approaches.
F60|The Politicization of Transatlantic Trade in Europe: Explaining Inconsistent Preferences Regarding Free Trade and the TTIP|The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) generated an unprecedented contestation across Europe. In this paper, we focus on the sources of such backlash and analyze opinions on free trade and the specific agreement. Not accounting for the fact that these preferences are correlated could lead to biased conclusions about their determinants. To remediate this, we construct a set of bivariate probit models and calculate joint probabilities for the different types of preference configurations. We validate that support for free trade and support for the TTIP have similar, but not identical foundations. Inconsistent preferences are rooted in individual values, EU attitudes, and political cues, as well as treaty partner heuristics. Our innovative empirical approach offers an improved understanding of trade attitudes within EU's multilevel context.
F60|On Trade and the Stability of (Armed) Peace|"We consider an environment in which two sovereign states with overlapping ownership claims on a resource/asset first arm and then choose whether to resolve their dispute violently through war or peacefully through settlement. Both approaches depend on the states' military capacities, but have very different outcomes. War precludes trade between the two states and can be destructive; however, once a winner is declared, arming is unnecessary in future periods. By contrast, a peaceful resolution under the threat of war today avoids destruction and supports mutually advantageous trade; yet, settlements must be renegotiated and the states must arm in future periods to resolve their ongoing dispute. Paying special attention to the importance of trade on arming incentives and payoffs in this context, we explore the conditions under which ""armed peace"" arises as the perfectly coalition-proof equilibrium over time. Our analysis reveals that, depending on the destructiveness of war, time preferences, and the distribution of initial resource endowments, greater gains from trade (jointly determined by trade costs and the substitutability of traded commodities) can reduce arming and pacify international tensions. Even when the gains from trade are relatively small, peace might be sustainable, but only for more uneven distributions of initial resources."
F60|GVC journeys: Industrialisation and deindustrialisation in the age of the second unbundling|Offshoring and participation in global value chains (GVCs) are critical to understanding the rapid deindustrialisation of G7 nations and the rapid industrialisation of a handful of developing nations. This paper distinguishes between trade in final goods and trade in parts to track the shifting pattern of the location of manufacturing. We introduce a simple empirical measure of comparative advantage in parts on one hand and in final goods on the other. We illustrate how this distinction can help organise thinking on the patterns of industrialisation and deindustrialisation—namely the ‘GVC journeys’ of advanced and emerging economies. We also provide one simple model. The model highlights the interactions of trade costs and the knowledge transfers to accompany offshoring of parts production and assembly, which we call trade-led versus knowledge-led globalisation.

F60|Vantagens Comparativas Reveladas e suas Determinantes: Uma Aplicação à Economia Portuguesa|Na era do “Made in the World” o valor bruto das exportações que atravessa a fronteira nacional é uma medida cada vez mais imperfeita do rendimento doméstico envolvido, comprometendo, por isso, a leitura de todos os indicadores de comércio externo derivados. A literatura económica tem feito grandes progressos para desenvolver um quadro de referência metodológico que isole devidamente o papel de cada país no contexto das Cadeias de Valor Globais (CVGs) e são já vários os projetos que, capitalizando estes contributos teóricos, procederam à construção de bases de dados multi-país a partir de matrizes input-output globais harmonizadas que identificam os recursos e empregos da produção na economia, com desagregação por setores de bens e serviços e países parceiros. Este trabalho utiliza a informação de comércio internacional em valor acrescentado, recentemente compilada pela OCDE-OMC, para (i) analisar a dinâmica da especialização produtiva portuguesa, no contexto das CVGs, com base no tradicional Índice de Vantagens Comparativas Reveladas (IVCR) de Balassa, considerando para efeitos de cálculo três tipos de fluxos no período 1995-2011 e (ii) discutir a validade da teoria clássica e neoclássica das vantagens comparativas no contexto das CVGs. Os dados confirmam que a utilização das estatísticas em valor acrescentado nacional é de facto muito relevante do ponto de vista da avaliação das capacidades com que Portugal se apresenta nas Cadeias de Valor Globais e sugerem que a estrutura setorial das vantagens comparativas reveladas para Portugal, no contexto das CVGs, obedece à teoria clássica e neoclássica do comércio internacional.
F60|A Look at the main channels of Potential Impact of Brexit on the Portuguese Economy|On June, 2016 the UK decided to leave the EU. The departure date was originally scheduled for March 29, 2019 but the process reached an impasse as the withdrawal agreement, that was negotiated with the European Union, failed to get parliamentary approval. The EU agreed to offer the UK a flexible extension of the Brexit deadline until October 31, but the risk of a no-deal scenario still exists. Since there is no precedent of a Member State withdrawing from the European Union, the implications of Brexit for the EU countries are still highly uncertain. However, countries and industries that have deep economic ties, in terms of international integration, to the UK are the most vulnerable to this departure. In this work we will use trade in value added statistics from OECD-WTO TiVA database and related indicators to depict how exposed and thus vulnerable is Portugal and its sectors to the UK market, delivering a useful contribute for assessing potential impacts of Brexit on the Portuguese Economy.
F60|How internationalization and competitiveness contribute to get public support to innovation? The Portuguese case|A wide range of empirical studies have analyzed which firm characteristics influence government evaluators on the decision to select specific firms for participating in Research and Development and Innovation subsidy programs. However, few authors have provided a precise analysis about the selection process of submitted applications for a public support. The aim of the present paper is to assess the effectiveness in the selection process and to understand which kind of projects are selected for being subsidized. The analysis is focused on the case study of applications submitted to the Portuguese Innovation Incentive System (SI Innovation) between 2007 and 2013. Once the selection criterion for accessing to this program is essentially based on competitiveness, namely in terms of internationalization and productivity, special attention was given on assessing the determinants of selection process regarding to these topics. Using a counterfactual analysis and Propensity Score Matching estimators, results show that the selection process to SI Innovation is more focused on expecting an increase of the internationalization and productivity of firms than in the efficiency of public expenditures and firm innovativeness. The conclusions of this paper could be useful for policy makers, once it identifies some failures in selection process, which according to other authors, could explain some disappointing results of public intervention in this field.
F60|A survey of the long-term impact of Brexit on the UK and the EU27 economies|This paper reviews a sample of studies on the long-term impact of Brexit on GDP and welfare for both the UK and EU economies. It considers only official and academic studies published before the end of November 2018. The paper highlights the very wide range of results, especially for the UK, reflecting great uncertainty. The negative economic impact is more limited for the EU27 and for most Member States. Small open economies closely related to the UK are more hit than others. This is the case for Ireland due to geographical proximity, for Luxembourg with its economy specialising in financial services and for Cyprus and Malta as they are Commonwealth countries. When only the trade channel of Brexit is estimated, GDP (or welfare) losses are around 1 percentage point of GDP in the Netherlands and in Belgium while these average 0.6 percentage point of GDP in the EU27. For a same Brexit scenario, the results depend on the model specifications, on the channels considered and on some key assumptions. For the UK higher GDP/welfare losses are found for reduced-form approaches, when a productivity shock is added and, also for the EU, for global value chain approaches. Higher GDP/welfare losses are also associated with higher non-tariff trade barriers. Results are sensitive to some parameters such as the reaction of trade volumes to changes in tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers (trade elasticities). Reaching a Free Trade Agreement could limit the GDP/welfare losses both for the UK and the EU Member States compared to an orderly no deal (WTO scenario). If the UK remains in the Single Market or the Customs Union, the GDP/welfare losses induced by Brexit could be even more contained. This justifies the economic interest for both the UK and the EU Member States to reach an agreement on their future relationship.

F60|Dynamic Changes and Effects of Agro-Food GVCS|Global value chains (GVCs) in agriculture and food sectors are becoming an important part of the agro-food trading landscape, influencing both the nature of the gains from trade and the impacts of trade policies. This study explores the changes in trade in value added that are occurring within agro-food GVCs and the implications that participation in agro-food GVCs has had on the agro-food sectors. It makes use of a database on trade in value added for 22 agro-food sectors derived from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database. The study finds that between 2004 and 2014, agro-food sectors have been increasing their participation in GVCs and that the links created within these production networks have become more “global” in nature. At the same time, agro-food GVCs have become increasingly centred around hubs in the People’s Republic of China and Germany where large amounts of value added are funnelled before reaching the end consumer. The study also finds that participation in agro-food GVCs is beneficial for sector development and growth – both in aggregate terms and in terms of domestic value added from exports. Of key importance has been the use of foreign value added and access to a wide diversity of imported inputs. However, policies that restrict trade and limit market openness reduce participation and sector growth and development – including policies that create barriers to trade in agro-food products themselves. In addition, the study finds that the use of services value added in exports is an important factor that contributes to sector growth, which highlights the importance of the broader policy environment to enhance the benefits from agro-food GVCs.
F60|Value Adding Pathways in Agriculture and Food Trade: The Role of GVCs and Services|Global value chains (GVCs) in agriculture and food sectors have the potential to influence trading relationships and the gains from trade for different sectors along the value chain. This report explores the way in which value from trade and GVC participation is created for the agriculture sector. It examines differences in returns to the sector from participation in GVCs and trade either directly in contrast to participation that relies on downstream domestic processing. The study makes use of a database on trade in value added for 22 agro-food sectors derived from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database. The evidence presented in this paper suggests that aggregate value to the agriculture and to the economy overall from direct participation in trade and GVCs generates at least as much value as participation that relies on domestic downstream processing. Similar overall gains from primary exports are associated with greater volumes and the value created from ‘value addition’ to these exports – the embodied service and other inputs. Indeed, countries that specialise in primary exports have higher shares of service value added in these exports, with this also being a determinant of value growth for middle-income countries.
F60|Employment in Agriculture and Food Trade: Assessing the Role of GVCs|Agricultural sectors are increasingly integrated into international markets as global value chains (GVCs) expand. This integration is helping to drive value added growth in the sector, including the returns that flow to labour. This report explores the impact that trade and agro-food GVC participation has on labour returns and thereby employment not only within the agricultural sectors, but across other sectors of the economy. At the global level, trade and agro-food GVCs generated an average of between 20-26% of total agricultural workforce returns between 2004 and 2014, and labour returns were generated from both direct participation in trade and from indirect participation through other downstream sectors. This report finds that the impact on economy-wide labour returns is on average greater for countries specialising in direct exports of primary products as compared to those specialising in indirect agricultural exports. Evidence also shows that agricultural subsidies have a negative impact both on labour returns from primary sector exports and the returns generated indirectly from processing-sector exports.
F60|Influencing GVCs through Agro-Food Policy and Reform|Global value chains (GVCs) in agriculture and food sectors contribute to sector growth and development. However, agricultural trade is subject to significant distortions that limit trade which in turn impacts on its competitiveness world-wide. Using the OECD Metro model, this study analyses the impact of trade and domestic support policies on participation in agro-food GVCs and the benefits that flow from them. The results show that current market access barriers and distorting forms of domestic support have a negative effect not only on welfare, but also on the possible benefits from participation in agro-food GVCs. If barriers, i.e. tariffs and quotas, were removed this would offer the potential to increase welfare, increase exports of agro-food domestic value added from all countries, and promote trade by furthering GVC links through value added. This study also shows that regional trade agreements have the potential to deepen GVC linkages amongst members.
F60|The Evolution of the Treatment of Agriculture in Preferential Trade Agreements|Preferential trading agreements are becoming a more common feature of the global agro food trading environment, a trend that has increased since the early 2000s. While they increasingly cover the majority of trade worldwide, there remains a question as to the extent to which their treatment of agriculture has changed over time, and whether the liberalising elements contained in these agreements are increasingly addressing distortions in world agro-food markets. This paper presents findings on the evolution of the treatment of agriculture within preferential trade agreements. Changes in various aspects of liberalisation achieved through these agreements have been explored, such as provisions related to market access, export competition and domestic support. The report finds that agriculture appears to be increasingly treated in a similar manner to other goods trade, with expansion in the scope of agreements extending to agriculture. Agreements are delivering reduced tariffs among members across the majority of agricultural commodities – however, heterogeneity of rules of origin between agreements is likely to be undermining these benefits. Reflecting multilateral rules, provisions related to Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures and Technical Barriers to Trade have become a standard feature of agreements. Overall, preferential trade agreements are strongly influenced by the multilateral framework.
F60|Extraction-cum-substitution: A KISS approach to mapping the impacts of bilateral trade conflicts|This paper presents a simple yet powerful methodological tool for analysing the impact of a bilateral trade conflict on third countries when trade includes intermediate inputs. Mixing input-output modelling with recent development of trade in value-added analysis, the extraction-cum-substitution approach maps and measures the sectoral and global interactions in global value chains.It can also be used to generate “in silico” a large data set of numerical “observations” that can be further analysed using appropriate exploratory statistical techniques. The paper counts with three parts, besides introduction and conclusion. The first one is theoretical, starting with a formal model of inter-industry trade before describing the empirical application to input-output analysis. The second part is didactic, illustrating the method on a small six-countries/three-industries model.The third part applies the methodology to the bilateral trade conflict that arose between China and the USA in 2018. This section shows also how the method can also be used for generating analytical data and identify modes of insertion in the global economy. The program, written in open-source R language, is shown in annex.
F60|Financial development and economic growth in the era of financial liberalization|Financial Institutions play crucial intermediary roles in achieving a nation’s economic growth which is achieved by the way financial intermediaries consolidate funds and channel them between the surplus and deficit sectors of an economy (Nwaeze Chinweoke 2014). The strengthening of these financial institutions goes a long way in ensuring macroeconomic stability and sustainable economic growth. Financial development ensures that financial institutions improves information communication in terms of possible investment opportunities and capital allocation, firm monitoring, exertion of corporate governance, savings pool mobilization as a means of payment.
F60|Globalization, robotization and electoral outcomes: Evidence from spatial regressions for Italy|Criticism of economic globalization and technological progress has gained support in Italy in the last two decades but, due to the diâ†µerentiated exposure of local communities to this process, political outcomes have varied considerably across the country. By observing the local impact of three global economic phenomena (flows of migrants, foreign competition in international trade, and diâ†µusion of robots) alongside with the patterns of local electoral outcomes potentially associated with discontent, this work analyses from a spatial perspective the economic forces driving the evolution of general elections in 2001, 2008 and 2013 in Italy. The analysis reveals that all these global factors had an impact on political outcomes associated with discontent, albeit in different ways and changing over time. These novel em- pirical results indicate that these global drivers interacted with elements pertaining to the political supply, such as party federation and scandals. By combining various methodological advances coming from the political geography and the political economy literature, this work attempts to bridge disciplines sharing similar interests but adopting diâ†µerent tools of analysis.
F60|Chinese competition and network effects on the extensive margin|I construct a network of input-output linkages in Chilean manufacturing and show that a negative demand shock has an impact on the number of firms producing in sectors that supply the sectors affected by the shock. Approximately one-third of the effect of increased Chinese competition on the extensive margin can be attributed to these network effects. The observed effect is a combination of multiproduct firms dropping varieties and firms leaving the market. I also study whether there is evidence of 'cascading failures' that could amplify the impact of idiosyncratic shocks. I find no evidence of these 'cascading effects'.
F60|A Review of Rent-seekers, Profits, Wages and Inequality, The Top 20%, 2019 by Peter Mihalyi and Ivan Szelenyi|The authors, Péter Mihályi and Iván Szelényi, set themselves the ambitious task of formulating an alternative discourse about inequality in which the extent of inequality per se is not the problem but rather where inequalities stem from? Herein lies their fundamental divergence with Piketty (2014) for whom the excessive growth of “profits” is assumed to be the source of inequalities. The problem with mainstream economics and Piketty is that “profit” and “rent” are lumped together. A critical distinction between the two is warranted to grasp the relationship between inequalities, innovation and economic growth. In line with Kornai’s criticism of Piketty (2016), the authors insist on the source of inequality. Are they engendered by wages and profits earned on competitive markets or are they originated from rents due to imposed restrictions on market competition? In contrast with Piketty, the general assumption of the authors is that higher profits and wages often add to the annual growth or national income. Rents on the other hand lower annual growth. Although some forms of rent may even be useful, excessive rents breeds economic stagnation.
F60|FDI Patterns and Global Value Chains in the Digital Economy|The modern process of digitalization of the world economy entails global flows of investment in technology-based industries and knowledge activities located upstream of value chains. This work exploits the wealth of information offered by the fDi Markets database to provide an overview about the geographical patterns of FDIs and of specialization in digital industries and in technological activities.We showremarkable differences across both advanced and emerging economies in this respect. Europe is both a big attractor and a big investor in digital related business, but relies on emerging economies more to offshore production than to set up R&D labs in these countries. By contrast, North American economies are more prone to engage in knowledge intensive FDIs towards the most dynamic emerging countries than is the case of Europe.Emerging economies also play a large variety of rolesinglobal flows of investment in digital industries.However, with the relevant exceptions of China, India and the Four Asian Tigers, inward and outward FDIsof Emerging economies are predominantlyproduction-oriented, with a lower involvement in R&D, Design and ICT activities. Hence, the observed patterns of FDIs appear to consolidate existing hierarchies in digital related global production networks, creating limited upgrading opportunities in the case of most emerging economies.
F60|Where Did Good Jobs Go? Acemoglu and Marx on Induced (Skill Replacing) Technical Change|The paper lays out a hypothesis about the effect global oversupply of labor had on induced technological change, clarifying how it might have contributed to the demand reversal for high skill workers and other recent observed trends in technological change in the US. The argument considers the effect of market friendly political/institutional transformations of the 1980s on technology as they created a potential for an integrated global labor market. The innovations induced by the promise of this potential eventually culminated in the creation of global value chains and production networks. These required large set up costs and skill enhancing innovations, but once in place they reduced the dependence of expanding low skill employment around the globe on skill intensive inputs from advanced countries, giving rise to the wellobserved high skill demand reversal and sputtering of IT investment.
F60|Testing the Smile Curve: Functional Specialisation in GVCs and Value Creation|According to the ‘smile curve hypothesis’ the potential for generating value added varies significantly across the various functions along a firm’s value chain. It suggests in particular that the production stage is the least promising value chain function in the entire manufacturing process. This logic implies that countries specialising as ‘factory economies’ are likely to generate comparatively little value added. To shed light on the relationship between functional specialisation along the value chain and value creation, this paper develops measures for functional specialisation derived from project-level data on greenfield FDI for a global sample of countries. These measures keep the industry and the functional dimension of specialisation strictly apart. They are used to test econometrically the negative relationship between value added creation and functional specialisation in production as predicted by the smile curve hypothesis.
F60|Online Platform Operators as Sovereigns over the Ecommerce Sellers Selected by the German Legislator|The German law to combat VAT fraud and other tax regulations went into force recently. The German legislator aims to enforce German VAT law via a liability of platform operators (like Amazon and eBay). The consequences of this regulatory approach are a) that platform operators enforce the law more strictly in relation to the ecommerce sellers than required by the law, b) that legal uncertainty occurs and c) that the legal protection of ecommerce sellers is not clear. Background of the more strict enforcement is that platform operators want to avoid liability risks. The situation from the ecommerce sellers’ perspective is described and discussed.
F60|The European economic crisis from 2007 onwards in the context of a global crisis of over-production of capital - a Marxian monetary theory of value interpretation|This paper attempts to clarify how the European economic crisis from 2007 onwards can be understood from the perspective of a Marxian monetary theory of value that emphasizes in-trinsic, structural flaws regarding capitalist reproduction. Chapter two provides an empirical description of the European economic crisis, which to some extent already reflects the struc-tural theoretical framework presented in chapter three. Regarding the theoretical framework Michael Heinrich's interpretation of 'the' Marxian monetary theory of value will be presented. Heinrich identifies connections between production and realization, between profit and inter-est rate as well as between industrial and fictitious capital, which represent contradictory tendencies for which capitalism does not have simple balancing processes. In the context of a discussion of 'structural logical aspects' of Marx's Critique of the Political Economy, explana-tory deficits of Heinrich's approach are analyzed. In the following, it is argued that Fred Mose-ley's view of these 'structural logical aspects' allows empirical 'applications' of Marxian mon-etary theories of value. It is concluded that a Marxian monetary theory of value, with the characteristics of expansive capital accumulation and its limitations, facilitates a structural analysis of the European economic crisis from 2007 onwards. In this line of argument, expan-sive production patterns are expressed, among other things, in global restructuring processes, while consumption limitations are mitigated by expansive financial markets and shifts in ex-port destinations.
F60|Understanding protectionism: Empirical analysis of protectionist attitudes in the EU|A changing landscape in trade policy in recent years is undoubtedly related to changing voter preferences. Based on Eurobarometer survey data, the present paper investigates both the factors determining the level of support for protectionism and the striking inconsistency of responses to questions related to free trade and protectionism. EU citizens are more likely to support protectionism when the economy runs smoothly and rejects protectionism if the national economy is not in the best shape. Unemployment, bad economic situations as well as negative feelings regarding immigration are identified as possible reasons to call for protectionism while respondents are favouring free trade at the same time. The inconsistent attitudes toward free trade and protectionism are a matter of lacking knowledge of political issues. Better educated EU citizens are all less likely to support free trade and protectionism at the same time. This applies to respondents who show a higher level of knowledge regarding basic EU-related facts as well as to those who discuss political matters with friends more often. A possible way to tackle this problem is a broad information strategy covering the topics of international econom-ics across several media channels. Especially radio, press and internet are identified as media which seem to contribute to a better understanding of these complex issues.
F60|The effects of external shocks on Azerbaijan economy|This paper examines the effects of external shocks on the economy of oil rich Azerbaijan. Using oil price and macroeconomic indicators of three major trade partners of Azerbaijan – EU, Russia, and Turkey - as the external shock variables, we analyze the effects of those shocks on the domestic macroeconomic variables of Azerbaijan during the period from 2000Q1 to 2017Q4, in the SVAR framework with block exogeneity restriction. The results show that the overall importance of the four groups of shocks, in descending terms, is in the following order: oil shock, EU origin shocks, Russia origin shocks, and Turkey origin shocks. The major findings of the paper are: a) among considered foreign shocks oil price shock is the most important foreign shock for the economy of Azerbaijan; b) in general EU origin shocks has larger impact on considered domestic variables compared to other trade partners origin shocks; c) Turkey origin shocks have almost no impact in any of the considered domestic variables of Azerbaijan, d) among considered external shocks oil price is the main determinant of the non-oil sector of economy, and e) among considered external shocks GDP growth of the trade partners is the main determinant of the inflation in Azerbaijan.
F60|Responding to the First Era of Globalization: Canadian Trade Policy, 1870–1913|In this paper we document Canada’s trade policy response to late-nineteenth- and earlytwentieth-century globalization. We link newly digitized annual product-specific data on the value of Canadian imports and duties paid from 1870–1913 to establishment-specific production and location information drawn from the manuscripts of the 1871 industrial census. Our findings reveal a highly selective move towards protectionism following the adoption of the National Policy in 1879. Changes in the Canadian tariff schedule narrowly targeted final consumption goods that had close substitutes produced by relatively large, politically influential domestic manufacturers.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F60|Multinational Profit Shifting and Measures throughout Economic Accounts|Profit shifting to low-tax countries imposes challenges for the treatment of multinational enterprises in economic accounts. Using adjustments for profit shifting calculated in Guvenen et al. (2017) under an alternative measurement methodology, this paper empirically demonstrates how the effects of profit shifting cascade throughout a fully articulated set of economic accounts for the United States in 2014. We find a 1.5 percent and 3.5 percent increase in measured U.S. gross domestic product and operating surplus, respectively, and a 33.5 percent decrease in measured income receivable from the rest of world. As a result of offsetting effects, measured U.S. gross national saving decreases by 0.8 percent, and national borrowing increases by 6.9 percent. There are also potentially significant implications for analytic uses of the measures, including decreases for the labor share of income and the return on U.S. direct investment abroad and increases for the trade in services balance and the return on domestic non-financial business.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F60|Cross-border spillovers of monetary policy: What changes during a financial crisis?|This paper analyses cross-border spillovers of monetary policy by examining two countries that were in the eye of the storm during the euro area sovereign debt crisis, namely Ireland and Portugal. The research provides insight as to how banking and sovereign stress affect the inward transmission of foreign monetary policy to two economies that share many characteristics, but that also have many distinct features. In particular, our research addresses the question of whether a banking system in distress reacts more or less to monetary policy changes in other major economies. The empirical analysis indicates that international spillovers are present for US and UK monetary policy for both Ireland and Portugal, but there is heterogeneity in the transmission mechanisms by which they affect credit growth in the two economies.
F60|Innovation and Trade Policy in a Globalized World|How do import tariffs and R&D subsidies help domestic firms compete globally? How do these policies affect aggregate growth and economic welfare? To answer these questions, the paper builds a dynamic general equilibrium growth model where firm innovation endogenously determines the dynamics of technology, and, therefore, market leadership and trade flows, in a world with two large open economies at different stages of development. Firmsâ€™ R&D decisions are driven by (i) the defensive innovation motive, (ii) the expansionary innovation motive, and (iii) technology spillovers. The theoretical investigation illustrates that, statically, globalization (defined as reduced trade barriers) has ambiguous effects on welfare, while, dynamically, intensified globalization boosts domestic innovation through induced international competition.
F60|Globalisation and Income Inequality Revisited|We re-examine the globalisation-income inequality nexus. Globalisation is measured by the KOF globalisation index and sub-indicators for trade, financial, political and social global globalisation. Income inequality is measured by Solt’s pre tax/transfer and the post tax/transfer Gini indices. We use data for 140 countries over the period 1970-2014 and deal with the endogeneity of globalisation measures. Our instrumental variable is predicted openness based on a time-varying gravity model. OLS results show that globalisation and income inequality are positively correlated within the full sample of countries and the sample of emerging and developing countries. The positive relationship is mainly driven by export openness, FDIs and social globalisation. The 2SLS results do not show that overall globalisation or any sub-indicator influences income inequality. The effect, however, is positive within the sample of higher developed countries and driven by transition countries from Eastern Europe and China. Within the sample of the most advanced economies, neither OLS nor 2SLS results show any significant positive relationship between globalisation and inequality.
F60|Production Integration in the European Union|Measured by trade in intermediate inputs, economic integration has increased between 2000 and 2014 between members of the European Union and even more with non-members. Integration is negatively related to economic size and positively to the number of years as a member. Germany is the largest hub in the production network and the centre of gravity has moved eastward. Older member states are increasingly exporting service inputs and new member states primary and manufacturing inputs. Wages are increasing faster in countries with low initial wages, indicating wage convergence as a result of production integration.
F60|Trade and currency weapons|"The debate on trade wars and currency wars has re-emerged since the Great recession of 2009. We study the two forms of non-cooperative policies within a single framework. First, we compare the elasticity of trade flows to import tariffs and to the real exchange rate, based on product level data for 110 countries over the 1989-2013 period. We find that a 1 percent depreciation of the importer's currency reduces imports by around 0.5 percent in current dollar, whereas an increase in import tariffs by 1 percentage point reduces imports by around 1.4 percent. Hence the two instruments are not equivalent. Second, we build a stylized short-term macroeconomic model where the government aims at internal and external balance. We find that, in this setting, monetary policy is more stabilizing for the economy than trade policy, except when the internal transmission channel of monetary policy is muted (at the zero-lower bound). One implication is that, in normal times, a country will more likely react to a trade ""aggression"" through monetary easing rather than through a tariff increase. The result is reversed at the ZLB."
F60|Who is NOT voting for Brexit anymore?|Using estimates of support for Leave across UK local authority areas constructed from a comprehensive 20,000 strong survey, we show that both the level and the geographic variation capturing differential degrees of support for Leave have changed significantly since the 2016 EU referendum. A lot of area characteristics, many of which were previously associated with higher levels of support for Leave, are now significant correlates capturing a swing towards Remain. They include, for example, the degree to which local authorities receive transfers from the EU or the extent to which their economies rely on trade with the EU, along with past electoral support for UKIP (and the BNP) and exposure to immigration from Eastern Europe. Lastly, exposure to austerity since 2010 is among the strongest individual correlates weakening the support for Leave. The evidence is consistent with the argument that the small margin of victory of Leave in 2016 was, to a significant extent, carried by protest voters, who used the EU referendum to voice their discontent with domestic social and economic developments, particularly, austerity. Lastly, we present some evidence suggesting that the UK public, even in Leave supporting areas, would be much more willing to make compromises on free movement and aspects of single market membership compared to what appears to be the UK governments negotiation objective.
F60|The KOF Globalisation Index – revisited|Abstract We introduce the revised version of the KOF Globalisation Index, a composite index measuring globalization for every country in the world along the economic, social and political dimension. The original index was introduced by Dreher (Applied Economics, 38(10):1091–1110, 2006) and updated in Dreher et al. (2008). This second revision of the index distinguishes between de facto and de jure measures along the different dimensions of globalization. We also disentangle trade and financial globalization within the economic dimension of globalization and use time-varying weighting of the variables. The new index is based on 43 instead of 23 variables in the previous version. Following Dreher (Applied Economics, 38(10):1091–1110, 2006), we use the new index to examine the effect of globalization on economic growth. The results suggest that de facto and de jure globalization influence economic growth differently. Future research should use the new KOF Globalisation Index to re-examine other important consequences of globalization and why globalization was proceeding rapidly in some countries, such as South Korea, but less so in others. The KOF Globalisation Index can be downloaded from http://www.kof.ethz.ch/globalisation/ .
F60|Measures of Global Public Goods and International Spillovers|This paper attempts a first-cut listing of global public goods and international spillover activities, as well as providing some data on their global distribution alongside basic correlational analysis. Few if any goods are “pure” global public goods and there is a spectrum of the extent of spillovers. Some global public goods are not well measured. The listing is far from exhaustive, nor is it based on rigorous selection criteria. But it does suggest considerable diversity in trends, levels and sources of public good and spillover activities.

F60|21st Century Trade Agreements and the Owl of Minerva|The post Second World War liberal trade order has been a driver of global economic growth and rising average per capita incomes. This order confronts increasing opposition, reflecting concerns about adjustment costs and distributional effects of globalization, and the ability to pursue national policy goals. At the same time the development of complex production relations distributed across many countries calls for cooperation on a variety of regulatory policies. Contrary to what is argued by opponents of globalization, this does not imply one size fits all rules that constitute a threat to national sovereignty and democratic legitimation. There remains an important ‘traditional’ integration agenda that centers on rule-making by major trading powers on policies that generate negative international spillovers. But the core challenge for the political economy of 21st Century trade agreements is to support regulatory cooperation to better govern international production and address the non-pecuniary externalities associated with greater economic integration.
F60|Innovation and Trade Policy in a Globalized World|How do import tariffs and R&D subsidies help domestic firms compete globally? How do these policies affect aggregate growth and economic welfare? To answer these questions, we build a dynamic general equilibrium growth model where firm innovation endogenously determines the dynamics of technology, and, therefore, market leadership and trade flows, in a world with two large open economies at different stages of development. Firms’ R&D decisions are driven by (i) the defensive innovation motive, (ii) the expansionary innovation motive, and (iii) technology spillovers. The theoretical investigation illustrates that, statically, globalization (defined as reduced trade barriers) has ambiguous effects on welfare, while, dynamically, intensified globalization boosts domestic innovation through induced international competition. Accounting for transitional dynamics, we use our model for policy evaluation and compute optimal policies over different time horizons. The model suggests that the introduction of the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit in 1981 proves to be an effective policy response to foreign competition, generating substantial welfare gains in the long run. A counterfactual exercise shows that increasing tariffs as an alternative policy response improves domestic welfare only when the policymaker cares about the very short run, and only when introduced unilaterally. Tariffs generate large welfare losses in the medium and long run, or when there is retaliation by the foreign economy. Protectionist measures generate large dynamic losses by distorting the impact of openness on innovation incentives and productivity growth. Finally, our model predicts that a more globalized world entails less government intervention, thanks to innovation-stimulating effects of intensified international competition.
F60|Is Employment Globalizing?|We investigate the claim that national labor markets have become more globally interconnected in recent decades. We do so by deriving estimates over time of three different notions of interconnection: (i) the share of labor demand that is export induced (i.e., all labor demand created by foreign entities buying products exported by the home country)—we provide estimates for 40 countries; (ii) the share of workers employed in sectors producing tradable goods or services—68 countries; and (iii) the ratio of the number of jobs that are either located in a tradable sector, or that are involved in producing services that are required by these tradable sectors, to all jobs in the economy, which we call the trade-linked employment share—40 countries. Our estimates lead to the conclusion that the evidence of a large increase in the interconnections between national labor markets is far weaker than commonly asserted: levels of interconnectivity, and the direction of changes over time, vary across notions of interconnection and countries. The main reasons for this are labordisplacing productivity growth in tradable sectors of each economy and the diminishing fraction of national labor forces hired into manufacturing jobs worldwide. We also discuss the implications of our results for different policy debates that each of the three measures is associated with: international coordination of macroeconomic policies (export-induced labor demand), currency devaluations (share of workers producing tradables), and education and labor protection (trade-linked share).
F60|Uncertainty and Fiscal Cliffs|Fiscal uncertainty arises in many forms. Expiring temporary stimulus measures, projections of rapid debt growth, and oscillating political concerns over general levels of taxation are examples that all contribute to fiscal uncertainty. Motivated by anecdotal evidence associated with the US Fiscal-Cliff episode near the end of 2012, we empirically investigate the impact of economic policy uncertainty on investment and employment, especially with regard to the type of investment project. Increases in policy uncertainty lower investment and employment, with some investment dropping immediately and some more gradually, depending upon the ease of installation of types of capital. Based upon this empirical evidence, we then present a DSGE model of expiring tax provisions, and show that the model generates responses to fiscal uncertainty that match key features of the data. The framework captures a few unique elements of fiscal uncertainty. First, fiscal uncertainty is over the average tax rate, rather than a mean-preserving shock to the future tax rate. Second, households obtain information that tax rates may change at a particular date in the future, though whether tax rates do ultimately change is uncertain. As a result, information indicating that a policy change may occur in the future immediately sets in motion partial adjustments toward the new policy. The degree of adjustment households undertake depends on the probability attached to the outcome that actually does result in a change in fiscal policy. Unsuccessful reforms inject noise into the economy and lower the steady state level of the capital stock and output.
F60|Escaping the Middle-Income Trap: A Cross-Country Analysis on the Patterns of Industrial Upgrading|With rapid industrial upgrading along the global value chain of manufactured goods, China has transformed, within one generation, from an impoverished agrarian society to a middle-income nation as well as the largest manufacturing powerhouse in the world. This article identifies the pattern of China’s industrial upgrading and compares it with those of other successfully industrialized economies and the failed ones. We find that (i) China (since 1978) followed essentially the same path of industrial upgrading as that of Japan and the “Asian Tigers.” These economies succeeded in catching up with the developed western world by going through three developmental stages sequentially; namely, a proto-industrialization in the rural areas, a first industrial revolution featuring mass production of labor-intensive light consumer goods, and then a second industrial revolution featuring mass production of the means of mass production (i.e., capital-intensive heavy industrial good s such as steel, machine tools, electronics, automobiles, communication and transport infrastructures). (ii) In contrast, economies stuck in the low-income trap or middle-income trap did not follow the above sequential stages of industrialization. For example, many Eastern European and Latin American countries after WWII jumped to the stage of heavy industrialization without fully developing their labor-intensive light industries, and thus stagnated in the middle-income trap. Also, there is a clear lack of proto-industrialization in the rural areas for many African economies that have remained in the low-income trap. We believe that laissez-faire and “free market” alone is unable to trigger industrial upgrading. Instead, correct government-led bottom-up industrial policies are the key to escaping the low- and middle-income traps.
F60|New impacts of globalization : Introduction to the special topic issued from the “66th Annual Congress of the French Economic Association<BR>[Nouveaux effets de la mondialisation : Introduction au dossier spécial issu du “66ème Congrès Annuel de l’AFSE”]|"This special thematic feature on ""New impacts of globalization"" was developed, in partnership with the French Economic Association (Association fran-çaise de science économique, AFSE), from the contributions presented at its 66th annual congress which took place in Nice in June 2017. The four articles published here illustrate the different channels by which a country's international openness impacts its wealth, employment and subnational inequalities. This introduction builds on these works to present some recent avenues of research for modelling and quantifying the impacts of globalization."
F60|Back on Track? A Macro–Micro Narrative of Italian Exports|Abstract Using both macro and firm-level data, we provide an in-depth analysis of Italy’s goods exports relative to its three main trading partners (Germany, France and Spain) in order to gauge the causes of its relative underperformance prior to the 2008–2009 crisis and to assess whether the improvement observed since 2010 reflects cyclical or structural factors. We argue that Italy’s relatively unsatisfactory performance in the 2000s was the result of the interplay between the appreciation of its real effective exchange rate, its specialization in products that were particularly exposed to increasing competition from China, and the size distribution of its exporters, skewed towards small firms. In recent years signs of structural improvement have emerged, alongside cyclical factors, in connection with a shift in the specialization of exports towards sectors that are less exposed to competitive pressures; moreover, the selection process triggered by the exceptional difficulties encountered by micro and small firms both before and during the global financial crisis have plausibly strengthened the population of Italian exporters, making it structurally more resilient to exchange rate appreciations and more capable of keeping pace with external demand developments.
F60|The KOF Globalisation Index â€“ Revisited|In this paper we present and describe the revised version of the KOF Globalisation Index, a composite index measuring globalisation for every country in the world along the economic, social and political dimension. The original index was introduced by Dreher (2006) and updated in Dreher et al. (2008). This second revision of the index introduces the differentiation between de facto and de jure measures along the different dimensions of globalisation, the differentiation between trade and financial globalisation within the economic dimension of globalisation and time-varying weighting of the variables entering the index. Finally, the revised version incorporates several additional variables in the construction process. At the aggregate level, we show that a bidirectional relationship between de facto and de jure globalisation exists.
F60|Compositional changes in aggregate productivity in an era of globalisation and financial crisis|We demonstrate that common modeling assumptions underlying micro-unit productivity indices induce biases in the evolution and decomposition of standard aggregate productivity measures. After controlling for such biases, we decompose aggregate productivity based on groups of economically significant firm types. We show that large incumbent firms that both export and import determine the evolution of aggregate productivity for the Belgian manufacturing sector. Over time, the increase in average productivity outweighs the decline in the covariance between market shares and productivity of this group. The former result stems from stronger learning-by-doing effects for granular firms. The latter suggests an increase in resource misallocation due to market distortions. This pattern intensifies after the 2008 financial crisis. All other firm types, if anything, contribute negatively to aggregate productivity and productivity growth.
F60|Spinning the Web: The Impact of ICT on Trade in Intermediates and Technology Diffusion|This paper studies how information and communication technology (ICT) improvements affect trade along the value chain and international technology diffusion. We examine the impact of a revolutionary technology, the roll-out of the global telegraph network, on the 19th century cotton textile industry. First, we show that connection to the telegraph disproportionately increased trade in intermediate goods relative to final goods. We document that this was due to differences in codifiability; that is, the extent to which product specifications could be communicated at a distance using only words (and thus by sending telegrams) as opposed to inspecting a sample of the product. Second, adoption of the telegraph also facilitated international technology diffusion through the complementary mechanisms of importing machinery and acquiring knowledge of the production process and local demand through importing intermediates. These results shed light on how ICT facilitates the formation of global value chains and the diffusion of frontier technology.
F60|Weight gains from trade in foods: Evidence from Mexico|This paper investigates the effects of trade in food on obesity in Mexico. We classifyMexican food imports from the U.S. into healthy and unhealthy and match thesewith anthropometric and food expenditure survey data. We exploit variation acrossMexican states in their exposure to food imports from the U.S.. We fi nd that imports ofunhealthy foods signi cantly contribute to the rise of obesity in Mexico. The empiricalevidence also suggests that unhealthy food imports may widen health disparitiesbetween education groups. By linking imports to food expenditure and obesity, thepaper sheds light on an important channel through which globalization may affecthealth.
F60|Techies, Trade, and Skill-Biased Productivity|We study the impact of firm level choices of ICT, R&D, exporting and importing on the evolution of productivity and its bias towards skilled occupations. We use a novel measure of the propensity of a firm to engage in technology investment and adoption: its employment of workers with STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) skills and experience who we call “techies”. We develop a methodology for estimating firm level productivity that allows us to measure both Hicks-neutral and skill-augmenting technology differences, and apply this to administrative data on French firms in the entire private sector from 2009 to 2013. We find that techies and importing of intermediate inputs raise skill-biased productivity, while imports also raise Hicks-neutral productivity. We also find that higher firm-level skill biased productivity raises low-skill employment even as it raises the ratio of skilled to unskilled workers. This is because of the cost-reducing effect of higher productivity. The techie and trade effects are large, and can account for much of the aggregate increase in skilled employment from 2009 to 2013.
F60|The U.S.-China Trade Balance and the Theory of Free Trade: Debunking the Currency Manipulation Argument|The U.S.-China trade imbalance is commonly attributed to a Chinese policy of currency manipulation. However, empirical studies failed to reach consensus on the degree and kind of RMB misalignment. We argue that this is not a consequence of poor measurement but of theory. The conventional principle of comparative advantage suggests real exchange rates will adjust so as to balance trade. Therefore, the persistence of trade imbalances tend to be interpreted as arising from currency manipulation. In contrast, the Smithian-Harrodian theory explains trade imbalances as the outcome of free trade and sees unequal real competitiveness as the root cause of the U.S.-China trade imbalance.
F60|Agro-food trade, GVCs and agricultural development in ASEAN|The countries that compromise the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have expanded their involvement in global agro-food trade through strong regional production growth and increasing consumer demands from population growth and higher incomes. Regional and international agro-food markets have thus become an important source of income and food for the regions producers and consumers. However, growth in trade has lessened in recent years with projections suggesting a further slowing over the medium term. This study explores the role that agro-food trade and participation in agro-food global value chains (GVC) has had on regional agro-food sectors and current barriers that are holding the region back from unlocking the full benefits of further integration into regional and global agro-food markets. It finds that although GVC engagement has increased regional agro-food growth between 2004 and 2014, gaps remain in the level of regional integration. Results from the analysis suggest that reducing the remaining tariff and non tariff barriers, and creating an enabling environment to allow agricultural producers to better access service inputs, will help spur sector growth and agricultural incomes.
F60|ASEAN rice market integration: findings from a feasibility study|This study explores feasibility of regional rice market integration by examining the impacts on production and trade, with a specific focus on the adjustment impacts for rice producers. It seeks to set out policy measures required to better integrate the rice markets of Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) countries and the role that trade policy can play to help the agricultural sector adjust to pressures created from freer trade in rice within this region. While regional rice market integration can deliver more rice at lower prices to the regions consumers, this study finds significant adjustments to the rice sectors will be required in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. However, opportunities through lowering tariff barriers with existing key trading partners of free trade agreements has the scope to create more employment and value adding opportunities in all agricultural sectors to offset the losses from regional rice market integration. The study suggests a number of measures are necessary to build trust in regional markets to allow rice market integration to take place. This includes an agreement to ban export restrictions. Furthermore, while broader trade reforms will help create new opportunities for agricultural sectors across the ASEAN region, flanking policies and investments in the enabling environment are still required for the sectors to take full advantage of these opportunities.
F60|Societal benefits and costs of International Investment Agreements: A critical review of aspects and available empirical evidence|This paper reviews alleged societal benefits and costs of International Investment Agreements (IIAs) as suggested by academia, governments, business and civil society. It sets out the wide range of issues that diverse actors have proposed in the context of assessing the societal benefits and costs of IIAs. The paper analyses and organises the available material generated by these sources to identify and classify the many different issues, summarises available empirical evidence and findings in these sources on the individual aspects, and assesses strengths and weaknesses of the approaches. The paper focuses in particular on the investor protection component of IIAs. The inventory finds that for many claims about the positive or negative impact of IIAs, little robust evidence has been generated to date. The paper highlights methodological challenges and suggests areas where further study would be required to draw firmer conclusions.
F60|A genie in a bottle?: Globalisation, competition and inflation|Declining inflation in many countries over the past few decades at the same time as rising global competition has led to a debate on the importance of globalisation for domestic inflation. This paper explores the implications of global value chain (GVC) integration and market contestability for inflation using a range of industry-level and micro-data sources. We provide evidence that rising participation in GVCs has placed downward pressure on producer price inflation, by increasing the ability of firms to substitute domestic inputs with cheaper foreign equivalents. We investigate the channels, which suggests that increased GVC participation contributed to lower inflation via downward pressures on unit labour costs – by raising productivity and reducing wages – in the importing country, especially when low-wage countries are integrated in supply chains. We then present industry-level evidence to support the conjecture that a higher level of GVC integration dampens producer price inflation by accentuating the impact of global economic slack on domestic inflation. However, we also find an increasing trend in mark-ups, suggestive of rising market power, particularly in services sectors. Thus, looking forward, there is a risk that stalling globalisation since the crisis, coupled with stronger aggregate demand and declining market contestability, could lead to inflationary pressures in the medium term, thereby letting the inflation genie out of the bottle.
F60|A dynamic spatial model of global governance structures|This paper presents a novel understanding of the changing governance structures in global supply chains. Motivated by the global garment sector, we develop a geographical political economy dynamic model which reflects the interaction between bargaining power and distribution of value among buyer and producer firms. We find that the interplay between these two forces, in combination with the spatial specificities of global production, are necessary and sufficient to drive governance structures towards an intermediate position regarding their level of explicit coordination and power asymmetry.
F60|16+1, a New Issue in China-EU Relations?|The present paper investigates the positions of individual member states, European institutions and organizations towards the 16+1 cooperation framework. At the institutional level, the European Commission’s Joint communication on elements for a new EU strategy on China of June 2016, the reports and joint statements of the European Economic and Social Committee and China Economic and Social Council (May 2016 and June 2017) and European Parliament publications underline: the absence of a common EU-level strategy on recent large scale Chinese initiatives and some member states pursue individual economic interests, which do not correspond to those of the EU as a whole; 16+1 format as “controversial”, as its arrangements are “in conflict with the EU law” which leads to the “erosion of EU norms”; the necessity to “cooperate with the Commission, the EEAS and other Member States to help ensure that relevant aspects to the EU are in line with EU law, rules and policies, and that the overall outcome is beneficial for the EU as a whole”. We analyze the concerns and make specific proposals so that the 16+1 format might cease to be an issue in China-EU relations.
F60|Openness and Factor Shares: Is Globalization Always Bad for Labor?|The secular decline in the labor share since the 1980's is a global phenomenon, and a trend that is concurrent with large liberalization episodes worldwide. In this paper we investigate the liberalization episode in India during the 1990's, which has been characterized by large and unexpected changes in trade and foreign investment policies. Contrary to what might be expected given the reduction in the aggregate data, we uncover a trade channel that raises the labor-to-capital relative factor shares in India. A reduction in capital tariffs and liberalization of FDI raise the share of income paid to labor relative to capital. Our results reveal access to foreign capital as a new mechanism through which openness affects factor shares. An increasing share of foreign capital in the total capital stock provides a capital-augmenting technical change and potentially reduces rental rates, both of which raises the relative labor share. We find capital and R&D intensities, and the borrowing capacity of the firm, to be important determinants of the factor share response to openness. Finally, we identify domestic deregulation policies and credit expansion as potential determinants of the observed decline in the labor share.
F60|Gains from Trade and the Sovereign Bond Market|Increasing international flows of goods, services, and financial assets have been shown to increase a country's welfare through various channels. This paper studies the interaction between a country's welfare gains from international trade and its sovereign’s access to bond markets. We do so by incorporating a sovereign bond market into a simple Armington (1969) trade model. While standard trade models suggest surprisingly small gains from trade, our model implies that introducing channels through a sovereign bond market greatly magnifies the gains from trade.
F60|FDI in the digital economy: a shift to asset-light international footprints|The digital economy is becoming an ever more important part of the world economy. It is revolutionizing the way we do business, and it has important implications for foreign direct investment (FDI). However, little systematic analysis has been done to investigate the investment patterns of digital multinational enterprises (MNEs). This study, conducted in the context of UNCTAD’s World Investment Report 2017 (WIR17), is an attempt to fill some of the gap in knowledge and to provide an impetus for future research. It proposes a new interpretative framework for the digital economy, builds an extensive sample of digital and ICT MNEs, and profiles their international operations. Its main findings are that MNEs in highly digitalized industries have a “lighter” FDI footprint than traditional MNEs; they tend to concentrate their operations in a few highly developed countries and their investment patterns are shaped by fiscal and financial motives more than those of traditional MNEs. As digital technologies and business models tend to disseminate across the broader economy, this may suggest the onset of a new era of international production and MNE internationalization paths. This paper sheds light on the methodology underpinning the analysis in WIR17 to ensure full replicability and to prepare the ground for further work in the area. It also builds further on the discussion in WIR17, proposing broader implications for international business and new avenues for future research.

The paper estimates lead to the conclusion that the evidence of a large increase in the interconnections between national labor markets is far weaker than commonly asserted: levels of interconnectivity, and the direction of changes over time, vary across notions of interconnection and countries.

F60|China Syndrome Or Not? Labour Market Effects Of A Greater Trade Openness In Us Manufacturing|According to the recent economic literature, international trade has had a significant influence on the US labour market, due to the import penetration of Chinese products. In particular, according to David Author and his co-authors, Chinese import would have caused a “China syndrome”, i.e. strong employment contraction as well as negative impact on the cumulated earnings of workers in the areas most exposed to this competition. Although it can be maintained that, in recent decades, international trade has had a negative impact on the US labour market, in this paper it is claimed that, from a theoretical point of view, import penetration does not represent an appropriate index to detect the influence of international trade on the labour market. The aim of this paper is to offer an alternative analysis tool, the Trade Openness Index, which could exceed the limits of the Factor Content of Trade and the Stolper-Samuelson theorem.
F60|Endowment Structure, Industry dynamics and Vertical Production Structure in China-Theory and Evidence|This paper proposes a theoretical model and shows that the comparative advantage of Chinaâ€™s factor endowment allows firms specializing in the midstream stage to gain at least as much as firms that specialize in the two ends of the supply chain (capital-intensive stage and labour-intensive stage) in terms of labour productivity and profitability, if and only if they have at least as much viability and use intermediate level of capital intensity. The empirical results are consistent with the theoryâ€™s predictions. Our findings on Chinaâ€™s industry supply chain production patterns provide a new angle on the division of gains in the vertical production network driven by the endowment structure. This could have far-reaching implications for the industrial development of other middle-income countries.
F60|National accounts for a global economy: the case of Ireland|Globalisation is affecting the way economic activity is reflected in the national accounts. Intellectual property, which is now part of the capital stock, interacts with the choice of global firms as to their legal structure, producing different national accounting outcomes for individual countries. This is but one manifestation of the challenges that a global economy presents for national accounting. Using the example of Ireland, consideration is given to the data needed to meet the needs of users of national accounts. In particular, more information is required to separately identify all the activity of multinational enterprises and domestically owned firms. This paper suggests a set of satellite accounts for Ireland that would show how changes in the economy affect the economic welfare of Irish residents.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

F60|Trade in Developing East Asia: How It Has Changed and Why It Matters|East Asia, for long the epitome of successful engagement in trade, faces serious challenges: technological change that may threaten the very model of labor intensive industrialization and a backlash against globalization that may reduce access to important markets. The analysis in this article suggests that how East Asia copes with these global challenges will depend on how it addresses three more proximate national and regional challenges. The first is the emergence of China as a global trade giant, which is fundamentally altering the trading patterns and opportunities of its neighbors. The second is the asymmetric implementation of national reform – in goods trade and investment versus services – which is affecting the evolution of comparative advantage and productivity in each country. The third is the divergence between the relatively shallow and fragmented agreements that regulate the region's trade and investment and the growing importance of regional and global value chains as crucial drivers of productivity growth.
F60|Asian Experiences with Global and Regional Value Chain Integration and Structural Change|This research report investigates the relationship between the growing integration into global and regional value chains (VCs) and structural change in the South and South East Asian (SEA) region. The analysis includes a sample of 60 developed and developing countries covered in the OECD’s Inter-Country Input-Output Tables. Focusing on the SEA region, we find the usual inverted U-shaped relationship between the manufacturing share and per capita income. With regards to the impact of growing VC integration, the econometric results suggest a small positive effect of the overall VC integration on the change in the manufacturing share at the global level. Very similar patterns are found for the South and South East Asian region, however, with a large degree of country heterogeneity. The main beneficiaries from VC integration in the region in terms of the relative importance of manufacturing in the economy include for example Korea and Thailand. Unexpectedly, no significant differences in the (manufacturing-related) structural impacts of regional and global VCs could be identified.
F60|Measuring Economic Openness|A Review of Existing Measures and Empirical Practices This paper surveys existing measures of economic openness understood as the degree to which non-domestic actors can or do participate in a domestic economy. We introduce a typology of openness indicators which distinguishes between ‘real’ and ‘financial’ openness as well as between ‘de facto’ and ‘de jure’ measures of openness, and show that this classification indeed captures different dimensions of economic openness. The main contribution of the paper is to supply a comprehensive and novel data set of openness indicators available for interested researchers. Based on this effort, we analyse some trends in economic openness over time and provide a correlation analysis across indicators. Finally, we explore the practical implications of choosing from different openness measures within a growth regression framework and highlight that researchers should make the choice of the indicator based on explicit theoretical justifications that correspond to their specific research questions.
F60|Gains from Trade and the Sovereign Bond Market|Increasing international flows of goods, services, and financial assets have been shown to increase a country's welfare through various channels. This paper studies the interaction between a country's welfare gains from international trade and its sovereign’s access to bond markets. We do so by incorporating a sovereign bond market into a simple Armington (1969)'s trade model. While standard trade models suggest surprisingly small gains from trade, our model implies that introducing channels through a sovereign bond market greatly magnifies the gains from trade.
F60|Technological justice: A G20 agenda|Technological justice can play an important role within the international system in resolving global challenges and creating a smart and more egalitarian society. Technological and scientific developments are generating huge opportunities for tackling societal challenges. However, the benefits of technology and innovation are unequally distributed, and they tend to cause economic and political disruptions in our societies that widen inequalities within states as well as between countries. Digitalisation and, especially, automation are challenges that must be faced if developing countries are to avoid premature de-industrialization, expulsion from global value chains of the world economy, and the serious damage to their growth paths that would result. The authors propose adopting the concept of 'technological justice' within our societies as a new paradigm for the international system to reconcile technological advances with the societal challenges facing our global society, especially poverty and sustainability; and propose a number of policies and measures by which the G-20 could take on a central role in pushing this major contribution onto the global agenda. The authors participate in the T-20 network of think tanks that facilitates interaction between its members, the public policy community and the general public, being its primary objective to add value to the G20 process with evidence-based public policy proposals on areas of interest for the international agenda.
F60|Integrated reporting and board features|In the last two decades the concept of sustainability reporting gained more importance in the companies’ annual reports, a trend which is embedded also in integrated reporting. Issuing an integrated report became a necessity, because the report explains to the investors how the organization creates value over time. The governance structure, more exactly the board of directors, decides whether or not the company will issue an integrated report. Thus, are there certain features of the board that might influence the issue of an integrated report? Do the companies which issue an integrated report have certain features of the governance structure? Looking for an answer to these questions, we seek for any possible correlations between a disclosure index and the corporate governance structure characteristics, on a sample from the companies participating at the International Integrated Reporting Council Examples Database. The results highlight that only the size of the board influences the extent to which the issued integrated report is in accordance with the International Framework.
F60|Vertical Specialization and Gains from Trade|"Multi-stage production is widely recognized as an important feature of the modern global economy. This feature has been incorporated into many state-of-the-art quantitative trade models, and has been shown to deliver significant additional gains from international trade. Meanwhile, specialization across stages of production, or “vertical specialization,"" has been largely ignored in these models. In this paper, I provide evidence that vertical specialization is a salient feature in the international trade data, which implies that the assumption made in standard models is inaccurate. I then develop a model with multi-stage production where country-level productivity differences provide a basis for vertical specialization and additional global gains from trade beyond those currently accounted for in standard models. I quantify the gains from vertical specialization according to the model. Despite the importance of vertical specialization in the data, I find that the average gains from trade are only slightly higher than the gains suggested by standard models with multi-stage production. Moreover, much of the impact of across-stage specialization is largely offset by across-sector intermediate input linkages. These results suggest that vertical specialization is not the source of missing gains from trade that have recently confounded trade economists."
F60|The Welfare Effects of Protection: A General Equilibrium Analysis of Canada’s National Policy|In this paper, we study the impact of Canada’s adoption of protectionist trade policy in 1879 on Canadian welfare. Under the National Policy the Canadian average weighted tariff increased from 14% to 21%. The conventional view is that this was a distortionary policy that negatively affected Canadian welfare. We argue that this view is incomplete because it ignores general equilibrium effects. Using a multi-industry general equilibrium model with differentiated goods, we show that the welfare effects of tariffs can potentially be positive, even for small open economies, due to their impact on the terms of trade. We apply these theoretical insights in a reassessment of the welfare consequences of the National Policy for Canada using newly compiled granular trade and production data from 1870 to 1913, and newly estimated historically contemporaneous import demand elasticities. Our results suggest that the National Policy’s tariff changes actually improved Canadian welfare by between 0.13% to 0.20% of gross domestic product, although a multilateral move to free trade would have resulted in an even better welfare outcome for Canadians.
F60|Competition for Global Value Added: Export and Domestic Market Shares|We propose a new “global” market share indicator that complements the traditional export market share analysis by accounting for the foreign value added embodied in the production process and for the performance of national firms on their domestic market. We also consider all the income from activities used in the production to address the manufacturing final demand, namely all activities within the manufacturing value chain. Our results show that the role of services is growing in global value chains. Interestingly, considering our global indicator makes the dynamics of market shares converge among large economies, which can be explained by a de-correlation between national and export performances. This de-correlation appears to reflect greater specialization within global manufacturing value chains.
F60|World changes in inequality: an overview of facts, causes, consequences and policies|This paper reviews various issues linked to the rise of inequality observed particularly in developed countries over the last quarter century. Various data on the time profile of inequality are examined, which do not always fit the common view that inequality is everywhere trending upwards. Overall, changes in inequality appear to be very country-specific. The same conclusion obtains when examining the causes of these changes. There is little doubt that common forces affected the distribution of income in most countries, but idiosyncratic factors have amplified their effects in some cases and offset them in others. Country-specificity also holds with regard to policies aimed at correcting inequality, even though globalisation imposes constraints on some key redistribution tools such as taxation and the regulation of financial markets. International coordination and, in particular, more transparency in cross-border financial operations are needed if governments are to recover some autonomy in these matters.
F60|Global Collaborative Patents|We study the prevalence and traits of global collaborative patents for US public companies, where the inventor team is located both within and outside of the US. Collaborative patents are frequently observed when a corporation is entering into a new foreign region for innovative work, especially in settings where intellectual property protection is weak. We also connect collaborative patents to the ethnic composition of the firm's US inventors and cross‐border mobility of inventors within the firm. The inventor team composition has important consequences for how the new knowledge is exploited within and outside of the firm.
F60|Brexit: The Economics of International Disintegration|This paper reviews the literature on the likely economic consequences of Brexit and considers the lessons of the Brexit vote for the future of European and global integration. Brexit will make the United Kingdom poorer because it will lead to new barriers to trade and migration between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Plausible estimates put the costs to the United Kingdom at between 1 and 10 percent of income per capita. Other European Union countries will also suffer economically, but their estimated losses are much smaller. Support for Brexit came from a coalition of less-educated, older, less economically successful and more socially conservative voters. Why these voters rejected the European Union is poorly understood, but will play an important role in determining whether Brexit proves to be merely a diversion on the path to greater international integration or a sign that globalization has reached its limits.
F60|Instrumental Variables and Causal Mechanisms: Unpacking the Effect of Trade on Workers and Voters|We identify how German voters responded to the labor market turmoil caused by increasing trade with low-wage manufacturing countries. We first establish that import competition increased voters’ support for only extreme (right) parties. We then decompose this populist ‘total effect’ of trade on voting into a ‘mediated effect’ running through labor market adjustments and an independent ‘direct effect’. Our Causal Mediation Analysis reveals that direct and indirect effect work in opposite directions.
F60|Some Doubts about the Economic Analysis of the Flow of Silver to China in 1550–1820|Abstract The paper takes issue with the mainstream economic analysis of the enormous flow of silver into China in 1550–1820. First, I challenge the view that arbitrage between gold and silver in European trade with China was important except for one twenty-year spell. Next, I argue that had China imported gold, its history would have been much the same. I also dispute the idea that the persistence of the silver inflows from 1550 to 1820 implies any persistent disequilibrium, and I maintain that economic theory can easily accommodate the view that the inflow of silver into China sponsored growth in China.
F60|Global Supply Chains: towards a CGE analysis|Economists have analysed global supply chains (GSC) using pure theory, case studies, econometrics and input-output calculations. We now need a new type of computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to show how GSC trade affects welfare and its distribution between and within nations. The new model must recognize: fragmentation of production; scale economies; intermediate inputs that cross national borders multiple times embodied in products at different stages of completion; and decision-making by global agents. We describe a prototype that incorporates these features and gives interpretable results not attainable with a standard CGE model. We discuss steps to move from the prototype to a policy-relevant model.
F60|On the Geography of Global Value Chains|This paper studies the optimal location of production for the different stages in a sequential global value chain. We develop a general-equilibrium model featuring a proximity-concentration tradeoff: slicing global value chains across countries allows to better exploit agglomeration economies, but such fragmentation comes at the cost of increased transportation costs. We show that, other things equal, it is optimal to locate relatively downstream stages of production in relatively central or well-connected locations, while upstream stages of production are optimally assigned to more remote locations. We illustrate this result by working out the optimal location of production for a few basic topologies featuring a low number of countries and stages. Exact solutions to the problem for a larger number of countries and stages are computationally complex, but can be obtained using combinatorial optimization tools. We apply the model to study the optimal specialization within chains in eleven countries in Factory Asia.
F60|Measuring Productivity and Absorptive Capacity Evolution in OECD Economies|We develop a new way to estimate cross-country production functions which allows us to parametrize unobserved non-factor inputs (total factor productivity) as a global technology process combined with country-specific time-varying absorptive capacity. The advantage of our approach is that we do not need to adopt proxies for absorptive capacity such as investments in research and development (R&D) or human capital, or specify explicit channels through which global technology can transfer to individual countries, such as trade, FDI or migration: we provide an endogenously-created index for relative absorptive capacity which is easy to interpret and encompasses potential proxies and channels. Our implementation adopts an unobserved component model and uses a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to obtain posterior estimates for all model parameters. This contribution to empirical methodology allows researchers to employ widely-available data for factor inputs (capital, labor) and GDP or value-added in order to arrive at policy-relevant insights for industrial and innovation policy. Applying our methodology to a panel of 31 advanced economies we chart the dynamic evolution of global TFP and country-specific absorptive capacity and then demonstrate the close relationship between our estimates and salient indicators of growth-enhancing economic policy.
F60|Re-examining the middle-income trap hypothesis (MITH): What to reject and what to revive?|Do middle-income countries face difficult challenges producing consistent growth? Using transition matrix analysis, we can easily reject any unconditional notion of a “middle-income trap” in the data. However, countries have different fundamentals and policies. Using a non-parametric classification technique, we search for variables that separate fast- and slow-growing countries. For middle-income countries, a relatively large working age population, sex ratio imbalance, macroeconomic stability, and financial development appear to be the key discriminatory variables. We do the same exercise for low-income countries. This framework yields conditions under which countries in the low- and middle-income ranges move forward or backward, or are trapped.
F60|Ideology and redistribution through public spending|For a panel of OECD economies (1980–2013) we analyse the scope of government ideology to shape patterns of public expenditures. To address if public expenditures are used to channel redistributive outcomes, we adopt a flexible panel error correction model and proceed in two steps: Firstly, we analyse if ideological positions matter for the sizing of the public sector. Secondly, we address the actual impact of government ideology on two disjoint categories of public expenditure that are characterized by distinguished redistributive effects. Under both, left-wing and right-wing governments, public spending shows progressively redistributive effects which are indirectly channelled through their policy response to changing macroeconomic, fiscal and demographic fundamentals. While right-wing governments act progressively redistributive under favourable socio-economic conditions, their left-wing counterparts do so under unfavourable conditions. Comparing the two effects in terms of their explanatory content, we find that the latter is stronger than the former.
F60|Does patriotic vigilance make any sense in the transnational arena? A cosmopolitan alternative to the globalization paradox|We address the issue of the relevance in the transnational arena of the concept of patriotic vigilance, as expressed by French Minister Arnaud Montebourg in 2014. Firstly, we examine the globalization paradox with its underpinnings in the literature and its illustration through the recent Alstom saga. Secondly, we review the idea of a paradigm shift in world monetary affairs signaled by the recent crisis. Finally, drawing on Kant’s ideas on cosmopolitism, we sketch out an alternative to the globalization paradox.
F60|‘Unbundlings’ and Development Strategies in ASEAN: Old Issues and New Challenges|This paper extends the conceptual framework of ‘unbundlings’ proposed by Baldwin (2016) and tries to provide a starting point for reorganizing development strategies of ASEAN Member States (AMS). The AMS have largely been successful in utilizing the mechanics of the second unbundling with a reduction in communication costs; however, a lot of room still exists for exploiting its benefits. In addition, a new wave of the third unbundling, which comes with reduced face-to-face costs, has already arrived in ASEAN, and AMS must start incorporating it into their development strategies.
F60|Features of Social and Economic Transformations in the Globalization Era|The article looks into some of the features of social and economic transformations in the globalization era. Due to a number of economic and political processes encompassing all countries, it becomes obvious that the humankind faces the beginning of the drastic historical changes and the world new integrity. The main idea of the article is the idea of principal impossibility of social and economic processes of absolute unification, averaging and simplification of the social systems in the globalization era. The authors’ conviction is based on understanding the fact that in the globalization era the social relations system is being formed, where due to essential processes the different forms of social times and socio-spatial formations interact. Even a cursory glance reveals the whole specter of social organisms represented by both present and past history: ranging from the primitive forms to the semi-feudal one, from the quite traditional relations to the industrial and post-industrial ones. Despite great difference all existing countries while interacting with each other create social context of globalization. In the frame of this process the new integrity of the modern state of the society as the universum is happening. In terms of the social philosophy this universum is understood as active non-line environment where various social spheres emerge and evolve: modern integrative production, information flows including high technology industry, business and other components where the culture is to play the leading role as the way of life of a human being and society. The authors insist, the genesis of modern social systems is extremely interesting scientific issue, its consideration may be not only significant for the science itself, but can be applied in particular for the social relations management.
F60|The Role of Human Factors in the Bank Capital Evaluation Framework|The article assesses various versions of «Bank capital» definitions, and the own bank capital definition is suggested by authors. It assumes that bank capital is a monetary value of the bank’s debts and equities. Milestones of managing the bank capital such as formation and application are provided in the paper. Two groups of bank capital users such as external and internal stakeholders are highlighted. The key-note of the paper is defining the role of human capital in evaluating the bank capital. Human capital is suggested to play positive and negative role through the whole bank capital evaluation. Both subjective pros and cons of the human factor are revealed in the paper. Typical errors such as low-skilled staff, non-flexible mind, inconsistent risk policy in decision-making, deficient analytical framework, lack of useful forecasting are defined. Authors also defined a set of advantages of the human factors such as: quality education, professional skills, professional development, and diplomatic, highly analytical and independent mind, stress tolerance, and so on. The paper highlights the concept that entities’ benefits which are in evaluating the bank capital could be structured in importance and effect of the parties concerned. The hierarchical framework of interests completely depends on the person arranging the framework. The paper stresses that interests of the parties concerned should be listed in the bank capital’s evaluation policy. A set of key indicators such as capital profitability rate, adequacy ratio to highlight stakeholders’ interests are defined. Key features of bank capital management are described. Objectives of internal and external stakeholders’ activity are defined. The set of factors indicating the impact of human factors on evaluating the bank capital are discussed.
F60|The Development of Cluster Relations within the State and Business Structures in Terms of Strategy of Non-Primary Sector Import-Substitution|The main aim of the article is to determine how the implementation of the strategy of import substitution in non-primary sector of the Russian economy can be insured. Rostov region and other Southern regions of Russia were selected as the subjects of the study by the authors. Research particularly focuses on the main areas of socio-economic development as well as the process of implementation of the import substitution policy. The authors also analyzed the possibility of solving the problems of import substitution in the non-primary sector of the regional economy, formulated algorithmic bases of realization of cluster interaction of state and business structures. The authors have presented some promising industry clusters far the South of Russia Region. This article contains suggestions for the creation of regional clusters in terms of import substitution. As a result authors concluded that within the non-primary development of regional economy the principle of cluster interaction of state and business structures allows for efficient implementation of the import substitution strategy in the industrial sector.
F60|Research and Development Intensity in Business: Russia and EU|The present study is devoted to the investigation of the intensity of research and development importance in Russian Federation and EU. The authors selected economics of EU and Russian Federation countries as the object of the study. The subject of research is the intensity of research and development in Russian Federation and EU in the context of the priority sectors: state sector, scientific sector, business sector. In the given article the authors consider the semantic definition of «the intensity of research and development», the dynamics of research intensity indicators and development in Russia and EU, the authors’ assessment of the choice of priorities for research and development sectors is also given. According to the results of the study authors indicated the problem zone, discussion points and priorities for the further research. The authors also give recommendations for the Russian practice.
F60|Financial Integration and Valuation Effects: Globalisation or Americanization?|"The paper studies the international financial integration of the G20 economies, including the underlying valuation effects. We find that international financial integration is a salient phenomenon across advanced economies, dominated by the US as the historical financial hegemon. Furthermore, we identify positive valuation effects across advanced economies, at times as large as 75% of their cumulative GDP. After the crisis, these effects have been mainly the result of large positive valuations on the US stock of foreign liabilities driven both by structural as well as cyclical factors of the US economy. Our analysis also suggests that the international financial integration may not be as ""global"" as perceived, but a limited number of advanced economies hold the greater amount of external assets and liabilities, and thus, are most exposed to the identified valuation effects in the US. In this context, a balanced policy mix in the US, aimed at lifting productivity and potential growth, could strengthen the contribution of the structural drivers to the US valuation effects, therefore minising the likelihood and potential impact of any cyclical corrections."
F60|Global socio-technical regimes|This paper addresses the question why socio-technical transitions follow similar trajectories in various parts of the world, even though the relevant material preconditions and institutional contexts vary greatly between different countries. It takes a critical stance on the implicit methodological nationalism in transition studies’ socio-technical regime concept and proposes an alternative ‘global’ regime perspective that embraces the increasingly multi-scalar actor networks and institutional rationalities which influence transition dynamics beyond national or regional borders. By drawing on globalization theories from sociology and human geography we show that socio-technical systems often develop institutional rationalities that are diffused via international networks and thus become influential in various places around the world. In so doing, we shed light on the multi-scalar interrelatedness of institutional structures and actors in socio-technical systems and elaborate on the implications for the conceptualization of transition dynamics. The paper illustrates this with the case study of an unsuccessful transition in the Chinese water sector. Recent studies indicate that key decisions on wastewater infrastructure build-up were not only influenced by path-dependencies stemming from China’s national context, but equally (or even more critically) by an import of the dominant rationality of the water sector’s global socio-technical regime. We conclude by discussing the contours of a new research agenda around the notion of global socio-technical regimes.
F60|Acquisition Of Mexican Companies By Foreign Investors: Evidence From Catering Services And The Food Industry, Adquisicion De Empresas Mexicanas Por Inversionistas Extranjeros: Caso De Comedores Industriales|acquisitions between countries are a business opportunity and offer international economic empowerment. Mexican companies are currently being purchased by foreign investors. This study identifies factors that influence the catering services and food industry in Mexico, and the relationship between them. We wish to know factors that make them attractive as a foreign investor purchase candidate. The study was done as a joint research. The qualitative stage involves a case study of the two most important companies in Mexico that were acquired by foreign investors. Factors that influenced its foreign acquisition were identified. The quantitative stage involved a questionnaire applied to 15 companies that had not been acquired. Their specific factors or characteristics and trend of rotation were identified. The results confirm that foreign investors primarily seek companies that possess an attractive profile
F60|Egalitarian Policies and Effective Demand: Considering Balance of Payments|This study examines the effectiveness of redistribution policies considering balance of payments. Unlike Bowles (2012) and Abe (2016, 2015), we assume that capital movement is sluggish to consider the short-run effects. Results indicate that conventional egalitarian policies such as increasing unemployment compensation and strengthening dismissal regulations can be effective, whereas an asset-based redistribution such as a decrease in the ratio of monitoring labor cannot be. These results contradict Bowles (2012). We need to reevaluate conventional egalitarian policies if the effects of effective demand and adjustment of capital continue in the long run.
F60|The Dilemmas of China’s Shift in Growth Trajectory and Economic Governance|The slowdown in China’s GDP growth in recent years suggests the exhaustion of the driving forces of extensive economic growth and signals a need to switch to an intensive growth trajectory. In order to successfully orchestrate this shift, a reform of the economy’s operation is necessary, including a change in economic policy objectives in order to avoid the middle income trap. This paper analyses the changing role of the sources of economic growth and the main features of the change in the growth trajectory in the post-2010 period, and their relationships with economic governance based on the relevant domestic and international literature and statistical data, without entering into specific details. According to the author’s hypothesis, the Chinese government is prioritising the conflicting objectives of economic rationality and socio-political stability at the expense of the former
F60|The ‘China shock,’ exports and U.S. employment: A global input–output analysis|This paper quantifies the impact on U.S. employment from imports and exports during 1995–2011, using the World Input–Output Database. We find that the growth in U.S. exports led to increased demand for 2 million jobs in manufacturing, 0.5 million in resource industries, and a remarkable 4.1 million jobs in services, totaling 6.6 million. Two‐thirds of those service sectors jobs are due to the export of services themselves, whereas one‐third is due to the intermediate demand from manufacturing and resource—or merchandise—exports, so the total labor demand gain due to merchandise exports was 3.7 million jobs. In comparison, U.S. merchandise imports from China led to reduced demand of 1.4 million jobs in manufacturing and 0.6 million in services (with small losses in resource industries), with total job losses of 2.0 million. It follows that the expansion in U.S. merchandise exports relative to imports from China over 1995–2011 created net demand for about 1.7 million jobs. Comparing the growth of U.S. merchandise exports to merchandise imports from all countries, we find a fall in net labor demand due to trade, but comparing the growth of total U.S. exports to total imports from all countries, then there is a rise in net labor demand because of the growth in service exports.
F60|Aggregating From Micro to Macro Patterns of Trade|We develop a new framework for aggregating from micro to macro patterns of trade. We derive price indexes that determine comparative advantage across countries and sectors and the aggregate cost of living. If firms and products are imperfect substitutes, we show that these price indexes depend on variety, average demand/quality and the dispersion of demand/quality-adjusted prices, and are only weakly related to standard empirical measures of average prices, thereby providing insight for elasticity puzzles. Of the cross-section (time-series) variation in comparative advantage, 50 (90) percent is accounted for by variety and average demand/quality, with average prices contributing less than 10 percent.
F60|The profit rate and asset-price inflation in the Spanish economy|The measure of capital profitability in the Spanish economy is relevant because of both a process of capital accumulation since mid-nineties largely driven by asset-price inflation, as well as the deep economic crisis since late 2008. Therefore, in this article a comparative analysis is carried out using different databases and measures of the rate of profit, incorporating the financial sphere and addressing other different countries of the Eurozone. It shows the scope of the underlying valorization crisis in relation to previous decades and in terms of its fall experienced during the years not only of the housing boom, but also throughout the subsequent recession. In addition, this drop in profitability stands out in relation to other economies of the European periphery. Hence, this analysis puts the rate of profit at the center of the debate on the Great Recession in Spain, despite its absence in much of the economic literature, including heterodox approaches.
F60|Skills, technical change and local labor markets: evidence from France 1990-2011|A skill-biased labor demand shift occurred in France, as well as other developed economies, over the last 20 years. We test one of the main hypothesis that explain this particular shift : a skill-biased technical change driven by the dissemination of Information and Communication Technologies and the automatisation of routine jobs, leading to their disappearance in favor of high-skilled jobs and low-skilled service jobs. Using a theoretical model developed by Autor and Dorn (2013), based on the analysis of the employment structure of local labor markets to identify national effects of technical change, we find evidence of a link between technical change and the 1990-2011 evolution of the labor force in France. In particular, we find that the low-skilled jobs switch from routine jobs to service jobs or unemployment. We also find that the labor demand shift interacts with a spatial functional specialization. These results are robust to the introduction of alternative hypothesis, such as globalization and international trade growth, or demographic changes.
F60|How policies shape global food and agriculture value chains|Global value chains (GVCs) have changed the nature of production and specialisation around the world, including in agriculture and food sectors. This study takes an in-depth look at the landscape of agro-food GVCs and explores the factors that influence GVC participation by making use of a newly developed database on trade in value added for 20 agro-food sectors derived from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database. The study also explores the benefits of GVC participation, viewed through the lens of domestic value added creation and employment, with a focus on the policy factors that influence these benefits. The study points to considerable variation in GVC participation across agro-food sectors, driven not only by product characteristics but also by policy factors related to trade and investment, the agricultural enabling environment and policies influencing service markets. The study shows that for agro-food sectors, trade barriers act as a tax on exports, reducing the domestic value added created from participation in agro-food GVCs.
F60|A method for estimating global trade in value added within agriculture and food value chains|Global Value Chains (GVCs) have transformed production across a broad range of goods and services worldwide. Although the development of GVCs has occurred in agro-food sectors alongside other sectors, less is known about the trade that occurs within agro-food GVCs due to limited information on flows of trade in value added. This study develops an approach to calculate disaggregated indicators of GVC participation in agro-food sectors in both developed and developing countries. Specifically, the approach exploits the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database to construct an inter-country input-output (ICIO) table for the year 2011. The resulting ICIO is used to compute indicators of GVC participation based on the concept of vertical specialisation – forward and backward participation – across 20 agro-food sectors in 70 countries and/or regions. Estimates of domestic value added in exports and final demand or agro-food products, including the contribution of all industries, are also presented.
F60|The balance between investor protection and the right to regulate in investment treaties: A scoping paper|There is vigorous debate about reforms to address the balance between investor protection and the right to regulate in the over 3000 existing investment treaties. This paper first notes the growing trend to analyse particular treaty rules rather than treaties as a whole and the importance of comparative analysis of balancing under other regimes. It then outlines issues in four areas: (i) the types of regulation potentially at issue in investment treaty claims by covered investors; (ii) the types and levels of investor protection; (iii) the degree of impact of treaties on regulation; and (iv) the processes and institutions that may be involved in balancing interests in investor protection and the right to regulate. While the paper recognises that dispute resolution institutions have a significant impact on the balance and the right to regulate, it focuses primarily on substantive issues in light of other ongoing work on dispute settlement.
F60|Addressing the balance of interests in investment treaties: The limitation of fair and equitable treatment provisions to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law|The fair and equitable treatment (FET) provision has leapt to prominence in the last 15 years as the principal ground of liability at issue in many if not most investment treaty arbitration claims. In debates about the impact of investment treaties on the right to regulate, FET is second only to investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) as the most-cited provision. This paper examines government action to address the balance between investor protection and the right to regulate by limiting fair and equitable treatment provisions to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law (MST-FET). The paper reviews the distinction between MST-FET clauses and autonomous FET clauses, and notes growing use of an express MST-FET approach in many regions. NAFTA governments’ views about the nature of the MST-FET standard, how it is identified, and its content are then examined in detail. An initial focus on NAFTA, while limited, is justified due to many singularities in NAFTA, including numerous government interpretations of MST-FET since 1994, their availability to the public and the comparatively higher success rate of NAFTA governments in defending FET claims. The paper concludes with brief comparisons between the government views and the views of ISDS tribunals and commentators.
F60|The global income distribution for high-income countries|This paper presents the global income distribution between all individuals living in the developed world. Global inequality for the group of high-income countries, as measured by the Gini coefficient, stands at 37 in 2013 and has increased by almost 3 Gini points since the mid-1990s. This was mainly driven by top 10% incomes growing more than middle and lower incomes and the bottom 10% falling behind. Rising inequality within the United States drives almost half of the inequality increase among high-income countries, a combination of a sizeable rise in inequality and a population share around a third in the sample. The broad global middle in high-income countries, located from the 10th to the 90th percentile, experienced strikingly similar disposable income growth, but at a very slow annualised rate around 0.5%. Robustness analyses show that this low-growth result is sensitive to declining real incomes in Japan and that scaling micro-based incomes to national accounts means, to include in-kind transfers such as healthcare and educational services, lifts measured household income growth substantially. Finally, the paper delivers a methodological contribution by decomposing the global growth incidence curve into within- and between-country components, allowing for a more granular assessment of the development than is possible by decomposing inequality indices. The decomposition shows that between-country income differences contributed little to growing inequality in the group of high-income countries.
F60|Services and Performance of the Indian Economy: Analysis and Policy Options|This paper highlights India’s unique services export led growth path. Observing that Indian business services have helped manufacturers all over the world to become more efficient and productive, it raises the question how Indian business services can do the same for local manufacturers and thus support the Make in India initiative. The paper also explores the potential for broadening the export base in services. The services sector that appears to have the largest prospect for unleashing the potential of both manufacturing and knowledge intensive business services is the telecommunications sector, particularly broadband internet services. In addition reforms in the distribution sector that enable multi-channel wholesale and retailing could facilitate the development of marketing channels for SME manufacturers both across the vast Indian market and abroad. Reforms in the logistics sector would further improve the competitiveness of local manufacturers producing time-sensitive goods including inputs to global value chains. Finally, competitiveness in knowledge-intensive services is obtained through knowledge sharing across borders. A prerequisite for broadening the export base in these sectors is openness to foreign professionals. The set of proposed recommendations emerging from this analysis underlines the importance of streamlining sector-level regulatory frameworks in all sectors to encourage foreign entry and competition, and the role that cross-cutting improvements in the trade and business environment would play to render services providers as well as down-stream manufacturers more competitive.
F60|GVC Participation and Economic Transformation: Lessons from three sectors|Integration into Global value chains (GVCs) provides opportunities for economic growth and development. However, the nature and extent of these opportunities differ across countries and sectors, and participation in GVCs can support processes of economic transformation in a variety of ways depending on the type of GVC. This paper explores some of the linkages between GVC participation and economic transformation at the sectoral level, with a view to assisting countries in assessing the various policy options for maximising their comparative advantages and their benefits from GVC participation. Three aspects of the relationship between GVC participation – defined as the use of foreign intermediates and integration into international production networks – and economic transformation are explored: i) sectoral differences in upgrading dynamics; ii) the role of services; and iii) resilience to external shocks. A range of qualitative and empirical approaches are used to explore and test the robustness of the relationship for three sectors presenting different characteristics in terms of their trade dynamics and links with economic transformation: mining and quarrying; motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers; and transport and storage services.
F60|Determinants of economic fluctuations in the construction sec-tor|Awareness and ability to possibly eliminate the potentially adverse consequences of economic fluctuations can constitute an extremely important factor of the financial condition and competitive position of the company as well as the entire construction sector. Especially in the construction sector creating a catalog of fac-tors affecting economic fluctuations is important from the point of view of not only the economy but also the company. The analysis carried out in this article of situation fluctuations in the construction industry in recent years allow to specify the factors that largely determine the conditions for construction enterprises devel-opment and shaping their competitiveness. Research background: The specifics and operation conditions of enterprises including the construction sector companies cause sensitivity to economic fluctua-tions manifested in the cyclical disorders of economic activity level (business cy-cles). Background research work is to determine the effect of internal and external environment on a range of determinants of the economic situation fluctuations potentially occurring in the sphere of the construction sector. Purpose of the article: The aim of this article is to present the main factors affect-ing economic condition fluctuations in the construction sector and their impact on company operation. Methodology/methods: The following research methods and tools are used in this work: analysis and critique of literature, examination of documents, analysis and synthesis, descriptive statistics. Findings: The result of the study and documents analysis will include identifica-tion of factors affecting to the highest degree the economic fluctuations in the construction sector. These factors will be specified from among the macro-economic environment but mainly from the internal environment of the company. Developed proposals will be useful in building the short- and long-term operation strategy for both the construction companies and the entire sphere of the construc-tion sector.
F60|Global Perspective of CPEC Regarding Economic Integration and Trade Openness|There is a misconception about CPEC that this mega project is only going to benefit China and Pakistan. However, this corridor is going to restructure and transform not only South and Central Asia, but also Middle East and Europe. Unlike EU, this project is planned to link different regions for economic integration and trade. This study is to analyse the importance of CPEC for its participants and its role in enhancing the economic integration and trade openness among Asian, European and African states. Not only this, challenges and opportunities associated with this project are also been discussed in this paper.
F60|Smile Curve and its linkages with Global Value Chains|The concept and logic of ‘smile curve’ in the context of global value chains has gained importance in recent time period and discussed at the individual firm level, but rarely identified and investigated at the sectoral level using real data for cross-country analysis. Using TIVA database for 2001 and 2011 time period, several conceptual value chain are investigated including exports of Base Metals, Computer Electronics, Electrical Machinery and Transportation equipment’s in Asian Economies. This paper focuses an idea to measure both the strength and linkages between producers and consumers of global value chain. The identified smile curve provides a very intuitive understanding of the roles played by different countries in various sectors and helps in identifying the benefits gained by them through their participation in global trade. The dynamics of structural upgrading and interactive growth via trade and investment within a hierarchy of countries is aligned with “flying-geese (FG)” theory of growth. The paper also gives emphasis on the role of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in broadening economic integration.
F60|Surging Populism around the Globe: Do we see a reversal?|Populism has been a buzzword around the world today. Various recent elections in industrialized parts of the world turned out to be a hot arena of debate on surging populism and demagogues made the best use of their populist agenda to reap rich dividend in electoral mandates. Once they come into power, they retract on their populist rhetoric and act on ways that endanger the underpinnings of the very democracy that begets them. The present article tries to analyse the causes of surging populism around the world and examines a reversal trend in populism in the year 2017.
F60|Almost equi-marginal principle based composite index of globalization: China, India and Pakistan|The present study proposes an alternative method to construct an index of globalization which is based on the principle of almost equi-marginal contributions (AEMC) or Shapley values of the constituent variables to the overall index rather than the correlation coefficients among the constituent variables and the overall index (the KOF index based on the principal component scores). This has been done by minimization of the Euclidean norm of the Shapley values of the constituent variables. As an exercise, secondary time series data (1970-2013) on the measures of globalization in three different dimensions (economic, social and political) of three economies (China, India and Pakistan) have been used. A comparison of the AEMC index with the KOF index reveals that while the former is more inclusive, the latter is more elitist in matters of inclusion of the weakly correlated constituent variables in the overall (composite) index. As a consequence, the AEMC index is more sensitive than the KOF index of globalization. Both indices capture the trends in globalization in the countries under study and are highly correlated between themselves. Thus, AEMC is an alternative or perhaps a better method to construct composite indices.
F60|Globalization under hysteresis: A study of Eastern Bloc Countries, China and India|This study is concerned with a great socio-economic experiment in history that replaced the naturally evolved market economy with the humanly designed command economy to achieve a socialist triumph over capitalism, experienced a setback and ultimately returned to the market economy for managing the material aspects of the society. Efforts to open the subject economies in the aftermath of the said experiment are on the contemporary agenda worldwide. Yet, the past pulls the present causing hysteresis that thwarts the momentum of globalization. Using KOF and AEMC indices of globalization (based on KOF data 1991-2014), the paper concludes that most of the countries to the south of Russian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan) have performed rather poorly in globalization efforts. On the other hand, the countries in the north-western side of the Russian Federation (except Moldova) have on the whole performed better. In comparison, China has performed fairly while India lags behind. In spite of all proclamations, unless the political will to globalization is there, globalization cannot progress much further. However, such a political will has not been strong in India. India has remained protectionist of vested interests of politicians, industrialists, business houses and perhaps the intelligentsia, a coalition of the dominant proprietary classes that benefit from the status quo or stagnancy of the Indian economy and society. Globalization in India is under a strong spell of hysteresis on account of the pre-1991 pseudo-socialistic nostalgia as well as age-old internal contradictions.
F60|Measuring degree of globalization of African Countries on almost equimarginal contribution principle|This paper is an exercise in construction of an alternative globalization index for 43 countries in Africa. It has used a new method for measurement of the degree of globalization (or construction of a globalization index) based on minimization of the Euclidean norm of the Shapley values, the concept borrowed from the cooperative game theory. It assigns weights to constituent variables such that their mean expected marginal contribution to the synthetic index is as equitable as possible. Since this index is based on combinatorial logic, it is also less likely to be affected by outlier data points. Globalization index for 43 African countries (for a time series of 45 years, 1970-2014) has been constructed. The new index has been compared with the KOF index of globalization for the countries under study. As its validation, it has been found that the index has stronger correlation (vis-à-vis the KOF index) with Human Development index, Corruption Perception index, Freedom index and the indicators of abject poverty in the African countries. Viewed as such the new index represents globalization closely in connection with other relevant socio-economic measures than its rival (KOF index of globalization) as well as it is based on more plausible theoretical premises based on marginal contribution rather than correlation.
F60|Trends in globalization of select Asian countries|In this study we have constructed a composite index of globalization of select Asian countries during 1970-2014 by minimizing the Euclidean norm of Shapley values of indicator variables contributing to the overall index. As a consequence, the mean expected marginal contributions of constituent variables to the overall index are approximately equal and thus, the overall composite index represents the constituent variables optimally. We call this index the Almost Equal Marginal Contribution (AEMC) index. We find that AEMC index and the KOF index of globalization are highly correlated (Pearson’s r=0.982). We find that Singapore, Cyprus, Israel, Qatar, Malaysia, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Kuwait, Bahrain and Japan have done very well and scored above 0.7. At the other end, Yemen, Tajikistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Iran, Nepal and Myanmar have scored below 0.5. Trends in globalization are increasing in general, but the rate of globalization, which accelerated after 1991, lost its momentum after 2007. Disparities in globalization, as measured by Gini coefficient over the countries under study, were more or less constant up to 1985 but after that they started declining. We have found that the index of globalization goes well with other socio-economic measures such as Economic Freedom Index, International Innovation Index, Social Progress Index, Human Development Index and Corruption Perception Index, showing high values of Kendall’s Tau and Spearman’s Rho. Its association with Democracy Index is rather weak but positive. It is almost uncorrelated with the Gender Gap Index. We observe, therefore, that globalization index is moving well with the indices of socio-economic condition in the Asian countries.
F60|European Union and Big Four’s Position Towards the 16+1 Cooperation Platform|The aim of the present paper is to investigate the position towards the 16+1 framework from the standpoint of the EU as an entity and also the four largest EU countries in terms of GDP, namely Germany, Great Britain, France and Italy. The Big Four are the main recipients of Chinese FDI and are also the most active European exporters to China, while CEE concentrates only a small share of the EU-Chinese trade and investment flows. However, the Big Four are apprehensive with regard to China’s rising competitiveness through national reform policies (such as China 2025 Program) but also via acquisition of high-tech companies. In the competition with a stronger China, these countries and especially Germany consider that the Chinese presence in CEE, alongside the proposed investment projects in infrastructure, including harbours, represent a threat to their established positions in this region and their companies will lose market shares and big infrastructure contracts. Seen from another perspective, in the literature the new framework is considered as a lobby platform, intended to influence the EU decisions through CEE players, which is incompatible with the strategic Sino-EU partnership. As a matter of fact, the EU foreign policy is incoherent in major aspects, including EU-China relation as well. Therefore our investigation focuses on three main aspects. First, we explain how the lack of harmonization between the Big Four and the other EU member states is influencing EU policy towards China. Conferring the Big Four observer status at the 16+1 summits might mitigate tensions. Second we investigate whether the Big Four detain the supremacy in the EU to the detriment of the EU periphery. Third, we underline that the EU needs a common vision towards the Eurasian cooperation, as it includes a new element: the Belt and Road Initiative. One cannot support the BRI by criticizing the 16+1, as the latter is considered by the Chinese authorities a significant component of the BRI. In conclusion, if the CEE countries become a bridge or a wall in the Chinese-EU relations depends only on the ability of all actors to have a balanced relationship with each other.
F60|Selling Souls: An Empirical Analysis of Human Trafficking and Globalization|Purpose: This paper investigates the impact of globalization on human trafficking using a large panel data set of 169 countries from 2001 to 2011. Design/Methodology/Approach: This study explores the contribution of economic, social and political globalization in the trafficking of humans for forced prostitution, forced labor, debt bondages and child soldiers. Moreover, the study investigates the impact of globalization on source (supply) and destination (demand) of human trafficking. This study uses Probit and Oprobit models of panel data for empirical analysis. Findings: Findings of the study show that globalization facilitates human trafficking, particularly, forced prostitution, forced labor and debt bondages while it helps to suppress the demand and supply of child soldiers. The empirical analysis also reveals that these are the mostly poor countries which serve as source of human trafficking while the rich countries are destination of trafficked victims. Research Limitations: The data series over a long period are not available and therefore the sample size is small. Originality/Value: This research paper contributes into the literature on human trafficking and globalization by highlighting the heterogeneity of source and destiny economies in shaping the links of globalization with human trafficking. To the best of our knowledge, it is first study of its kind that provides an empirical analysis of source and destiny of human trafficking with globalization. Moreover, this study considers different dimensions of globalization and human trafficking. Implications: The main message of this research is that as globalization proceeds, human trafficking increases. Therefore, the governments of developing economies need to improve socioeconomic conditions to provide basic necessities of life at home country and the governments of developed countries need to implement strong rule of the law to discourage such practices. Our study is useful in offering insights to policy makers that how to avoid the perils of globalization.
F60|Government-sponsored labour-market training and output growth - cyclical, structural and globalization influences|Empirical work on the effects of government-sponsored labour-market training programs (LTPs) has been largely focused on the unemployment-exit and employment-entry probabilities of program participants using micro-level data. This paper seeks to add to the current literature by providing broad cross-country evidence on whether or not additional public-sector resources allocated to LTPs contributes to raising output growth and per-capita incomes. Using data from OECD countries during 1989-2009 and GMM estimation, we find evidence suggesting that on average labour-market training programs are growth-enhancing. The positive growth-effect of LTP-spending is found to be stronger the more favourable are business-cycle conditions, the larger is the magnitude of structural shocks at country level and the greater is the scale of opening-up of markets at the global level.
F60|Gross versus value added trade balances of the Central and Eastern European countries|The making available in the early 2010s of databases containing world input-output tables (e.g. WIOD) was a significant advancement in research on international trade. It allowed to compile statistics of value added flows between countries. The concept ?trade in value added? accounts for the value added of one country directly and indirectly contained in final consumption of another country. The typical question would be: How much value added of other countries is contained in the consumption of the country under examination?. The trade statistics in value added term eliminate the multiple calculation of such goods in trade ? first as components (intermediate goods) and then as parts of final goods. Thus, those statistics are better to assess the benefits derived by particular countries from foreign trade. The aim of this paper is to present changes of trade balances in bilateral trade of the Central and Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia ? CEECs) in 1995-2011. The illustration of these changes is based on trade statistics both in value added terms and in gross terms. The data are downloaded from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD Release 2013). The research study shows that trade deficits and trade surpluses when measured in value added terms tend to become smaller as compared to gross trade figures. The key to understanding of this pattern is trade in intermediates. The differences between trade balances in gross and value added terms differ among the CEECs. The largest are in the Central European countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia). These countries are strong integrated with the global value chains.
F60|Global Value Chains and Structural Upgrading|Global value chains (GVCs) are increasingly seen as a part of the industrial policy toolkit as they facilitate the entry into global markets and MNEs have greater incentives to share knowledge within their production network. Making use of international input-output data for 53 countries, this paper investigates econometrically how countries’ participation in GVCs affects structural upgrading. A sizeable structural change bonus arising from increasing GVC trade is identified for emerging and transition economies. However, this bonus is not stronger for GVC trade than for trade in general. Therefore, the role of GVCs as an industrial policy tool should not be overestimated.
F60|Culture and International Business|National culture is still an important factor in managing a wide spectrum of areas and forms of international business. The understanding of the concept of culture, respectively the values and practices of foreign business partners, is instrumental in achieving effective intercultural communication and international business. The notion of culture as a set of schemes and codes (culture-as-a-code) gives ground to the context dependent concept of culture (culture-in-context). Although the context dependent paradigm of culture is not a new phenomenon, the international business practice has not capitalized on its contributions yet. The paper does not aim at comprehensively revealing the nature of culture and its components. The focus is on those issues which have proved its significance for international business practice. The thesis states that culture is dynamically enfolded in international business practice and its specific context. That’s why contemporary international business players should be knowledgeable about both the traditional postulates about the culture factor and the dynamic aspects of cultural, including intercultural, matters. On the basis of a literature review and analytical reasoning, the paper strives to shed light on the topical debate on culture and its implications for international business.
F60|L’insertion commerciale de la France mesurée en valeur ajoutée|La mesure des échanges en valeur ajoutée fait apparaître que, contrairement à ce que disent les statistiques traditionnelles, les échanges extérieurs de la France interviennent majoritairement avec des pays non européens et que les services jouent un rôle majeur dans sa compétitivité internationale.
F60|France’s trade integration measured in value added|Measuring trade in terms of value added shows that, contrary to what traditional statistics say, France’s foreign trade takes place predominantly with non-European countries and services play a major role in its international competitiveness.
F60|Global Cycles: Capital Flows, Commodities, and Sovereign Defaults, 1815-2015|Capital flow and commodity cycles have long been connected with economic crises. Sparse historical data, however, has made it difficult to connect their timing. We date turning points in global capital flows and commodity prices across two centuries and provide estimates from alternative data sources. We then document a strong overlap between the ebb and flow of financial capital, the commodity price super-cycle, and sovereign defaults since 1815. The results have implications for today, as many emerging markets are facing a double bust in capital inflows and commodity prices, making them vulnerable to crises.
F60|Why is China Investing in Africa? Evidence from the Firm Level|China’s increased trade with and investment in Africa have boosted the continent’s economic growth but have also generated considerable controversy. In this paper we investigate China’s outward direct investment ODI in Africa using macro and micro data. The aggregate data on China’s ODI in African countries reveal that China’s share of the stock of foreign investment is small, though growing rapidly. China’s attraction to resource-rich countries is no different from Western investment. China’s overall ODI is uncorrelated with a measure of rule of law, whereas Western investment favors the better governance environments. As a result, Chinese investment in strong and weak governance environments is about the same, but its share of foreign investment is higher in the weak governance states. The micro data that we use is MOFCOM’s database on all registered Chinese firms investing in Africa between 1998 and 2012. We use key words in project descriptions to code the investments into 25 sectors. This database captures the small and medium private firms investing in Africa. Contrary to common perceptions, there are few projects in natural resource sectors. Most projects are in services, with a significant number in manufacturing as well. In our country-sector-level regressions based on firms’ transaction-level data, we find that Chinese ODI, both horizontal and vertical, is profit-driven, just like investors from other countries. In particular, our regressions show that Chinese ODI is relatively more concentrated in skill-intensive sectors in skill-abundant countries, but in capital-intensive sectors in capital-scarce countries. These patterns are mostly observed in politically unstable countries, suggesting stronger incentives to seek profits in tougher environments. The predominance of Chinese ODI in services appears to be widespread across host countries, independent of host countries’ market size and trade costs, but is negatively correlated with their skill abundance.
F60|The European Neighbourhood Policy : One Policy, Two Neighbourhoods|"The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) was launched in 2003 and implemented in 2004 by the European Union (EU) to create an area of prosperity, stability, security and economic cooperation with neighboring countries, with the objective of avoiding the emergence of new dividing lines between the enlarged EU and its neighbors. Indeed, this policy has been implemented immediately after 2004 enlargement to avoid the emergence of ""new dividing lines"" with neighbouring countries. It supposes the application of the same approach applied for countries applying for membership become then member of the EU to prepare the countries of the Eastern region to an eventual membership. This approach confirms the orientation of this policy for the Eastern neighborhood. It has been more active in this region than in the southern Mediterranean region, mainly due to the presence of a geostrategic concurrency with Russia."
F60|Primera globalización económica y las raíces de la inequidad social en México|En este artículo se da a conocer la dinámica de la economía mexicana durante la segunda mitad del siglo XIX, periodo que se le conoce como la “primera globalización”. En este periodo, el país avanzó económicamente, lo que se refleja en el crecimiento de la población, de las ciudades y de la renta, al propio tiempo que aumentaría considerablemente la actividad del sector externo. Sin embargo, al mismo tiempo, se abre una clara brecha entre el crecimiento de la economía en términos macroeconómicos y la escasa repartición de la riqueza en amplios sectores de la sociedad, así que el hilo conductor de este artículo es el analizar cómo es que a pesar de este desarrollo económico, se creó un modelo económico basado en – y es una herencia aún vigente en el México contemporáneo- grandes desigualdades sociales que traen como consecuencia la ausencia de elementos que permiten cohesión social en el país.
F60|Rethinking economics in response to current crisis phenomena|In seven years from the eruption of a global economic crisis, a noticeable change has taken place in the approach of economists, as well as international economic organisations (i.e. IMF and the World Bank), to analysing the occurring crisis phenomena. A purpose of the article is to present transformation of views and positions of the abovementioned communities in the context of experiences in overcoming crisis and of the modern challenges of post-crisis economy. In this scope, the article shows changes in economic theory and policy and proposals for the new state role, especially emphasizing the significance of institutional environment for socio-economic development. The assumed research task, performed on the basis of a critical analysis of subject’s literature, serves to verify an initial hypothesis of gradual formation of new rules of the game, i.e. institutional order, in the post-crisis world, of which Poland is a part. The postulated institutional order would constitute a connection of social, economic and political aspects. The analysis conducted in the article proved an influence of occurring crisis phenomena on evolution of economic science and policy. In this area, in order to increase explanatory and predictive power of macroeconomics, it is recommended to make use of a more heterodox approach which includes taking into account the financial markets’ behavior and macroeconomic effects of income inequalities. In general, it can be stated that current revaluations in thinking about economy, although being the prerequisites for institutional change, are not of a breakthrough character, so they do not constitute critical junctures in economic development and theory. In this regard, the significance of governments’ political will is emphasized as a basic factor in resolving problems resulting from global economic crisis.
F60|The Effect of Innovation Performance on Dimensions of the Globalization|Developments such as deployment of local and nationalistic perspectives to a broader outlook of an interconnected and interdependent world with free transfer of capital, goods, and services across national frontiers are associated with Globalization phenomenon. Although globalization is not new it is used more commonly and associated with a new subject every day. Globalization is frequently associated with economic growth via expanding international trade, cross-border transfer of financial resources, increased foreign investments, growing multinational enterprises and joint ventures. However this new world of globalization resulted in greater international competition for the countries and obliged them to be innovative in order to remain at the forefront in the global competition environment. It is generally accepted that there is a strong relationship between innovation and globalization. However globalization doesn’t influence high income and low income countries same way. Furthermore different dimensions of globalization is affected by the innovation in a different way. In this paper innovation performance of the countries and the relationship between the dimension of globalization is investigated. The data is extracted from INSEAD Innovation Indexes and KOF Globalization Index and tested using panel regression analysis. The results have shown that except political globalization the relation connection between innovation and economic and social dimensions of globalization is significant and positive.
F60|Globalization, Financial Development and Economic Growth|Widespread globalization and integration remove the borders but this leads to an increase in the income differences among countries. Today, the evaluation process of economic growth experience of countries shows that globalization degree of the economy is also important as the financial development. This paper investigates the relationship between financial development, globalization and economic growth for the case of the countries classified according to income levels over the period 1980-2010. After considering the panel characteristics of the dataset, long-run relationships among financial development, economic growth and the other key growth factors are analyzed by dynamic ordinary least squares method. The empirical results suggest that the effective policy applications are different according to the country classifications
F60|How Globalization and Economic Growth Affect Energy Consumption: Panel Data Analysis in the Sample of Brazil, Russia, India, China Countries|This study analyzes the causality and cointegration correlation between the series using total energy consumption, economic growth, and globalization data of Brazil, Russia, India, China (BRIC) countries in 2000-2012 period. Unit roots of the series were extracted in empirical part in order to make them stationary. Then, Pedroni and Kao cointegration and Granger causality analysis panel were used. As a result of the cointegration analysis, it was observed that the series were cointegrated in the long-term. On the other hand, causality analysis results suggested a unidirectional causality correlation from total energy consumption to economic growth, and another unidirectional causality correlation from globalization to economic growth. Lastly, no causality correlation between energy consumption and globalization was found.
F60|Spatial determinants of U.S. FDI and exports in OECD countries|World foreign direct investment (FDI) flows have been characterized by an unprecedented growth over the last four decades, with an uneven distribution across countries. This paper analyzes the spatial interdependence/third-country effects of multinational enterprises (MNE) for affiliate location choice and spillover effects of foreign direct investment (FDI). We specify a simultaneous equations model estimated using the generalized spatial two-stage least squares method on a sample of 25 OECD recipient countries of U.S. FDI during the period spanning the years 1999–2009. Our results lend support to the existence of complex vertical FDI and the significance of third-country effects, which is indicative of agglomeration economies.
F60|Has Foreign Growth Contributed to Stagnation and Inequality in Japan?|This paper examines the contributions of foreign growth (particularly in China), on Japan’s domestic economic performance and inequality. While the standard approach to external sources of inequality has emphasized transmission through trade and labor markets, here the emphasis is on financial flows. We begin by exploring this link using a three factor, three sector, two-region dynamic computable general equilibrium model (CGE), in which the regions are interlinked by both trade and financial flows. To provide an empirical perspective, a lag-augmented vector autoregression (LA-VAR) and a sign restricted vector autoregression (Sign restricted VAR) are estimated. We find convincing evidence through numerical simulations that strong growth in a near neighbor not only retards domestic performance but also raises home inequality. Empirical results suggest that growth in China has a significant delayed effect in aggravating Japanese inequality and its importance in explaining Japanese inequality increases in magnitude over time.
F60|Sport u vremenu globalizacije|U ovoj knjizi težište je na prikazu prodiranja profesionalnog sporta kao gospodarske djelatnosti, koja ima sva obilježja privredne grane. Ona spaja, kako ističe dr.sc Mario Ančić, bogato akademsko iskustvo i osobnu predanost vrhunskom svjetskom sportu. U knjizi se sport gleda kroz oči ne samo vrhunskih znanstvenika, nego i sudionika velikih sportskih manifestacija. Želja autora je pokazati kako je sportska djelatnost postala dinamičan sektor ekonomije sa stopom rasta većom od prosjeka ostalih grana, što ubrzava razvoj gospodarstva u cjelini. Ova je knjiga prikazala evoluciju sporta i međusobnog odnosa sporta i društva kroz povijest te njegove promjene . Čitatelj ima mogućnost komparacije razvoja, strukture, djelatnosti i utjecaja svakog pojedinog sporta, naglašava prof.dr.sc Ivo Andrijanić, profesor emeritus, DIU Libertas. Knjiga se bavi ekonomijom sporta, pisana na znanju, iskustvu i aktivnom osobnom sudjelovanju u vrhunskom svjetskom sportu, uz prikaz biografija vrhunskih svjetskih sportaša, a povezivanje dva zasebna velika područja, gospodarstva i sporta njezina je osnovna ekonomska vrijednost, istaknuo je prof.dr.sc. Ljubo Jurčić, sa zagrebačkog Ekonomskog fakulteta. Mogli bismo ju nazvati i svojevrsnom malom enciklopedijom jer u njoj se nalazi pregled BDP strukture svjetskog proizvoda, životopisi najpoznatijih svjetskih i hrvatskih sportaša, lista najpoznatijih svjetskih managera te pregled sportova po važnosti i težini . Vrlo su kvalitetne analize kao i statistički podaci koji čitatelju pojašnjavaju način djelovanja velikih sportskih organizacija te fenomen sporta kao jednog od vrlo važnih čimbenika gospodarstva. Spomenuti su i dobitnici medalja te sportski rekordi, a obrađen je i fenomen uključivanja sportaša u razne grane gospodarstva i politike. Provedena je i opsežna razrada sportskih disciplina te njihova vrijednost na gospodarskom tržištu. Posebno je poglavlje posvećeno i Olimpijskim igrama, koje su od amaterskog natjecanja prerasle u ozbiljan događaj koji generira znatan novac.
F60|Globalization of World Economy|"This article addresses a whole evolution of the European integration - deepening, broadening, reforming, relations with third parties - precisely from this perspective of the efforts to obtain more important positions in the global competition. Used after the 1950s, the term globalization is present in all major languages of the world, be it the ""globalization"" for the English speakers, ""mondialisation"" for the French speakers, ""globalizzazione"" for the Italian speakers, ""Globlisierung"" for the German speakers or ""Quan Quai Hua"" for the Chinese speakers. The global attribute has a common use in phrases like ""global market"", ""global institutions"", ""global communications"". The widespread use of the term, both in everyday language and in the academic world, is produced since about the 1970s. However, the emergence of the industrial capitalism also marks the presence in the intellectual discourses of the references to a series of events similar to those that today retain the attention in the globalization context: the reduction of time and space as a result of the evolution and the development of transportation and communication, which substantially increases the possibilities of human interaction. It is, however, difficult to trace the border between cause and effect in terms of the globalization process. The world economies evolutions in regards to the trade, production, finances, led on one hand to the global nature of the economy and, on the other hand have influenced and boosted each other."
F60|The impact of Chinese competition on Africa’s manufacturing|In this paper, the impact of Chinese competition on Africa’s manufacturing value added is analyzed through a model of manufacturing. Using panel data on 44 African countries covering the period 2000 to 2013, and controlling for the usual determinants of industrialization – such as the size of the domestic market, the quality of infrastructure and governance – we find that exports of manufactured goods by China and other countries to African countries mainly exert a negative effect on African manufacturing, while a moderate real appreciation of African currencies vis-à-vis the renminbi positively influences manufacturing value added, probably due to the reduced cost of imported machine and transport equipment from China (which accounted for 36% of total African imports from China in 2013) and to the reduced price of imported consumption goods increasing the remuneration of poor workers and therefore improving their productivity. However, a strong real appreciation (of more than 33%) instead exerts a negative effect on African’s manufacturing, as traditional theory predicts.
F60|The Rise of Exporting by U.S. Firms|In this note, we summarize the motivation and results of Lincoln and McCallum (2015), which investigates the factors supporting globalization by focusing on the experience of the United States.3 Along with the well-known expansion of export volumes, we document a significant increase in the prevalence of U.S. firms selling abroad. Using a firm level dataset and empirical model to identify the key determinants of U.S. firms' participation in export markets, we uncover that the development of the internet, new trade agreements, and growth in foreign income were important forces behind increased export participation. Declines in barriers to entry, exchange rate movements, and the fall of the Soviet Union, in contrast, all played small roles. In so doing, we provide a better understanding of the factors giving impetus to the recent increase in globalization.
F60|The Rise of Exporting By U.S. Firms|Although a great deal of ink has been spilled over the consequences of globalization, we do not yet fully understand the causes of increased worldwide trade. Using confidential microdata from the U.S. Census, we document widespread entry into countries abroad by U.S. firms from 1987 to 2006. We show that this extensive margin growth is unlikely to have been due to significant declines in entry costs. We instead find evidence of large roles for the development of the internet, trade agreements, and foreign income growth in driving these trends.
F60|Linking Services to Manufacturing Exports|In this paper we analyse the interplay between services and manufacturing. This is done through identifying and quantifying a direct link between manufacturing exports and the sales by service providers. For identification of this transmittance mechanism, with the help of highly detailed geographic data, we create a Localised Export Exposure (LEE) variable that captures the variation in demand for service inputs based on nearby exporters. Since service firms are much less geographically specialised than manufacturing firms, we observe a high variation in their exposure to demand changes. This spatial variation in the demand for service inputs results from a variation in local export volumes (LEE); which is used to assess the interplay between manufacturing exports and services. Our results show that a 1% increase in exports increases the volume of sales of service firms by 0.2% (and employment within the firm by 0.06%). The results show also that the link is highly local and the strongest impact is within 20 km of the shock.
F60|Nation Branding in the XXI century – A Conceptual Approach|In a more and more globalized world, countries must make high efforts to differentiate between them and to create a competitive advantage. Given the economic development at present, no country can afford to remain isolated from the world economy and should make consistent efforts to adapt quickly. The market became almost homogenous and that’s why nations must explore every niche they find. But in order to be successful they need to make those niches relevant to the consumers. And one of the ways to do this is through nation branding. The aim of this paper is to analyze the steps which led to nation branding and to explain the concept by making a review of one of the most important authors who studied this phenomenon. What is nation branding? How this concept appeared and why countries should brand themselves instead of allowing the stereotypes to define them completely are the questions that this article tries to answer.
F60|Upstreamness in the Global Value Chain: Manufacturing and Services|This paper investigates gupstreamness, h which measures the distance of an industry from the final use in terms of the number of production stages, using the WIOD global input-output tables, which cover 40 major countries. We find that global upstreamness increased in the mid -2000s. This trend is mainly due to developments in the manufacturing sector, but the service sector also contributed to the increase. In manufacturing, upstreamness has increased mainly in East Asian economies including Japan, which is consistent with the recent deepening of global value chains in this area. In services, the growing role of business services contributed to the deepening of value chains, such as outsourcing via leasing and staff agencies, and linkages to new businesses through mobile telecommunications. In further research, the concept of upstreamness can be applied to the analysis of industries f international competitiveness and of the influence of demand shocks across countries.
F60|GGlobal Value Chains assessment in the 2000s: an approach with income transfers|In this paper, we make use of recent data published by the World Input-Output Database to (i) measure the degree of total and net “transferred” gains of major Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)-member countries and emerging economies by being part of a Global Value Chain (GVC) with two incomerelated indicators built for this purpose and (ii) capture whether the bilateral degree of GVC insertion of this group of countries, measured with the proposed indicators, contributes to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows in the 2000s. The pooled regression model estimated shows that bilateral FDI inflows, controlling for other possible FDI determinants, are positively associated to the total “transferred” income generated by GVC-induced bilateral trade of inputs, taken as a proxy to the degree of GVC-embeddedness of those countries, while correlation with GVC-associated net gains was not confirmed. The regression also shows the negative impact of the global financial crisis of 2008-9 and the significant role played by the People’s Republic of China on FDI inflows. Key Words : Globalization, Global Value Chains, Foreign Direct Investment, Pooledregression model
F60|The Export Performance of the 2004 EU Enlargement Economies since the 1990s: a Constant Market Share Analysis|Abstract This study focuses on the export performance of the 2004 European Union (EU) enlargement economies to the EU15 between 1990 and 2013. The long time span analysed allows to capture different stages in the relationship of these new members with the EU before and after accession. The study is based on the constant market share methodology of decomposing an ex-post country’s export performance into different effects. Two constant market share analyses were selected in order to disentangle (i) the growth rate of exports and (ii) the growth rate of exports relatively to the world. Both approaches are applied to manufactured products grouping products in different classifications of sectors. Results provide information on export performance for the ten economies individually considered, including the importance of each EU15 destination market.
F60|The Beveridge Curve in the OECD. Before and after the great recession|This paper analyses the Beveridge Curve across nine OECD countries from 1985 to 2012. Besides allowing for some customary labour-market institutions, we assess the role of various kinds of structural factors (technological progress, globalisation, oil prices) and of the current recession on the Curve. Significant institutional variables include unemployment benefits, the tax wedge, active labour-market policies and employment protection legislation (the latter improving the unemployment-vacancies trade-off). Technological progress (R&D intensity) shifts the Curve outwards, producing evidence in support of a creative destruction effect. Globalisation and unfavourable oil price shocks also shift the Curve outwards. Structural relationships seem to be stable throughout the 2008-2012 period, suggesting that the Great Recession mainly implied moves along the Curve.
F60|Cadenas globales de valor y generación de valor añadido: El caso de la economía española|Following Koopman, Wang and Wei (2014) and using the data and indicators derived from the international input-output tables of the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), this paper addresses the participation of the Spanish economy and its sectors in GVCs during the period 1995-2011 and its implications for the value-added content of trade. The analysis reveals the increasing integration of the country in GVCs and the heterogeneity between manufacturing and services in their degree of international fragmentation and its contribution to value-added. The importance of sectors heavily dependent on foreign inputs and the relatively low share of exports in GDP limit the capacity of the external sector to stimulate a sustained recovery. Siguiendo la metodología propuesta por Koopman, Wang y Wei (2014) y a partir del banco de datos generado en base a las tablas input-output internacionales de la World Input-Output Database (WIOD), el trabajo analiza la integración de la economía española y sus distintos sectores en las cadenas globales de valor (CGV) a lo largo del periodo 1995-2011, así como las implicaciones de su especialización en la generación de valor añadido. El análisis refleja el avance de su integración en las CGV y la existencia de diferencias notables entre manufacturas y servicios en su grado de fragmentación internacional y aportación al valor añadido. La importancia de sectores muy dependientes de los insumos extranjeros en su estructura productiva, junto con el reducido peso de las exportaciones brutas sobre el PIB, limitan la capacidad del sector exterior de estimular la recuperación de manera sostenida.
F60|State and Governance in the Contemporary International Economic System|The end of the Cold War caused many changes in the world’s political and economic order. Under the newly reshaped world order, debate on the role of states with regard to governance of the international economic system has reached unprecedented levels, with some scholars proclaiming the end of the state and the beginning of a new era in a borderless world, and others insisting that nothing has changed with regard to the state’s role. It is obvious that, since 1991, changes in technology have greatly enhanced the volume, intensity and speed of international economic activities. In today’s highly interdependent world economy, the state’s power has indeed been transformed to meet the needs of changing international markets, but this transformation does not necessarily mean a diminishment in the power of the state. When an international crisis arises, neither private actors nor civil society organizations are called upon to solve the problem. The state as an actor appears to be turning to the economic scene these days through ongoing bail-out operations.
F60|Pulin B. Nayak, Economic Development of India|The paradigm shift in economic policy in the 1990s elicited a tremendous interest in the pace and pattern of economic development of India. Indian economic policies as also the process of her development is being closely monitored and written about by academics, global institutions, think tanks, media, political analysts and civil society within and outside the country. The development issues of erstwhile British colonies did not attract adequate academic attention for the most part of the twentieth century. A four volume compendium of 75 papers giving a comprehensive account of the development process of the Indian economy by Pulin Nayak is a timely and valuable contribution to the pool of studies being carried out on India in different parts of the globe. Introduction to the four volume book reflects the scholarship of the author, which will be of immense academic value to anyone who is interested in the historical backdrop of the development path chosen by the Indian leaders after Independence of the country in 1947. It builds on the discourse of development economics for low income countries.
F60|Egalitarian Policies, Effective Demand, and Globalization: Considering Budget Constraint|This paper examines the effectiveness of redistribution policies under budget constraint considering government spending for the productivity improvement as Bowles (2012) and effective demand based on Abe (2015). It shows that an asset-based redistribution policy is not always effective under effective demand and budget constraint. However, the increase of effective demand because of income distribution improves employment, labor productivity, and wage rates because of increased government spending for productivity improvement as the results of saving rate from profit income show.
F60|Real Exchange Rates and Growth|This paper empirically investigates the impact of real exchange rates (RER) on growth of a large number of advanced (AE) and developing economies (DE) by employing the recent non-stationary panel data estimation procedures to estimate conventional growth models augmented with global financial and monetary conditions variables. Our results suggest that, the expansionary depreciation findings for DE are often based on a misinterpretation of an error correction mechanism coefficient. We find that external variables representing global financial and monetary conditions are strongly significant in explaining growth in DE along with the conventional variables including trade openness, human capital, domestic savings. Our data support the view that RER depreciations are contractionary for DE with high external debt and expansionary for AE. Higher trade openness enhances the contractionary impact of RER depreciations in both AE and DE. These results are found to be robust for different RER and per capita real income measures.
F60|Participation of Turkey in Global Value Chains: An Analysis Based on World Input Output Database|This study examines the trends in Turkey’s participation in Global Value Chains (GVCs), particularly through backward integration (i.e. vertical specialization-VS or the foreign content of value added in exports) between 1995 and 2011 utilizing the World Input Output Database (WIOD), and this is the first attempt to adopt WIOD for analyzing VS in Turkish exports at sectoral and trade partner dimensions. The findings show that Turkey’s VS has increased between 1995 and 2011. Considering the sectoral trends in manufacturing with respect to technological classification, especially in the 2000’s, Turkey’s VS share in mid-high and high-tech sectors has increased faster than that in mid-low as well as low tech sectors. At individual partner level, Germany, China, Italy and France play important roles in VS of Turkish exports. Although Germany sustained the largest contribution to Turkey’s VS up to 2010, in 2010 China became the top contributing country; however this contribution is chiefly in a low-tech industry such as textiles, thus is not necessarily conducive to Turkey’s upgrading her position in GVCs. In that respect, integration into the GVCs through technology-intensive sectors via the technology imported from developed countries might better help improve Turkey’s position in the world markets.
F60|Asymmetric Convergence in Globalization? Findings from a Disaggregated Analysis|Using the KOF index of globalization that allows for the multidimensionality of the process, the paper sets out to examine the presence of convergence among countries in the three dimensions of the globalization process: economic, social, political. The sample used in the empirical investigation consists of 111 countries and covers the period 1971–2011. To allow for differences in the speed of convergence, countries were clustered into four income groups: high, upper middle, lower middle and low income in line with the World Bank’s classification. The results yielded and reported herein point to an asymmetric process of convergence with different speeds both between groups as well as in the different dimensions of globalization.
F60|Effects Of The Intercultural Dialogue In Tourism|This paper is based on the assumption that the intercultural dialogue is a successful communicative form not only in view of its communicative value, but also in view of the effects resulting from the relationships that derive from it. The intercultural dialogue has an essential role to play in the sphere of international tourism whereby its undeniable positive influence can hardly be treated in a single study or report. This paper focuses on one part of the successful impact due to intercultural dialogue in tourism which becomes clearly manifest through the intercultural competence and the development of intercultural tourist competence, the enhancing intercultural sensitivity in tourism, the improvement of the processes of intercultural adaptation of tourists and the minimization of the impact of culture shock in tourism. These four main effects ensue from a more comprehensive survey in the sphere of recreational tourism in Bulgaria encompassing different target groups of foreign tourists of several nationalities.
F60|The Processes of Globalization for Emerging Markets and Growth Prospects|The processes of globalization are in today's global economy remarkably intense. This is one of the key characteristic traits of one particular market category - emerging markets, which are characterized by their rapid economic growth. In this globalization environment they are faced with new challenges for finding economic growth. In this line of thought, the goal of this article is to shed light on the implications that globalization has on emerging markets and to provide a practical solutions for their future eco­nomic growth. The subjects of this article are the globalization processes in emerging mar­kets and the obstacles emerging markets face in their economic growth. The task at hand is to present globalization in its current form – the processes of globalization are interlinked with the macroeconomic condi­tions necessary for emerging market growth. Additionally, we are observing a globalization which is associated with the rapid expansion of world trade and the larger inflows from direct investment. Secondly, globalization in its present form leads to restructuring in many companies. In conclusion, the goal of this article is to show that the key to economic growth in emerging markets are technological growth, institutional reform and financial independence.
F60|On the cultural profile of project management|The dominance of technical over the behavioral elements of projects is considered as a failure factor in project management (PM). Projects are not just a technocratic solution but also a social system. Thus, the practice of PM, viewed as an overall management approach, is a function of technical competences of PM but also of the presence and development of certain cultural values among the people in the organization. As far as the origin of modern PM comes from Western management culture, the extent of transferability of “Western” PM knowledge in the practice of other countries, whose national cultural peculiarities differ from the Western ones, is questionable. At the same time professional PM training might be instrumental in changing work values as required by the professional PM culture. In addition to national and professional culture, other cultural layers also play a role, for example organizational culture, and personality characteristics of the individual - participant in international projects. It is the responsibility of the very project manager to judge the ratio of influence which various cultural layers exert on the management of each single project. The article aims at assisting international project managers in their judgment about the cultural profile of the projects, they are responsible for.
F60|Measuring the Unequal Gains from Trade|Individuals that consume different baskets of goods are differentially affected by relative price changes caused by international trade. We develop a methodology to measure the unequal gains from trade across consumers within countries. The approach requires data on aggregate expenditures and parameters estimated from a nonhomothetic gravity equation. We find that trade typically favors the poor, who concentrate spending in more traded sectors. JEL Codes: D63, F10, F60.
F60|Home Bias, an Academic Puzzle|Only 16% (23%) of all empirical studies published in the top four (fourteen) Finance journals examine non-US markets, a fraction that is well below measures reflecting their economic importance. This “home bias” measure fluctuates across years with a weakly declining trend. There is also a “foreign bias” in which some non-US countries are more frequently the subject of published papers than others. I am able to explain only a small fraction of either the home-bias or the foreign-bias puzzles. Surprisingly, there are on average 2.01 higher annual cumulative citations per non-US paper published relative to cohort-matched US-focused papers.
F60|About Political Change in Greece|There have been almost 40 years after the restoration of democracy in Greece and a peculiar prosperity, which was consciously cultivated by the leaders of political and economic elites, was promoted before the onset of the financial crisis. However, from the beginning of the financial recession, the temporal illusions have been revealed and the need of a complete transformation of the financial policies has been expressed, while a significant transformation of the entire political culture has started. Parties such as SYRIZA, Independent Greeks(ANEL) and Golden Dawn took advantage of the growing social discontent by propagating their selves as exponents of ordinary people and of their concerns or their fears, as the expression of resistance against an avoidable sellout of public values. However, crisis has exposed a number of successive truths which were elaborately hiding in the underbelly of the detaining political and socioeconomic system. These truths were exteriorized once it became clear that the foundations on which the Greek society was based after the restoration of democracy, were weak and insufficient to guide the country’s way towards a modern future.
F60|Chinese And African Migrant Entrepreneur’s Articulation Shaped By African Agency|Much has been written on the relationship of China and Africa in the past decade. However, the subject of Chinese migrant entrepreneurs in Africa and their articulation with African counterparts was little explored up to the early 2010s. Apparently, this research gap has been closed, as shown by four publications in recent years: three edited volumes and one monography, focusing on this subject. In view of early prejudices on the passive or even disapproving reception of Chinese migrants by Africans, the state of the art underlines the importance and scope of African agency vis à vis Chinese migrant entrepreneurs in Africa.

F60|الأسباب الإقتصادية لتنامي ظاهرة الإرهاب في إفريقيا جنوب الصحراء<BR>[Economic Causes of Terrorism in Africa South of the Sahara]|The success of any long term strategy to fight terrorism need to be depend on a deep understanding of the real economic, social and political causes of this phenomenon. In this Paper I try to find out the economic causes that push individuals to engage and participate in those acts. Contrary to what was settled that poverty, unemployment and inadequate education is the suitable environment for raising terrorism, it was found that members of terrorist groups usually descending from middle to high income families with high educational level, members of ISIS in some African and Arab countries couldn’t be classified as poor or illiterate personal. This paper aim to identify the economic causes of terrorism in 35 African countries depending on two hypotheses: the Economic Relative Deprivation hypothesis and Immiserizing Modernization hypothesis, using Generalized Least Square (GLS) Method. The main result of the analysis is favouring the Immiserizing Modernization hypothesis.
F60|On the Geography of Global Value Chains|This paper develops a multi-stage general-equilibrium model of global value chains (GVCs) and studies the specialization of countries within GVCs in a world with barriers to international trade. With costly trade, the optimal location of production of a given stage in a GVC is not only a function of the marginal cost at which that stage can be produced in a given country, but is also shaped by the proximity of that location to the precedent and the subsequent desired locations of production. We show that, other things equal, it is optimal to locate relatively downstream stages of production in relatively central locations. We also develop and estimate a tractable, quantifiable version of our model that illustrates how changes in trade costs affect the extent to which various countries participate in domestic, regional or global value chains, and traces the real income consequences of these changes.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F60|Global inequality of class to the country of residence of the proletarians to migrants<BR>[Глобальное Неравенство: От Классовой Принадлежности К Стране Проживания, От Пролетариев К Мигрантам]|The inequality between the citizens of the world in the XIX century, at least half could be attributed to the difference in income between workers and owners of capital in a particular country. The real income of workers in most countries was about the same low level. That is what was the basis for the widespread acceptance of Marxism. After more than 150 years old, at the beginning of the XXI century, the situation changed dramatically: over 80% of global differences in income due to a significant gap between the average income in different countries, and the wages of unskilled workers in rich and poor countries often differ on the order. This is due to a new global political problem of migration, because the difference in income between the countries makes the migration extremely beneficial to the individual. The main problem of the near future will be to find an answer to this new challenge - assuming migration recognition of one of the most effective tools for reducing global poverty and inequality.
F60|FDI in Central and Eastern Europeâ€™s (CEE) Agribusiness|Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) had adopted restricted industrialization policy until 1990. The economic and social transition started after 1990, providing free atmosphere for foreign investments in CEE. Due to such interference, the early eminent countries were replaced by new eminent ones. This article examines the affirmative as well as unimpressed role of foreign direct investment (FDI) in agribusiness in CEE during 1990sâ€“2000s. Like CEE, India was also a restricted economy until 1991. As a part of continuing reforms, India has recently allowed a bulk of FDI in agribusiness sectors which have prompted farmers and local industrialists to raise their voice against such decision. Agriculture, being a livelihood of major population, needs a better farmâ€“firm link through investment. Evidence from the CEE has proved many positive outcome of FDI. However, India cannot ignore some eccentric lessons from CEE.
F60|Globalization and Violence against Women: The Missing Girls of India|Globalization of the economies has long been hailed as an apparatus that generates and maintains a level-playing field for both genders. It is argued that freer the markets become, the higher will be the opportunities for women to be empowered. Therefore, women will be more enlightened economically and will gain agency. As various forms of violence against women do not show any sign of decline, this article asks a fundamental question about the role of globalization. We examine whether the forces of globalization inadvertently play the role of an ally in the rise of violence against women. This article focuses on an extreme form of gender violence, namely, female foeticide, in India to show how the access to cheap technology may enhance such violence. JEL: J16, F60, F69
F60|Developing or Under-developing? Implications of Chinaâ€™s â€˜Going outâ€™ for Late Development|Since the turn of the century, Chinaâ€™s influence on world development has increased enormously. This paper seeks to analyse major attributes of the influence of Chinaâ€™s â€œgoing outâ€ , centring on the argument that the influence has been in the main conducive to the rest of the developing world. Specifically, this paper offers a critique of relevant, popular theses such as â€œChinaâ€™s neoliberalization crowds out world developmentâ€ , â€œChina under-cuts the conditions of the worldâ€™s working classâ€ , and â€œChina exhibits a tendency towards imperialismâ€ , etc. It is argued that, in the context of a neoliberal world economy that is increasingly speculation-oriented, Chinaâ€™s production-oriented activities can be seen as an important countervailing force. Whether this China influence is to continue to be conducive to world development in the future, or to turn to become detrimental, depends critically on the broader political-economic context.
F60|Can I stay a BIT longer? The effect of bilateral investment treaties on political survival|Abstract Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) have proliferated throughout the international system. While ostensibly commercial in purpose, do BITs have domestic political ramifications? I argue that BITs affect a leader’s tenure through their effect on the property rights environment in developing countries. BITs, by segmenting a country’s property rights environment for foreign and domestic firms, reduce the incentive for foreign firms to lobby for property rights protections in the host country thus leading to a stagnating domestic property rights environment. In autocracies, a stagnating domestic property rights regime benefits domestic business elites who can continue to stymie small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The political benefits of BITs, however, decrease as a country becomes more democratic. Using a dataset of developing country leaders over the period 1965-2011, I find support for my hypothesis that BITs are associated with a decreased hazard of losing office and that the effect diminishes with higher levels of democracy. My results highlight the consequences of the legalization of global investment on the domestic political economy.
F60|Die Kosten der Flüchtlingskrise in Deutschland – eine Investition in die Zukunft?<BR>[The Costs of the Refugee Crisis in Germany – An Investment in the Future?]|Zusammenfassung In einem finanzökonomischen Modell zeigt sich, dass der „fiskalische Break-even-Point“ 2031 möglich ist. Dann könnten erstmalig die Steuern und Abgaben der erwerbstätigen die Kosten der nicht erwerbstätigen Flüchtlinge übersteigen. Der „ökonomische Break-even-Point“ kann bereits 2025 erreicht werden, wenn die Bruttowertschöpfungsbeiträge der dann erwerbstätigen Flüchtlinge die Kosten der Versorgung und Integration der nicht erwerbstätigen Flüchtlinge übersteigen. Voraussetzung sind hohe Investitionen in die individuelle Qualifizierung und eine flexible Anwendung arbeitsmarktpolitischer Instrumente.
F60|Has foreign growth contributed to stagnation and inequality in Japan?|This paper examines the contributions of foreign growth (particularly in China), on Japan's domestic economic performance and inequality. While the standard approach to external sources of inequality has emphasized transmission through trade and labor markets, here the emphasis is on financial flows. We begin by exploring this link using a three factor, three sector, two-region dynamic computable general equilibrium model (CGE), in which the regions are interlinked by both trade and financial flows. To provide an empirical perspective, a lag-augmented vector autoregression (LA-VAR) and a sign restricted vector autoregression (Sign restricted VAR) are estimated. We find convincing evidence through numerical simulations that strong growth in a near neighbor not only retards domestic performance but also raises home inequality. Empirical results suggest that growth in China has a significant delayed effect in aggravating Japanese inequality and its importance in explaining Japanese inequality increases in magnitude over time.
F60|Do open borders tempt a saint? Evidence from Schengen on crime rates in German border regions|The abolishment of passport and any other type of border controls at the German-Polish and German-Czech border in December 2007 provoked public concerns that open border would increase cross-border crime. Despite these widespread concerns, there is still little research on whether the public fears were justified. The paper evaluates the extent to which the implementation of the Schengen Agreement in Poland and the Czech Republic in 2007 affected crime rates in German regions bordering these two countries. Effects are identified by regression-adjusted difference-in-difference estimation on matched samples that allows evaluating the Schengen effects in a causal way. Preliminary results show that no significant Schengen effect can be observed for the most common types of criminal offense. This indicates that crime patterns did not change after the implementation of the Schengen Agreement in a statistically significant way. These findings suggest that in contrast to public concerns, border regions have not experienced an increase in crime as a result of Schengen. In light of the current discussion on the future of the Schengen zone and borderless Europe, this is quite an important, indicatory result.
F60|Drivers of global liquidity and global bank flows: A view from the euro area|This paper exploits a novel bank-level monthly dataset to assess the effects of global liquidity on the global flows of euro area banks. The period associated with the European sovereign debt crisis has witnessed increased growth in euro area bank claims on extra-euro area residents, against a background of contracting euro area credit supply. Controlling for bank risk, global credit demand, and price effects such as interest rate differentials and exchange rates, empirical evidence supports a range of determinants of global liquidity - including global risk, global bank equity and unconventional monetary policy in the US, UK, Japan and euro area - as drivers of the global flows of euro area banks. Moreover, regression analysis indicates heterogeneity in the influence of global liquidity on global flows across euro area bank type, defined by their balance sheet composition and country of residence (stressed versus non-stressed euro area countries). The results highlight the importance of exogenous factors as drivers of global bank flows and the potential for international leakages of unconventional monetary policy.
F60|Internationalisierung von kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen im Dienstleistungssektor im Lichte der (amtlichen) Statistik|Der Dienstleistungshandel Deutschlands hat seit 2001 erheblich zugenommen. Inwieweit KMU des Dienstleistungssektors am Dienstleistungshandel teilnehmen, war bisher unklar. Unsere Analysen zeigen, dass zwar nur 14% dieser KMU exportieren, sie aber anteilsmäßig stärker zum Exportvolumen des Sektors beitragen als KMU im Verarbeitenden Gewerbe. Dienstleistungen werden vor allem zwischen Unternehmen bzw. innerhalb von multinationalen Konzernen gehandelt, z. B. Nutzungsrechte für geistiges Eigentum oder FuE-Ergebnisse. In den Wirtschaftsabteilungen Verkehr, Handel und unternehmensbezogene Dienstleistungen erzielt ein exportierendes KMU im Schnitt 20% des Jahresumsatzes mit dem Auslandsgeschäft.
F60|Do preferences for pop music converge across countries? Empirical evidence from the Eurovision Song Contest|The combination of the digitalization of cultural goods and facilitated cross-border availability through the internet fuels a globalization process that is of-ten said to cause a homogenization of demand across countries, in particular, for entertainment goods as music and movies. In the markets for music, this implies that the same hits and the same artists should be popular across countries and cultures. In order to test this hypothesis, we analyze historical voting data of the Eurovision Song Contest, the worldwide biggest live broadcasted international music competi-tion between all countries of the European Broadcasting Union. It covers the period from 1975-2016 where digitalization and internet availability were invented and evolved into mass phenomena. Consequently, according to the outlined theory of homogenization of preferences, voting should have become more concentrated on the leading artists and less focused on regional differences in taste. For the purpose of detecting concentration trends in the points allocation, we employ different indi-cators for measuring concentration. First, we calculate a concentration ratio, repre-senting the accumulated total number of points of the top three, five and ten-placed countries in each year of the contest. Second, we calculate the Herfindahl-Hirschman-Index (HHI) and, third, the Gini-Coefficient for each year. Furthermore, we test trend-lines for statistical significance. The results show, that our analysis cannot support the thesis of preference homogenization. We find no significant trend towards pref-erence convergence. In contrast, some of the employed indicators and methods point towards significant, albeit weak, deconcentration trends in voting behavior for the contest.
F60|Do Open Borders Tempt a Saint? Evidence from Schengen on Crime Rates in German Border Regions|The abolishment of passport and any other type of border controls at the German-Polish and German-Czech border in December 2007 provoked public concerns that open border would increase cross-border crime. Despite these widespread concerns, empirical research on whether the public fears were justified is still scarce. Based on data from the official German Police Crime Statistic, the paper evaluates whether the implementation of the Schengen Agreement in Poland and the Czech Republic in December 2007 affected crime rates in German regions bordering these two countries. Effects are identified by regression-adjusted difference-in-difference estimation on matched samples that allows evaluating the Schengen effects in a causal way. Preliminary results show that no significant Schengen effect can be observed for the most common types of criminal offenses. These findings suggest that in contrast to public concerns, German NUTS3 regions bordering Poland and the Czech Republic have not experienced an increase in crime as a result of the implementation of the Schengen Agreement of its Eastern neighbors. In light of the current discussion on the future of the Schengen zone and borderless Europe, this is quite an important result.

F60|Towards Holistic Theory of Money: Overcoming Twentieth Century Neoclassical Monetary Paradigm|The present paper is about rethinking and reformulating conventional assumptions concerning monetary economics. The money homogeneity and neutrality are rejected. New formulation of money market is suggested. It is demonstrated that money market is entangled with all the other markets and that the system of markets, including money, does not converge to equilibrium. Only under the gold standard some kind of self-regulation may be observed. Appropriate monetary and fiscal policies do not distort, but increase the efficiency of market forces. The introduction of internal money issued by private banking sector does not improve the situation and does not guarantee stability. Further, if we institute external value (exchange rate) of money, the basic conclusions are not altered. Flexible exchange rates require autonomous monetary policy and also rule out automatic equilibrium convergence. Prevailing floating exchange rate monetary regimes imply in addition dominance of internationally cooperative equilibrium based on mutually consistent macroeconomic policies. This implicit macroeconomic coordination precedes the international liberalization and deregulation, so, paradoxically the driving force behind globalization is the broadening of the scope of macroeconomic regulation. Finally, money uncertainty principle is introduced and connection between maximum entropy rule, economic uncertainty and money is established. The conclusions of the paper are related to certain basic Keynesian postulates about money.

F60|The Impact Of Globalization On The Characteristics Of Tax Systems Of The European Countries|In the international literature, a great number of studies have sought to determine the relationship between the characteristics of the national tax systems and globalization. Most of the research was conducted to prove the impact of the tax system on the competitiveness of the national economy, in order to give a clear recommendation for how economic and fiscal policy should create a stimulating economic background and enable greater involvement of the national economy in international flows. However, the process can be viewed from the reverse perspective, in the sense that the process of globalization and international competition can shape the characteristics of national tax systems. This paper aims to determine by empirical evidence the impact of the process of globalization and international competition on the characteristics of taxation in observed European countries.
F60|The Challenge of Market Power under Globalization| The legacy of Adam Smith leads to a false confidence on the optimality of laissez faire policies for the global market economy. Instead, the polarized character of current globalization deeply affects both developed and underdeveloped economies. Current globalization is characterized by factor exchange between economies of persistently unequal development. This implies the existence of persistent extraordinary market power in transnational corporations, reflected in their disproportionate participation in income and policy. These are shown to be steady-state features of globalization in a convergence club model of development and underdevelopment including trade and foreign direct investment (FDI). Moreover, results in tax competition explain how the increased share of transnational profits under globalization leads to lower corporate taxes, more conservative policies, and weaker institutions for balancing market power. The increased level of market power under globalization poses a serious challenge for national and global governance that deeply impacts economic development, distribution, sustainability, and democracy everywhere.
F60|Brain Drain Migration Type. What Causes Brain Drain Phenomenon?|"The phenomenon of migration of intellectuals, also known as ""brain drain"", we mean that constant transfer of highly qualified persons, especially in generally into less developed countries, to those states that have a developed economy. Most often, aspects of the social environment of home country, are the triggering factor in the migration decision intellectuals. Reducing the negative impact of brain drain can be achieved through the transfer of ""know-how"" through collaboration between intellectuals in the Diaspora with those of the country of origin in some projects."
F60|Internationalization of the RMB, Capital Market Openness and Financial Reforms in China|This paper provides an overview of Chinese financial and trade integration in recent decades, and the challenges facing China in the coming years. China had been a prime example of exported growth, benefiting from learning by doing, and by adopting foreign know-how, supported by a complex industrial policy. While the resultant growth has been spectacular, it comes with hidden but growing costs and distortions. The Chinese export-led growth path has been challenged by its own success, and the Global Financial Crisis forced China toward rebalancing, which is a work in progress. Reflecting on the internationalization of the CNY, one expects the rapid accelerating of the commercial internationalization of the CNY.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F60|Should We Stay or Should We Go? The economic consequences of leaving the EU|We analyze the effects of Brexit on the UK economy. The most important economic consequence of Brexit would likely be reduced trade with EU countries. We consider an optimistic scenario with relatively small increases in trade barriers between the UK and the EU and a pessimistic scenario with larger rises. In the optimistic scenario Brexit reduces UK income per capita by 1.1% and in the pessimistic scenario income per capita falls by 3.1%. The effect of Brexit on FDI and migration would impose additional costs on the UK and following Brexit the UK would not benefit from future EU free trade agreements such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership currently being negotiated with the United States.
F60|A closer look at revealed comparative advantage: Gross-versus value-added trade flows|With the availability of international value added trade data it has become evident that gross export data and value added data do not provide the same information. Although gross exports crosses national borders and is the target of trade policy, value added data tell us what fragment in the production chain is internationally competitive in a particular country. With respect to comparative advantage the differences between the two types of data are often illustrated by means of examples using a single sector. In the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage, however, the position of a commodity versus all other commodities in a country determines whether or not a sector has a comparative (dis)-advantage. This implies that distributions of comparative advantage of all sectors should be compared and not just individual sectors. In this paper we determine the distributions of Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) in terms of gross exports and value added for 40 countries. A Systematic comparison of these distributions shows that the distributions of RCA calculated with gross exports and value added data are indeed significantly different from each other. After establishing these significant differences we use the Great Recession as an example to determine which RCA measure has the largest information content regarding the real economy. We find that RCA calculated with value added data is the most telling.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F60|Hat Globalisierung zu Kreditmarktderegulierung geführt?|Im Zeitraum von 1970–2010 sind sowohl die Globalisierung als auch die Kreditmarktderegulierung stark vorangeschritten. In einer neuen Studie wurde untersucht, ob diese beiden Entwicklungen zusammenhängen und die Globalisierung zu einer Kreditmarktderegulierung geführt hat. Die Analyse kann den scheinbar offensichtlichen Zusammenhang zwischen der Globalisierung und der Kreditmarktderegulierung nicht auf einen kausalen Effekt zurückführen. Zumindest lässt sich ein solcher Effekt mit geeigneten Methoden in den verfügbaren Daten statistisch nicht nachweisen.
F60|Does exporting improve matching? Evidence from French employer-employee data|This paper documents a novel fact about the hiring decisions of exporting firms versus non-exporting firms in a French matched employer-employee dataset. We construct the type of each worker using both a traditional wage regression and a theory-based approach and compute measures of the average worker type and worker type dispersion at the firm level. We find that exporting firms feature a lower type dispersion in the pool of workers they hire. This effect is quantitatively larger than the common finding in the literature that exporters pay higher wages because, among other factors, they employ better workers. The matching between exporting firms and workers is even tighter in sectors characterized by better exporting opportunities as measured by foreign demand or tariff shocks. Our findings are consistent with a model of matching between heterogeneous workers and firms in which variation in the worker type at the firm level exists in equilibrium only because of the presence of search costs. When firms gain access to the foreign market, matching with the right worker becomes particularly important because deviations from the ideal match quickly reduce the higher potential value of the relationship. Hence, exporting firms select sets of workers that are less dispersed relative to the average. This analysis is suggestive of the presence of additional gains from trade due to improved sorting.
F60|Vocation Of Language For International Communication – A Prediction Tool For Future Evolutions In Global Communication|"The paper proposes a new perspective that explains the convergence toward an increasingly smaller number of languages in communication between speakers of different native languages: the ""vocation of language for international communication"". For the population of a country, the exposure to its official language by implicit interaction with it makes that the majority of citizens understands this language. Correlating the populations of these countries with the spread of these languages by countries and continents generates a hierarchy of languages, at global or regional level. English has the strongest vocation of language for international communication at global level, followed by French and Spanish, while Russian and Arabic have strong vocation only at regional level. Chinese has only a medium vocation at regional level, as German, Portuguese, Italian and Dutch. 23 languages officially spoken at least 2 countries and other 88 official languages of a sole country are grouped in 5 clusters, by their vocation of language for international communication."
F60|Global Trade. The Key To Transatlantic Competitiveness|Global trade has an important characteristic in terms of open global markets by means of eliminating barriers to trade and investment. The United States and the European Union, two major international actors and competitors in the economic field, have both the opportunity to change the global trade by concluding the negotiations of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. For this reason, this paper tries to find the connections between global trade and transatlantic competitiveness in the way that the global trade can be considered a key to transatlantic competitiveness. The United States and the European Union are global actors and competitors in the global economy and the play field is the global trade. In order to be aware of the importance ofglobal trade in the transatlantic competitiveness, this paper includes also an analysis of the concrete actions that both economic powers are taking in key-sectors of the transatlantic economy.
F60|Fdi And Economic Growth In Cee Countries|The aim of the current paper is to emphasize the correlation between FDI inflows and GDP growth rate in selected countries from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The dynamic of FDI inflows and GDP growth rate have been significantly affected by the current economic crisis, which has led to a decrease in foreign capital inflows and a restrained of investment projects. However, macroeconomic imbalances and increased volatilities have determined a strong contraction of GDP growth rates in these economies, except Poland which was the most resilient to worldwide shocks. The results show a unidirectional causality between FDI and GDP growth in all cases, except Hungary. Further analysis will be developed testing the impact of foreign flows volatility on GDP growth.

F60|Tariff Reductions, Entry, and Welfare: Theory and Evidence for the Last Two Decades|In a standard multi-sector, heterogeneous-firm trade model the effect of tariffs on entry, especially in the presence of production linkages, can reverse the traditional positive optimal-tariff argument. We construct and employ a new, large, disaggregated tariff dataset and then apply a 189-country, 15-sector version of our model in order to quantify the trade, entry, and welfare effects of trade liberalization over the period 1990–2010. We find that the impact on firm entry was larger in Advanced Economies relative to Emerging and Developing Economies; that more than 90% of the gains from trade are a consequence of the reductions in MFN tariffs (the Uruguay Round); and that for some countries, particularly some Emerging and Developing Economies, there are additional gains from a further move to complete free trade. The countries which would gain from the elimination of tariffs have a strong rank correlation with those that gain from a negative optimal tariff, which comprise one-quarter of the countries in the world.
F60|The Beveridge Curve in the OECD Before and After the Crisis|This paper tests the existence of a Beveridge Curve across the economies of nine OECD countries from 1980 to 2011, investigating the impact of various kinds of structural factors (technological progress, globalisation, oil prices) and of the current recession on the Curve. Technological progress (R&D intensity) shifts the Curve outwards, producing evidence in support of the creative destruction effect. Globalisation and unfavourable oil price shocks also shift the Curve outwards, worsening the unemployment-vacancies trade-off. Structural relationships seem to be stable enough in the 2008-2011 period, suggesting that the current crisis mainly implied moves along the Curve.

F60|La República Popular de China y América Latina: impacto del crecimiento económico chino en las exportaciones latinoamericanas|El papel de la República Popular de China en la economía mundial se ha incrementado significativamente en las últimas décadas, convirtiéndola en un socio estratégico en el comercio exterior de gran parte de América Latina. El comercio bilateral entre la región y la nación asiática alcanzó los 120.000 millones de dólares durante el año 2009. En esta investigación se analiza la elasticidad ingreso de las exportaciones de la región a dicho país. Los resultados muestran que, asumiendo un crecimiento real del producto interno bruto (pib) chino cercano al 7% anual, el valor (a precios de 2005) de las exportaciones latinoamericanas a China crecería en torno del 10% promedio anual entre 2014 y 2019. A su vez, un escenario más conservador, en que se contemple un crecimiento promedio anual de la economía china del 4,5% para igual período, arrojaría un aumento de las exportaciones cercano al 7% anual.
