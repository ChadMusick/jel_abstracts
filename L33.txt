L33|Costs of Submarine Maintenance at Public and Private Shipyards|Public shipyards, which are owned and operated by the Navy, conduct a large majority of all submarine maintenance. To reduce delays at public shipyards, the Navy sent 29 submarines to private shipyards for Docking Selected Restricted Availability (DSRA) overhauls between 1993 and 2017. During that period, 117 DSRA overhauls were done at public shipyards. The overhauls conducted at private shipyards have been 31 percent less expensive, on average, by CBOâ€™s estimate. That gap has narrowed in recent years, but CBOâ€™s data include only one overhaul at a private shipyard after 2010.
L33|Effects of Market Structure and Patient Choice on Hospital Quality for Planned Patients|We investigate the change in the effect of market structure on planned hospital quality for three high-volume treatments, using a quasi difference-in-differences approach based on the relaxation of patient constraints on hospital choice in England. We employ control functions to allow for time-varying endogeneity from unobserved patient characteristics. We find that the choice reforms reduced quality for hip and knee replacement but not for coronary bypass, This is likely due to hospitals making a larger loss on hip and knee replacements, since robustness checks rule out changes in length of stay, new competitors’ entry and hospital-level mortality as possible confounders.
L33|The effect of government contracting with faith-based health care providers in Malawi|We study the impact of contracting-out of maternal health care by the government of Malawi to providers from the Christian Health Association of Malawi (CHAM) in the form of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Under a SLA, a CHAM facility provides agreed maternal and newborn services free-of-charge to patients, and is reimbursed on a fixed price per service. We merge data on health facilities in Malawi with pregnancy histories from the 2010 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey, and exploit the staggered implementation of SLAs across facilities. Using difference-in-differences, we estimate the differential effects on pregnancy- related health care utilisation to mothers residing near and far from facilities with a SLA over time. Our findings show that SLAs reduced home births and increased skilled deliveries at CHAM hospitals. We observe greater provision of prenatal care services at CHAM health centres but no overall increase in the number of prenatal care visits. We find evidence of a reduction in certain components of prenatal care.
L33|Evaluación de la Misión Bogotá S.XXI en materia de cobertura de servicios públicos domiciliarios (1990-2017)|Este ensayo pretende evaluar el cumplimiento o no de los objetivos de cobertura en servicios públicos domésticos (SPD) propuestos por la Misión Bogotá S. XXI, 28 años después de su creación, específicamente en los servicios de energía eléctrica, acueducto, alcantarillado, aseo y gas natural. El trabajo se estructura en cuatro secciones: 1) contexto socioeconómico de Bogotá a finales del S.XX; 2) propuestas hechas por la Misión en materia de cobertura de los SPD y condición inicial de Bogotá en este aspecto; 3) evaluación sectorial de los alcances de la Misión en materia de cobertura y 4) conclusiones. Se llega al resultado de que el cumplimiento de los objetivos dependerá en buena medida de la metodología utilizada para medir la cobertura; si bien en las dos metodologías analizadas en todos los SPD para 2017 superan tasas del 70%, existe una, basada en las proyecciones de demanda del servicio, que muestra coberturas cercanas al 100% y otra, basada en proyecciones del número total de hogares, que muestra tasas entre el 71y 78% para 2017. This essay aims to assess the compliance or not of the coverage objectives in domestic public services (SPD) proposed by the Bogota S.XXI Mission, 28 years after its creation, specifically in the electric power services, aqueduct, sewerage, and toilet and natural gas. The work is structured in four sections, 1) socioeconomic context of Bogotá at the end of the 20th century; 2) proposals made by the Mission regarding coverage of the SPD and the initial condition of Bogotá in this regard; 3) sectorial evaluation of the scope of the Mission in terms of coverage and 4) Conclusion. As a result, the fulfilment of the objectives will depend to a large extent on the methodology used to measure the coverage, although in the two analyzed methodologies all SPD for 2017 surpass rates of 70%, there is one, based on the demand projections of the service, which shows coverage close to 100% and another, based on projections of the total number of households, showing rates between 71% and 78% for 2017.
L33|Entry decisions and asymmetric competition between non-profit and for-profit homes in the long-term care market|The demand for long-term care (LTC) services is growing strongly, mostly due to population aging. Historically, the German LTC market was dominated by non-profit nursing homes, but the recent entry wave was tilted towards for-profit competitors. Using a rich administrative dataset on all LTC facilities in Germany, we examine strategic interaction between these two ownership types in a static entry model. The estimates of competitive effects imply that non-profit and for-profit homes are substitutes, but competition is much stronger within-type, suggesting that they provide differentiated products. For-profit homes in particular act as if they operate in a different market segment, but over time their entry behavior has converged to that of the more established non-profits. Counterfactual simulations of proposed changes in government policy suggest that even small changes favoring either type could have a large impact on the fraction of markets that remain unserved or only served by a single type.
L33|Workers BuyOut: why employee-owned enterprises are more resilient than corporate business in time of economic and financial crisis? The case of Emilia-Romagna Region|The Workers BuyOut (WBO) is an economic and social phenomenon that has developed since the beginning of the 2008 financial and economic crisis and is still growing. In Italy, its roots can be traced back to the 1970s and today journalists and politicians are publishing reportages and books on this phenomenon. Inside the Italian scientific community, also some economists have dedicated accurate but rare studies to the topic. Nevertheless, the WBO has not yet become the focus of a precise and in-depth research by sociologists, despite its evident social relevance. The present paper is the result of a sociological investigation carried out by the authors and aims at illustrating this phenomenon through the lens of organizational analysis. It is structured in five sections: a general introduction; a description of the phenomenon at the national level, through the analysis of its normative grounds and its quantitative dimensions; a more detailed description of the WBO in EmiliaRomagna Region; a focus on the case study of one firm that turned into a successful WBO; a critical conclusion, highlighting the main incentives and obstacles for the full development of WBO experiences.
L33|Russia’s public sector and privatization policy in 2018|From 2016, statistical data began to be published in the framework of the System of Public Property Management Efficiency Estimates. It was approved by Decree of the RF Government No 72 dated January 29, 2015, and introduced by way of replacing the public sector monitoring data, collected and released by the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) since the early 2000s in accordance with the provisions stipulated in RF Government Decree No 1 dated January 4, 1999 (as amended on December 30, 2002). Among other things, the System contains data on the number of federal state unitary enterprises (FSUEs) and joint-stock companies (JSCs) with RF stakes in their capital. Previously, such data were usually published as part of government privatization programs (from 2011 – for three-year period, and prior to 2011 – for one-year period). In the current Forecast Plan (Program) of Federal Property Privatization and the Main Directions of Federal Property Privatization for 2017–2019, relevant data are available only as of early 2016 (Table 1), and so in order to describe the processes taking place over the period 2016–2018, one must rely on data in the System of Public Property Management Efficiency Estimates.
L33|The housing market in Russian cities in 2018|The preliminary results of the Russian economy’s development in 2018 appear to be rather controversial. On the one hand, the growth rate of GDP gained 2.3 percent; on the other, the consumer inflation index increased significantly, to 4.3 percent, from its record low of the entire period since the onset of market reforms (2.5 percent), achieved in 2017. The movement pattern of personal disposable income, which is a much more significant factor determining the situation in the real estate market, was quite volatile throughout the course of last year, with multiple trend reversals. In spite of the positive results of the first two quarters, probably achieved thanks to the current electoral cycle, in the end the personal disposable income index stayed roughly at the same level as in 2017. The RF Central Bank twice reduced its key rate over the course of H1 2018, to 7.25 percent per annum in early autumn. However, over the next few months it was once again hiked twice, and so returned to its level of late 2017 (7.75 percent). The tricky movement pattern of the key rate pushed down the interest rates on bank loans and notably improved the position of borrowers.
L33|Outsourcing Public Services: Contractibility, Cost, and Quality|We review the literature on public sector outsourcing to explore if the theoretical predictions from the incomplete contracts literature hold up to recent empirical evidence. Guided by theory, we arrange services according to the type and magnitude of their contractibility problems. The empirical studies point at rather favourable outsourcing outcomes, in terms of costs and quality, for services without severe contracting problems. The picture is more mixed for services with tougher contracting problems, with the weight of the evidence in favour of public provision. This difference between services is largely in line with the property-rights framework and theories of incomplete contracts.

L33|Going Places: Rail Transport in Japan|The purpose of this short paper is to summarize the state of rail transportation in Japan and to recount recent developments. Points of focus here are organization and types of competition in the rail industry in Japan, the evolution of passenger and freight rail transportation, yardstick regulation as a competition tool, and recent vertical separation in Japan. Several distinguishing factors of the Japanese rail industry are discussed. First, passenger rail transportation is still vital in Japan, but the freight rail business is weaker than in other major industrial countries. The second notable feature of the rail industry in Japan is the extraordinary number of rail operators, the vast majority of which are privately owned passenger railways. Third, most railways are vertically integrated, and entry into and exit from the market are not free but are regulated. Fourth, there are eight types of competition, among which is yardstick competition, an indirect form that is applied to separate markets and has existed in Japan since the 1970s. Fifth, as for the evolution of passenger and freight rail transportation, two developmentsâ€”the Ekinaka business for passenger rail and the Eco-Rail-Mark certificate system for freightâ€”are underway in the rail industry. Sixth, yardstick regulation is effective to some degree, but it is unknown how long the effect will continue. Last, while vertical integration is the norm in Japan, there are cases of vertical separation in some urban area operations. Recently, however, new types of vertical separation have been emerging, mostly for financial reasons. As competition in Japanâ€™s rail industry has been very limited up to now, Japanese policy makers would be wise to seek lessons from the European experience.
L33|Hold-up Problems in Contracting Out Waste Collection Services|It is reported previously that, in contracting out waste collection services to pri- vate enterprises, there is generally an inverse relationship between the contracting- out rate and the contract price, but this inverse relationship levels out as the degree of contracting-out increases and the contract price even goes up eventually as the contracting rate approaches 100%. In this paper, we construct a simple bargain- ing model between municipal governments and private rms and identify how the bargaining equilibrium differs from an outcome where municipal governments can make take-it-or-leave-it offers to private enterprises. Through a simple simulation analysis, in addition, we demonstrate that hold-up concerns of local governments can indeed lead to a U-shaped relationship between the contracting-out rate and the contract price across different municipalities.
L33|Can a Tiger Change Its Stripes? Reform of Chinese State-Owned Enterprises in the Penumbra of the State|The majority of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China were privatized through ownership reforms over the last two decades. Using a comprehensive dataset of all medium and large enterprises in China between 1998 and 2013, we show that privatized SOEs continue to benefit from government support relative to private enterprises. Compared to private firms that were never state-owned, privatized SOEs are favored by low interest loans and government subsidies. These differences are more salient with the Chinese government’s trillion-dollar stimulus package introduced after the 2008 global financial crisis. Moreover, both SOEs and privatized SOEs significantly under-perform in profitability compared to private firms. Nevertheless there are clear improvements in performance post-privatization. The tiger can change its stripes; however, the government’s behavior seems to be sticky.
L33|The Impact of the Affordable Care Act: Evidence from California's Hospital Sector|The Affordable Care Act (ACA) authorized the largest expansion of public health insurance in the U.S. since the mid-1960s. We exploit ACA-induced changes in the discontinuity in coverage at age 65 using a regression discontinuity based design to examine effects of the expansion on health insurance coverage, hospital use, and patient health. We then link these changes to effects on hospital finances. We show that a substantial share of the federally-funded Medicaid expansion substituted for existing locally-funded safety net programs. Despite this offset, the expansion produced a substantial increase in hospital revenue and profitability, with larger gains for government hospitals. On the benefits side, we do not detect significant improvements in patient health, although the expansion led to substantially greater hospital and emergency room use, and a reallocation of care from public to private and better-quality hospitals.
L33|Enablers of the Neo-Liberal State? Exploring the Role of the International Accounting-Consulting Firms in Australia Since the Mid-1980s|This Discussion Paper is part of a wider contemporary history project examining the growth and role of the commercial consultancy and contractor market within the public sector in Australia since the neo-liberal turn in the mid-1980s. The paper considers evidence as to whether the role of the big international accounting firms within the public sector was â€˜neo-liberalâ€™ in nature, either as a result of ideological and policy advocacy or technical facilitation of pre-set neo-liberal directions. The extent to which these firms (currently PwC, KPMG, EY and Deloitte) are seen as integrated or fragmented organisations has some bearing on this question. Hence, the first quarter of the paper sketches the historical broadening-out of the firms from accounting to a wider range of services, the debate over whether they have functioned as global corporations or networked partnerships, the rationalisation of the leading firms over the past three decades and the relatively sparse commentary from political scientists about the significance of the firms and other commercial consultants for public policy and administration in Australia. The second quarter of the paper points to the role of the firms in regard to two markers of a neo-liberal policy direction: privatisation of government business enterprises and particular tax policies and practices. Drawing on qualitative sources, it argues that while the firms made some contribution to the agenda-setting process in both areas, in tacitly (privatisation) or explicitly (taxation) signalling their broad policy preferences, they played a more fundamental role in detailed policy formulation and implementation â€“ in easing the path of privatisation and corporate tax minimisation. The second half of the paper summarises original research by the author in regard to official public listings of consultancies and contracts at the national government level. This quantitative analysis yields important findings: that overall spending on the firms displayed a long-term, consistent and strong increase, both in absolute terms and relative to other consultancies and contractors; that this spending went far beyond accounting and auditing to many areas of management, though with financial analysis likely to underpin management inputs; and that a good deal of this work appeared to be oriented to program content and policy-relevant tasks. otwithstanding these findings, the paper emphasises that the extent to which this work confirmed to neo-liberal markers â€“ such as support for private modes of provision and greater competition â€“ cannot be readily confirmed, due to limitations in the official summary data. Such confirmation can only be achieved by qualitative case studies.The paper acknowledges that, as the firms have broadened their personnel and services over the three decades, much of the management and technology work of the firms in the public sector is unlikely to be intrinsically neo-liberal but potentially compatible with other philosophies of the public sector. Nonetheless, the growing presence of the firms within the public sector does erode notions of public sector capability and distinctive ethos. The paper concludes with a brief pointer to how the foregoing discussion, and further research, can be related to the academic literature on the differing roles played by commercial consultants in relation to clients, ranging from legitimation and facilitation of client preferences through to independent advice and learning.

L33|Spatial dependence in museum services: An analysis of the Italian case|In this paper we investigate whether the services offered by museums are affected by the choices of neighbors, and we discuss whether the evidence can document that competition processes are at work. Specifically, we take into account the Italian case, where governmental and private museums co-exist. Resorting to Spatial Autoregressive Models, we show that a significant influence of neighbors’ choice concerning service supply does emerge. However, we cast several doubts that this piece of evidence can be solely due to sound competition among museums.
L33|Innovation spillover, licensing, and ex-post privatization in international duopoly|This paper studies the impact of innovation spillover and licensing on optimal ex-post privatization policies by involving an exogenous R&D activity in a partial-equilibrium international duopoly setting. By assuming a domestic public firm is relatively inefficient compared to its foreign private rival, we characterize and discuss optimal privatization policies under both foreign private and domestic public innovation. The theoretical results suggest that foreign private (domestic public) innovation, including both spillover and licensing, reduces (increases) the optimal degree of ex-post privatization. In addition, innovation spillover and licensing have the same impact direction on privatization policies. The numerical evidence supports these theoretical findings.
L33|How (Not) to Foster Innovations in Public Infrastructure Projects|The government wants an infrastructure-based public service to be provided. First the infrastructure has to be built, subsequently it has to be operated. Should the government bundle the building and operating tasks in a public-private partnership? Or should it choose traditional procurement, i.e. delegate the tasks to different firms? Each task entails unobservable investments to come up with innovations. It turns out that depending on the nature of the innovations, bundling may either stimulate or discourage investments. Moreover, we find that if renegotiation cannot be prevented, a public-private partnership may lead the government to deliberately opt for a technologically inferior project.
L33|Economies of Diversification in Microfinance: Evidence from Quantile Estimation on Panel Data|Prior studies of the diversification-driven cost savings from the joint provision of credit and deposits in microfinance usually ignore the multi-way heterogeneity across MFIs which vary substantially in size, business model, target clientele and operate in diverse environments. Using a quantile panel data model with correlated effects capable of accommodating multiple heterogeneity, we show that the typical measurement of economies of diversification at the mean provides an incomplete and distorted picture of their magnitude and prevalence in the industry. While we find statistically significant estimates, they are modest for most small-size MFIs but are quite substantial for large-scale institutions.
L33|The Economic Impact of public private partnerships (PPPs) in Infrastructure, Health and Education: A Review|This paper summarizes what is known about the impact of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure (energy, transport, water and sanitation, and telecommunications), education, and health. It reviews evaluations of the effectiveness of PPPs and, whenever possible, the implications for coverage and affordability. For infrastructure, there is some evidence of PPPs leading to gains in labor productivity, as most transitions to private participation have entailed significant labor downsizing, but only mixed support for improvements in total factor productivity or quality, coverage, and affordability. Selection issues plague most available studies, calling for caution when considering the conclusions. For education, micro-level studies shows that PPPs have the potential to increase enrollment and respond to a growing demand for education, but that their impact on educational outcomes appears to depend greatly on the institutional details and the scale of the programs considered. Finally, PPPs appear to be likely to increase socio-economic and ethnic segregation in education systems. Finally, there is inconclusive evidence of an impact of PPPs on health service utilization, the quality of services, patient satisfaction and health-related outcomes. The review points to the need to identify the reasons for service under-utilization, such as lack of information on the side of users, poor quality of services, before implementing interventions, and to combine demand- and supply-side policies if needed. Overall, more work appears to be due to rigorously evaluate the impact of PPPs, especially regarding infrastructure and health.
L33|The strange case of appropriate C-sections:DRG-tariff regulation, hospital ownership, and market concentration|The aim of this paper is to discuss how different types of hospitals respond to large financial incentives for vaginal deliveries and to financial disincentives for C-sections. We focus on a public health care system based on the quasiâ€“market model. We theoretically and empirically evaluate a government policy equalizing the tariff for C-section and vaginal deliveries at a level such that hospitals face monetary disincentives for C-section and monetary incentives for vaginal deliveries. We first theoretically show that hospital ownership matters insofar different types of hospitals are characterized by different ethical preferences; but ownership interacts with market concentration. We then consider the case-study of Lombardy in Italy. We exploit spatial variation in the presence of for-profit, not-for-profit and public hospitals and in the market concentration at the local level to evaluate the relationship between ownership and the probability of C-section. Our empirical results strongly suggest that competitive pressures from alternative providers tend to homogenize behaviors. However, in local monopolies, we do observe less C-section from private for-profit hospitals than from public and private non-profit hospitals especially when they are medically appropriate.
L33|The influence of political characteristics on the relationship between family control and firm performance: A meta-analytical approach|This multilevel meta-analytic study, based on 176 studies from 36 countries, examines the impact of political characteristics on the performance of family firms when comparing them to non-family firms (k=311, N=1,598,964). Our findings support the expectation that family firm characteristics are positively related to firm performance. We trace the variance between the studies to differences in certain political characteristics of the firms' countries of origin: government stability, regime stability, regime type and special periods of factionalism. In terms of government and regime stability, we find positive moderating effects on the focal relationship. We further show that periods of factionalism even reverse the superior performance of family firms. While the focal relationship becomes stronger in democracies, the relationship turns negative when looking at anocracies and becomes stronger and positive again considering autocracies. Finally, we reveal that government stability partly mediates the influence of the regime type. Therefore, government stability is a crucial condition for family firms to prosper in any political environment. Our study has several implications for the interplay between family firms and politics: First, the comparative advantage of family firms depends on specific political characteristics. Second, the ability of institutions to provide stability is more important for family firms than the actual institutional setting itself. Third, the impact of a political environment on economic success differs between family firms and nonfamily firms and therefore depends on the structure of the given economy.
L33|Multiple Long-Run Equilibria in a Free-Entry Mixed Oligopoly|We investigate a free-entry mixed oligopoly with constant marginal costs. A privatization policy is implemented after private firms enter the market. We find that both full privatization and full nationalization are equilibrium policies, and the former is the worst privatization policy for welfare.
L33|Endogenous scope economies in microfinance institutions|Scope economies resulting from the joint offering of loans and savings accounts (as opposed to loans only) are customarily invoked to promote the transformation of credit-only microfinance institutions (MFIs) into integrated loans-and-savings entities. To ensure robust inference, we estimate scope economies for the microfinance industry using a novel approach which, among its other advantages, accommodates inherent heterogeneity across loans-only and loans-and-savings MFIs as well as controls for endogenous self-selection of institutions into the either type. For analysis, we use a large 2004–2014 Mixmarket dataset. Unlike earlier studies, we do not find prevalent scope economies in the microfinance industry. We find that the median degree of scope economies is statistically indistinguishable from zero and that scope economies are significantly positive for less than a half of loans-and-savings MFIs. For a non-trivial 14% of institutions, the empirical evidence suggests the existence of significantly negative diseconomies of scope indicating that the separate production of loans and savings accounts actually has the potential to reduce an MFI’s costs. We also find that the failure to account for endogenous selectivity dramatically overestimates the degree of scope economies resulting in the failure to detect scope diseconomies among MFIs. Thus, our findings call for caution when invoking scope economies as a blanket justification for universal expansion of the scope of financial operations by MFIs. Instead, promoting integrated loans-and-savings MFIs may be justifiable as a means to meeting the needs of the poor rather than as a way for the industry to save costs.
L33|Restructuring the Chinese Freight Railway: Two Scenarios|Twenty years of debate regarding the restructuring of the Chinese freight railway have failed to yield a consensus. Early policy statements favoring the creation of above-the-rail competition over a monopoly infrastructure – the “European” model of rail restructuring – have broadened into a lively policy and scholarly debate that includes as an alternative the division of the system into competing vertically integrated railways – the “Americas” model of restructuring. To date, however, there have been no tangible reform steps beyond organizational restructuring, the construction of new coal railroads, some with private-sector participation, and the introduction of scheduled service, especially for containers, between China and Europe. In this paper we argue in favor of the Americas model as a basis for restructuring and offer two alternative scenarios for the creation of multiple vertically integrated freight railways. Both plans enable competition between independent firms and routes for import/export traffic, one a southern, One Belt/One Road path, the other a northern path via the Trans-Siberian Railway.
L33|Flexible Privatization Policy in Free-Entry Markets|We investigate a mixed oligopoly in a free-entry market in the presence of shadow cost of public funding. The government chooses the degree of privatization before the entry of private firms and then adjusts the degree of privatization after the entry. We show that a pre-entry privatization policy may serve as a commitment device if the foreign ownership share of private firms is moderate, and substitutes the ideal privatization policy with complete commitment if the equilibrium pre-entry privatization policy is partial privatization.
L33|Communautes Et Developpement Local Dans Le Projet Hydroelectrique De Lom Pangar : La Responsabilite Societale Du Maitre D’Ouvrage<BR>[Lom Pangar Hydroelectric Community Development Project: Social Responsibility Of The Owner]|Local communities nowadays play an important role in the implementation of development project. This study gives room for an assessment of the societal impact of an ongoing project in the energy sector in Cameroon. It is of keen interest to international financial institutions sponsoring the project to a great extent. However, it comes out that CSR in its contribution to sustainable development goes beyond the implementation of a project.
L33|Implicit Protectionism via State Enterprises and Technology Transfer from Foreign Enterprises|We formulate a mixed triopoly in which one state enterprise competes with one domestic and one foreign private enterprise. The private enterprise can transfer its technology to the private rival, which reduces the rival's production cost. We show that if the privatization policy is endogenous, the foreign firm voluntary transfers its technology, even without fees. We also show that the domestic private firm does not transfer its technology to the foreign firm. Consequently, the domestic private enterprise extracts rents from the foreign enterprise and increases its market share. We also show that the foreign enterprise may strategically raise its local ownership share, which implies that the existence of a state enterprise and its potential future privatization serve as an industrial policy that improves the domestic firm's competitive advantage relative to the foreign enterprise or the implicit foreign ownership regulation.
L33|The Relationship between Privatization and Corporate Taxation Policies|This paper investigate how the corporate (profit) tax rate affects the optimal degree of privatization in a mixed duopoly, while introducing a minimum profit constraint for the private firm. Firstly, we show that the profit tax rate directly affects the behavior of the partially privatized firm and affects the behavior of the private firm through strategic interaction. In addition, we investigate the relationship between the optimal privatization policy and corporate tax policy, and find that the optimal degree of privatization increases with the corporate tax rate, regardless of whether the constraint is binding. The optimal degree of privatization decreases (increases) with the foreign ownership share in the private firm if the constraint is ineffective (effective). This result suggests that a minimum profit constraint can be crucial in the optimal privatization policy.
L33|From central planning toward a market economy: The role of ownership and competition in Vietnamese firmsâ€™ productivity|This paper examines the role of ownership and market competition in Vietnamese firmsâ€™ total factor productivity (TFP) from 2001 to 2011. Making use of a large panel dataset of Vietnamese manufacturing firms, we find that, on average, both foreign-owned enterprises (FOEs) and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have performed better than privately owned enterprises (POEs) in terms of their TFP levels. However, while FOEs ranked the highest in terms of TFP in the period 2001â€“2006, SOEs â€œclosed the gapâ€ with FOEs in the period 2007â€“2011. SOEsâ€™ good performance may be the result of the state-led development policies undertaken during the 2000s. We also find that market competition has been effective in enhancing average firm productivity and reducing the gaps in efficiency across firms of different ownership types. Based on these results, we compare Vietnamâ€™s transition path with those followed by other countries.
L33|Do economic regulatory agencies matter to private-sector involvement in water utilities in developing countries?|This paper suggests that, for developing countries, the creation of economic regulatory agencies, separate from the ministry in charge of water and sanitation, may not be a necessary or sufficient condition to stimulate large scale private involvement (PPPs) in the sector. The odds of an impact are higher for Latin American countries than other regions and for countries with higher income levels. They are also better when inflation is high. At the margin, the odds are unrelated to the contract type, except for greenfield projects, for which they may be contraindicated.
L33|A Scoping Study of PPP Guidelines|The Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third Conference on Financing for Development underscores sustainable and resilient infrastructure as a pre-requisite to sustainable development. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are expected to deliver infrastructure in furtherance of this Agenda. In view of this expectation, twelve prominent PPP guidelines were reviewed for alignment with the Addis Agenda and key public governance factors. The research found that the PPP guidelines are not sufficiently aligned with the Addis Agenda, have insufficient sustainability content, and do not acknowledge the role of the public in PPPs. It recommends that the next generation of the guidelines address these aspects. This paper is an updated version of the draft paper presented to the expert group meeting of the Inter-agency Task Force in December 2016. The author is grateful for discussion and comments received on the earlier versions of this paper. Some are reflected in the paper without attribution, owing to the Chatham House rule followed at the meeting. The author takes full responsibility for the contents of this report.

L33|The optimal port privatization levels under inter-port competition: Considering both horizontal and vertical differentiation|The authors examine a mixed duopoly market with Cournot or Bertrand competition between a purely private port (port 1) and a partial public port (port 2). Considering both horizontal and vertical differentiation between the two ports, they analytically derive the welfare effect of privatization of port 2 and determine the optimal degree of privatization. Under Cournot or Bertrand competition, it is demonstrated that the social desirable private level of port 2 varies among full privatization, partial privatization and full nationalization, which hinges mainly upon the market size, both horizontal and vertical differentiation between the two ports and the marginal operation cost of each port. As a result, there is not necessarily a one-size-fits-all strategy for port privatization, and it is important for policymakers to consider the effects of market demand, port competition factors in port privatization.

Consistent with patterns observed in commodity export data, MNEs are found to account for the majority of firm exports during this period. Wholly-foreign MNEs (WFs), which accounted for the vast majority of MNE production in Vietnam, accounted for most MNE exports. Both WFs and MNE joint ventures (JV) made larger direct contributions to exports than to production or employment, as observed in other Asian developing economies. There was a strong tendency for WFs to have the highest export propensities (export-turnover ratios) followed by JVs. Manufacturing firms exported over four-fifths of the total in most years. Tobit estimates that controlled for the effects of firm size, capital intensity, liquidity, location, and industry affiliation for manufacturers indicate WFs also had the highest conditional export propensities, followed by JVs, private firms, while export propensities tended to be similar in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and private firms in most industries. Because Vietnam imposes few ownership restrictions on MNEs, these results imply that MNEs generally prefer to export from WFs rather than JVs, and are consistent with previous results for Thailand and Indonesia, for example.
L33|Foreign Ownership and Exports of Thai Manufacturing Plants by Industry in 1996| This paper investigates how foreign multinational enterprises (MNEs) contributed to exports by Thai manufacturing plants at the industry level in 2006. The mean export-sales ratio (export propensities) in heavily-foreign MNEs with foreign ownership shares of 90 percent or more exceeded 50 percent and heavily-foreign MNEs accounted for one-third of plant exports. Minority-foreign (10-49% foreign shares) and majority-foreign (50-89% shares) MNEs combined to account for another one-fifth of plant exports but had lower export propensities, about 30 percent and 40 percent, respectively. The mean export propensity for local plants in 20 sample industries was only 15 percent. In large samples of all 20 industries combined, econometric estimates controlling for industry affiliation with intercept dummies as well as the effects of the scale, age, factor intensities or labor productivity, and BOI-promotion status of plants also indicated that export propensities were the highest in heavily-foreign MNEs, followed by majority-foreign MNEs, minority-foreign MNEs, and lastly by local plants. Moreover, ownership-related differences in export propensities were highly significant statistically. When inter-industry heterogeneity was more fully accounted for by allowing slope coefficients as well as intercepts to differ among the 20 industries, export propensities were the highest in heavily-foreign MNEs and significantly higher than in local plants in 12 industries. However, differences among MNE ownership groups were usually insignificant and MNE-local differentials in export propensities differed substantially among industries, suggesting it is important account for inter-industry heterogeneity as fully as possible.
L33|Firms and social policy preferences under weak institutions : Evidence from Russia|When does business support the expansion of social policy in the developing world? Existing work on managers’ preferences has tended to concentrate on the developed world, where governments can credibly commit to policy, tax evasion is constrained, and mechanisms exist to hold the bureaucracy accountable for policy implementation. In this paper, I relax these assumptions, arguing that weak institutions create opportunities for some firms to shift costs onto others: making social policy more attractive. I argue that firms with political connections are uniquely positioned to benefit from subsidies and property rights protection, which decreases the cost of social policy, while firms with low visibility can evade taxes and free-ride off universalistic social policy. Such firms will support social policy even where institutions are poor. I test this argument using a survey of 666 firms in 10 Russian regions.
L33|Common Ownership of Public Goods|We analyze optimal ownership of public goods in a repeated game focusing on common ownership. Under common ownership an owner’s access to the public good cannot be restricted by other owners. We find that under common ownership both the value of the relationship and the gain from deviation are high. Common ownership is optimal when the marginal return to maintenance investments is low consistent with the stylized facts.
L33|Does public sector outsourcing decrease public employment? Empirical evidence from OECD countries|I examine the extent to which public sector outsourcing relates to public employment in OECD countries. I use new panel data on public sector outsourcing. The sample includes 26 countries over the period 2009-2015. Contrary to common expectations, the results do not suggest that public sector outsourcing expenditure was negatively related to public employment in the full sample. The relation between public sector outsourcing and public employment, however, does vary across countries. If anything, the growth in public sector outsourcing in period t-1 was positively correlated with the growth in public employment in period t. When public sector outsourcing gives rise to regrouping public employees but not reducing public employment, outsourcing may even increase inefficiencies in the public sector.

L33|Government versus Private Ownership of Public Goods: Experimental Evidence|Who should own public projects? We report data from a laboratory experiment with 480 participants that was designed to test Besley and Ghatak's (2001) public-good version of the Grossman-Hart-Moore property rights theory. Consider two parties, one of whom can invest in the provision of a public good. The parties value the public good differently. Besley and Ghatak (2001) argue that more investments will be made if the high-valuation party is the owner, regardless of whether or not this party is the investor. While our experimental results provide support for the Grossman-Hart-Moore theory, they cast some doubts on the robustness of Besley and Ghatak's (2001) conclusion.
L33|State-Owned Enterprises: Rationales for Mergers and Acquisitions|The paper contributes to the empirical literature on M&A deals performed by SOEs with a detailed analysis of the reported rationales from a sample of SOE-led acquisitions over the last decade. The sample includes 355 worldwide M&A deals performed by SOEs as acquirers over the period 2002-2012. The data set was obtained by combining firm-level information from two sources, Zephyr and Orbis (Bureau Van Dijk). The analysis is on a case-by-case basis for the rationales of the sample. Overall, the most important message arising from our analysis is that rescue of firms in financial distress is a relatively minor one role played by contemporary SOEs in spite of the Great Recession, while shareholder value maximization and long term strategic goals are more frequently the objective of the observed deals.
L33|The Financial Performance, Restructuring and Privatisation of the Shipyards in the Republic of Croatia|The shipbuilding industry in Croatia has a long history. Positioned on the Adriatic sea, Dalmatia has had a long tradition of maritime commerce and shipbuilding as well as other supporting activities. Over time the Croatian shipbuilding industry has been accorded different levels of strategic importance and support by the government. However, over the period from 2011 to 2015 the industry has undergone significant restructuring and faced changes to its competitive environment. Furthermore, it has received enormous levels of state support especially as Croatia prepared for the accession to the EU. The main objective of the paper is to explain the main characteristics of the processes in which the shipyards have been restructured, of the liabilities that the state has assumed pursuant to restructuring contracts and the liabilities and responsibilities that the new owners have taken on. Explained in particular will be the impact of restructuring on employment, wages, orders and the value of jobs contracted and deliveries.
L33|Offrir des biens publics et des communs et revitaliser l’action publique dans le cadre d’un processus de « destruction créatrice »|"Recent developments in the economic analysis about public goods and commons, initiated notably in relation to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and to the work of Elinor Ostrom, have highlighted the social utility of their production to meet societal expectations of democracy and of sustainable development. The production of public and social economy organisations is in this perspective of crucial importance for the future, as is the outline of public policies that help develop coproduction or joint production of public goods and services. Thus, Public and Social and Solidarity Economy Partnerships (PSSEP) are the subject of analyzes in the CIRIEC book Providing public goods and commons. Towards coproduction and new forms of governance for a revival of public action that highlights: the importance of these partnerships within the framework of the current paradigm of public action; the induced behavioral transformations of the organizations; the scope that these new forms of partnership can have in terms of co-construction of public action and of responses to expectations on the territories; and the place of these partnerships in a process called here ""creative destruction of public action""."
L33|Does market size matter for charities?|We analyze implications of market size for market structure in the charity sector. While a standard model of oligopolistic for-profit competition predicts a positive relationship between market size and firm size, our analogous model of competition between prosocially motivated charities predicts no such correlation. If charities are biased towards their own provision, a positive association between market size and provider size can arise. We examine these predictions empirically for six different local charity markets. Our empirical findings suggest that charities do not solely pursue prosocial objectives, and that increased competition in the charity sector can lead to rationalization in provision.
L33|Opportunism and hold-up in the incomplete public private partnership (PPP) contracts|Opportunism is a concern for contracts that are incomplete in the presence of bounded rationality and uncertainty. Since Public Private Partnership (PPP) contracts are incomplete, are these contracts prone to opportunism? This paper attempts to find the answer to this question. It examines the contract design of the Indian PPP road contracts and analyzes its strengths and weaknesses to avoid the opportunism or hold-up using the probabilistic framework. This framework suggests that each type of contract should have its own self-enforcing range to make it incentive compatible. This paper compares the risk allocated in the two types of contracts (i.e. linked and delinked contracts) for delivering the project on time. Further, it empirically tests these findings using 82 PPP projects. The low probability of timely completion and longer time overruns in the delinked projects indicate the presence of possible opportunism. A further analysis of delinked contracts shows that the same set of companies (which have both types of contracts in their portfolio) could exploit the incorrectly specified delinked contract to create a hold-up like situation. In consonance with the contract theory, the analysis suggests that extra leverage should be given with more accountability and better checks.
L33|Effects of contract governance on public private partnership (PPP) performance|Using the basic instruments of governance as highlighted in the transaction cost economics literature, this paper empirically examines the impact of differences in contract attributes on project outcomes. The hypothesis is to test whether better incentive structure and stricter administrative controls lead to more efficient project outcomes. It compares two sets of contracts (called as toll and annuity) from Indian PPP road projects which are designed for the same task and implemented under the similar conditions, but have some differences in the contract governance attributes. It carries out this exercise using data from more than 150 projects. The empirical findings highlight how instruments of governance influence the degree of efficiency in achieving the desired results. For instance, the annuity model, that has tighter budget constraint (i.e. better incentive structure) than the toll model, performs better in terms of minimizing cost and time overruns. Moreover, the results demonstrate that changes in administrative controls also influence outcomes. Stricter the control, better is the efficiency in the desired outcomes. The empirical findings could be useful to the policymakers for designing better contracts for the road as well as other infrastructure related sectors.
L33|The public sector of the Russian economy: it’s size and dynamics|Two main channels can be pointed out whereby the state participates in value added chains: through the operation of companies with state stakes, and through the services (in a broader sense of the work) produced by enterprises with state stakes and budget-funded organizations. Consequently, the assessment of the state sector scope inside the national economy consists, as a rule, of two components: an analysis of the relative share of biggest companies with state stakes – state-owned enterprises (SOE) in a country's aggregate economic statistics (the scope of state ownership); and an estimation of the input of the general government sector (GGS) in GDP.
L33|Federal property and privatization policy|2016 saw first publication of data from a performance measures framework for federal property management that was adopted on January 29, 2015 by Russian Government’s executive order No. 72 in lieu of performance measures for a public sector monitoring conducted by Rosstat in the early 2000s in pursuance of the Russian Government’s executive order No. 1 dated January 4, 1999 (as further amended on December 30, 2002). The performance measures framework contains data for the number of federal state unitary enterprises (FSUEs) and joint-stock companies (JSCs) with government equity participation that were previously published in privatization programs over a 3-year period (since 2011) and one-year period (prior to 2011). A new Forecast Plan (Program) for Federal Property Privatization and Guidelines for Federal Property Privatization for 2017–2019 adopted early in 2017[1] contains data dated only as of early 2016 (Table 1). As of early 2017, according to the Report of the Federal Agency for State Property Management (hereinafter Rosimushchestvo) on the implementation of privatization program for 2017–2019, the Russian Federation owned 1108 FSUEs and held an interest of 11 and 17 percent in 1416 JSCs and LLCs, respectively, marking a decline from the previous year’s number of economic agents with the same legal form of business. However, developments and processes that took place in 2017 only can be described using data from the performance measures framework for federal property management.
L33|The housing market in Russia's cities in 2017|The actual development pattern displayed by the Russian economy in 2017 only in part answered the expectations voiced by the expert community in late 2016. First of all, last year there was no sustainable recovery at the macroeconomic level. Although the year-end GDP growth rate amounted to 1.5 percent, it still demonstrated rather strong volatility of its index over the course of the year. However, the professional participants of the real estate market, as well as Russian businesses in general, usually look not at GDP or industrial output indices, but at the exchange rate of the national currency, the movement of wages and salaries, and consumer demand, because the latter better describe the existing risks, while the movement pattern of GDP serves only as a background indicator.
L33|Firm Ownership, Political Participation, and Access to Finance through Public Bond Offerings in China|This study examines how state versus private ownership and political participation by private entrepreneurs affect access to financing through the corporate bond market in China. We find that state ownership is positively related to the likelihood that a firm issues bonds and that firms controlled by ultimate owners who participate in politics are significantly more likely to issue bonds. We also show that state ownership as well as political participation by the ultimate owner is positively associated with the amount firms raise in bond offerings. Moreover, state firms characterized by over-investment tend to increase their excess investments after a bond offering. For under-investing private firms, existing suboptimal investment levels are alleviated by bond offerings. In addition, we find that private firms significantly increase their R&D investments after a public bond offering, especially those controlled by owners who participate in politics. Finally, bond offerings are associated with a significant decline in market value for SOEs. For firms controlled by an owner who participates in politics, the opposite holds true. These findings highlight the need to improve the existing credit allocation via the bond market and the important role political capital plays for private firms in China.
L33|What is the Cost of Privatization for Workers?|The world is in the midst of a new wave of privatization, with record dollar amounts raised in both developed and developing countries. Using rich Swedish registry data covering two decades from the mid-1990s, we show that privatizations increased unemployment incidence by almost a fifth, and duration by a quarter, relative to peers who remained employed by a state-owned enterprise. This led to almost one million extra days of unemployment for the workers affected. Wages and labor force participation remain unchanged. Furthermore, we show that privatizations have been costly for workers, and therefore for society, only if they took place during recessions. These results shed new light on the welfare costs of privatization and how they can be mitigated.
L33|Exploring Digital Time Measurement in the Public Sector: Labor Productivity and Service Quality in Home Care|We measure labor productivity in home care using new data from the recent introduction of digital time measurement in Swedish municipalities. By measuring worker utilization (delivered hours as a share of worked hours) we avoid several problems that have plagued previous studies of public sector productivity. The time use measure exposes substantial variation in productivity between home care units, suggesting room for improvement. More productive units deliver a larger share of the hours approved by care managers and have equally satisfied users.
L33|Choice and Competition in the Welfare State: Home Care as the Ideal Quasi-market|We study a reform by which a standardized model of choice and competition was introduced in tax-financed home care in a majority of Swedish municipalities. The market for home care is of particular interest since it is close to the ideal quasi-market. For identification, we exploit the different timing of reform implementation across municipalities. We find that the introduction of free choice and free entry in home care increased perceived quality by about one quarter of a standard deviation without affecting costs. Since satisfaction is unrelated to the private market share, the underlying mechanism seems to be new choice opportunities rather than competition or an advantage of private providers.

L33|“Do public-private partnership enabling laws increase private investment in infrastructure?”|Rising use of public-private partnerships, or PPPs, is an important development in U.S. infrastructure delivery. PPPs are detailed contracts between a public-sector infrastructure project sponsor and a private-sector provider that bundle delivery services. PPPs represent a middle ground between pure-public project delivery and complete privatization. As of 2016, thirty-five U.S. states had enacted PPP enabling laws. That legislation defines the broad institutional framework surrounding a PPP agreement. It addresses such questions as the mixing of public- and private-sector funds, the treatment of unsolicited PPP proposals, and need for prior legislative approval of PPP contracts, among other key issues. We provide the first thorough empirical assessment of the impact of PPP enabling laws on a state’s utilization of private investment. We analyze the overall effect of having a PPP enabling law while controlling for a variety of factors, including the state’s indebtedness, its broad political disposition, union membership, per-capita income, and other variables. We then assess the impact of thirteen individual PPP enabling-law provisions. We develop an expertinformed weighted index reflecting the degree to which a state’s law is encouraging or discouraging of private investment. We find that more favorable PPP enabling laws increase private investment: when our favorability index increases by one-tenth, the proportion of infrastructure investment delivered via PPP in a state increases by 0.5-0.6. We find that PPP enabling-law provisions allowing unsolicited proposals and the comingling of public and private funds are particularly important in attracting private investment.
L33|“When politics and lobbyism combine to promote white elephants by using PPPs”|Theoretical insights into the cooperation between public and private partners (PPPs) suggest that they can be an effective tool for preventing ‘white elephant’ type projects. However, various case studies have shown that this belief is largely dependent on the effective transfer of operational risk to the private partner, and on the application of user-pay funding. This paper goes one step further and explores the idea that private partners that participate in PPPs with no substantial risk transfer – and under heavily subsidized schemes – can act as lobbies, exerting pressure to develop white elephants.
L33|“Is Private Production of Hospital Services Cheaper than Public Production? A Meta-Regression of Public vs Private Costs and Efficiency for Hospitals”|The question of whether private organisations can outperform public ones in public service delivery has been a major topic of interest over the last few decades. However, empirical evidence does not systematically support the hypothesis of lower costs and higher efficiency when private organisations deliver public services. To better understand the cost and efficiency differences of public and private organisations, we conduct a metaregression analysis of econometric studies relating to hospital ownership and performance. We analyse 61 estimations extracted from health studies using public versus private hospital costs and efficiency as an independent variable. Our analysis shows a genuine true effect in favour of public sector hospitals. We found evidence that public production of health services may be cheaper if this is provided by the public sector. However, the results show that when technical efficiency is considered, the private sector performs better than the public counterpart. And the opposite happens when instead of considering technical efficiency we consider financial costs. We discuss how the divergence in the results is affected by factors such as country, year, use of panel data in the study, whether performance is measured by examining financial costs, or if the study considers not-for-profit hospitals, among others.
L33|Public Contracting for Private Innovation: Government Expertise, Decision Rights, and Performance Outcomes|We examine how the U.S. Federal Government governs R&D contracts with private-sector firms. The government chooses between two contractual forms: grants and cooperative agreements. The latter provides the government substantially greater discretion over, and monitoring of, project progress. Using novel data on R&D contracts and on the geo-location and technical expertise of each government scientist over a 12-year period, we test implications from the organizational economics and contracting literatures. We find that cooperative agreements are more likely to be used for early-stage projects and those for which local government scientific personnel have relevant technical expertise; in turn, cooperative agreements yield greater innovative output as measured by patents, controlling for endogeneity of contract form. The results are consistent with multi-task agency and transaction-cost approaches that emphasize decision rights and monitoring.
L33|The Role of Non-state Actors in the Integration of Refugees and Asylum Seekers|Significant variation across and within OECD countries reflects the diverse roles that non-state actors can play in the reception and integration of asylum seekers. This variation can be explained by the differences in the organisation of welfare service delivery, the various national schemes supporting employment and the specific legal frameworks allowing for the labour market access of asylum seekers, along with the inclination of local inhabitants to self-organise to face new challenges. Within the wide spectrum of non-state actors that provide assistance to refugees and asylum seekers, this paper focuses specifically on third sector organisations. Through a survey, it assesses the contribution of these organisations during the refugee crisis in Europe, from 2014 to 2016, in delivering reception and integration policies for refugees, protection holders and asylum seekers and in experimenting with innovative approaches. The paper concludes with a number of policy recommendations on the ways governments leverage the innovative capacity of third sector organisations in providing meaningful and effective initiatives to integrate refugees in the society, labour market and economy of host communities.
L33|Patient and impatient capital: time horizons as market boundaries|Since the 1980s privatisation and outsourcing have been promoted on grounds of efficiency and fiscal convenience. The argument here is that the appropriate choice between business and public enterprise is determined by the interaction between two time horizons, a financial time horizon and a project time horizon. The prevailing interest rate defines a credit time horizon. Among project appraisal methods, the payback period defines a unique temporal outer bound for private sector break-even. Net present value break-evens (and other forms of business credit) are always shorter. Any project which has a break-even longer than the payback period cannot be funded by business alone. Long-term projects encounter uncertainty and attempt to control it by means of rigid contracts, which also lead to inferior outcomes. This analysis accounts for historical patterns of enterprise. It also provides normative guidance. Public-private partnerships for infrastructure development intended to overcome credit time boundaries. They have given rise to inefficiency and corruption and are currently in decline. It is possible to overcome the temporal boundary with a â€˜franchiseâ€™ i.e. protection from uncertainty provided by social and government agencies. This allows longer credit break-evens, but at a cost in competitive efficiency. It is also prone to corruption. The time-horizon model undermines the standard argument for market superiority. It turns Hayek on his head: it is financial markets that require certainty, whereas social and public agencies manage in its absence.
L33| Opportunism and Third-Party Influence on Long-Term Public Contracts| The present paper refers to the influence of interest groups and stakeholders on government and concessionaire contractual behavior in long-term public contracts. In particular, we show how government political commitments with interest groups represent a ‘reputational investment’, which reduces the incentives to enforce the contract and increases the willingness to accept renegotiation proposals. This situation, particularly in the case of “high profile” or “politically sensitive” projects, when observed by the private concessionaire, can be exploited to capture additional quasi-rents from the exchange relationship. Using a simple model and a case study of the South Interoceanic Road Project in Peru, we show how interactions of the government with influential stakeholders, in the context of weak institutions, can create favorable conditions for private opportunistic behavior.

L33|The public sector and privatization policy|In 2016, statistical data began to be published in the framework of the newly introduced System of Public Property Management Efficiency Estimates. It was approved by Decree of the RF Government of 29 January 2015, No 72 and introduced by way of replacing the public sector monitoring data, collected and released by the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) since the late 1990s in accordance with the provisions stipulated in Decree of the RF Government of January 4, 1999, No 1 (as amended as of December 30, 2002). Among other things, the System of Public Property Management Efficiency Estimates contains data on the number of federal state unitary enterprises (FSUEs) and joint-stock companies (JSCs) with RF stakes in their capital, which previously were published as part of government privatization programs (from 2011 – for three-year period, and prior to 2011- for one-year period.
L33|Competitive Neutrality and the Cost and Quality of Welfare Services|Competition between private and public firms can increase service quality and reduce public costs in markets for tax-financed welfare services with non-contractible quality. Synergies arise from combining high-powered incentives for quality provision (emanating from private firms) with low rents (public firms). However, sometimes, the optimal regulation requires the government to provide public firms with better funding than private competitors, e.g. by paying them higher prices or covering their deficits. This additional compensation is not tied to any additional verifiable quality obligations and may therefore violate competitive neutrality rules incorporated to various areas of legislation.
L33|Management Practices and the Quality of Primary Care|Using the World Management Survey method, we map and analyse management quality in Swedish primary care centres. On average, private providers have higher management quality than public ones. We also find that centres with a high overall social deprivation among enrolled patients tend to have higher management quality. Regarding quality of care, we find that management quality is positively associated with accessibility, but not with patient reported experience.
L33|Nonprofit wages: theory and evidence|The nonprofit sectorâ€™s share of wage and salary employment in the US has increased over time, from about 5.5 percent in the mid-1990s to 7 percent in 2015. This chapter surveys the literature and presents new evidence on the employment and earnings of workers in the nonprofit sector since 1994. As compared to the private for-profit sector, nonprofits have a more educated and older workforce, with employment concentrated in health, education, and service occupations and industries. Standard wage level analysis indicates lower wages for men employed in nonprofits compared with male for-profit workers with similar measured attributes. No such penalty is found for women. Based on panel estimates of wage changes, we find no substantive wage penalties for either women or men moving between jobs in and outside the nonprofit sector. We conclude that wages in the nonprofit and for-profit sectors, on average, differ little for similar workers and jobs.
L33|Privatization of state holding corporations|Abstract Many countries have privatized part of their state holding corporations in recent years. However, the literature on this issue has analyzed mainly the privatization of uniproduct public firms. We consider a state holding corporation with two plants that may produce complement or substitute goods. Assuming that private firms are more efficient than the state holding corporation we find the following: If the marginal cost of the state corporation is low, it is not privatized either if goods are substitutes or if they are complements. However, if the marginal cost of the state corporation is high the two plants of the state holding corporation are sold to a single private investor if goods are complements, and to different investors if goods are substitutes. If goods are close substitutes and the marginal cost of the state corporation takes an intermediate value only one plant is privatized. We extend the model to consider that firms are equally efficient, that they face quadratic cost functions and that there are n uniplant private firms producing each good. We find two differences with the previous result: The government never privatizes just one plant of the state corporation, and when goods are complements the two plants of the state corporation are sold to different investors if n is high.
L33|Public Enterprises – Objectives and Performance|Public ownership is a way to provide goods and services where market performance is not satisfactory, or when the economy would otherwise be stagnant, provided that its costs do not overshadow its benefits. We provide a brief review of the existing theoretical and empirical literature. While far from exhaustive, the review suggests that there is no unanimous body of research showing that public ownership is inefficient to such an extent that private ownership is always socially superior. More research is needed on the costs and benefits of different forms of ownership, and we emphasise the need of analysing potential intrinsic motivation, service quality and the impact of international competition. Moreover, the fact that privatisation has often been implemented through outsourcing suggests a need of analysing renationalisation through buyer power.
L33|Basics of contract theory|"(Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences 2016 — Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstrom) The 2016 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstrom ""for their contributions to contract theory"". In their papers, they have demonstrated that strategic analysis of environments with asymmetric information might be very fruitful in providing answers to many natural economic questions: How should firms reward their managers? Why insurance contracts often include deductibles and co-payments? When do firms outsource and when do they prefer in-house production? In its brief exposition, the paper starts with the basics of contract theory and discusses some most important results of 2016 laureates."
L33|Public Sector Undertakings: Bharat's Other Ratnas|"This paper analyzes the performance of India's 235 public sector undertakings (PSUs) - India'ssocialistic legacy from the Nehru-Gandhi days. Of these 7 largest PSUs are called Maha Ratnas, 17 are called Nav Ratnas and some 73 are given the title of Mini Ratnas. The economic reforms of 1991 dismantled the ""license-raj"" but left the PSUs intact. Attempts were made to improve their performance through performance contracts called Memorandum of Understandings (MoUs) with some success but with still a large number of loss makers. A brief attempt was made under the NDA-1 government from 1999-2004 to begin dismantling this legacy with strategic disinvestment (privatization) but met with considerable opposition from vested interests and labour unions. Subsequent UPA governments tried to further improve the performance of these companies through better performance contracts and bringing more PSUs into the Ratna classification. Under UPA-2 more aggressive disinvestment (partial privatization) was also pursued to raise more revenue and hopefully improve firm performance. Using firm-level data over the period 1990-2015 from the Public Enterprise Survey now collated in the Capitaline Data Base, this paper looks into factors that explain the performance of these PSUs. The results show that MoUs have had a positive impact on PSU performance by increasing their return on capital (ROC) by almost 8-9 percentage points. This result holds mainly for the non-service sector (manufacturing, mining) but less so for service sector firms. In the case of service sector firms, partial privatization (share sales) has a significant impact on performance, making them ideal candidates for more aggressive disinvestment. The results also show that larger PSU-Maharatnas appear to perform better than smaller PSUs and even better than private firms of similar size. But smaller PSU-Navratnas and MiniRatnas perform worse than private companies and should be good candidates for strategic disinvestment (privatization). PSUs that do not have Ratna status, and are loss makers should be disposed of for their real estate and scrap value. We concludes that India should raise capital through strategic disinvestment (privatization), disinvestment and liquidation of up to $ 250 billion which can be re-invested in public infrastructure through the National Infrastructure Investment Fund and not into the budget as a revenue raising measure."
L33|Bolder Disinvestment or Better Performance Contracts? Which Way Forward for India's State-Owned Enterprises|This paper analyses the performance of India's Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) us-ing measures of labour and overall efficiency and productivity indicators as opposed to finan-cial returns. Using methods that correct for selection bias, the results show that performance contracts do not improve firm efficiency but disinvestment has a very strong positive effect on firm efficiency. Disinvestment improves labour productivity and efficiency, which is not surprising, but it also improves overall efficiency. India should pursue much bolder privati-zation even of PSUs which claim to be making operational profits - such as Air India, because privatization improves overall firm efficiency and unlocks capital for use elsewhere, espe-cially in public infrastructure, and reduces the possibility of political interference in their functioning in future.
L33|Adjudicator Compensation Systems and Investor-State Dispute Settlement|Compensation for adjudicators is generally considered as a core issue for judicial independence and for attracting good judges in the institutional design for courts. This paper examines compensation systems for adjudicators and dispute settlement administrators in investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). The paper uses in part a comparative perspective based on approaches in domestic courts in advanced economies, an approach rarely taken in analysing investor-state arbitration.The first section of the paper provides historical context and examines the reform of remuneration of judges to replace private litigant fees with salaries in colonial America and the United States, France and England in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Subsequent sections address debates over the impact of compensation systems on adjudicators; contemporary approaches to the compensation of judges in advanced economies; the co-existence in advanced economies of national courts with salaried judges since the early 19th century with generally strong support for commercial arbitration based on ad hoc fee-based remuneration; and similarities and differences between commercial arbitration and investment arbitration, focusing how the largely similar compensation systems may have different effects and be differently perceived by the public.Annexes to the paper report on discussions about adjudicator compensation at the 2016 OECD Investment Treaty Conference and gather some preliminary facts about adjudicator and dispute administrator compensation in investor-state arbitration as well as the investment court system included in the recent EU-Canada CETA trade and investment agreement.
L33|Productivity effects of the ownership concentration in employee–owned companies|Empirical research on the influence of the degree of ownership concentration in the employee–owned companies on their sales revenues thematically fits into the issue of efficiency of the direct privatisation method, in particular giving a state–owned enterprise for use against payment. The main goal of this article is to verify the research hypothesis stating that in employee–owned companies an increase in the degree of ownership concentration leads to an increase in sales revenues. In conducted empirical studies parameters of a Cobb–Douglas production function were estimated by Ordinary Least Squares method for two variants, differing in the way of measuring the degree of ownership concentration. The research hypothesis formulated in this paper was verified negatively as the increase in the degree of ownership concentration in employee–owned companies caused the decrease in their sales revenues.
L33|Spatial Price Discrimination and Privatization on Vertically Related Markets|We consider a vertically structured market with two retail firms of mixed ownership competing against each other exercising spatial price discrimination. We examine the strategic behavior of downstream rivals as well as the effect of privatization on the intensity of competition and welfare in two cases; when location decisions are taken sequentially and when location decisions are taken simultaneously. We show that production cost differentials are crucial in determining the Nash equilibrium locations (hence market shares) and the impact of the degree of privatization on the level of downstream competition. Privatization leads to stiffer competition when the mixed ownership firm has the cost advantage. However, it can be welfare enhancing only when decisions are taken sequentially with the follower being the semi-public firm having a moderate production cost advantage over the market leader. The results of our model generalize to capture the case of vertical mergers.
L33|Optimal Privatization Policy with Asymmetry among Private Firms|We revisit the relationship between the optimal privatization policy and market competition indexes such as the Hirschman--Herfindahl index, which is affected by the number of firms and asymmetry of size among these firms: the larger the number of firms (the less asymmetry among firms), the lower the market concentration index. The literature on mixed oligopolies suggests that the optimal degree of privatization is increasing with the number of private firms (and, thus, decreasing with the market competition index), assuming that all private firms are homogeneous. We investigate how the asymmetry among private firms affects the optimal degree of privatization. We propose the simplest and natural model formulation for discussing asymmetry among private firms. We find that the optimal degree of privatization is either nonmonotone or monopolistically increasing (and, thus, never monopolistically decreasing) in the asymmetry among private firms.
L33|The non-profit sector as a foundation for the interaction among the social economy, the public sector and the market|The paper introduces a theoretical model to show how in a territorial framework characterized by spatial inequalities, the availability of goods and services decreases moving from central to peripheral areas. Specifically, private firms and public administrations might supply an insufficient level of goods and services in socially and/or physically remote areas due to lack of market size and higher distance costs. Peripheralization, therefore, often implies economic marginalization and political exclusion. Against this backdrop, non-profit organizations can foster local development rebalancing, or at least narrowing, economic and social inequalities, but a territorial dualism between a core linked to global patterns of development and marginalized peripheries left to autarchic forms of subsistence might emerge. To avoid territorial polarization and revive equitable and sustainable development, it is important to empower cooperative and social enterprises, as the latter exert a productive and distributive function that at the same time improves workers’ employability, facilitates market access for local initiatives, and raises the factor productivity of market activities.
L33|Dynamic Privatization Policy|This study formulates a two‐period model of mixed oligopoly in which the government privatizes a state‐owned public firm over multiple periods. We introduce the shadow cost of public funding (i.e., the excess burden of taxation). The government is concerned about both the total surplus and the revenue obtained from the privatization of the public firm. We find that the government may or may not increase the degree of privatization over time depending on the competitiveness of the product market and nationality of private competitors. The government increases the degree of privatization over time if the product market is competitive and the foreign ownership share in private firms is low. Although it adjusts its privatization policy over time, this harms welfare. In addition, this distortion in the ex post incentive leads to too low a degree of privatization in the first period.
L33|School Management and Public–Private Partnerships in Uganda|Can the quality of school management explain differences in student test scores? In this paper, I present the first internationally benchmarked estimates of school management quality in Africa (based on the ‘World Management Survey’). The level and distribution of management quality is similar to that found in other low and middle-income countries (India and Brazil). I combine this data with individual student panel data, and demonstrate that differences in school management quality matter for student value-added—a standard deviation difference in management is associated with a 0.06 standard deviation difference in test scores. Finally, I contribute to understanding the role of the private sector in education in a low-income setting. Contrary to common perception, I find no difference between the quality of school management in government, private or public–private partnership (PPP) schools (despite the higher level of autonomy available to them). An exception is an internationally owned chain of PPP schools, which are as well managed as schools in the UK.
L33|Firms' Costs, Profits, Entries, and Innovation under Optimal Privatization Policy|We investigate how cost conditions of private firms affect optimal privatization policy and private firms' profits. We find that the optimal degree of privatization is decreasing with the costs of private firms unless the public firm is fully privatized in equilibrium. A cost reduction in a private firm increases the degree of privatization and benefits for all private firms. Therefore, each private firm's profit is increasing with its rival private firms' costs, which is in contrast to the result when the degree of privatization is given exogenously. This interesting property yields two important results. The profit of each private firm can increase with the number of private firms, and the positive externality of innovation accelerates private firms' R&D.
L33|Shadow Cost of Public Funds and Privatization Policies|We investigate the optimal privatization policy in mixed oligopolies with shadow cost of public funds (excess burden of taxation). The government is concerned with both the total social surplus and the revenue obtained by the privatization of a public firm. We find that the relationship between the shadow cost of public funds and the optimal privatization policy is non-monotone. When the cost is moderate, then higher the cost is, the lower is the optimal degree of privatization. However, this does not hold when the cost is high. A further increase of the cost might drastically increase the optimal degree of privatization.
L33|Competitive pressure from neighboring markets and optimal privatization policy|We formulate a mixed oligopoly model in which one state-owned public enterprise competes with n private firms in the same market and m private firms in the neighboring market. We investigate how n and m affect the optimal degree of privatization. The optimal degree of privatization is increasing with the number of private firms in the same market, and the relationship between the optimal degree of privatization and the number of private competitors in the neighboring market is an inverted U-shape. Our result suggests that more pressure from competitors supplying differentiated products can reduce the optimal degree of privatization. We also find that the optimal degree of privatization can increase with the foreign ownership share in private firms in the neighboring market.
L33|Tariffs and Privatization Policy in a Bilateral Trade Model with Corporate Social Responsibility|This paper considers an international bilateral trade model with corporate social responsibility (CSR) and examines the strategic interaction between tariffs and privatization policy. We demonstrate that strategic tariff in a private market is higher than that in a mixed market, while efficient tariff in a private market is lower than that in a mixed market. We then show that privatization policy raises strategic tariff and worsens (improves) domestic welfare when the degree of CSR is low (high). Further, we investigate endogenous choice of privatization policy and demonstrate that both the countries choose nationalization policy even though privatization policy is globally optimal when the degree of CSR is high. This indicates the existence of a prisoner’s dilemma in choosing privatization policy in a bilateral trade model with higher CSR.
L33|Partial Privatization under Multimarket Price Competition|We investigate the effect of multimarket contacts on the privatization policy in mixed duopoly with price competition. There are two markets, one of which is served solely by the state-owned public firm, and the other is served by both public and private firms. Two markets are linked by the production technology of the public firm. In the general model, we first show that privatization is never optimal in the absence of multimarket contacts, i.e., if there is only one monopoly market or one duopoly market. Then, using a linear-quadratic specification, we show that a positive degree of privatization can be optimal in the presence of multimarket contacts. This result has an implication for the privatization policy in universal service sectors.
L33|Supply function equilibria and nonprofit-maximizing objectives|We examine the supply function equilibrium (SFE) that is often used in the analysis of multi-unit auctions, such as wholesale electricity markets, among (partially privatized) public firms. We show that in a duopoly model with linear demand and quadratic cost functions, both a partially privatized public firm and a profit-maximizing firm offers flatter supply functions as equilibrium strategies, resulting in a larger social surplus, when the public firm focuses more on social welfare. This implies that the full nationalization is optimal if firms compete in SFE, in contrast to a Cournot case, which has been used as an approximation of the wholesale electricity markets. We also confirm that the SFE converges to the (inverse) marginal cost function when the firms’ social concern is improved symmetrically in the industry.
L33|How Costly is Social Screening? Evidence from the Banking Industry|Social banks screen loan applicants by using both social and financial criteria, and social screening implies an extra workload. To check the costs involved in this type of screening we use balance-sheet information on European banks, and compare the operating costs of social banks with those of other banks. Surprisingly, our first results suggest that social banks' costs are not significantly higher than those of their mainstream counterparts. Next, we uncover that the extra costs of social screening are offset by a cheaper workforce. Despite their need for specific screening, social banks are financially sustainable in a market dominated by for-profit institutions.
L33|A comment on mixed oligopoly spatial model: the non-uniform consumer distribution|Abstract We allow a general (non-uniform) consumer distribution in a mixed duopoly Hotelling model. We characterize respective conditions under which socially optimal pricing and location are achieved. We find that, while the condition for socially optimal pricing is fairly general, that for a socially optimal location is much more restrictive. Consequently, using a public firm to regulate a market may continue to yield a socially optimal price, but not the socially optimal location. This implies that privatization of the public firm may be desirable.
L33|Public Private Partnership management effects on road safety outcomes|Public Private Partnerships (PPP) have become common in providing high-quality infrastructure in many countries worldwide. One of the main reasons for PPP agreements is to improve efficiency and quality in the delivery of public services, as well as to boost investments for expensive projects. Despite PPPs having been particularly widespread in the case of the construction and rehabilitation of high-capacity road infrastructure, their impact in terms of road safety outcomes is still unexplored. This paper studies the effects of PPPs on road safety outcomes by taking advantage of the variety of management models provided in the Spanish highway network. Results based on a panel-data fixed-effects method show that the most relevant aspect influencing road safety outcomes is the quality of design of the road. However, we find strong evidence suggesting that privately operated highways perform better in terms of road safety outcomes than publicly operated highways, for roads with a similar quality of design.
L33|Power Politics: Electoral Cycles in German Electricity Prices|We provide evidence that German public energy providers, over which municipality-level politicians hold substantial sway, systematically adjust the pricing of electric energy in response to local electoral cycles. The documented pattern is in line with both, an artificial reduction in prices before an election that needs to be countermanded by future price increases, and an artificial postponement of market-driven price increases until after the election is over.
L33|How important are SOEs and MNEs in Vietnam’s economy?| This paper examines patterns and changes of shares of the state sector, including stateowned enterprises (SOEs) and other state entities, and foreign multinational enterprises (MNEs) in Vietnam since the mid-1990s. Because most Vietnamese are still self-employed or household workers with little or no connection to the state sector or MNEs, it is important to exclude the household sector from these comparisons. First, ownership shares vary markedly among economic activities. For example, economy-wide estimates indicate that MNEs and state sector have both been relatively small employers, but larger producers. MNEs have also become by far the largest exporters. Second, ownership shares and their trends vary substantially depending on the data source. Most conspicuously, SOE shares of nonhousehold enterprise employment and sales have decreased rapidly since 2000. On the other hand, economy-wide estimates of state shares in non-household employment and GDP declined much more slowly. Recent discrepancies between these estimates have become so large that they almost certainly result from errors in one or more data sources. There are also smaller discrepancies between corresponding, alternative estimates of MNE shares. The extent of privatization of SOEs and its economic effects are thus ambiguous in Vietnam, creating important concerns for academics and policy makers.
L33|Change in the Ownership Policy Paradigm in Poland: State Control vs. Privatisation|The paper presents an analysis of the shift in the ownership policy of the Polish government in office since 2015 towards a more active role of the state and a more reluctant attitude towards privatisation. This shift reflects a general change in the paradigm of the role of the state towards the concept of the state as a strong market player, which includes the strengthening of its ownership functions. Among others, it has led to stalling the privatisation process and concentrating only on its fiscal goals. Possible factors causing this statist shift are divided into two dichotomic groups: the government’s good faith vs. the impact of rent-seeking interest groups and endogenous vs. exogenous factors. Our main conclusion is that despite similarities with the trends observed in some other countries, endogenous factors such as increasing capture of the state by rent-seeking groups, and not the exogenous ones, including the global financial crisis, contributed most to the growing statist trends in the Polish state’s ownership policy.
L33|Municipal socialism or municipal capitalism? The performance of local public enterprises in Italy|This paper evaluates the performance of Italian local public enterprises (LPEs) with respect to their private sector counterparts. We address the following questions: i) do LPEs perform worse than (comparable) private firms?; ii) does the performance gap depend on the ownership structure (the share held by the public) or on the market structure (the degree of competition in the sector)?; iii) which are the main determinants of LPEs' performance in terms of productivity? The main findings – which are robust to the possible endogeneity of the ownership structure – are as follows: i) LPEs perform less well than private companies by about 8 percent in terms of TFP; ii) although both ownership structure and market structure matter, our results suggest that the ownership structure is more important; and iii) the performance gap of LPEs with respect to private firms seems to be driven by over-capitalization rather than by over-employment.
L33|Stakeholder Orientation and Capital Structure in the Social Care Sector|Nonprofit enterprises differ from for-profit firms at least along two dimensions: the stakeholder-oriented governance system and the nondistribution-of-profit constraint. In turn, these two dimensions can affect the firms' choice of capital structure. On these grounds, the paper investigates the role played by stakeholder orientation and nondistribution constraint in shaping capital structure differences between for-profits and nonprofits. We show that the stakeholder orientation positively affects firms' leverage, while the nondistribution constraint has a negative impact. We empirically investigate which effect dominates by studying the Italian social care sector, where for-profit and profit enterprises coexist and have similar market shares. The estimates of a partial adjustment dynamic model show that, ceteris paribus, the leverage of mature nonprofit enterprises is 8% to 14% lower than that of mature for-profit companies.
L33|Divestitures and the financial conglomerate excess value|We study a sample of the world’s largest financial conglomerates from 15 countries and we track their largest divestitures over the period 2005–2016. We develop a novel market-based metric to analyse the impact of divestitures on financial conglomerate excess value, and our findings point to divestitures having a significant impact on financial conglomerate valuation, contributing to a reduced conglomerate discount. Our results are driven by sales of financial service assets. Selling assets unrelated to the financial sector has no significant effect on conglomerate excess value. These results are robust with the inclusion of multiple control variables and alternative econometric model specifications. Altogether these results cast doubts on the existence of large benefits for financial conglomerates from combining financial service activities. This study has implications both for financial conglomerate boards who might direct their strategies to downsize their firms, and for regulators who address issues related to financial stability.
L33|Can Outsourcing Improve Liberia’s Schools? Preliminary Results from Year One of a Three-Year Randomized Evaluation of Partnership Schools for Liberia|After one year, public schools managed by private contractors in Liberia raised student learning by 60 percent, compared to standard public schools. But costs were high, performance varied across contractors, and contracts authorized the largest contractor to push excess pupils and underperforming teachers onto other government schools.
L33|The effect of hospital ownership on quality of care: Evidence from England|We investigate whether quality of care differs between public and private hospitals in England using data on 3.8 million publicly-funded patients receiving 133 planned (non-emergency) treatments in 393 public and 190 private hospital sites. Private hospitals treat patients with fewer comorbidities and past hospitalisations. Controlling for observed patient characteristics and treatment type, private hospitals have fewer emergency readmissions. But patients’ choice of hospital may influenced by their unobserved morbidity. After instrumenting the choice of hospital type by the difference in distances from the patient to the nearest public and the nearest private hospital, the effect of private ownership changes sign and is statistically insignificant. Similar results are obtained with coarsened exact matching. We also find no quality differences between hospitals specialising in planned treatments and other hospitals, nor between for-profit and not-for-profit private hospitals. Our results show the importance of controlling for unobserved patient heterogeneity when comparing quality of public and private hospitals.
L33|Do Private Water Utilities Operators Care about Regulatory Agencies in Developing Countries ?|This paper shows that the creation of an independent regulatory agency (IRA) is often not a necessary or sufficient condition to help countries attract private participation in the operation and financing of the water and sanitation sector of developing countries. The odds of an impact are, however, significantly higher for Latin American and Caribbean countries and to a lesser extent Eastern European countries, than for any other region. Higher income levels and higher prices are also correlated with a higher effectiveness of IRAs in attracting private sector financing. The analysis of the impact on the various types of PPP contracts shows that, at the margin, IRAs are irrelevant in general, to the contract choice, except for greenfield projects for which IRAs may be counterproductive at the margin.
L33|Do state and foreign ownership affect investment efficiency? Evidence from privatizations|Using the high-power setting of newly privatized firms from 64 countries, we examine the relationship between ownership type and firm-level capital allocations as captured by the sensitivity of investment expenditure to investment opportunities. Consistent with our predictions that government and foreign institutional owners are associated with different levels of information asymmetry and agency problems, we find strong and robust evidence that government (foreign) ownership weakens (strengthens) investment-Q sensitivity, thereby increasing investment inefficiency (efficiency). Moreover, we find that the relation between foreign ownership and investment efficiency is stronger when governments relinquish control and country-level governance institutions are weaker. Overall, our findings highlight the important role of ownership type in determining firms' investment behavior and efficiency.
L33|Growth and growth obstacles in transition economies: Privatized versus de novo private firms|In this study, we employ the World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) data collected in 2002, 2005, and 2009 for 21499 firms from 27 Eastern European and Central Asian countries to examine firm-level growth constraints faced by privatized firms versus those faced by the originally (de novo) private firms. We find that the de novo firms experience significantly higher financial, corruption, and legal obstacles than the privatized firms. We further document that, even though faced with more obstacles in the business environment, the de novo firms outperform the privatized firms. One explanation is that the profit motive of the de novo firms is organic, whereas the profit motive of the privatized firms is acquired. The organic profit motive may be powerful enough for the de novo firms to overcome more difficulties in the business environment and excel. Our study is the first in the privatization literature to go beyond performance comparisons and examine firm-level growth constraints.
L33|Ownership and environmental regulation: Evidence from the European electricity industry|The paper investigates how ownership affects the environmental performance in developed countries where environmental regulation is introduced in the form of market-based instrument. By looking at a cross-country panel dataset of 29 power markets around Europe over the period 1990–2012, we find empirical evidence that an increase of public ownership, as measured by the OECD ETCR index, is associated with a reduction of both greenhouse gas emissions and carbon intensity. We also find that the implementation of the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) had a limited impact on emissions' reduction due to lax allocation of allowances. The positive effect of public ownership on environmental performance has been significant even after the introduction of the ETS, giving additional incentives to mitigate emissions when the ETS cap was not stringent enough. This evidence suggests that government control over power companies in Europe can has created idiosyncratic incentives to improve environmental quality, complementing environmental regulation in the achievement of environmental goals when the latter was absent or sub-optimal.
L33|Governments in the market for corporate control: Evidence from M&A deals involving state-owned enterprises|Recent evidence suggests that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are increasingly taking over other firms. Such domestic or transborder acquisitions are the reverse of privatizations, where SOEs are the target of private investors. The question we ask is whether, because of the specific objectives and risks faced by governments, SOEs deviate from the benchmark of deals involving private firms on both sides of the merger and acquisition (M&A) transaction. To answer this new research question, we focus on a set of firm-level characteristics of the targets and acquirers involved in the deals. We built an original dataset of 31,479 deals in 138 countries drawing from Zephyr and Orbis (Bureau Van Dijk) data. Empirical results of multinomial logit and OLS models show that deals involving SOEs are clearly different from the benchmark of private–private deals. This is mainly due to the greater assets, higher solvency ratios, broader experience of deals, and closer proximity to targets of the acquirers (both public and private) under public–private, public–public, and private–public deals compared to private–private deals.
L33|The targets of state capitalism: evidence from M&A deals|Over the last decade, particularly after the Great Recession, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have been expanding their role in the global economy, including through merger & acquisitions (M&As). What are the characteristics of the firms targeted by SOEs? Are they different from firms controlled by private investors? By looking at a unique sample of around 25,000 M&As occurred over the period 2005–2012, we find that only SOEs controlled by means of minority of stakes (state-invested enterprises, SIEs) do not show any statistically significant difference in their targeting strategy compared to private enterprises. Conversely, majority-owned SOEs, and in particular financial SOEs buy lower performing firms compared to private acquirers. We interpret this fact as evidence of the internalization of political objectives by fully controlled and financial SOEs, but not by SIEs.
L33|Charity, incentives, and performance|We propose that donating profits to charity may improve firm performance through reduced moral hazard and increased effort in incomplete contract environments. This proposition is tested and confirmed in an incomplete contract principal-agent laboratory experiment where principals’ profits are donated to charity. The results show that both principals and agents have higher earnings in treatments where principals are working on behalf of a charity. Only in the charity treatments do agents respond positively to the effort levels suggested by the principals, and do higher requested levels of effort result in higher principal earnings.
L33|Self-selection Bias and the Listing Status of Target Firms: Value Effects in the Spanish Market|As corporate announcement decisions are non–random events, standard OLS estimations must be corrected for the self–selection bias. In the M&A field several studies suggest that previous evidence on univariate analysis of abnormal returns is not fully reliable. We examine whether using the standard Heckman two–step estimation procedure to correct for endogeneity significantly changes the previous evidence with respect to the decision to acquire a listed versus an unlisted firm. Our results show that this correction does not change the conclusions drawn from unconditional abnormal returns. Therefore, we emphasize that the existence of self–selection bias should not mean a general invalidation of the previous evidence.
L33|Russia's Billionaires|Using data collected by Forbes since the 1990s, I examine the emergence and survival of the super-wealthy in Russia over the past two decades and compare Russia's record to those of other countries. The major surge in the number of Russian billionaires came in the mid-2000s, mirroring the dynamic worldwide. While early billionaires were predominantly found in the oil, gas, metals, and banking sectors, the distribution has become more diverse, now including some in trade, real estate, chemicals, and information technology. Only a minority of today's Russian billionaires acquired significant assets in the privatization of the 1990s.
L33|Multinational Enterprises and Vietnam’s Exports: Comparing Economy-wide and Firm-level Evidence| This paper examines the role of foreign multinational enterprises (MNEs) have played in Vietnam’s exports in 1995-2014. Economy-wide estimates suggest MNE share of Vietnam’s export grew from about one quarter to about two-thirds during this period. MNE shares of GDP were much smaller (6 to 18 percent); correspondingly export-production ratios were much (4.7 to 9.6 times) higher in MNEs than in the non-MNEs sector. If comparisons are limited to formal enterprises, wholly-foreign MNEs (WFs), which account for the vast majority of MNEs in Vietnam, tend to have relatively high export propensities and account for the vast majority of MNE exports. These data thus suggest that MNEs, and particularly WFs, make unusually large direct contributions to exports in Vietnam compared to other economic activities. On the other hand, these compilations cannot establish if export propensities differ significantly among ownership groups after accounting for other, related firm-level and industry-level characteristics. Most importantly, this paper highlights several substantial problems revealed by compilations of the firm-data which much be addressed before more reliable, rigorous analysis of the firm-level data will be possible.
L33|Key Factors for Success of Social Enterprises in Italy: Analysis of Financial and Operating Performance|Assessing social performance is one of the greatest challenges for practitioners and researchers in social entrepreneurship. Even though social enterprises (SEs) have the main goal of achieving social purposes, they should also be able to economically and financially survive to meet their aim and accomplish their tasks. To this purpose, we investigate if the key factors leading to the financial and operating performance are the same as those of for-profit firms, by using Italian data at a firm level during the period 2002-2013. We find that the standard financial and operating factors characterising for-profit firms¡¯ performance play a crucial role for SEs¡¯ results as well. Moreover, territorial and socio-economic variables seem to have a positive impact on financial performance. From a policy perspective, this may imply that further programs (e.g. safety-oriented and those promoting facilities in the territory) should be locally adopted to support the SEs¡¯ activity and development.
L33|Labour, Profit and Housing Rent Shares in Italian GDP: Long-Run Trends and Recent Patterns|The share of labour increased in the first half of the 1970s, declined slowly to its 1960s level in 2001, and since then has been rising. Between 1975 and 2001, the decline in the labour share was due in part to the recovery in profits, and in part to a steady increase in housing rents on GDP, to 13% of value added (5% in 1975) and almost 40% of capital income (20% in the mid-1970s). Net of housing rents, the share of profits fell to a historical low during the great recession. In the business sector net of housing, recovery of the labour share, magnified by the recent recession, was evident in manufacturing and industries other than regulated sectors (energy, transport, communications and finance), where privatizations and changes to regulation provoked a marked drop in the labour share in the late 1990s. I tentatively explain the trend reversal in the labour share, which started well before the onset of the crises, as due to a compression in the mark-ups on marginal costs and the difficulty experienced by Italian firms to be rewarded for their innovation efforts (product quality upgrading)in a more competitive environment.
L33|Privatization In Serbia – An Assesment Before The Last Round|Serbia has had a long history of privatization. It commenced in 1990 and was only fully completed, as defined by the privatization legislation, in 2015. The reasons for this are many and complex and the paper provides a short historical overview. Privatization, however, began in earnest after the democratic revolution of 2000 and the paper analyses the political motives behind the adoption of the current model. The paper goes on to explain the model design, as well as its dynamics and results. The analysis probes more deeply into the specific weaknesses of auction implementation, showing that an alternative approach could have produced better results in terms of revenue. The specific institutional flaws that led to a high failure rate in the privatization of companies are identified and analysed. These weaknesses lie in the design, implementation, and monitoring, which led to results that were not in line with the goals of the privatization process. The designers of the privatization model gave scant attention to broader institutional coherence, which enabled largescale manipulation of the process. In some cases this enabled motives unrelated to the future of the firm being privatized to dominate the process. Finally, the scope of the, last round of privatization in Serbia, which commenced in June 2015, and the probable results are discussed.
L33|In Medio Stat Virtus: Does A Mixed Economy Increase Welfare?|Over the past few decades, social enterprises have grown remarkably. This paper investigates how social enterprises affect access to social services (e.g., education and health-care) and utilitarian welfare. To this end, two economic systems are compared: a market economy system, where all firms are profit maximizers, and a mixed economy system, where both for-profit businesses and social enterprises are present. Findings show that individuals are more likely to have access to social services within mixed economy. Moreover, conditions are derived under which utilitarian welfare is larger within mixed economy. Public policies in support of social enterprises (e.g., subsidies) are shown to result in the following trade-off: access to social services is further enhanced but utilitarian welfare is more likely to be lower than that within market economy.
L33|Customer Ownership And Quality Provision In Public Services Under Asymmetric Information|The implementation of projects producing external effects is often a source of disagreement and conflict between hosting and non-hosting communities.The paper focuses on the impact of participatory ownership on conflict resolution and social welfare in the presence of asymmetric information and imperfect quality monitoring. We show that in such situations the participatory solution may help solve �Not-in-my-backyard� (Nimby) crises and similar deadlocks that money transfers to a for-profit operator cannot solve. The analysis highlights two main factors behind this fact. First, a customer-owned cooperative internalizes, at least partially, the external effects generated by the project. Second, the alignment of cooperative members' preferences with those of the social planner reduces (in some cases eliminates) the distortions caused by information asymmetries.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L33|Privatization, Unemployment, and Welfare in the Harris-Todaro Model with a Mixed Duopoly|This paper explores the unemployment and welfare effects of privatization through the Harris-Todaro model with a mixed duopoly. Our approach is more generalized than the existing literature. When capital is sector-specific (i. e., it is in the short run), an increase in the degree of partial privatization will raise the unemployment rate, but the change of social welfare is conditional on the market share of the public firm and the relative degree of partial privatization. When capital is sector-mobile (i. e., it is in the long run), an increase in the degree of partial privatization will reduce the unemployment rate, but the change of social welfare is also dependent on the market share of the public firm and the relative degree of partial privatization. Our results capture the fact that the public firm and the private firm usually coexist in a competitive environment in the real world.
L33|Does competition from private surgical centres improve public hospitals' performance? Evidence from the English National Health Service|This paper examines the impact of a government programme which facilitated the entry of for-profit surgical centres to compete against incumbent National Health Service hospitals in England. We examine the impact of competition from these surgical centres on the efficiency – measured by pre-surgery length of stay for hip and knee replacement patients – and case mix of incumbent public hospitals. We exploit the fact that the government chose the broad locations where these surgical centres (Independent Sector Treatment Centres or ISTCs) would be built based on local patient waiting times – not length of stay or clinical quality – to construct treatment and control groups that are comparable with respect to key outcome variables of interest. Using a difference-in-difference estimation strategy, we find that the government-facilitated entry of surgical centres led to shorter pre-surgery length of stay at nearby public hospitals. However, these new entrants took on healthier patients and left incumbent hospitals treating patients who were sicker. This paper highlights a potential trade-off that policymakers face when they promote competition from private, for-profit firms in markets for the provision of public services.
L33|Market structure, patient choice and hospital quality for elective patients|We examine the change in the effect of market structure on hospital quality for elective procedures (hip and knee replacements, and coronary artery bypass grafts) following the 2006 loosening of restrictions on patient choice of hospital in England. We allow for time-varying endogeneity due to the effect of unobserved patient characteristics on patient choice of hospital using Two Stage Residual Inclusion. We find that the change in the effect of market structure due to the 2006 choice reforms was to reduce quality by increasing the probability of a post-operative emergency readmission for hip and knee replacement patients. There was no effect of the choice reform on hospital quality for coronary bypass patients. We find no evidence of self-selection of patients into hospitals, suggesting that a rich set of patient-level covariates controls for differences in casemix.
L33|Does independent needs assessment limit supply-side moral hazard in long-term care?|The decision about the amount and type of care that a patient needs may be entrusted to health care providers or be delegated to an independent assessor. An independent assessment limits the scope for supply-side moral hazard and occurs frequently in long-term care (LTC), e.g. in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, and Japan. The characteristics of LTC, the potential lack of incentives for efficient use for consumers, providers and third-party payers, and the absence of other restrictions of supply and demand, suggest that there may be room for excessive LTC use in the Netherlands, so there might be a case for independent needs assessment. Unique individual level data about LTC-eligibility decisions and use show that consumers make use of the indicated type of care but that for virtually all subgroups in the population there is considerable non-take-up, meaning that the independent assessment does not limit the amount of care that patients use. This finding suggests that the independent needs assessment may only have a small effect on preventing supply-side moral hazard in LTC.
L33|Effects of foreign direct investments. Evidence from Southeast Europe|The purpose and research objective of this study is probing effects of foreign direct investments in Southeast Europe economies. For this purpose six countries have been chosen and a sample has been drawn for: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia. In order to conduct this analysis we use Enterprise Surveys available by the World Bank which are done using firm-level data of a representative sample of economy's private sectors. The conception of this analysis is examining the effects of how foreign direct investments contribute to the development of domestic firms and the overall economy. In general, foreign direct investment is defined as dominant or controlling ownership of a company in one country, by an entity based in another country. As of the beginning of the transition process, foreign direct investments remain priority, as essential pillar, that moves forward the society toward developed market economy. The data used in this article are analyzed with an econometric model, which as employed in this study examines the interrelationships between output and set of variables that influence FDI patterns. Further, we are interested in the way foreign direct investments shape the economy.
L33|International Experience of Public-Private Partnership in Financial Management of Higher Education|The article describes the international and Russian experience of higher education establishments in both fundraising and search for off-budgetary sources of income; studies the international practice of using the capabilities of charitable foundations to finance both education process and research projects in higher educational establishments; views the prospects of applying the West-European countries’ experience of public-state partnership in education under the current Russian economy.
L33|Logistics and Supply Chain Related Issues Faced by Malaysian SMEs: A Case Study|This study uses a case study approach in order to identify the logistics and supply chain related issues faced by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia. Previous study revealed that the causes of the failure of SMEs are both internal and external and one of the external factors identified are non-availability or deficiency in logistics and supply chain management. Based on these findings, this study is conducted in order to further focus on the logistics and supply chain related issues. Thus, the objective of this study is to identify the logistics and supply chain issues faced by SMEs in Malaysia. Data were collected through case study interviews with five SMEs. The case study interviews reveal two most common issues confronted by these firms, namely customer service and inventory management issues. These two issues are related to one another as lack of inventory will lead to SMEs inability to fulfil their customer needs. Firms themselves need to rectify these issues as they may result in loss of sales, which will eventually result in loss of customers. The finding also indicates the important role of external supply chain members such as the supplier, carrier or third-party logistics service providers as they directly influence the level of customer services provided by SMEs.
L33|Investment efficiency, state-owned enterprises and privatisation: Evidence from Viet Nam in Transition|Our research firstly tests the difference in investment efficiency between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and private firms and secondly evaluates the effect of privatisation and equitisation policies on the investment efficiency of former state owned enterprises (SOEs). We use a novel dataset from Viet Nam which covers large and non-listed SMEs across construction, manufacturing, and service sectors. Our methodology uses a structural model to test the relationship between Tobin's Q and capital spending. While evident differences in investment efficiency are found across heterogeneous groups of private firms (size, industry, financially constrained and location), we find no evidence of investment spending being linked to marginal returns by SOEs across all sectors and size classes. However, former SOEs that have been privatised and equitized with a minority state shareholding display positive links between Q and investment. In fact, the link is stronger for these firms than for private firms. Differences are also evident across size and sector highlighting that the method of divestment chosen by government shareholders has a differential impact on efficiency across groups of firms and industries.
L33|Where does privatization work? Understanding the heterogeneity in estimated firm performance effects|Why do the reported effects of privatization on firm performance vary so much? This paper provides new estimates of these effects and tests potential explanations for heterogeneity using comprehensive, long-panel data for 70,000 firms in five East European economies. We estimate that privatization raises measures of profitability, productivity, and growth by about 5–12% on average, but with substantial variation across countries and time periods. Analyzing heterogeneity in privatization effectiveness, we find little systematic role for firm size, financial dependence, exchange listing, or technological complexity, but important variation by fraction privatized, ownership concentration, firm quality, and the macroeconomic and institutional environment.
L33|Does firm ownership structure matter? Evidence from sugar mills in India|This paper examines the effect of firm ownership structure on firm behavior and the economic outcomes of upstream suppliers by comparing privately owned sugar mills to cooperatives and public mills in India. In this setting, government support for cooperative and public mills allows meaningful variation in ownership structure to be observed, while the “command area” zoning system – whereby mills are given monopsony power to operate within an assigned area – helps tackle the identification challenge. The borders of command areas allow for a geographic regression discontinuity design, where underlying soil, weather, and institutional characteristics are exactly the same but ownership structure changes across boundaries. Using satellite images overlaid on digital maps to measure sugarcane grown along the borders, as well as a survey to determine the effects of crop choices on farmer welfare, I find that private mills encourage sugarcane production. Greater cane cultivation is tied to better credit provided by private mills, and it results in higher income and consumption for farmers.
L33|Nash bargaining and renegotiation with social preferences: case of the roundwood log supply contracts in the French timber market|By considering the French forest-based sector, we study both negotiation and renegotiation between a public timber and roundwood log supplier, which can be either public-interest-oriented or profit-maximizing, and a profit-maximizing lumber manufacturer. We first prove that the Nash bargaining game yields a unique equilibrium log supply contract, at which the negotiation takes only place on the prices. We then find that the expected profit-maximizing is achieved when the supplier's public interest and the manufacturer's bargaining power are strategic substitutes. The renegotiation reveals the presence of a memory effect over the quantities issued from bargaining. Our results can be generalized to all economic settings that revolve around public interest and commodity risk management.
L33|Corruption in PPPs, incentives and contract incompleteness|We analyze risk allocation and contractual choices when public procurement is plagued with moral hazard, private information on exogenous shocks, and threat of corruption. Complete contracts entail state-contingent clauses that compensate the contractor for shocks unrelated to his own effort. By improving insurance, those contracts reduce the agency cost of moral hazard. When the contractor has private information on revenues shocks, verifying messages on shocks realizations is costly. Incomplete contracts do not specify state-contingent clauses, thereby saving on verifiability costs. This makes incomplete contracts attractive even though they entail greater agency costs. Because of private information on contracting costs, a public official may have discretion to choose whether to procure under a complete or an incomplete contract. When the public official is corrupt, such delegation results in incomplete contracts being chosen too often. Empirical predictions on the use of incomplete contracts and policy implications on the benefits of standardized contracts are discussed.
L33|Free trade agreements and privatization policy with an excess burden of taxation|We introduce the excess burden of taxation into a bilateral trade, two-country and two-mixed market model, in which a state-owned enterprise in each country competes with both domestic and foreign private enterprises. We show that the welfare effect of privatization and free trade agreements (FTAs) depends on the shadow cost of the excess burden of taxation. We also show that privatization without an FTA can reduce social welfare and that privatization with an FTA improves (reduces) social welfare when the shadow cost is low (high). We then examine an FTA-coordination game and show that nationalization is a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium; without an FTA it reduces welfare when the shadow cost is low, and with an FTA it improves welfare when the shadow cost is high. Finally, we show that privatization policy can play the role of commitment device to encourage parties to agree to an FTA and thus, it can improve both domestic and global welfare when the shadow cost is low.
L33|Cost versus control: Understanding ownership through outsourcing in hospitals|For-profit hospitals in California contract out services much more intensely than either private nonprofit or public hospitals. To explain why, we build a model in which the outsourcing decision is a trade-off between cost and control. Since nonprofit firms are more restricted in how they consume net revenues, they experience more rapidly diminishing value of a dollar saved, and they are less attracted to a low-cost but low-control outsourcing opportunity than a for-profit firm is. This difference is exaggerated in services where the benefits of controlling the details of production are particularly important but minimized when a fixed-cost shock raises the marginal value of a dollar of cost savings. We test these predictions in a panel of California hospitals, finding evidence for each and that the set of services that private non-profits are particularly interested in controlling (physician-intensive services) is very different from those than public hospitals are particularly interested in (labor-intensive services). These results suggest that a model of public or nonprofit make-or-buy decisions should be more than a simple relabeling of a model derived in the for-profit context.
L33|Privatization and quality: Evidence from elderly care in Sweden|Non-contractible quality dimensions are at risk of degradation when the provision of public services is privatized. However, privatization may increase quality by fostering performance-improving innovation, particularly if combined with increased competition. We assemble a large data set on elderly care services in Sweden between 1990 and 2009 and estimate how opening to private provision affected mortality rates – an important and not easily contractible quality dimension – using a difference-in-difference-in-difference approach. The results indicate that privatization and the associated increase in competition significantly improved non-contractible quality as measured by mortality rates.
L33|The long-run effects of privatization on productivity: Evidence from Canada|From a public policy perspective, the social value of privatization depends on the aggregate efficiency benefits over the long term. However, most privatization studies that examine the efficiency impacts of privatization employ relatively short time frames: usually 3-years before and 3-years after the privatization. In contrast, this study examines the long run effects (up to 24 years) of privatization on productivity based on an examination of major, mostly federal, share-issue privatizations in Canada. We control for factors that might affect productivity apart from privatization by including panels of Always-SOE firms and Always-Private firms, and estimating difference-in-difference models. The major finding is that the productivity of Privatized SOEs increases relative to SOEs at a decreasing rate, peaking at 14–16 years. Despite this improvement, the productivity of privatized firms continues to lag that of Always-Private firms. We consider some of the policy implications of these findings.
L33|Quality uncertainty and the market for renewable energy: Evidence from German consumers|Consumers can choose from a wide range of electricity supply contracts, including green power options. Electricity produced from renewable energy involves information asymmetries. With a sample of more than 2,000 German electricity consumers, we tested the proposition of a “lemon market” for renewable energy in a discrete choice experiment. Specifically, we found that, compared to investor-owned firms, additional willingness-to-pay for renewable energy is approximately double when offered by cooperatives or municipally-owned electricity utilities. Consumers who are experienced with switching suppliers have an additional willingness-to-pay of one Eurocent per kilowatt hour for cooperatives and two Eurocents for public enterprises. The results demonstrate that organizational transformation in dynamically-changing electricity markets is not only driven by political initiatives but also by consumers' choices on the market. Public policy may reduce information asymmetries by promoting government labeling of green energy products.
L33|Can privatization be a catalyst for environmental R&D and result in a cleaner environment?|In this paper we explore whether privatization helps to catalyze a firm's environmental research and development (ER&D) and improve environmental quality. By defining ER&D as the effort undertaken by a firm to reduce its pollution per unit of output, we find in a duopoly framework that privatization cannot catalyze both public and private firms’ ER&D efforts simultaneously; it can increase one but decrease the other firm's investment, or it may even lower both firms’ ER&D investments. Moreover, when production causes severe environmental damage, or the imposition of environmental taxes poorly internalize the pollution externality, privatization may result in a poorer environment. For the sake of having a cleaner environment, policy-makers can impose higher environmental taxes on a highly polluting industry when it is being privatized.
L33|Strategic partnerships in local public transport|We present a rationale for the delegation of regulatory functions in public transport to a partnership that rebalances social and commercial interests according to an agreed and predetermined objective function. This allows for the improvement of economic efficiency providing a constructive commitment to tariff and subsidy policies. Using a simple model, we determine the optimal corporate structure for such a partnership between the local government and any regulated monopoly. The government's strategic option of using its stake in the partnership to generate budget revenue from sale proceeds and/or dividends encourages the relevant authorities to increase the commercial attractiveness of the joint enterprise by setting appropriate tariffs. We show that such a strategic partnership can lead to improvements in welfare if the local cost of public funds is relatively high. These theoretical findings are then examined through the prism of suburban railway transport reform in Russia.
L33|Wage inequality and welfare in developing countries: Privatization and reforms in the short and long run|The impacts of privatization on wage inequality and welfare are considered for developing countries. In the short run, privatization can narrow wage inequality but reduce output of public firms. However, the favorable effect of privatization on lowering wage inequality vanishes in the long run due to the excessive entry of public firms. Thus, a policy recommendation for privatization would be: to avoid rising wage inequality, entry regulation of public firms should be imposed in the short run, and to mitigate the output contraction, complementary structural changes or policy reforms are needed in the transitional period of privatization.
L33|Labor protection and the privatization or partial privatization method|In this paper, we examine whether the extent to which the labor force is legally protected impacts the choice of whether to privatize SOEs through share issues in the public stock exchange or through asset sales to a small group of investors. Based on a sample of 3983 privatizations, which occurred from 1989 through 2008 in 55 countries, and using various measures of labor protection, we find that greater labor protection enhances the likelihood of share issue privatizations (SIPs). This result is robust to controls for political, legal, and economic factors and suggests that legally protected labor acquires enough power to be able to influence a government's choice of the privatization method. We also provide evidence that the positive effect of labor protection on the likelihood of SIPs is stronger (weaker) in countries where investors enjoy better (worse) legal protection, financial systems are more (less) developed, and when foreign investors are involved in the privatization offer.
L33|Low Visibility: The Fate of Air Traffic Control Privatization|It is possible a new air navigation service provider (“ANSP”) could provide better service at reduced cost, but thus far no evidence for such a reform in the U.S. has been put forward, nor has any detailed plan been proposed.
L33|Per una comparative political economy dell’impresa pubblica: alcuni contributi recenti (2013-2015)|Questo articolo discute recenti contributi e propone alcuni temi di ricerca per una ‘comparative political economy’ dell’impresa pubblica. Si argomenta l’opportunità di mettere al centro dell’indagine la relazione fra politiche e organizzazioni, andando oltre il tradizionale confronto di performance fra controllo pubblico e privato. In questa prospettiva, si segnalano contributi sulla fase formativa dell’intervento pubblico nell’economia di sei grandi potenze con un metodo di analisi storica comparata; sull’evoluzione dell’impresa pubblica nelle economie emergenti, particolarmente in America Latina; sulla ‘societarizzazione’ delle imprese pubbliche nel Sud del mondo; sulla rivalutazione della missione di imprese pubbliche locali e nazionali in economie sviluppate. In questa ottica si sostiene che la storia della liquidazione dell’ IRI, il maggiore gruppo industriale italiano andrebbe considerata come parte della crisi di un assetto politico-economico e non prevalentemente come una operazione finanziaria. L’articolo è concluso da considerazioni sull’agenda di ricerca futura.
L33|Italian state-owned enterprises after decades of reforms: Still public?|The present paper analyzes the top ten Italian state-owned enterprises (SOEs) over the period 2004-2013, after both their corporate organization and their markets have been deeply reformed. We question whether SOEs’ strategies are more profit or public oriented. The authors find that, on average, the management and performance of the Italian SOEs has improved and it holds the comparison with private and public European industry peers. Still, remarkable divergences persist among Italian in terms of performance and orientation towards markets or public values, largely depending on the intensity of the reforms they went through. Listed SOEs operating in liberalized markets are largely profitable and distribute dividends. They have expanded their business internationally, though cross-border M&As. As a result, a high share of their revenues and employees originates out of Italy. Conversely, unlisted SOEs operating in non-competitive markets are still somehow compelled to maintain an informal public mission; they provide universal services, they often incur in economic losses, which are partly covered by taxpayers.
L33|The organisation of services of general interest in Finland|Like in most European countries, SGIs in Finland have in recent years been subject to competition and increased private provision or privatisation. This development is motivated by expected cost reductions, by EU-regulations, by ideology and fashion, and in some cases by expected sales revenues. The empirical evaluations of SGI-reforms are few and somewhat contradictory, but the relative success of Finland’s manufacturing SOEs suggests that the public sector is hardly unable to organise efficient SGIs. A number of potential market failures suggest that public ownership should be taken seriously as an alternative to regulation. An increased emphasis on public ownership would be fairly easy to implement in Finland, because the state is still a significant owner, but EU’s policy on liberalisation and unbundling needs an overhaul.
L33|Financial performance of major public enterprises in Croatia from 2006 to 2014|The aim of this paper is to present basic characteristics of state-owned enterprises in Croatia, assess their financial operations and identify major trends in their operations and long-term development prospects. The analysis is carried out for the period from 2009 to 2014. The paper gradually examines financial operations, management system and the systems of accountability and transparency in state owned enterprises. The particular emphasis is on the comparative overview of major state-owned enterprises’ missions and the extent to which they serve public purposes. Moreover, the paper evaluates capital investment plans and provides proposals for the reform of state-owned enterprises in Croatia. In all state-owned enterprises, a serious organizational restructuring - adjustment of the organizational structure and number of employees is still expected.
L33|State-invested enterprises in the European telecommunications industry: Are they competitive players?|The present paper provides an overview of the main companies operating in European telecommunication industry over the decade 2006-2015, with a specific focus on their ownership structure. Following Christiansen and Kim (2014), State-invested telecom companies are classified into State-owned (SOEs) and partially State-owned (PSOEs) enterprises. The aim of the analysis is to investigate the current involvement of European Governments in the telecommunications sector after the deep process of privatisation started in the ‘80s and to understand whether the type of ownership is connected with companies’ economic performance. It turns out that European States still have an important role in the telecommunications industry, mainly through minority but significant participations into previously publicly held incumbents. Moreover, from the analysis of balance sheet data it turns out that State-Invested companies have achieved an economic performance which is comparable, if not superior, to that of private enterprises in terms of profitability. However, some gaps seem to persist as far as labour productivity and investment levels are concerned.
L33|The Financialisation of Health in England and Wales; Lessons from the Water Sector|This is a Foresight paper prepared for the EU-funded research project, Financialisation, Economy, Society and Sustainable Development, FESSUD. Drawing on lessons from the provision of water in England, the paper anticipates future developments in the provision of health, exploring the increasing role of finance and financial cultures. This is captured in the term “financialisation” which has recently emerged in academic literature to account for the rapid expansion of financial assets and financial activity in the economy, and the expanding reach of the financial sector into traditionally non-financial areas of economic and social life. The paper starts with an overview of the context in which financialisation has evolved within, and impacted upon, the National Health Service (NHS). Two contextual elements stand out. First, since the 1980s, the NHS has been subject to incremental reforms to introduce market-mimetic structures. These reforms accelerated with the introduction of the 2012 Health and Social Care Act (HSCA). This legislation has only just begun to have an impact at the time of writing (December 2015), but the extent of private sector involvement in health provision is likely to increase rapidly as a result of the Act. The second significant aspect of the context for financialisation is the growing financial deficit in the NHS which creates an important backdrop to the HSCA reforms. Irrespective of the proximate as well as the deeper reasons for this, it provides for a narrative of “unaffordability” and “inefficiency”, itself taken as a rationale both for greater private sector intervention and as justification for NHS trusts to increase revenue from private sources. However, the paper shows that this narrative thread does not fit with global data which indicate that the NHS is broadly in line with OECD averages for spending on GDP, and health outcomes. The paper considers four mechanisms by which financialisation is affecting the health service in England. First, financing in the sector is allocated on the basis of internal “markets” which mimic financialised structures (regardless of ownership or provision). An institutional division between the “purchaser” and “provider” of health services within the NHS has been refined over the years since it was first introduced in the early 1990s. Health providers are remunerated via a complex “pricing” system known as Payment by Results (PBR) so that transactions between state agencies are delineated in financial terms. Second, financial processes have become embedded in the sector via the process of tendering to both NHS and private service providers. A growing proportion of services has been contracted to private companies, particularly in the wake of the 2012 HSCA. Aside from creeping privatization, this process brings financial practices into the provision of health services, with, for example, health commissioners required to observe competition law even where contracts are awarded to state organisations. Third, under the 2012 HSCA, the cap on the proportion of income that NHS providers can raise from private patients has increased from 2% to 49%, leading to an increase in private patient income within some NHS hospitals. Global finance is becoming more closely integrated with health provision as a result with new partnerships developing between NHS providers and private investors. Finally, since the early 1990s most new capital investment in the NHS has been undertaken through the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) where the private sector finances the design, build and operation of hospitals and these are then leased back to the NHS Trust over a period of decades. These contracts have proven to be costly for NHS hospitals but highly lucrative for (often institutional financial sector) investors in PFI contracts. The paper then considers the nature of the private companies that are involved in healthcare. Health providers are often owned by larger conglomerates for which health is one of many assets in a diverse investment portfolio. The paper compares the changes taking place in health with developments in the water sector in England which has been privatized since 1989 and where financial structures, processes motives and investors have long been established. In both sectors, processes associated with financialisation mean that services are increasingly distanced from the materiality of provision and instead are interpreted in terms of the revenue stream that they can provide to investors. Innovative financial practices have been adopted to boost shareholder returns. In terms of Foresight, health provision is in the process of a fundamental transition from a public service to a financial asset, as has happened in the provision of water in England. The result is expected to be a considerable deepening in the cultures of individualisation and commodification of the health system. This is likely to be associated with a fragmented service and greater inequality in a number of respects: government spending on health will be transferred ultimately to global private finance, boosting the earnings of financial investors; the state will be left with the most difficult (and expensive) to treat as these are of least interest to the private sector; a two-tier system will emerge, with the poorest left with a severely weakened second-rate health system; labour rights are expected to be weakened as employment structures become fragmented across different health providers. Such developments threaten to undermine the core principles on which the NHS was founded. Furthermore, these changes will be difficult to reverse as the ability of the public sector to pose an effective alternative to private and financialised provision of health will be considerably debilitated.
L33|The Role of the State in Financialised Systems of Provision: Social Compacting, Social Policy, and Privatisation|This paper draws on a series of case studies to consider the Role of the State, using the systems of provision (SoP) approach where the state and market are not considered to be dichotomous entities (as in most orthodox literature). Rather, markets are organised by the state in ways that are continually evolving. Our coverage of this extensive topic has been delimited by focusing on three aspects of the role of the state. The first of these is social compacting which considers the ways in which economic, political and ideological interests relate to the state. This section considers the state’s role in representing different social interests with a declining influence of labour. The second aspect addressed here is the state’s role in social policy and the provision of basic services. The paper shows that this increasingly comes down to providing for the hard to serve while wider concerns of equity and redistribution are neglected. Finally the paper explores the role of the state in connection with privatisation. Using the empirical evidence of the case studies, the paper shows that implementation and outcomes have been diverse across sectors and countries but common strands are emerging. These sectors are far from competitive, and privatisation has created conditions for significant rent extraction in ways that were unintended at the time of privatisation
L33|Housing and Water in Light of Financialisation and “Financialisation”|This paper addresses the impact of financialisation on the systems of provision (SoPs) drawing on a series of case studies in housing and water – both non-financial sectors. In order to understand this more fully, the paper first considers some of the theoretical constructs connecting money, commodities and finance, exploring the theories of money, the extension of that theory to finance and the specification of the processes attaching finance to the non-financial. The paper shows that both case-study sectors have increasingly been subject to market forms with, for example, land markets in housing and cost recovery practices in water provision. However there are different forms of monetary relations across the case studies. Simply to equate financialisation with commodification would be misleading. The diversity of arrangements across sectors and locations is addressed in the paper by making the distinction between commodification (production for private profits), the commodity form (periodic payments for a good or service in the absence of a profit motive) and commodity calculation (application of a monetary logic without money changing hands). Each of these is associated with different forms of marketization and “market forces” but they are underpinned by different economic and social structures. The paper then goes on to tie these insights to financialisation and contemporary capitalism more generally with reference to the case studies. For housing there is variegation in the extent to which the expansion of finance coincides with expansion of material provision, as shown with for example the different outcomes from expanding lending for house production as opposed to mortgage lending for consumption. In water, there is diversity in the extent and nature of privatisation and this has led to differences in the extent and depth of financial intervention across the case studies. England and Wales lies at one extreme with heavily entrenched financialisation while this is considerably less significant in the case studies with less privatisation. The final section of this paper considers the implication of the different forms of financialisation for economic and social reproduction including gender.

L33|New Amendments To Russia’S Privatization Legislation: Cosmetic Measures Or Further Deregulation?|Analysis of recent updates to the Russian privatization legislation in 2015 allows saying that the 2015 amendments as a whole aim to boost the process of privatization. The suggested enhancements for the information system of privatization of government-owned and municipal property and for the mechanism of selling such property are intended to render the entire privati - zation process more transparent while counteracting occurrences of corrup- tion and criminality. It has not gone unnoticed that the practice of narrowing the scope of the privatization legislation continues. Since the legislation came into force late in 2001, the number of property categories whose disposal goes beyond the scope of the provisions thereof has nearly doubled (to 20 from 11), some of which have been given a broader interpretation. The next few years will show what kind of eff ect the potential of the foregoing amendments has on the effectiveness of this process, bearing in mind the contribu- tion to meeting the federal budget defi cit and generating budget revenues at other levels of public authority.
L33|Privatization Program For 2014-2016: Formal Shifts And Uncertain Prospects|The outcome of the current privatiza on program, to be completed this year, will strongly depend on the general situation in the Russian economy, and in particular on the behavior of the domestttc stock market. In the explanatory documents a ached to the draft law on federal budget for 2016 submitted to parliament by the government, it is stated that the revenues from privatiza on are expected to amount to more than Rb 33.2bn. This goal does not appear to be quite realistic, though. The planned sum of budget revenue to be generated by this source in 2016 is comparable to the total amount of revenue generated by the privatiza on program for 2011–2013 over the entire 3-year period of its implementa on. However, the economic and political situation then was very diﬀerent from what we have been experiencing over the last two years (massive capital outflow, the introduction of economic sanctions, the ruble’s plummeting exchange rate, and the probability of protracted recession in the national economy).
L33|State Property Management: Statistical Portrait Novelties|A new indicator framework for the performance measurement of state property management was adopted early last year. Basic characteristics of state property and of economic entities that are in state ownership have been presented on the basis of the initial data gathered from the framework. Transition to providing data in terms of legal forms, which was not the case under the old indicator framework for public sector monitoring, as well as a special focus on property (real estate, land, stakes (interest) of any size) given the value and liquidity thereof is the main novelty that the new framework offers.
L33|Новации Российского Приватизационного Законодательства: Косметические Меры Или Ускорение Разгосударствления?|Анализ изменений, появившихся в приватизационном законодательстве в 2015 г., позволяет говорить, что в целом правовые новации, сделанные в минувшем году, должны способствовать активизации приватизационного процесса. Предлагаемое улучшение информационного обеспечения приватизации государственного и муниципального имущества, и механизма его продажи в электронной форме призвано обеспечить большую прозрачность приватизационного процесса в целом, противодействуя явлениям коррупции и криминалитета. Нельзя не отметить продолжающееся расширение практики изъятий из приватизационного закона. С момента появления в конце 2001 г. количество категорий имущества, при отчуждении которого не применяются его нормы, выросло почти вдвое (с 11 до 20) при том, что часть из них получила расширенную трактовку. Ближайшие годы должны показать, насколько потенциал этих поправок к закону о приватизации скажется на результативности данного процесса, имея в виду вклад в покрытие дефицита федерального бюджета и пополнение бюджетной системы на других уровнях публичной власти.
L33|Приватизационная Программа 20142016 Гг.: Формальные Сдвиги И Неопределенные Перспективы|Итоги действующей приватизационной программы, которая завершается в текущем году, находятся в тесной зависимости от того, как будет складываться ситуация в российской экономике в целом и конъюнктура фондового рынка в частности. В сопроводительных документах к правительственному законопроекту о федеральном бюджете на текущий год общие поступления средств от приватизации прогнозируются в 2016 г. в объеме более 33,2 млрд руб. Достижение таких величин представляется весьма проблематичным. Предполагаемая к получению бюджетом сумма приватизационных доходов сопоставима с аналогичной величиной за все 3 года действия приватизационной программы 2011–2013 гг. Однако тогда была совершенно другая экономико-политическая ситуации, радикально отличающаяся от ситуации последних двух лет (массированный отток капитала, введение разнообразных санкций, снижение обменного курса рубля, вероятность затягивания рецессии в отечественной экономике).

На основе ее первых данных могут быть представлены базовые характеристики государственной собственности и относящихся к ней хозяйствующих субъектов. Основным новшеством новой системы является переход к представлению данных в разрезе организационно-правовых форм, чего не было в рамках прежней системы показателей мониторинга госсектора, а также больший акцент именно на имуществе (недвижимость, земля, пакеты акций различной величины) с учетом его стоимости и ликвидности.
L33|Effects of Privatization on Price and Labor Efficiency: The Swedish Electricity Distribution Sector|I examine the effects of privatization, in the form of acquisitions, in the Swedish electricity distribution sector. As the majority of the distribution networks remained publicly owned, I use a synthetic control method to identify the effects on price and labor efficiency. In comparison to their synthetic counterparts, I find that the acquired networks increased labor efficiency by on average 18 percent, while no effect is found on the price. Thus, the evidence suggests substantial efficiency gains but that these are not fed through to consumer prices. Since each acquisition involved several bordering networks that were separately operated by each municipality prior to the acquisitions, I examine to what extent the efficiency gains are likely to be driven by increased economies of scale. Results suggest that the entire effect can be explained by increased economies of scale, questioning the causal effect of privatization per se.
L33|Do Acquisitions Generate Long-Term Returns For Acquirer Companies?, Â¿Generan Las Adquisiciones Rendimientos A Largo Plazo Para Las Empresas Adquirientes?|In this study we extend the previous empirical evidence on the impact that an announcement of acquisition has on the quotes of acquirers traded in the Spanish stock market. If the stock market is efficient, the announcement of an acquisition would be immediately incorporated in the price (quote) both of the target firm and the acquirer, reflecting if the operation generates or destroy value. However, evidence from other markets shows the existence of significant abnormal returns that extend over long periods of time after this sort of events. As the estimation and testing of long-run abnormal returns is under certain controversy we analyse the long-term after performance of a sample of Spanish listed acquirers employing a variety of methods in order to assure the robustness of our results. We find that acquirers gain longâ€“term positive abnormal returns when the acquisition is paid with cash, it is a crossborder acquisition of an unrelated industry target firm, when the target is an unlisted firm and of a related industry. Nevertheless, we do not find significant long-run abnormal performance when we take into account the relative size of the target firm and the leverage
L33|New joints: private providers and rising demand in the English National Health Service| This paper investigates how changes in hospital choice sets affect levels of patient demand for elective hospital care. We exploit a set of reforms in England that opened up the market for publicly-funded patients to private hospitals. Impacts on demand are estimated using variation in distance to these private hospitals, within regions where supply constraints are fixed. We find that the reforms increased demand for publicly-funded procedures. For public hospitals, volumes remained unchanged but waiting times fell. Taken together, our results provide new insights into how individuals make choices about their care and the scope of competition between hospitals.
L33|Bank ownership, board characteristics and performance: Evidence from commercial banks in India|The role of governance mechanisms in determining bank outcomes has been studied mostly in the context of developed economies and focused mainly on private banks. In this paper we examine the importance of board size and board composition in determining bank outcomes using data from an emerging economy, India, and using a sample that includes both public and private banks. Relatedly, we also examine the effect of CEO tenure in influencing bank outcomes, a topic that acquires particular importance in context of public sector banks where the tenure of the CEO is relatively short. Using data that spans over ten years from 2003-2012 that witnessed a large number of governance reforms in India, the results of our empirical analysis suggest that while board size plays an insignificant role in determining bank outcomes, board independence plays a significant role. There is a strong ownership effect with board independence having a significant effect on performance of private sector banks and negatively impacting the performance of private sector banks. The analysis also reveals that longer tenure of the CEO has significant effects in improving bank outcomes both in terms of financial performance and asset quality. These positive effects strengthen in the later years of CEO tenure. Our results have governance implications for strengthening the composition of board of directors and CEO tenure, especially in publicly owned banks.
L33|Institutions and the support for market reforms|Economic self-interest and social considerations are the key determinants of public support for market reforms in transition countries. However, political strategies that rely mainly on public support for pushing through economic reforms have limited relevance if the prevailing institutional environment is weak or corrupt. Poor governance and under-developed democracy significantly reduce the level of support. A good institutional framework allows the potential gains from reforms to be realized in a beneficial way, while corruption and poor governance deny the prospect of gains for individuals and for society.
L33|Public or private job placement services—Are private ones more effective?|Expenditures on job placement and related services make up a substantial share of many countries’ GDP. Contracting out to private providers is often proposed as a more efficient alternative to the state provision of placement services. However, the responsible state agency has to design and monitor sufficiently complete contracts to ensure that the private contractors deliver the desired quality of services. None of the recent empirical evidence indicates that contracting out is necessarily more effective or more efficient than public employment services.
L33|Certification Under Oligopolistic Competition|Abstract In a symmetric duopolistic market where each firm’s choice regarding certain quality attributes such as the environmental friendliness of its product is its own private information, the extent of horizontal differentiation between firms plays a crucial role in a certifier’s optimal certification policy. Under a non-profit certifier it is always the case that both firms produce the highest quality and opt for certification. This is also the case under a for-profit certifier, but only when the degree of horizontal differentiation is sufficiently high. When horizontal differentiation is low, the for-profit certifier, by charging a very high certification fee, creates maximum vertical differentiation between firms. As a result, only one firm produces the highest quality and opts for certification whereas the other firm produces the lowest quality and does not opt for certification. This asymmetry under a for-profit certifier makes the market inefficient, which provides one possible explanation for the existence of mostly non-profit certifiers in such markets.
L33|State ownership and corruption|Abstract We test two interesting results that can be obtained from a simplified version of the theoretical model of Shleifer and Vishny (Q J Econ 109(4):995–1025, 1994) that studies bargaining between politicians and managers of state-owned firms. The model suggests that firms with more state ownership tend to pay less in bribes but not have a different experience of costly obstacles imposed on them by politicians. In our full sample, the results suggest that a one percentage increase in state ownership is associated with a $125 reduction in the total annual informal payment of the firm and with a 0.5 % decrease in the probability that a firm will consider corruption to be an obstacle to their current operations. We refine these average relationships by splitting the sample by global region. Only in our Europe and Central Asia sample do we find strong evidence in support of the first result and again we find a significant effect of state ownership on obstacles.
L33|Tracing the Emergence of Broadening Marketing Proposition: A Thorny Path|The broadening marketing concept was introduced in 1969 and was initially well-received by marketing scholars. However, during the subsequent four decades, the concept has been increasingly questioned and has divided marketing scholars in to two opposing camps. This paper traces the evolution of the broadening marketing proposition and critically examines the arguments put forward against the broadening proposition.
L33|Privatization and Optimum-Welfare in an International Cournot Duopoly|In this paper, we will analyse the relationship between privatization of a public firm and tax revenue for the domestic government in an international competition, with import tariffs. We consider a duopoly model where a domestic public firmand a foreign private firmcompete in the domesticmarket, asCournot players. Furthermore, the domestic government imposes a tariff to regulate an imported good, and may have a higher preference for tariff revenue than for social welfare. We compute the outputs at equilibrium and we show that privatization (i) will increase the profits of both domestic and foreign firms; (ii) will increase the tariff imposed to the imported good; and (iii) will decrease the domestic welfare. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a rise in the government’s preference for tariff revenues raises the social welfare in both mixed and private models.
L33|The Italian Post-World War II Experience in Human Relations and Corporate Welfare|"The relevance of interventions in welfare and social security systems in the twentieth century has become the subject of extensive historical research. In particular from a prevalent focus on State intervention to a more in-depth historiographic reconsideration of the work performed by private institutions, including an important role played by industry. The focus of this paper is precisely the Corporate Welfare in the context of action after IIWW, by addressing the transformation in practices in terms of welfare and social security for workers, the essence of which is capable of revealing the participatory and communal nature of companies. In specific, I concentrate my attention on the relevance of the Human Relations in Italy and their effects on the Corporate Welfare. The paper examines some cases of HR as OM, Pirelli, Falck and Unilever. Finally there is a specific attention on the job training of the ""leader"" and the ""social worker of the factory""."
L33|Development of a Standard Model for Comprehensive Management Plans for Public Facilities, and Model Cases|The aging of infrastructure and the expected budget shortage for renewal investment are recognized as serious problems by the majority of local governments throughout Japan. The national government has already drawn up a Basic Plan for Extending the Service Life of Infrastructure to clarify the measures to address these problems, and has requested local governments to draw up comprehensive management plans for public facilities, as local action plans based on the national basic plan. However, it is difficult for local governments to sort out their own public facilities across sectors and set priorities for them, considering the possibility of integration or abolition of some of those facilities. In view of such background, the authors created a standard model to enable local governments to draft their plans easily. In this model, the necessity of public facilities is assessed, by type of facility, from various aspects such as whether each facility functions as a necessary public service, whether it should be provided by the government, whether it is needed, and whether it needs to exist as an independent facility, and appropriate measures for the respective facilities are chosen from among options such as integration or abolition, replacement with intangible services, expansion of the service area, and conversion into multifunctional types. Public works also undergo an assessment process through which they are designated to be abolished or replaced with localized services, delivery services or IT. The concept of risk-based maintenance (RBM), i.e. assuming the service life of a public work according to its importance, is also introduced. In order to verify the effectiveness of the standard model, the authors conducted a simulation test in Kawagoe City, Saitama Prefecture, and found the following results. The budget shortage could be nearly entirely resolved by taking proactive measures such as the integration or abolition of elementary or junior high schools (including the integration of an elementary school and a junior high school in the same area), and the relocation of the functions of small community centers and facilities into school facilities. Selling surplus land may also be conducive. On the other hand, the budget secured for roads, bridges and sewage works has recently been so small that whatever measures were taken, the budget shortage could not be resolved as long as the budget size was held at the current level. Practical solutions to problems faced by individual local governments could not be found without taking into account specific facilities or numerical data in the assessment process. The test showed that the standard model is effective for such assessment. The authors hope that the standard model will help local governments implement their comprehensive management plans and that the national government will provide support for such local governments that are making sufficient efforts to resolve their budget shortage.
L33|The “true” private school effect across countries using PISA-2012 Mathematics|It is known that in most countries, students of private schools perform better in international assessments compared to students in the public school system. However, when one controls for observable socioeconomic background characteristics at the individual and school level, public school students perform equally well. Furthermore, sorting to private vs. public schools based on unobservable characteristics takes place, which biases econometric estimates. I account for selection on unobservables using an approach based on the idea that the amount of selection on the observed explanatory variables in a model provides a guide to the amount of selection on the unobservables (Altonjie et al. 2005; Oster 2013). I use PISA-2012 data for Mathematics to derive bias-corrected estimates of the “true” private-dependent and independent school effect for 40 countries. With few exceptions, public schools outperform private schools (especially independent schools). Accounting for both peer effects and selection is necessary when evaluating school effectiveness.
L33|Does Public Competition Crowd Out Private Investment? Evidence from Municipal Provision of Internet Access| Government investment in infrastructure may crowd out private investment that would have otherwise occurred. But, the threat of government intervention may also induce private firms to invest preemptively in infrastructure, in order to maintain their market position. This leaves the net effect of public competition on private investment unclear. This paper investigates the tension between these competing effects by providing evidence from the setting of internet service provision. Using household survey data and a novel data set of internet plan characteristics, I provide nationwide estimates of demand for internet technologies. I then use these results to estimate a dynamic oligopoly model of private and public internet service providers’ entry and technology adoption decisions, where private firms are driven by profits and municipalities by some (as yet) unknown combination of profits and consumer welfare. Finally, I simulate firms’ actions under a ban on public provision and find evidence that public competition partially, but not completely, crowds out private investment. Ultimately, I find that a ban on municipal provision in 30 states would result in a loss in consumer welfare of $1.11 billion over 20 years.
L33|UIDAI's Public Policy Innovations|The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) was mandated to issue unique identification numbers to every resident of India. The Authority has largely accomplished this mandate in a short time and within budget because it took many innovative and bold decisions. The first innovative decision we consider, in this paper, is the UIDAI's decision to add iris images to the set of biometrics collected by it. Another innovation of the UIDAI was its practice of conducting on-field trials. The last innovation we consider relates to how the UIDAI promoted competition and standardisation. The success of the UIDAI offers lessons for other government projects. Government processes need not prevent it from taking innovative decisions. High-quality procurement and project management skills can help the government outsource many functions that are currently housed within it. Testing major hypotheses through field trials before launching projects at scale can help ensure best use of public resources.
L33|Concerns Related to the Internationalisation of State-Owned Enterprises: Perspectives from regulators, government owners and the broader business community|The rise in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as growing actors in international trade and investment has received renewed attention in recent years, not least due to controversy that has arisen over SOE foreign investments. This has raised the profile of these issues with policy makers and tilted much of the public debate in one direction. Some concerns revolve around the intentions of these companies, or any potential competitive distortions that could be caused by them which would differentiate them from privately-owned enterprises operating under like circumstances. With a view to keeping the trade and investment environment open, this paper draws attention to particular perceptions of concerns or challenges that arise when SOEs internationalise. Although perceptions are not verifiable facts, they reveal important trends that may inform the debate and shape future government policies towards foreign trade and investment by SOEs. The information in the report is primarily drawn from findings emerging from a three-part perception-based OECD survey addressed to public officials responsible for enterprise ownership, competition enforcement, investment regulation and trade policy in addition to departments of government with broader responsibility for the enterprise and competition landscape, and/or cross-border trade and investment regulation.
L33|The state advances, the private sector retreats? Firm effects of China’s great stimulus programme|It has been argued that the state sector is advancing at the cost of the private sector in China. To examine this issue, we conduct an empirical analysis in which we exploit the launch of a large stimulus programme in the autumn of 2008. We find that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are better able to maintain their leverage levels and have better access to both short- and long-term debt compared with private firms after the introduction of the stimulus programme. We also find that preferential access to debt financing does not help SOEs improve their performance. Instead, SOEs perform significantly worse than private firms after the introduction of the stimulus programme. Moreover, political connections obtained through political participation help mitigate the discrimination that private firms face from Chinese banks and help improve firm performance. These results support the conjecture that China’s state sector is advancing, with negative consequences for aggregate performance in the economy.
L33|Differential market entry determinants for for-profit and non-profit at-home care providers in large Japanese cities|Japan’s long-term care insurance system requires that for-profit and non-profit at-home care service providers provide the same services at the same prices. Both types of providers compete on completely equal terms, though they may have different determinants of entry. This study considers market entry determinants for both for-profit and non-profit at-home long-term care providers in large Japanese cities. The estimation results show that potential for-profit entrants were sensitive to issues of profit, and that potential non-profits enter disadvantaged municipalities. The net entry rates of both potential entrants have gradually declined. The results show that both providers’ entries compensate for the gap between at-home long-term care demand and supply in each religion. Non-profit entrants supplement for-profit entrants because non-profits enter regions with low profitability. However, the insurance systems will face an issue due to the increase in premiums and decrease in unit prices, which discourage new entries.
L33|Organization And Governance In Social Economy Enterprises: An Introduction|In this introduction, we briefly overview the topics covered by the contributions included in this special issue which, from different angles, deal with the organization and governance of social economy enterprises. Three different approaches are taken by the contributions to the special issue: one is theoretical, another is empirical and the last one is a case- based, qualitative perspective.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L33|Analysis of Contracts in Various Formats of Blockchain|One of the important features of Blockchain is that it allows the hosting and execution of contracts. Such a contract in the digital world is known as a Smart Contract. But the process and consequences of a contract vary radically from one format of Blockchain to another. One of the formats (and the most common at present) is the Unregulated Blockchain (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) with no government supervision whatsoever. Another format is the Controlled Blockchain which is managed and guaranteed by the Government. It is this difference that is vital in understanding the impacts and consequences of entering into and abiding by Smart Contracts. Firstly, the concept of cryptocurrencies (also referred to as cryptocoins in this paper) is explained. Then the concept of Regulated and Sovereign Backed Cryptocurrencies (RSBCs) is discussed. Later on, I explain how contracts vary between the two Blockchain formats. Finally, the paper concludes as to how smart contracts can be best executed and on which format of Blockchain.

L33|Build-Operate-Transfer Projects in Turkey: Contingent Liabilities and Associated Risks|The government of Turkey actively promotes public-private partnership models in infrastructure projects. Public-private partnership implementation contracts risk incurring a heavy fiscal burden on the state through contingent liabilities. It is therefore important to distribute risk among contract parties, according to the risk-management capacities of each. In the context of Build-Operate-Transfer projects, governments are expected to cover political and force majeure risks, as well as to guarantee demand for the goods and/or services produced. In Turkey, however, the government also assumes responsibility for finance risk, construction risk, and availability risk, which are usually assumed by the private sector. This study presents an overview of the legal and institutional frameworks relevant to Build-Operate-Transfer projects in Turkey, assessing the explicit contingent liabilities and associated risks to formulate policy recommendations on the evaluation, monitoring, and management of such contingent liabilities and risks in line with international best practice.
L33|Evaluating Minimum-Traffic Guarantees for PPPs in Turkey by Real-Option Pricing|Minimum-traffic guarantees for build-operate-transfer toll-road projects are contingent liabilities that expose government to fiscal risk. Therefore, public authorities must value guarantees, thereby enabling informed decision-making about the level and type of guarantee provision. This study demonstrates the use of financial modeling and risk analysis in a toll-road project in Turkey, contributing to the narrowing of a capacity gap in the field. We present three types of guarantee, modeled as real options and evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation. We identify one criterion to determine the optimum level of guarantee for a given project, and one criterion to measure the extent to which a guarantee will reduce risk. Based on these and other complementary criteria, it is proposed that the guarantee with income ceiling is the most appropriate for the project considered here. The paper concludes with a discussion of the policy implications of the findings.
L33|Social Impact Bonds: Implementation, evaluation and monitoring|Traditional approaches to public policy increasingly fail to resolve social challenges, particularly in the field of criminal justice. High rates of juvenile recidivism, for example, are often linked to inequality in education and persistent, long-term unemployment—factors which, while complex, are nonetheless conducive to preventative strategies. Social impact bonds (SIBs) are ‘pay-for-success’ programs that attract private-sector, upfront funding for social interventions. If the program achieves agreed targets, taxpayer funds repay the investor. If the program fails to meet agreed targets, investors take the loss. This innovative form social finance through public-private partnership (PPP) has helped spur efficiencies and improvements in the provision and outcomes of criminal justice services. However, the success of a SIB depends on careful implementation, evaluation and monitoring.
L33|Dynamics of Non-Farm Informal Enterprises in Rural Uttar Pradesh: A Disaggregated Analysis|There are two quite opposite view about Non-Farm Informal Enterprises (NFIE). First, it is low productive sector producing low quality goods and the other one recognizes it as dynamic, flexible, innovative and contributing significantly in economic development. Based on National Sample Survey unit level data (1999-2000 and 201011) and village level household enterprise data, this study tries to understand the dynamics of NFIE at disaggregate level in rural Uttar Pradesh. NFIE are mainly Own Account Enterprises (OAEs) in all four regions of state. During 1999-2000 to 2010-11, the share of manufacturing enterprises has declined and trade has gained significantly. Though there has been phenomenal growth in enterprises reporting to be expanding, still more than half of the enterprises are stagnant. The intensity of sub-contracting is increasing in all regions. Employment growth has been mostly sluggish in OAEs and is less than 5 per cent per annum in establishments. Results of primary data reveal that the main reason for start-up of NFIE was lack of other productive employment. Remittances, surplus from non-farm, relative/friends support and surplus from agriculture are the main sources of initial capital for start-up. This study also confirms that enterprise profit contributes significantly in household income and in absence of this household takes recourse to wage income. It seems that growth of informal enterprises has replaced casual work in rural Uttar Pradesh.
L33|Change in Economic Policy Paradigm: Privatization and State Capture in Poland|Kozarzewski and Ba³towski analyse the causes and manifestations of this trend in economic policy in Poland. They use privatization policy as an example. The authors examine the effects of the privatization policy and point to a large unfinished agenda in ownership transformation that has had an adverse impact on the institutional setup of the Polish state, creating grounds for rent seeking and cronyism, which, in turn, impede the pace of privatization. They find out that it is the increasing capture of the state by rent-seeking groups, and not, contrary to popular opinion, the global financial crisis, that most contributes to the growing statist trends of Poland’s economic policy.
L33|Tumbas, parroquias y espacios ganaderos: configuración y evolución del paisaje medieval de la sierra de Ávila|In this article agricultural landscapes are conceived as the cumulative materialization of collective perceptions and forms of land-use. This perspective is applied to the historical analysis of medieval landscapes in the Sierra de Ávila, a pastoral area that offers variable and uneven information for that period. A diachronic approach using the archaeological record, written documentation, place names and palaeoenvironmental information permits tracking the contingent and ever-changing arrangements of the agroforest landscapes in this area. In early medieval times monumental tombs of large dimensions were carved out of rock by autonomous and extensive cattle farmers. These tombs are regarded as landmarks for claiming customary rights, devices that helped in the reinforcement of social cohesion and milestones for guiding flocks and shepherds. The high medieval period involved the political and legal reorganization of the rural milieu (demarcation of village territories) and a profound change of mentality (new village identities). Communal and extensive silvopastoral spaces were lost due to growing intensification of farming. The new village and parish networks anchored the peasants to their fields, thus contributing to the abandonment of the previous burial places and the implementation of parish cemeteries. In the late Middle Ages, livestock farming took on new relevance as a key strategy for aristocratic groups seeking to maximize their revenues. Community mountain pastures (or alixares) located by the early medieval necropoleis were now devoted to new land uses (dry farming and flax fields) due to their appropriation for the exclusive use of these elite groups.
L33|De la gestión privada a la gestión colectiva del riego: El caso de Riegos de Levante|Studies and research on organizational alternatives used in managing common access renewable resources have seen a great revival thanks to the approaches pioneered by Elinor Ostrom, the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics. For this author, reality shows that there are other models (or ‘theoretical frameworks’ as Ostrom likes to define them) in which resource appropriators are able to self-organize and efficiently manage a natural resource without having to fall into the dichotomy between private and public sector companies or administrations. This paper presents a case that runs contrary to the trends exhibited by today’s dominant models: the transition from a private company, the Real Compañía de Riegos de Levante S.A, to a self-organizing irrigator’s corporation, the Comunidad de Riegos de Levante. As a counterpoint, its evolution is compared and contrasted with the survival of a private sector company in the same market: the Nuevos Riegos el Progreso S.A. How should we consider an organization that is the holder of several water rights concessions and the irrigation water supplier for about 20,000 farmers in an area of 39,000 hectares in southern Alicante province? Is this a private or a public company? Is it possible to define it as another type of organization?
L33|Institutional Forms of Action against social exclusion in Poland|Negative social phenomena such as poverty, unemployment disabilities and social pathologies have been building up. Governments in many countries search for the new methods of governing in order to confine the processes or at least, to reduce their growth.Solutions based on the establishment of non ? governmental organizations as institutions compensating for the weaknesses of the public and private sector have turned out insufficient. It has become necessary to create jobs for persons exposed to discrimination and unequal treatment in labour market. Extention of the non-profit sector to include business organizations that can create jobs for the disadvantaged with State?s suport in one of the implemented measures. Theory has labeled this enlarged sector as a social economy. In addition to clasic nonprofit institutions, other components of the sector are social enterprises, social cooperatives and Social Integration Centers.The paper aims to value such organizations activity in the Polish circumstances. They were formaly set up in Poland in 2003-2006.The analysis takes advantage of relevant law and statistical data concerning the activity of the established and operating organizations.The analysis will show the tendencies of development of these institutions in Poland. Besides it allows to limit their weak points and to asses their usefulness to the economy.
L33|Cobb–Douglas production function on FDI in Southeast Europe|Abstract In this research, we focus on effects of foreign direct investments in Southeast European economies. Using World Bank Microdata Library and specifically Enterprise Surveys, we take a sample of six countries. The model is based on firm-level data of a representative sample of economy’s private sectors for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia. What we are closely examining are the effects of foreign direct investments on the development of domestic firms and the overall economy. Foreign direct investment is usually defined as dominant or controlling ownership of a company in one country, by an entity based in another country. Transition economies undergo a set of structural transformations intended to develop market-based institutions through economic liberalization, where prices are set by market forces. Hence, foreign direct investments remain main concern as major source of capital utilized toward enterprise restructuring. This research is built on Cobb–Douglas production function where data are analyzed with econometric models, which as employed in this study examines the interrelationships between output and set of variables that influence foreign direct investments arrangements. Additionally, according to the results, estimates are specified on the ways foreign direct investments mold the economy.
L33|Market Structure as a Determinant of Patient Care Quality|Understanding how market structure affects health outcomes is difficult because of the nonrandom nature of where patients receive care. I develop a control function approach that is robust not just to selection on unobservable differences in patients’ condition severity, but also to selection on unobservable variation in how patients respond to different treatments. I apply the approach to data from 2004 to 2008 for all hemodialysis patients in Atlanta, Georgia. The results indicate that a one-facility acquisition by the average provider in the average market would lead the average patient to spend 28 percent more days in the ICU/CCU. Estimates that do not control for the role of idiosyncratic matching would predict smaller, though still economically and statistically significant, effects on the affected patients. I interpret the results as indicating the importance of idiosyncratic matching in this market, which multifacility firms address by differentiating their operations.
L33|The Role of Donations in Quality Disclosure: Evidence from Nonprofit Nursing Homes Full Access|This paper uses a quality disclosure policy--the Nursing Home Quality Initiative, which mandates the public reporting of quality information on selected dimensions--to investigate how nonprofit nursing homes react to economic incentives. The study finds that nonprofits are as responsive as for-profits to quality disclosure: quality improves along the reported dimensions and diminishes along the unreported ones. Further tests show that nonprofits may respond to donations and fail to mimic for-profits when competing with them. These findings suggest that donor response may be the motive for nonprofits to respond to quality disclosure in the same way as for-profit alternatives.
L33|Selectivity and Transparency in Social Banking: Evidence from Europe| How do social banks signal their social commitment to motivated funders? We hypothesize that two main channels are used: selectivity and transparency. We test these predictions using a rich dataset comprising balancesheet information on 5,000 European banks over the period from 1998 to 2013. The results suggest that social screening leads social banks to higher project selectivity compared to mainstream banks. Social banks also tend to be more transparent than other banks. However, combining selectivity and transparency can result in excess liquidity. Overall, the empirical findings not only confirm our theoretical hypotheses, but also raise challenging issues regarding the management of social banks.
L33|Taxe environnementale et délégation|Ce papier analyse la taxation des émissions de pollution dans une industrie où une entreprise semi-publique est en concurrence avec une entreprise privée (nationale ou étrangère).

Nous montrons que la délégation a pour effet d'augmenter la taxe environnementale et le dommage environnemental.

A comparative study]|Entre los deberes de los miembros de los órganos de gobierno de las diferentes entidades, vinculados al buen gobierno de éstas, destaca el deber de lealtad, derivado del deber de buena fe, y consistente en la obligación de actuar en interés de la entidad en caso de conflicto de intereses con ésta, subordinando los propios a favor de aquélla, salvo que se autorice tal situación. Se trata de un deber predicable tanto respecto de los miembros del órgano de administración, que deben gestionar el interés de la sociedad, como de los socios, tomando en consideración el fin común que deriva del contrato de sociedad. Este deber, al mismo tiempo se concreta en una serie de normas más precisas, relativas a la transparencia, la remuneración, la prohibición de competencia, la autocontratación, etc. Partiendo de lo anterior, este estudio recoge una comparativa de la regulación del deber de lealtad y sus distintas concreciones en las Leyes de cooperativas en España, tanto en relación con los administradores sociales, como de los socios en general, comparando ésta al mismo tiempo con la regulación de estos aspectos en el Derecho de sociedades en general, y en la Ley de Sociedades en General en particular, con el objetivo de obtener una visión general de la cuestión, base necesaria para poder profundizar en ella, planteando una serie de conclusiones o valoraciones preliminares.
L33|Public-Private Partnerships and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: Fit for purpose?|In light of a cautious emphasis given to public-private partnerships (PPPs) as a mechanism to finance infrastructure projects and highlighting the need for capacity building and knowledge sharing at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa, this paper reviews the extant literature on the subject and identifies areas requiring better understanding and institutional innovation for ensuring value for money, minimizing contingent fiscal risk and improving accountability. An institutional capacity to create, manage and evaluate PPPs is essential to ensure that they become an effective instrument of delivery of important services, such as infrastructure. There is also a need for a common definition of PPPs and internationally accepted guidelines, including uniform accounting and reporting standards.
L33|The impact of piped water supply on household welfare|In the absence of piped water from a utility company, households rely on alternative supply from small-scale private providers. We quantify losses of wellbeing associated with using small-scale private providers instead of piped water from the utility company. We measure welfare in three dimensions: health, wealth (income), and time available for education, work, or leisure. An empirical application to Burkina Faso reveals that households' greatest welfare losses are in terms of time availability. The opportunity cost of collecting water is estimated to be 23 hours per week, which is comparable to half of a full weekly working period of an employed person. This loss is often borne by women. In terms of health and affordability of water, paradoxically, households using alternative sources of water are slightly better off.
L33|Persistent and transient efficiency on the stochastic production and cost frontiers – an application to the motorway sector|This paper implements both stochastic production and cost frontier analyses to estimate the efficiency of toll motorway companies in Spain, the country with the largest number of private concessionaires in this economic sector. Our dataset includes 32 concessionaires with different features for a time span of 26 years (1988-2014). The results support the existence of scale and density economies, showing that an increase in vehicle-kilometers is more important for cost efficiency than extending the motorway. The differences between transient and persistent efficiency are significant, so that we can test for regulatory and ownership differences. The price cap regulation seems to increase management technical efficiency. Regional governments grant better projects than central governments and, as shareholders, they also perform better. However, their performance is not significantly differently from that of full private concessionaires. We also find limited evidence of efficiency gains from privatization. These results help us provide new insights to evaluate policy and regulatory reforms aimed at enhancing technical efficiency in the sector.
L33|Property rights and transaction costs : The role of ownership and organization in German public service provision|This paper provides evidence that ownership and organization matters for the efficiency of provision of public services. In particular, we find that pure private ownership is more efficient than pure public ownership, followed by mixed ownership. The delegation of management in different legal forms also has an impact, highlighting the importance of the design of the government-operator relation. We apply a structural approach of production function estimation ensuring precise determination of total factor productivity for a panel of German refuse collection firms in the time period between 2000-2012. We project total factor productivity estimates (TFP) on ownership and organization. Our results are in line with the trade-offs implied by the property rights literature and provide important policy implications regarding the organization of public service provision.
L33|Inhibited privatization: a hurdle race over vested interests|This paper recognizes vested interests as one of the primary premises that reduce the effectiveness of privatization policy, stall its momentum and produce structural problems in the long-run. Both exogenous and endogenous drawbacks are cited, but the main focus is put on the dynamism of vested interests’ character, interconnectedness and evolution. Policy makers have been long aware of the existence of activities rooted in vested interests including empire building behaviors, creation of sinecures or extravagant management style. Hence, the fundamental effort here is put on the identification of emerging vested interests that were typically not considered by scholars. The channels through which conventional vested interests have snowballed over time are emphasized. This includes casting a closer glance at family employment, as well as at sports sponsorship arrangements, which emerge as the favorite domain of marketing activity for Polish state-owned enterprises. The research of available literature is performed, along with its application to the Polish case, and insightful observations concerning the anatomy of privatization-related reluctance. Rough policy recommendations conclude the paper.
L33|The interaction of grassroots communities and local authorities in Russia|Taking into consideration the underdevelopment of the Russian civil community it is of essential interest to touch upon local communities (known as TOS). Local governments and TOS communities could provide similar services and as such cooperate or compete with each other. Community initiatives could supplant poorly performing government services, or governments could outsource to communities some of its functions. Based on empirical Russian data, collected in the city of Kirov this research shows that the prevailing initial incentive to establish TOS is driven by the prospect of obtaining seed money from the government. We detected sources of TOS advantages over municipal authorities: ratio of costs and benefits, sensitivity to the demands of consumers, social capital, and voluntary nature of TOS. TOS are more likely to emerge in communities where people are sceptical about the efficacy of conventional mechanisms of democratic accountability, and prefer to collaborate with municipal governments on specific projects
L33|A Unified Model of Spatial Price Discrimination|We present a general model of mixed oligopoly, where competing firms exercise spatial price discrimination. Our findings indicate that the Nash equilibrium locations of firms are always socially optimal irrespective of the number of competitors, the level of privatization, the form of the transportation costs and the number and/or the varieties of the produced goods. An immediate implication of this result is that this form of competition is preferable from a welfare point of view.
L33|Social cooperatives, social welfare associations and social networks| We use an original data-set to study how participation in two types of non-profit organizations – i.e. social welfare associations and social cooperatives – affects individual social capital, understood as a network of cooperative relationships. Participation in both the types of organization allows members to start new social relations. However, social welfare associations seem to play a significantly greater role in the development of volunteers’ social capital, favouring the creation of weak ties that are used to exchange information and advice, and offering the opportunity to establish stronger ties entailing concrete mutual support. Within social cooperatives, workers appear to develop their individual social capital to a greater extent than volunteers. Our results suggest that the composition of the workforce, the depth of members’ involvement in the organization’s activities and the human resources strategies adopted by the management influence the creation of cooperative relations through on-the-job interactions.
L33|Does Privatization Increase Firm Performance in Nigeria?: An Empirical Investigation|The public enterprises have generally failed to provide the social and economic development sought by the post-independence era in African countries, hence privatization has been central to policy making in the recent times. This paper offers insight into the validity of the efficacy of privatization by investigating not only whether privatization has improved financial (profitability) performance of firms but also whether such improvement has impact on the operational efficiency of privatized firms for the period 1990-2001 in Nigeria. Using a panel data for a sample of 20 privatized firms obtained from the Nigerian Stock Exchange and Securities and Exchange Commission, the result shows an increase in all the profitability ratios after privatization. However, only the return on assets and return on sales are significant in explaining the difference between pre- and post-privatization performance of firms in Nigeria. The result of the operational efficiency shows a significant increase in the mean (median) values of sale efficiency and income efficiency. Interestingly, while output (real sales) and employee income of firm significantly increase after privatization, the number of employees insignificantly decreases after privatization. The paper concludes that privatization in Nigeria has worked in the sense that it improves the financial and operational efficiency performance of firms.
L33|Citizens Involvement In Public Decisions: Between Normative Framework And Actual Findings (I - Theoretical Overview)|Public institutions should be driven both by efectiveness and financial targets, and by ethical rules principles governing their activities. In a democratic state, all public institutions and all public decisions should function based on mechanisms applying the principles of participation, accountability, transparency, rule of law, subsidiarity and equality of opportunity and treatment. This paper focuses on emphasizing main contributions in the theory of participatory democracy in local governance institutions, but also some practical considerations, including results and restrictions concerning how they are actually implemented in the Romanian public institutions.
