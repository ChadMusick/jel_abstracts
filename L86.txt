L86|Externalities in Knowledge Production: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment|Do contributions to online content platforms induce a feedback loop of ever more user-generated content or will they discourage future contributions? To assess this, we use a randomized field experiment which added content to some pages in Wikipedia while leaving similar pages unchanged. We find that adding content has a negligible impact on the subsequent long-run growth of content. Our results have implications for information seeding and incentivizing contributions, implying that additional content does not generate sizable externalities, neither by inspiring nor by discouraging future contributions.

L86|Innovative events|We take a fresh look at firms' innovation-productivity linkages, using novel data capturing new aspects of innovative activity. We combine UK administrative microdata, media and website content to develop experimental metrics - new product/service launches - for a large panel of SMEs. Extensive validation and descriptive exercises show that launches complement patents, trademarks and innovation surveys. We also establish connections between launches and previous innovative activity. We then link IP, launches and productivity, controlling for media exposure and firm heterogeneity. Launch activity is associated with higher SME productivity, especially in the service sector. High-quality launches and medium-size firms help drive this result.
L86|Does Light Touch Cluster Policy Work? Evaluating the Tech City Programme|Despite academic scepticism, cluster policies remain popular with policymakers. This paper evaluates the causal impact of a flagship UK technology cluster programme. I build a simple framework and identify effects using difference-in-differences and synthetic controls on rich microdata. I further test for timing, cross-space variation, scaling and churn channels. The policy grew and densified the cluster, but has had more mixed effects on tech firm productivity. I also find most policy 'effects' began before rollout, raising questions about the programme's added value.
L86|Data brokers co-opetition|Data brokers collect, manage, and sell customer data. We propose a simple model, in which data brokers sell data to downstream firms. We characterise the optimal strategy of data brokers and highlight the role played by the data structure for co-opetition. If data are “sub-additive”, with the combined value lower than the sum of the values of the two datasets, data brokers share data and sell them jointly. When data are “additive” or “supra- additive”, with the combined value equal to or greater than the sum of the two datasets, data brokers compete. Results are robust to several extensions.
L86|Superstars in two-sided markets: exclusives or not?|This article studies incentives for a premium provider (Superstar) to offer exclusive contracts to competing platforms mediating the interactions between consumers and firms. When platform competition is intense, more consumers subscribe to the platform hosting the Superstar exclusively. This mechanism is self-reinforcing as firms follow consumer decisions and (some) join exclusively the platform with the Superstar. Exclusivity always benefits firms and may benefit consumers. Moreover, when the Superstar is integrated with a platform, non-exclusivity becomes more likely than if the Superstar was independent. This analysis provides several implications for managers and policy makers operating in digital and traditional markets.
L86|Crowdfunding Dynamics|Various forms of social learning and network effects are at work on crowdfunding platforms, giving rise to informational and payoff externalities. We use novel entrepreneur-backer data to study how these externalities shape funding dynamics, within and across projects. We find that backers decide to back a particular project based on past contributions not only to that project—as documented by prior work—but also to other contemporaneous projects—a novel result. Our difference-in-differences estimates indicate that such ‘cross-project funding dynamics’ account for 4-5% in the increase of contributions that projects generate on a daily basis. We show that recurrent backers are the main transmission channel of cross-project funding dynamics: by initiating social learning about project existence and quality, recurrent backers encourage future funding by other backers. Our results demonstrate that even though contemporaneous projects compete for funding, they jointly benefit from their common presence on the platform. We finally show that these crowdfunding dynamics stir platform growth, with important consequences for competition among platforms.
L86|Exclusive Data, Price Manipulation and Market Leadership|The unprecedented access of firms to consumer level data not only facilitates more precisely targeted individual pricing but also alters firms’ strategic incentives. We show that exclusive access to a list of consumers can provide incentives for a firm to endogenously assume the price leader’s role, and so to strategically manipulate its rival’s price. Prices and profits are non-monotonic in the length of the consumer list. For an intermediate size, price leadership entails a semi-collusive outcome, characterized by supra-competitive prices and low consumer surplus. In contrast, for short or long lists of consumers, exclusive data availability intensifies market competition.
L86|Cooperation, Dependence and Eviction - How Platform-To-Business Relationships in Mobile Telephony Ecosystems Should Be Addressed in A Competition Law Perspective?|This contribution aims at analysing the potential effects of competition law based decisions in the mobile operating systems domain, considering their two-sided structure. Based on the notion of complementary investments, it proposes to investigate the relationships between the pivotal player and its partners. After establishing the economic and technical grounds underlying their contractual relationships, we assess them under the length of competition laws requirements. We show that, despite the gains that can result from these relationships, their asymmetrical nature may induce abuses of dominance or anticompetitive takeovers. However, we stress that competition law based remedies may be poorly efficient to address these issues. Cette contribution porte sur les effets des décisions concurrentielles dans le domaine des systèmes d’exploitation mobiles en regard de leur structure de plateforme biface. S’appuyant sur la notion d’investissement complémentaire, elle se propose d’analyser les relations entre la firme pivot de chaque système et ses partenaires. Il s’agit d’évaluer en termes concurrentiels les dispositifs techniques et financiers qui les lient. Au-delà de cette question liée à l’évaluation de leur effet net sur la concurrence, il s’agit également de s’interroger sur les possibles abus d’exploitation et d’éviction qui peuvent résulter de telles relations complémentaires mais asymétriques. Cette contribution discute enfin les possibles effets de remèdes concurrentiels portant sur ces relations. Version en français de cet article

L86|Do low-skilled workers gain from high-tech employment growth? High-technology multipliers, employment and wages in Britain|Do low-skilled workers benefit from the growth of high-technology industries in their local economy? Policymakers invest considerable resources in attracting and developing innovative, high-tech industries, but there is relatively little evidence on the distribution of the benefits. This paper investigates the labour market impact of high-tech growth on low and mid-skilled workers, using data on UK local labour markets from 2009-2015. It shows that high-tech industries – either STEM-intensive ‘high-tech’ or digital economy – have a positive jobs multiplier, with each 10 new high-tech jobs creating around 7 local non-tradeable service jobs, around 6 of which go to low-skilled workers. Employment rates for mid-skilled workers do not increase, but they benefit from higher wages. Yet while low-skilled workers gain from higher employment rates, the jobs are often poorly paid service work, so average wages fall, particularly when increased housing costs are considered.
L86|Les marchés bifaces saisis par le droit de la concurrence. Réflexions sur la décision Android de la Commission Européenne|Ce travail porte sur la décision de la Commission européenne du 18 juillet 2018 dans l’affaire Google Android.

L86|Accounting for Innovations in Consumer Digital Services: IT Still Matters|"This paper develops a framework for measuring digital services in the face of ongoing innovations in the delivery of content to consumers. We capture what Brynjolfsson and Saunders (2009) call ""free goods"" as the capital services generated by connected consumers' stocks of IT digital goods, a service flow that augments the existing measure of personal consumption in GDP. Its value is determined by the intensity with which households use their IT capital to consume content delivered over networks, and its volume depends on the quality of the IT capital. Consumers pay for delivery services, however, and the complementarity between device use and network use enables us to develop a quality-adjusted price measure for the access services already included in GDP. Our new estimates imply that accounting for innovations in consumer content delivery matters: The innovations boost consumer surplus by nearly $1,800 (2017 dollars) per connected user per year for the full period of this study (1987 to 2017) and contribute more than 1/2 percentage point to US real GDP growth during the last ten. All told, our more complete accounting of innovations is (conservatively) estimated to have moderated the post-2007 GDP growth slowdown by nearly .3 percentage points per year.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
L86|Intellectual Property and Taxation in Digital Platforms|I study the impact of competition and taxation on the openness and the intellectual property policies of two-sided digital platforms. I model a market in which two platforms compete for users and developers. First, I find that higher competition shortens the period of exclusivity granted to developers but does not influence the degree of openness of a platform. However, the higher the degree of differentiation in the developers market, the less open the platforms are. Second, I analyze two types of taxes, ad valorem and unit taxes. Ad-valorem taxes have no effect on the length of the exclusivity period. However, they increase the degree of openness of the platform when levied on users. Unit taxes instead limit the degree of openness and increase the period of exclusivity when levied on the developers market. Lastly, I find that multi-homing reduces the exclusivity period, but does not change the qualitative effects of taxation. My findings suggest that the new digital tax proposed by the European Commission, that should come into force in 2020, may reduce openness and innovation levels in the European Union.
L86|Proof of Work and Proof of Stake Consensus Protocols: A Blockchain Application for Local Complementary Currencies|This paper examines, with the help of a theoretical setting, the properties of two blockchain consensus protocols, namely the Proof of Work (PoW) and the Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol in the management of a digital local complementary currency or a network of digital local currencies. The model includes a control (by the issuer of the currency) of advantages derived from the use of a local currency by heterogeneous consumers and a determination of rewards for heterogeneous validators and miners. It also considers the resilience of these protocols to attacks conducted by an individual or a pool of validators or miners. Our results share similarities with an ordinary crypto-currency system and show that there is support for the PoS protocol for small communities of local complementary currencies, whereas the PoW appears to be more advantageous when the size of the communities is significantly large.
L86|Quels impacts des règles relatives à la protection des données sur la concurrence entre plateformes infonuagiques, industrielles et immobilières?|Le développement de l’économie des plateformes ne se limite plus aux services rendus à des consommateurs mais concerne également les services rendus à des acteurs industriels. Les services rendus en matière de stockage et de traitement des données par les plateformes infonuagiques ou la structuration de nouveaux processus productifs de type industrie 4.0 font écho à la constitution d’écosystèmes coopératifs et ouverts dans le secteur immobilier, lesquels sont favorisés par la numérisation des activités et le développement de l’internet des objets. Ce travail établit un parallèle entre ces différents types de plateformes et la numérisation du secteur immobilier. Il s’interroge sur les conditions de la coopération intra-plateforme et sur celle de la concurrence inter-plateformes, notamment en regard de la réglementation afférente à la protection des données personnelles mais aussi celle relative à la protection des communications électroniques et celle portant sur le secret des affaires.
L86|Access to Information of Disabled People on the Web: A Dispute between Accessibility and Digital Rights Management|Objective - The study aims to explore the dispute between accessibility and Digital Rights Management (DRM) for disabled people in accessing information on the Web. More specifically, this paper explores the challenges DRM has placed on them. Methodology/Technique - This study inspects the controversial interaction between accessibility and DRM in relation to disabled people's access to information on the Web using document analysis from a socio-legal perspective. Further, the black-letter law of some widely known and internationally cited regulations are used in the investigation and discussion. Findings & Novelty- It is argued that the regulations which are beneficial to the accessibility of disabled people are overruled by DRM. More specifically, the challenges posed by DRM include: (1) Negligence of disabled people's rights, (2) Conflict of accessibility, and (3) Ignorance of copyright-related exceptions. This study is a cross disciplinary study probing the issue of disabled people in both legal studies, through relevant legislation, and information studies, through the topic of information access on the Web. It examines and analyses major regulations issued by leading organizations across the two disciplines. The findings of this study may be beneficial to knowledge and practice to bridge the gap of human rights for information access, particularly for disabled people, and argues that both information and legal professionals should be responsible for this.
L86|Platform competition: Who benefits from multihoming?|Competition between two-sided platforms is shaped by the possibility of multihoming (i.e., some users joining both platforms). If initially both sides singlehome, each platform provides users on one side exclusive access to its users on the other side. If then one side multihomes, platforms compete on the singlehoming side and exert monopoly power on the multihoming side. This paper explores the allocative effects of such a change from single- to multihoming. Our results challenge the conventional wisdom, according to which the possibility of multihoming hurts the side that can multihome, while benefiting the other side. This in not always true, as the opposite may happen or both sides may benefit.
L86|Les marchés bifaces saisis par le droit de la concurrence Réflexions sur la décision Android de la Commission européenne|This work aims at analysing the EU Commission's decision Google Android of 18 July 2018. Rather than focusing on the deterring effect of the fine, we question both the underlying damage theory and the potential effects of associated remedies, especially with regard to Android's two-sided structure. Not only is this structure the keystone of Google's business model, but also that of Android's very technical architecture. Such a market structure induces specificities in terms of value creation and stakeholders' interdependence which urges to consider Google's practices (anti-fragmentation provisions and apps' pre-installation) under these two dimensions.
L86|Security Analysis of Machine Learning Systems for the Financial Sector|The use of artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML), is being extensively discussed in the financial sector. ML systems, however, tend to have specific vulnerabilities as well as those common to all information technology systems. To effectively deploy secure ML systems, it is critical to consider in advance how to address potential attacks targeting the vulnerabilities. In this paper, we classify ML systems into 12 types on the basis of the relationships among entities involved in the system and discuss the vulnerabilities and threats, as well as the corresponding countermeasures for each type. We then focus on typical use cases of ML systems in the financial sector, and discuss possible attacks and security measures.

L86|Does the Internet cause polarization? -Panel survey in Japan-|There is concern that the Internet causes ideological polarization through selective exposure and the echo chamber effect. This paper examines the effect of social media on polarization by applying a difference-in-difference approach to panel data of 50 thousand respondents in Japan. Japan is good case for this research because other factors affecting polarization like huge wealth gap and massive immigration are not serious issue, thus it offers quasi natural experimental situation to test the effect of the Internet. The results show that people who started using social media during the research period (targets) were no more polarized than people who did not (controls). There was a tendency for younger and politically moderate people to be less polarized. The only case in which the Internet increased polarization was for already radical people who started using Twitter. However, since radical people represent only 20% of the population and there was no effect for Facebook or blogs, the overall effect of the Internet was moderation, not polarization.
L86|Access to Data in Connected Cars and the Recent Reform of the Motor Vehicle Type Approval Regulation|The need for regulatory solutions for access to in-vehicle data and resources of connected cars is one of the big controversial and unsolved policy issues. Last year the EU revised the Motor Vehicle Type Approval Regulation which already entailed a FRAND-like solution for the access to repair and maintenance information (RMI) to protect competition on the automotive aftermarkets. However, the transition to connected cars changes the technological conditions for this regulatory solution significantly. This paper analyzes the reform of the type approval regulation and shows that the regulatory solutions for access to RMI are so far only very insufficiently capable of dealing with the challenges coming along with increased connectivity, e.g. with regard to the new remote diagnostic, repair and maintenance services. Therefore, an important result of the paper is that the transition to connected cars will require a further reform of the rules for the regulated access to RMI (esp. with regard to data access, interoperability, and safety/security issues). However, our analysis also suggests that the basic approach of the current regulated access regime for RMI in the type approval regulation can also be a model for developing general solutions for the currently unsolved problems of access to in-vehicle data and resources in the ecosystem of connected driving.
L86|Data-sharing in IoT Ecosystems from a Competition Law Perspective: The Example of Connected Cars|This paper analyses whether competition law can help to solve problems of access to data and interoperability in IoT ecosystems, where often one firm has exclusive control of the data produced by a smart device (and of the technical access to this device). Such a gatekeeper position can lead to the elimination of competition for after-market and other complementary services in such IoT ecosystems. This problem is analysed both from an economic and a legal perspective, and also generally for IoT ecosystems as well as for the much discussed problems of â€œaccess to in-vehicle data and resourcesâ€ in connected cars, where the â€œextended vehicleâ€ concept of the car manufacturers leads to such positions of exclusive control. The paper analyses, in particular, the competition rules about abusive behavior of dominant firms (Art. 102 TFEU) and of firms with â€œrelative market powerâ€ (Â§ 20 (1) GWB) in German competition law. These provisions might offer (if appropriately applied and amended) at least some solutions for these data access problems. Competition law, however, might not be sufficient for dealing with all or most of these problems, i.e. that also additional solutions might be needed (data portability, direct data (access) rights, or sector-specific regulation).
L86|Smartphone Use and Academic Performance: Correlation or Causal Relationship?|After a decade of correlational research, this study is the first to measure the causal impact of (general) smartphone use on educational performance. To this end, we merge survey data on general smartphone use, exogenous predictors of this use, and other drivers of academic success with the exam scores of first-year students at two Belgian universities. The resulting data are analysed with instrumental variable estimation techniques. A one-standard-deviation increase in daily smartphone use yields a decrease in average exam scores of about one point (out of 20). When relying on ordinary least squares estimations, the magnitude of this effect is substantially underestimated.
L86|Retailer Banks Information Technology Governance impact on customers statisfaction|Information technology IT has become essential component in retailer banks business model, by heavily investing in information technology assets banks are able to offer numerous e-services via new innovative channels. This development makes it imperative to adapt standard IT management framework to insure high investment return and customers satisfaction. This paper examines the relation between retailer banks IT governance practices and banks customers satisfaction. For this purpose, questionnaires developed using COBIT5 IT governance framework as benchmark and sent to 4 retailer Banks IT managers. another questionnaire filled up by 350 this bank?s customers to assess their level of satisfaction. The results show that all banks understudy partially adapting Cobit5 framework process, it also indicates that some process such as services delivery and aligned planing and organization has higher impact on customers satisfaction level.
L86|Improving interoperability in Healthcare using Hl7 FHIR|Data sharing within patients, hospitals and medical centers and the diversity of healthcare data still remain one of the main challenges in Albania. Exchanging health information is crucial because it can improve treatment, health care and decision-making process. FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is used as a standard for exchanging healthcare information in HL7 (Health Level 7). FHIR is based on the RESTful principles, so the resources can be accessed using HTTP and displayed in XML or JSON format. The aim of this paper is to analyse the use of FHIR standard in improving interoperability and integration of patient?s data between different hospital services and radiology service in Albania.
L86|There's an app feature for that: Establishing user preferred mobile app features through asynchronous online interviews|A mobile application's (app) popularity and influence is determined by its users.These users download, use, review and support an app based on a myriad of requirements and needs. The aim of this paper is to showcase the results from asynchronous online interviews, which was focused on exploring the needs of potential users of a mobile blood donation app in South Africa.This paper specifically reports on the results of the 89 interviews conducted with existing and potential blood donors in South Africa during late 2017 and early 2018. As part of a larger, exploratory sequential mixed method research project, the interview schedule described in this paper was guided by the Leximancer analyses of app store reviews of existing blood donation apps, and the results from the interview informed a quantitative questionnaire. The results of the interviews, garnered from a Leximancer analyses, showed that the potential convenience afforded to blood donors by a blood donation app was important ? aspects such as reminders to donateand GPS functionality for finding blood donation events, among others, were mentioned as preferred features by respondents.Furthermore, several respondents noted that a question and answer feature with the blood donation organisation would be a value adding feature in an app of this kind.
L86|There's a Google Scholar Alert for that: An integrative review methodology exploring mobile app features through Leximancer|Mobile application (app) usage has become a universal trend. Paramount in most app designers' focus, is what mobile app users want in terms of features offered by an app. Forming part of a larger study which aims to determine the most desirable app features for a mobile blood donation app, this paper reports on one section of that study's exploratory sequential mixed method research strategy.The paper illustrates how the use of Google Scholar alerts, over a period of six months, was systematically employed to inform the researchers of the most current research on app features. Abstracts and keywords from 47 academic articles which were included in the alert emails, were analysed through the natural language analysis software Leximancer. The findings aimed at highlighting prominent concepts and themes related to the development, selection, and application of mobile app features. Findings showed a prevalence of research articles focused on mobile health apps, specifically apps that support self-management of various illnesses.
L86|The Production of Information in an Online World: Is Copy Right?|This paper documents the extent of copying and estimates the returns to originality in online news production. We build a unique dataset combining all the online content produced by French news media (newspaper, television, radio, pure online media, and a news agency) during the year 2013 with new micro audience data. We develop a topic detection algorithm that identifies each news event, we trace the timeline of each story and study news propagation. We unravel new evidence on online news production. First, we show that one quarter of the news stories are reproduced online in less than 4 minutes. Second, we find that only 32:6% of the online content is original. Third, we show that reputation effects partly counterbalance the negative impact of plagiarism on newsgathering incentives. By using media-level daily audience and article-level social media statistics (Facebook and Twitter shares), we find that original content represents between 54 and 62% of online news consumption. Reputation mechanisms actually appear to solve about 30 to 40% of the copyright violation problem.
L86|Multimarket Contact and Platform Competition: Reassessing the Mutual Forbearance Hypothesis|Antitrust authorities are particularly concerned with the dominant market position of tech giants such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These digital conglomerates are characterized by platform-based business models. However, despite their dominance, they are competing with each other to attract the same groups of users (developers, advertisers, end users, third party sellers, etc). They therefore have not only overlapping users (or sides) but also multimarket contact (MMC). In traditional one-sided markets, theory and empirical evidence show that MMC tends to relax competition. However, it is unclear whether this result holds under platform competition. This paper examines how MMC a ects pricing behaviour and pro ts of two-sided platforms. We develop a model of platform competition with two distinct markets. We assume that platforms only charge one group of users and provide free access to the other group. We argue that multimarket platforms also generate cross-market externalities that favour their users, in addition to well-known cross-group externalities. We nd that when cross-market externalities bene t the side that has free access, price competition is ercer and total welfare increases under MMC. However, when they bene t the side that pays to access the platform, the same result only holds if the cross-group externality and/or cross-market externality are suciently high. Finally, we show that a single-market platform competing with a multimarket platform may be deterred from entering the second market if cross-market or cross-group externalities are high. Our ndings contrast with the mutual forbearance hypothesis which claims that MMC relaxes competition in traditional (one-sided) industries. From a competition policy perspective, our paper provides an insight into how antitrust authorities should review conglomerate mergers and assess the e ects of diversi cation strategies of digital platforms.
L86|Vaccine Hesitancy and Fake News: Quasi-experimental Evidence from Italy|The spread of fake news and misinformation on social media is blamed to be one of the main causes of vaccine hesitancy, one of the ten threats to global health according to World Health Organization. This paper studies the effect of diffusion of fake news on immunization rates in Italy by exploiting a quasi-experiment occurred in 2012, when the Court of Rimini officially recognized a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism and awarded injury compensation. To this end, we exploit virality of fake news following the 2012 Italian Courtâ€™s ruling along with the intensity in the exposure to non-traditional media driven by regional infrastructural differences in Internet broadband coverage. Using a Difference-in-Difference (DiD) regression on regional panel data, we show that the spread of fake news caused a drop in children immunization rates for all types of vaccines.
L86|Online privacy and market structure: Theory and evidence|This paper investigates how privacy regulation affects the structure of online markets. We provide a simple theoretical model capturing the basic trade-off between the degree of privacy intrusion and the informativeness of advertising. We derive empirically testable hypotheses regarding a possibly asymmetric effect of privacy regulation on large and small firms using a diff-diff-diff model with heterogeneous treatment timing. Our theoretical model predicts that privacy regulation may affect predominantly large firms, even if - as our data confirms - these large firms tend to offer more privacy. Our empirical results show that, if any, only large firms were negatively affected, suggesting that privacy regulation might boost competition by leveling out the playing field for small firms.

L86|Trading stocks on blocks: The quality of decentralized markets|The trust-free nature of blockchain-based systems challenges the role of traditional platform providers and enables the creation of new, intermediary-free markets. Despite the growing number of such markets, the impact of the blockchain's configuration on market outcomes remains unclear. In this study, we utilize order-level data from realworld financial markets to explore the impact of the blockchain parameters block size and block creation time on the quality of decentralized markets. More specifically, we find that increasing the blocks' capacity improves market activity, while higher block frequencies impose a trade-off between higher turnovers and lower trade sizes. In addition, we identify the block creation time and block size as core drivers of daily and intraday liquidity, respectively. In consequence, improving liquidity goes hand in hand with a higher activity. However, the reciprocal relationship between blockchain parameters and the increasing price impact of a block also indicate that faster and bigger blocks are no silver bullet to scale decentralized markets and may facilitate volatility. In total, we contribute an initial, technology-agnostic assessment of the quality of decentralized markets that aims to guide interdisciplinary researchers and innovative practitioners.
L86|The blockchain, plums, and lemons: Information asymmetries & transparency in decentralized markets|Despite a growing interest, researchers and practitioners still struggle to transfer the blockchain concept introduced by Bitcoin to market-oriented application scenarios. To shed light on the technology's usage in markets with asymmetric information, this study analyzes the effect of the blockchain's public transparency paradigm on behavioral patterns and market outcomes. In line with prior research, our findings indicate that the blockchain's shared record mitigates adverse selection effects and reduces moral hazard of good market participants (plums). In addition, we identify an incentive for bad market participants (lemons) to behave opportunistically in the presence of perfect quality information. More specifically, the disclosed information allows them to learn about quality differences between plums and lemons, deceive their counterparties, and move to a new equilibrium with increased utility. As a result, the market collapses despite a welfare gain and future generations are denied market access. In addition, plums and lemons are committed to inefficient equilibria following irrational behavior. In total, this study aims to provide initial guidance for blockchain adoption in the context of markets with information asymmetries and highlights risks that arise from competition, the exposure to irrational behavior, and the implementation of services on the infrastructure level.
L86|Stars in social media: New light through old windows?|We review the economics of superstars, originally developed for stars in traditional media, and discuss whether they are applicable for the (allegedly) novel phenomenon of stars in social media (influencer, micro-celebrities). Moreover, we analyse potentially new factors for creating social media superstardom that may be special to the nature of social media. Our overall result is that the economics of superstars, like the role of talent, market concentration effects, MacDonald-style and Adler-style effects, remain applicable and relevant for social media stars. In line with this assessment, we find that several (allegedly) new star factors in social media, like user-generated content, prosumption, disappearance of gatekeepers and authenticity, turn out to be only partly applicable or just slightly different to traditional concepts. However, algorithm management and upload strategies represent novel success factors relevant for social media superstardom that are not captured by traditional superstar theories.
L86|Happily ever after? Vertical and horizontal mergers in the U.S. media industry|This paper provides an economic analysis of recent vertical and horizontal mergers in the U.S. industry for audiovisual media content, including the AT&T-Time Warner and the Disney-Fox mergers. Using a theory-driven approach, we examine economic effects of these types of mergers on market competition, focusing on digital media content distribution. In doing so, we address three research questions: (i) Is the current development of analyzing industry with its recent merger activity concerning? (ii) Would vertical or horizontal integration be more preferable for overall welfare and competition in this industry? (iii) What are implications for antitrust policy? We conclude from our analysis that in the already highly horizontally concentrated U.S. market for audiovisual content the process of further vertical integration creates concerns from a competition policy perspective. Moreover, even though horizontal concentration on some of the market stages may be anticompetitive as well, vertical integration is likely to be more harmful. As a consequence, we recommend a stricter approach to vertical merger control in this industry, as well as a more active abuse control against already vertically-integrated media companies.
L86|Success factors of academic journals in the digital age|Digitalisation has opened up new opportunities for the dissemination of information. That is why many academic journals have started introducing online services since the early 1990s. Previous studies suggest that online availability and free access to articles are positively connected to the number of citations. However, little is known about the relative impact of the introduction of online services at the journal level and what provides a long-term competitive advantage in times of digital change. Based on panel data from SSCI-listed management journals from 1989 to 2016, we examine which journals have pioneered the digital field, to what extent first-mover advantages can be identified, and which journal characteristics are associated with citation-based performance indicators. Our results show that lower-ranked journals were the first to introduce digital services and were beneficiaries of the digital age. Furthermore, we find a significant connection between the international composition of author teams and performance indicators. Our analysis of the relationship between online availability as well as open access and performance contradicts previous studies as we find that significant correlations diminish when adequately controlling for journal-level effects.
L86|Taxation in the digital economy: Recent policy developments and the question of value creation|"The paper reviews the evidence on the challenges of digitalization for direct (corporate profit) and indirect (consumption) taxation. Based on both anecdotal and empirical evidence, we evaluate ongoing developments at the OECD and European Union level and argue that there is no justification for introducing a new tax order for digital businesses. In particular, the significant digital presence and the digital services tax as put forward by the European Commission will most likely distort corporate decisions and spur tax competition. To contribute to the development of tax rules in line with value creation as the gold standard for profit taxation the paper discusses data as a ""new"" value-driving asset in the digital economy. It draws on insights from interdisciplinary research to highlight that the value of data emerges through proprietary activities conducted within businesses. We ultimately discuss how existing transfer pricing solutions can be adapted to business models employing data mining."
L86|The Welfare Effects of Social Media|The rise of social media has provoked both optimism about potential societal benefits and concern about harms such as addiction, depression, and political polarization. We present a randomized evaluation of the welfare effects of Facebook, focusing on US users in the run-up to the 2018 midterm election. We measured the willingness-to-accept of 2,743 Facebook users to deactivate their Facebook accounts for four weeks, then randomly assigned a subset to actually do so in a way that we verified. Using a suite of outcomes from both surveys and direct measurement, we show that Facebook deactivation (i) reduced online activity, including other social media, while increasing offline activities such as watching TV alone and socializing with family and friends; (ii) reduced both factual news knowledge and political polarization;(iii) increased subjective well-being; and (iv) caused a large persistent reduction in Facebook use after the experiment. Deactivation reduced post-experiment valuations of Facebook, but valuations still imply that Facebook generates substantial consumer surplus.
L86|Paying to Program? Engineering Brand and High-Tech Wages|We test the hypothesis that IT workers accept a compensating differential to work with emerging IT systems, and that employers that invest in these systems can, in turn, capture greater value from the wages they pay. We show that much of the utility IT workers derive from these systems is from skills acquired on the job. This is principally true for younger workers at employers where skill development is encouraged, and the effects are stronger in thicker markets where workers with newer skills have more outside options. An analysis of the text in online employer reviews supports the notion that IT workers value access to interesting IT systems above most other employer attributes. These findings are important because first, they provide evidence of how worker preferences can influence corporate IT investment decisions; second, because they shed light on factors influencing IT skill development; and third, because they point to a potentially important explanation for returns from IT investments.
L86|Assessing the Gains from E-Commerce|E-Commerce represents a rapidly growing share of consumer spending in the U.S. We use transactions-level data on credit and debit cards from Visa, Inc. between 2007 and 2017 to quantify the resulting consumer surplus. We estimate that E-Commerce spending reached 8% of consumption by 2017, yielding consumers the equivalent of a 1% permanent boost to their consumption, or over $1,000 per household. While some of the gains arose from saving travel costs of buying from local merchants, most of the gains stemmed from substituting to online merchants. Higher income cardholders gained more, as did consumers in more densely populated counties.
L86|Too Much Data: Prices and Inefficiencies in Data Markets|When a user shares her data with an online platform, she typically reveals relevant information about other users. We model a data market in the presence of this type of externality in a setup where one or multiple platforms estimate a user’s type with data they acquire from all users and (some) users value their privacy. We demonstrate that the data externalities depress the price of data because once a user’s information is leaked by others, she has less reason to protect her data and privacy. These depressed prices lead to excessive data sharing. We characterize conditions under which shutting down data markets improves (utilitarian) welfare. Competition between platforms does not redress the problem of excessively low price for data and too much data sharing, and may further reduce welfare. We propose a scheme based on mediated data-sharing that improves efficiency.
L86|Deceptive Products on Platforms| On many online platforms, sellers offer products with additional fees and features. Platforms often deliberately shroud these fees from consumers. Examples are shipping fees, luggage fees on flight-aggregator websites, or resort fees and upgrades on hotel booking platforms. We explore the incentives of two-sided platforms to disclose additional fees and design a transparent marketplace when consumers might naively ignore shrouded additional fees. First, we find that platforms have stronger incentives to shroud additional fees than sellers in the absence of platforms. This result holds for monopoly platforms and in some competitive settings. Second, competition might induce platforms to regulate additional fees, which benefits consumers. We discuss connections to frequent practices like drip pricing, and platforms like Amazon or eBay regulating shipping fees.
L86|Commuting and internet traffic congestion|We examine the fine microstructure of commuting in a game-theoretic setting with a continuum of commuters. Commuters' home and work locations can be heterogeneous. A commuter transport network is exogenous. Traffic speed is determined by link capacity and by local congestion at a time and place along a link, where local congestion at a time and place is endogenous. The model can be reinterpreted to apply to congestion on the internet. We find sufficient conditions for existence of equilibrium, that multiple equilibria are ubiquitous, and that the welfare properties of morning and evening commute equilibria differ.
L86|The Advancement in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Economic Development: A Panel Analysis|This study analyses the impact of advancement in information and communication technologies (ICT) on economic development over the period of 2000 to 2017 in the case of 87 developed and developing countries. The developed and developing countries are selected following the ranking of International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook Database, October 2018. This article uses three types of analysis: the first is based on the whole sample, and for comparative analysis developed and developing countries’ analysis are done separately. The results of panel least squares reveal that advancement in information and communication technologies has an insignificant relationship with economic development, whereas the advancement in information and communication technologies is playing a positive and significant role in the economic development of developing countries. This shows that developed countries are getting more benefits from advancement in information and communication technologies in comparison with developing countries in the process of economic development. The developed countries have a more stable macroeconomic environment in comparison with developing countries, so macroeconomic stability is playing more significant role in the case of developed countries. If developing countries want to achieve higher economic development, they must increase trade and physical capital with stable macroeconomic environment. Moreover, developing countries should adopt advancement in information and communication technologies (ICT) to compete with developed countries in the process of economic development.
L86|Travellers’ choice of information sources and information channels for domestic trips|The topics of disintermediation and re-intermediation, both offline and online, have captured the attention of researchers and practitioners alike. Relying on an information search perspective, this study aims to identify which factors (i.e. different socio-demographic characteristics and travel-related variables) best predict whether a traveller will seek information from a travel agency or from a service provider (i.e. information source choice) and if this will be done face to face or through the Internet (i.e. choice of communication channel). Contribution to the body of knowledge and managerial implications are discussed and suggestions for future research are given.
L86|Evidence of Decreasing Internet Entropy: The Lack of Redundancy in DNS Resolution by Major Websites and Services|This paper analyzes the extent to which the Internet’s global domain name resolution (DNS) system has preserved its distributed resilience given the rise of cloud-based hosting and infrastructure. We explore trends in the concentration of the DNS space since at least 2011. In addition, we examine changes in domains’ tendency to “diversify” their pool of nameservers – how frequently domains employ DNS management services from multiple providers rather than just one provider – a comparatively costless and therefore puzzlingly rare decision that could supply redundancy and resilience in the event of an attack or service outage affecting one provider.
L86|The Welfare Effects of Peer Entry in the Accommodation Market: The Case of Airbnb|We study the effects of enabling peer supply through Airbnb in the accommodation industry. We present a model of competition between flexible and dedicated sellers - peer hosts and hotels - who provide differentiated products. We estimate this model using data from major US cities and quantify the welfare effects of Airbnb on travelers, hosts, and hotels. The welfare gains are concentrated in locations (New York) and times (New Years Eve) when hotels are capacity constrained. This occurs because peer hosts are responsive to market conditions, expand supply as hotels fill up, and keep hotel prices down as a result.
L86|Incentives Can Reduce Bias in Online Reviews|Online reviews are a powerful means of propagating the reputations of products, services, and even employers. However, existing research suggests that online reviews often suffer from selection biasâ€”people with extreme opinions are more motivated to share them than people with moderate opinions, resulting in biased distributions of reviews. Providing incentives for reviewing has the potential to reduce this selection bias, because incentives can mitigate the motivational deficit of people who hold moderate opinions. Using data from one of the leading employer review companies, Glassdoor, the paper shows that voluntary reviews have a different distribution from incentivized reviews. The likely bias in the distribution of voluntary reviews can affect workersâ€™ choice of employers, because it changes the ranking of industries by average employee satisfaction.
L86|Economic Policy for Artificial Intelligence|Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI)—a general purpose technology affecting many industries—has been focused on advances in machine learning, which we recast as a quality-adjusted drop in the price of prediction. How will this sharp drop in price impact society? Policy will influence the impact on two key dimensions: diffusion and consequences. First, in addition to subsidies and intellectual property (IP) policy that will influence the diffusion of AI in ways similar to their effect on other technologies, three policy categories—privacy, trade, and liability—may be uniquely salient in their influence on the diffusion patterns of AI. Second, labor and antitrust policies will influence the consequences of AI in terms of employment, inequality, and competition.

L86|Some Facts of High-Tech Patenting|Patenting in software, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence has grown rapidly in recent years. Such patents are acquired primarily by large US technology firms such as IBM, Microsoft, Google, and HP, as well as by Japanese multinationals such as Sony, Canon, and Fujitsu. Chinese patenting in the US is small but growing rapidly, and world-leading for drone technology. Patenting in machine learning has seen exponential growth since 2010, although patenting in neural networks saw a strong burst of activity in the 1990s that has only recently been surpassed. In all technological fields, the number of patents per inventor has declined near-monotonically, except for large increases in inventor productivity in software and semiconductors in the late 1990s. In most high-tech fields, Japan is the only country outside the US with significant US patenting activity; however, whereas Japan played an important role in the burst of neural network patenting in the 1990s, it has not been involved in the current acceleration. Comparing the periods 1970-89 and 2000-15, patenting in the current period has been primarily by entrant assignees, with the exception of neural networks.
L86|Certification, Reputation and Entry: An Empirical Analysis|Markets with asymmetric information will often employ third-party certification labels to distinguish between higher and lower quality transactions, yet little is known about the effects of certification policies on the evolution of markets. How does the stringency in quality certification affect the intensity and composition of entry, incumbents' reactions, and market outcomes? We use detailed administrative data and exploit a policy change on eBay to explore how a more selective certification policy affects entry and behavior across a rich set of online market segments. We find that after the policy change, entry increases and does so more intensely in markets where it is harder to become certified. The average quality of entrants also increases more in the more affected markets, while the quality distribution of entrants exhibits fatter tails ex post. Finally, some incumbents increase the quality of their service to maintain certification and deliver higher quality after the policy change. The results help inform the design of certification policies in electronic and other markets with asymmetric information.
L86|Fake News and Advertising on Social Media: A Study of the Anti-Vaccination Movement|Online sources sometimes publish information that is false or intentionally misleading. We study the role of social networks and advertising on social networks in the dissemination of false news stories about childhood vaccines. We document that anti-vaccine Facebook groups disseminate false stories beyond the groups as well as serving as an “echo” chamber. We also find that after Facebook's ban on advertising by fake new sites, the sharing of fake news articles on Facebook fell by 75% on Facebook compared to Twitter.
L86|Competing with Superstars in the Mobile App Market|" Firms considering to enter into online markets face significant demand uncertainty and consumer search costs, with consumers most likely finding previously successful products in the market. This leads to a trade-off for potential entrants. Consider the appearance of a new very popular product (â€œsuperstar"") in a particular niche. The popular product resolves demand uncertainty but also increases search costs for new entrants relative to the superstar. The interaction between these two forces could result in too much entry by low quality products, or not enough entry. I empirically examine these effects using 2012- 2013 data on mobile games in the Android mobile app store. I show that there are large increases in entry in niches where the superstar appears, unless they were already popular niches (â€œdiscovered""). I also show that the superstar reduces the quality of the new entrants and intensifies price competition."
L86|Technology Adoption in a Hierarchical Network| This paper studies the effect of network structure on technology adoption, in the setting of the Python programming language. A major release of Python, Python 3, provides more advanced but backward-incompatible features to Python 2. We model the dynamics of Python 3 adoption made by package developers. Python packages form a hierarchical network through dependency requirements. The adoption decision involves not only updating one's own source code, but also dealing with dependency packages lacking Python 3 support. We build a dynamic model of technology adoption where each package makes an irreversible decision to provide support for Python 3. The optimal timing of adoption requires a prediction of all future states, for the package itself as well as each of its dependencies. With a complete dataset of package characteristics for all historical releases, we are able to draw the complete hierarchical structure of the network, and simplify the estimation by grouping packages into different layers based on the dependency relationship. We study how individual adoption decisions can propagate along the links in such a hierarchical network. We also test the effectiveness of various counterfactual policies that can promote a faster adoption process.
L86|Peer influence in the workplace: Evidence from an enterprise digital platform| We study how the broadcasting of peer success on an enterprise digital platform affects worker productivity. Using sales workers in an IT service company as our research context, we leverage the unexpected resignation of several HR staff members as an exogenous shock to the sharing of peer success and implement a difference-in-differences estimation. The empirical evidence shows that sales workers exert less effort when peer success messages are absent. We next investigate how the framing of peer success messages may generate different forms of peer influence, and particularly explore two ways of framing—messages that highlight peer’s ability (i.e., ability-based messages) and messages that highlight peer’s effort (i.e., effort-based messages). We find that although both types of peer success messages have a positive influence on worker productivity, there exists important heterogeneity. For ability-based messages, workers respond most strongly if their peers are socially close or have worse historical performance. By contrast, the effect of effort-based messages does not vary by peer characteristics.
L86|Search and Information Frictions on Global E-Commerce Platforms: Evidence from Aliexpress| Global e-commerce platforms provide a promising avenue that connects sellers and buyers from different parts of the world. In this project, we begin by documenting a few new stylized facts about exporter dynamics on global e-commerce platforms using data from Aliexpress. These facts indicate substantial search and information frictions in this market, due to the large number of market participants and significant ex-ante heterogeneity in quality. These imply that initial demand shocks could have a persistent impact on growth and performance can be quite path-dependent. Motivated by by the empirical facts, we design an experiment where we randomly generate demand and information shocks to a set of small perspective exporters via randomly placed orders and reviews. We follow all sellers for 3 months and collect a rich set of firm performance and quality data to estimate the extent of search and information frictions. Our findings suggest that initial demand shocks significantly boost subsequent sales among the treated sellers. Information on product quality seems to matter more compared to information on shipping quality, suggesting that the former may be the major type of asymmetric information between the two sides of the market. We further explore other potential determinants of growth and heterogeneity in the treatment effect.
L86|Cloud Computing and National Accounting|As the digitalisation of the economy progresses, one of the changes in business models affecting statistics including GDP and trade data is the adoption of cloud computing services in place of fixed investment in computer and communications hardware and the development of own-account software. This rapidly growing phenomenon involves the detachment of the physical location of data and computing processes from their creation, ownership and use, potentially introducing transactions across national borders. In this paper, we construct price indices for cloud services in the UK, showing significant price declines both before and after adjusting for quality in the past few years. We discuss the conceptualisation of a volume measure for cloud services. We discuss the implications of cloud use by businesses for the interpretation of measured business investment, GDP and productivity growth, noting in particular the limitations of measuring total factor productivity through growth accounting, and the importance of double deflation when there are significant changes in the price of intermediate goods such as cloud services. We discuss also the implications for the interpretation of international trade statistics. Finally, we set out the requirements for official statistical surveys to be able to track cloud computing in the future.
L86|Smart contracts and transaction costs|Because of the enforcement based on the blockchain technology, smart contracts are supposed to allow contracting parties to conduct transactions more efficiently than traditional contracts. This paper challenges that claim. Because of the need for an efficiency-enhancing adaptation of institutions—a chief problem of transaction cost economics-traditional contracts may incur lower transaction costs than smart contracts.
L86|Modeling and Checking the Power Quality of High Pressure Sodium Vapor Lamp|High pressure sodium Vapor lamps due to long service life High Light, as the most comprehensive street lighting and industrial lighting Whose use is increasing day by day. One of the major drawbacks to these lamps is producing a lot of current harmonic. Therefore, check the Power Quality of these lamps becomes necessary. To check the quality of our lamps, it's necessary to express the exact model of these lamps. In this paper, we simulate a high-pressure lamp based on plasma physics equations. With this exact model, the power consumption of these lamps is considered by using THD and the results are compared with the standard values. In this paper, taking into account the magnetic ballast for a high-pressure sodium Vapor lamp, a precise simulation of these lamps was performed using the MATLAB / Simulink software.
L86|Slanted images: Measuring nonverbal media bias|I build a dataset of over one million images used on the front page of websites around the 2016 election period. I then use machine-learning tools to detect the faces of politicians across the images and measure the nonverbal emotional content expressed by each politician. Combining this with data on the partisan composition of each website’s users, I show that websites portray politicians that align with the partisan preferences of their users with more positive emotions. I also find that nonverbal coverage by Republican-leaning websites was not consistent over the 2016 election, but became more favorable towards Donald Trump after he clinched the Republican nomination.
L86|Associating Facebook Measurable Activities with Personality Traits: A Fuzzy Sets Approach|In this study we identify potential associations between people’s personality (utilizing the popular Big Five personality model) and measurable Facebook activities such as number of likes received, number of posts, number of comments on posts. Extant literature suggests that personality can be manifested through different features of the Facebook profiles but under an implicit assumption that those users may belong in a single psychographic group. However, it has been shown that people may share characteristics, common acts and behaviors of more than one psychographic group. In this study we aim to address limitations of previous studies, by adopting a fuzzy set approach which is capable to handle users’ membership in multiple psychographic groups. Furthermore, fsQCA offers equifinality, which means that research can end up to the same outcome, beginning from different initial combinations of data. The work presented here provides empirical evidence concerning the association between Facebook activities and users' personalities in a novel way indicating the significance of this relationship and providing alternative combinations that lead to the same output. Furthermore, it paves the ground towards predicting social platforms' measurements, other than Facebook, relying on users' personalities, using the same technique but on different fields of study and social media platforms.
L86|Demographic variation in active consumer behaviour: Who searches most for retail broadband services?|Consumers who actively search for better broadband deals may benefit from lower prices or improved service quality compared to those who do not. If, however, consumers differ in their propensity to engage with the market and actively search, these potential benefits may not accrue equally. This paper investigates differences in consumer search activity for telecommunications services across small geographic areas. We exploit rich and novel data from a commercial price comparison site to explore the dispersion of consumer search in the Irish retail broadband market, while controlling for supply-side variations. By linking geo-coded searches to census data on small area socio-economic characteristics, we identify the areas where most search originates and can thus characterise the socio-economic and demographic groups to whom the benefits of search are most likely to accrue. We find evidence that areas populated by many highly educated, married people, commuters, mortgage holders, and retirees are among the most active in search. In contrast, those areas in which many older people, farmers, low-skilled workers and students reside give rise to significantly fewer consumer searches.
L86|The Effect of Social Media on Employees’ Job Performance: The mediating Role of Organizational Structure|Social media is creating a drastic change at workplaces, and organizations are increasingly interested in adaption of it for their business processes. The aim of social media usage at workplace may differ but ultimate objective is to build social networks and sharing. This empirical research examined the effect of use of social media on employees’ job performance and the mediating effect of an organizational structure. Survey data gathered from 205 valid responses and analyzed by structural equation modelling technique. Results revealed that “use of social media” is positively correlated with “employees’ job performance”, while organizational structure has positive mediating effect.
L86|Purchase, Pirate, Publicize: Private-network Music Sharing And Market Album Sales|I quantify the effects of private-network music sharing on aggregate album sales in the BitTorrent era using a panel of US sales and private-network downloads for 2,109 albums during 2008. Exogenous shocks to the network's sharing constraints address the simultaneity problem. In theory, private-network activity could crowd out sales by building aggregate file sharing capacity or increase sales through word of mouth. I find evidence that private-network sharing results in decreased album sales for top-tier artists, though the economic impact is quite modest. However, private-network activity seems to help mid-tier artists. The results are consistent with claims that word of mouth is stronger for lesser-known artists and that digital sales are more vulnerable to increases in file sharing capacity. I discuss policy implications and alternatives to costly legal efforts to shut down private file sharing networks.
L86|Privacy and Platform Competition|We analyze platform competition where user data is collected to improve adtargeting. Considering that users incur privacy costs, we show that the equilibrium level of data provision is distorted and can be inefficiently high or low: if overall competition is weak or if targeting benefits are low, too much private data is collected, and vice-versa. Further, we find that softer competition on either market side leads to more data collection, which implies substitutability between competition policy measures on both market sides. Moreover, if platforms engage in two-sided pricing, data provision is efficient.
L86|The Application of Artificial Intelligence at Chinese Digital Platform Giants: Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent|Abstract The Chinese digital platform giants – Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent – have quickly risen to be amongst the most notable developers and users of artificial intelligence. One important catalyst for this development has been the so-called Platform Business Group (PBG) strategy used by Chinese digital platform firms. In this strategy a platform firm aims to develop powerful synergies by tightly linking together a number of different platforms it owns so as to offer multiple services to users under its umbrella. By applying the PBG strategy, Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent are able to exploit enormous multi-faceted datasets on individuals for use in the development of artificial intelligence algorithms. As a result, the Chinese platform giants appear to be taking a somewhat different approach with the development and use of artificial intelligence than their Western counterparts. If the Chinese platform giants succeed in their efforts to expand into the global market, their business strategies will introduce a different threat to the conventional European industries from those challenges already presented by Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.
L86|Using Preference Vector Modeling to Polarity Shift for Improvement of Opinion Mining|This research proposes the preference vector modeling (PVM) to deal with polarity shifts for improvement of sentiment classification for word of mouth (WOM). WOM has become a main information resource of consumers while making business or buying strategies. A polarity shift happens when the sentiment polarity of a term is different from that of its associated WOM document, which is one of the most difficult issues in the field of opinion mining. Traditional opinion mining approaches depend on predefined sentiment polarities of terms to be accumulated as the WOM?s sentiment polarity or to be trained based on machine learning techniques, but ignore the significance of polarity shift due to some specific usage of terms. There are two kinds of approaches used for detection of polarity shifts in the literature, which are rule-based approaches and machine learning approaches. However, it is hard for a rule-based approach to manually define a complete rule set. The machine learning approach, which is based on the vector space model (VSM), suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, this research proposes a novel approach to deal with polarity shifts for sentiment analysis because of the weakness of existing research in the literature. Firstly, this research proposes PVM based on an integration of opinionated documents and a star ranking system. The dimensionality of preference vectors equals the number of the star ranking system. Thus, the proposed PVM overcomes the curse of dimensionality as the number of dimensionality of the star ranking system is much fewer than that of the document vector based on VSM. Then, the automatic approach for polarity shift detection is proposed. The document preference vector is represented based on the average vector of term preference vectors. This way is able to deal with opinionated documents if they are extracted from the same scale of the star ranking systems and the same domain. Finally, the integrated approach of PVM and some classification techniques is used for improvement of sentiment classification for word of mouth.
L86|On a New Digital Electrotherapy Equipment with Microcontrollers and Complex Programmable Logic Device|Nowadays innovation such as applications of electronic devices and information technologies are commonly seen as one of the most important trends in sustainable development of health. Recently, Electrotherapy Equipment typed Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) and Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) are widely used for treatment of general acute and chronic pain syndromes. This equipment uses electrical stimulation of the peripheral nervous system to override pain messages or evoke muscle contractions and requires electrical stimulation with high accuracy. Traditionally, the electronic devices, then the IC, and most recently low power Complex Programmable logic (CPLDs) together with Information Technology (IT) have been used in designing and manufacturing of medical equipment. To improve the treatment?s capabilities, effects, planning and performance, a new Digital Electrotherapy Equipment has been designed using advanced system capabilities and re-programmability, programmable logic devices (PLDs), especially low power Complex Programmable logic (CPLDs), low-power, high-performance Microcontroller, based on neurophysiology and medical treatment knowledge. This new device has Switching Power Supply, Interface, Microcontroller, Pulse Amplitude, Pulse type modifier, Power Amplifier, Instrument Errors, and CPLD and Microcontroller Interface parts. The new type of the Electrotherapy Equipment also has an automatic self-test routine to detect functional errors during operations and display on a LCD. This equipment was tested several times at Center of Electrical Department, Faculty of Electronics-Telecommunications, Hanoi University of Technology (HUT) and has been used widely in several hospitals in Vietnam for treatment of thousands of patients. Applying the new technology allows more complex capabilities, improves the functionality, ergonomics, and lowers the production costs of the equipment. This digital electrotherapy equipment is easy to upgrade by software. The new equipment can generate 11 methods in treatment, 18 different treatment currents and 21 different waveforms which can be used to treat acute sprains and strains, arthritis, low back pain, osteoarthritis, shingles, spinal cord disorders, sports injuries and tendonitis. All of created waveforms have a high accuracy and stability satisfied EU standards. The tests and treatment results show that treatment?s capabilities, effects, planning and performance of the new type of the Electrotherapy Equipment are remarkably improved compared to the traditional ones. This method of design can also be used for many other medical devices.
L86|Designing for user experience: Analysing app store reviews for app feature identification|South Africa's blood stock level is often categorised as alarmingly low, leaving blood donation organisations in constant need of voluntary, unpaid blood donations to ensure their ability to supply hospitals with safe blood. Globally, there are successful mobile blood donation apps facilitating blood donation by providing useful services to blood donors, however similar apps available in South Africa are new, and not popular when compared to global standards. An estimated 5.9 million South Africans download and use mobile applications (apps), and this paper explores the process and results from the first phase of a study, which employed a sequential mixed method research design, to identify user-preferred features for a mobile blood donation app. The findings of the study should serve as a roadmap to blood donation organisations in South Africa, regarding what users expect from a blood donation app, and which features may possibly stimulate a constant or increased frequency of blood donation instances. The two largest app stores, Google Play and Apple iOS, served as the sources of the eventual sample of blood donation apps, of which the user reviews were analysed. Commenting from a design science paradigm, this paper reports on the selection process that had been followed to sample the relevant apps, and further discusses the user insights gained from the analysis of these apps' reviews. The paper further reports on how the app review analysis findings informed the creation of an interview schedule, that was used to gain in-depth understanding of perceptions held by users of the blood donation apps, specifically regarding the users' preferred features in these types of apps.
L86|Mobile application for diabetes follow-up and analysis|It is very difficult for people with diabetes, one of the most common diseases of recent years, to follow factors that affect their disease. With the development of technology, patients have become able to measure their own blood sugar using tiny devices whenever they want, wherever they want, instead of going to hospitals to measure blood sugar. Considering that nowadays when smartphones are so widespread, diabetes can be easily followed using a mobile application. In this paper, design and development of a mobile application that allows a patient to save his/her diabetes related parameters at certain intervals and transmit the values to his/her doctor is explained. Since potential users of the designed application are Turkish people, the interfaces of the software application are in Turkish. The user interface in English is currently being developed.
L86|A simple application for network stegonagraphy|The Internet has changed the paradigm of traditional circuit switch network largely. The services and applications have been created by the network users themselves. This paradigm shift is one of the main sources of the tremendous success of the Internet. On the other hand, although the Internet has created many new possibilities and opportunities, communication through the Internet is subject to many security risks. In this paper, we propose a simple application to transfer sensitive data securely and present its details. The application we propose secures the exchange of sensitive data by relying on network steganography. When the users input data at the application?s interface, the data is hidden in IP packets before transmission so that it cannot be obtained by malicious users. Since the required libraries are more stable and can be easily found on the Linux platform, the application was developed for the Linux platform.
L86|Breaking Audio Captchas for IRCTC Booking Automization|CAPTCHAs are computer generated tests in the form of images, audios and object recognition that world can communicate easily and computer systems cannot. Internet sites present users with captchas to set apart human users from false computer programs, often referred to as bots. Their purpose is to obstruct attackers from performing automatic registration, online polling and other such actions. IRCTC, being the website to reserve tickets for Indian railways, one of the biggest railway network, has also employed both image and audio captchas for security purposes. However, the audio captchas used on the website are not effective in distinguishing between humans and bots. Most of the visual CAPTCHAs and some audio CAPTCHAs on different websites have been cracked using various methods of machine learning and we propound an identical idea to examine the security of audio CAPTCHAs on IRCTC website. In this paper, we show that our bot is able to break the IRCTC audio captchas with a success rate of 98%, 96.04% and 80.3% using three different models. Along with breaking the captcha, another python script written by us was able to automate the process of ticket booking. Thus, combining all of it into a single package could result in a system which would login and reserve tickets only by a single click. Travel brokers can easily use such a system for easy and fast booking of tatkal tickets which would lead to commercializing this activity for deriving huge profit from needy travelers.
L86|Applicability of Teleworking in Software Distributed Development|The purpose of this research is to confirm the possibility of personnel participation in a software development project remotely. Modern system development projects require secure specialist personnel with a wide range of technical capabilities to satisfy the diversified customer needs and the remarkable technological advancement. Nevertheless, many Japanese companies are oriented toward centralized development. There are limited people in the organization with the latest technology, and their work orientation is not uniform, making it difficult to realize intensive development. These trends are not limited to the IT industry. At the same time, the Japanese government recommends that companies adopt teleworking in order to provide flexibility to their employees and improve their quality of life. In research, teleworking has become a trend in current software development environments, confirming the possibility of distributed software development in the IT industry. Here, we propose a teleworking system configuration for such distributed development.
L86|The Internet and the grassroots foundation of civil society in Indochina|It is widely believed that the social contract, credited to Magna Carta of Englandin the 13th century and subsequent thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes, JohnLocke, is the major factor that has empowered the concept of civil society in theworld, starting from the West. This perspective paper suggests that althoughthat still holds to a large extent, the case of Indochina shows a diametrical, andunnatural, difference as civic engagement in social matters of deep influence wasborn out of the state’s necessity to tolerate diverging voices, either bycontrolling, empowering or engaging, in order to cope with social conflicts. Thisobservation gives rise to the need for further studies on the nature of theinformation-power nexus in the age of big data and social networks.
L86|Does connection with @realDonaldTrump affect stock prices?|This study investigates whether investors react to signals of an association between a firm and Donald Trump indicated by tweets containing both words 'Trump' (or '@realDonaldTrump') and a S&P500 firm name. Our results reveal that a large number of such tweets ignite speculations about a political connection between a firm and the US's President, thus affecting investors' trading behaviors. In particular, a rise in these tweets induces significant increases in trading volatility and trading volume. However, we do not find such great impacts on stock returns, suggesting that the speculations are more likely to spread among small non-institutional investors. Further investigations show that sentiments embedded in these tweets have limited influence. There is evidence of a changing market behavior towards such tweets centered by the President's inauguration.
L86|Social media bots and stock markets|This study examines whether stock indicators are affected by information in social media such as Twitter. Using a daily sample of tweets with a FTSE 100 firm name over two years, we find insignificant associations between tweets/bot-tweets and stock returns whereas there is a strongly significant association with volatility and trading volume. Using a high-frequency sample, we detect a positive (negative) impact of tweets (bot-tweets) on stock returns. The impact of bot-tweets vanishes within 30 minutes. The results for volatility and trading volume are consistent with the daily data analysis. In addition, event study reveals a bounce-back pattern of price reactions in response to negative retweets. Abnormal increases in tweets/bottweets have significant effects on stock volatility, trading volume and liquidity.
L86|Consumers' Privacy Choices in the Era of Big Data|Recent progress in information technologies provides sellers with detailed knowledge about consumers' preferences, approaching perfect price discrimination in the limit. We construct a model where consumers with less strategic sophistication than the seller's pricing algorithm face a trade-off when buying. They choose between a direct, transaction cost-free sales channel and a privacy-protecting, but costly, anonymous channel. We show that the anonymous channel is used even in the absence of an explicit taste for privacy if consumers are not too strategically sophisticated. This provides a micro-foundation for consumers' privacy choices. Some consumers benefit but others suffer from their anonymization.

L86|Airbnb, Blablacar, Le Bon Coin ... Pourquoi et comment utilise-t-on les plateformes de consommation collaborative ?|Le succès de Airbnb, Blablacar ou Le Bon Coin témoigne de l'engouement des français pour les plateformes de consommation collaborative. Les récents travaux sur l'économie collaborative et l'économie du partage ont montré la diversité des motivations des utilisateurs : économiques, environnementales, idéologiques. Dans cet article nous cherchons à expliquer les déterminants des usages des plateformes de consommation collaborative, ainsi que des gains monétaires obtenus sur ces plateformes. En exploitant une enquête sur 2000 français âgés de plus de 18 ans, nous trouvons que les individus ayant des utilisateurs de plateformes dans leur entourage, un niveau de vie confortable, un niveau d'éducation élevé, et un niveau de confiance fort envers les autres, sont plus enclins à utiliser des plateformes collaboratives, et ont un usage plus diversifié de ces plateformes. Les effets varient selon le type de plateforme considéré et à l'intérieur de chaque type de plateforme, selon le rôle des utilisateurs (offreurs ou demandeurs). Enfin, les offreurs qui retirent les gains monétaires les plus élevés sur ces plateformes sont ceux qui ont un niveau de vie confortable et un niveau de confiance élevé, suggérant un renforcement des inégalités.
L86|Regulating the digital economy: Are we moving towards a 'win-win' or a 'lose-lose'?|The digital economy has been growing by leaps and bounds in recent years, mostly as a result of new digital technologies that are promoting a global transformation to industry 4.0. The resulting expansion of digital trade has sparked off a political and policy controversy on digital economy and e-commerce, where its boundaries stand and how best to regulate it. Policy discussions on the topic however do not take into account the true expanse of digital trade, which encompasses hardware, software, networks, platforms, applications and data as its core elements, and stretches the boundaries of e-commerce policy to trade in goods, services and intellectual property protection. This article focuses on the challenges in regulating the digital economy, with a particular focus on development, and offers a discussion of the interdependency between the economic, social, personal and developmental aspects of digital trade for developing countries. Section II opens with a detailed discussion on key digital technologies and their plausible impacts on employment globally and industrial catch-up of particular importance to developing countries, to highlight the divisive nature of digital technologies. Section III then analyses the unfulfilled promise of a pro-development perspective at the WTO looking at how multilateralism has currently failed e-commerce. In this section, the incoherence between digital realities and the policy debates at the WTO are presented to show how the institution might have become a means to legitimise national policies of industrialised countries on a universal level in this important area of policymaking. Norm-setting through FTAs is also analysed at length in section III of the article, which provides a comprehensive review of the plurilateral and bilateral policy developments in e-commerce. The ramifications for developing countries are discussed in the form of a couple of examples. Section IV presents some options for developing countries for the future at the national and international level.
L86|Blockchain: The birth of Decentralized Governance|By allowing networks to split, decentralized blockchain platforms protect members against hold up, but hinder coordination, given that adaptation decisions are ultimately decentralized. The current solutions to improve coordination, based on “premining” cryptocoins, taxing members and incentivizing developers, are insufficient. For blockchain to fulfill its promise and outcompete centralized firms, it needs to develop new forms of “soft” decentralized governance (anarchic, aristocratic, democratic, and autocratic) that allow networks to avoid bad equilibria.
L86|Do Software and Videogames firms share location patterns across cities? Evidence from Barcelona, Lyon and Hamburg| The aim of this paper is to analyse common location patterns of Software and Videogames (SVE) industry in Barcelona, Lyon and Hamburg. This is a key industry in developed countries that mainly located at core of bigger metropolitan areas, looking for agglomeration economies, skilled labour and a wide range of spillover effects existent there. Cities used in our empirical application share some common features in terms of size, manufacturing tradition and, specially, economic strategies, as they have managed to promote high-tech neighbourhoods through ambitious urban renewal policies. When analysing location patterns of firms from these industries, although our results highlight predominant role of urban cores of three cities, also indicate important specificities in terms of core-periphery. distribution of SVEâ€™s firms.

L86|To acquire or not to acquire: Mergers and Acquisitions in the Software Industry| The aim of this paper is to analyse the impact of Mergers and Acquisitions on firm growth for Software firms located in Catalonia. We investigate firms which are targeting, or are themselves the target of an acquisition and we find that the impact on is heterogeneous; there appear to be positive and negative impacts on productivity and sales growth rate. This paper contributes to the understanding of the M&A process in this young industry characterised by an exponential growth and how such activity interacts with the growth and productivity of the firms involved.

L86|Special Interest Groups versus Voters and the Political Economics of Attention|Asymmetric information between voters and legislative representatives poses a major challenge to the functioning of representative democracy. We examine whether representatives are more likely to serve long-term campaign donors instead of constituents during times of low media attention to politics. Combining data on campaign finance donations made by individuals and special interest groups with information on their preferences for particular bills, we construct novel measures of electoral and organized interests pressure that representatives face with regard to specific legislative votes. In our analysis based on 490 roll calls between 2005 and 2014 in the US House of Representatives, we find strong evidence that representatives are more likely to vote with special interests and against constituency interests when the two are in conflict. Importantly, the latter effect is significantly larger when there is less attention on politics. Thereby, we draw on exogenous newsworthy shock events that crowd out news on the legislative process, but are themselves not related to it. The opportunistic behavior seems not to be mediated by short-term scheduling of sensitive votes right after distracting events.
L86|Uncorking Expert Reviews with Social Media: A Case Study Served with Wine|The growth of social media outlets in which individuals post opinions on publicly consumed goods provides an interesting and relatively unexplored area for examination of the role of crowd sourcing amateur opinions in areas traditionally relegated to experts. In this paper we use wine as an illustrative example to investigate the interaction between social media and expert reviews in the market for high end consumer goods. In particular, we exploit a novel data set constructed from the social media website CellarTracker, which is composed of the averaged individual reviews for 355 distinct wines on a quarterly basis from 2004 through 2017, and pair this with a similarly dimensioned panel of average auction prices for these wines as well as the reviews from three leading experts. We develop a signal extraction model to motivate the interaction between amateurs and experts in revealing a measure of the quality of the wine. The model is then used to motivate the adaptation of an empirical panel structural VAR approach based on Pedroni (2013) by embedding the expert reviews as an event analysis within the panel VAR, which is used to decompose information into components that signal the quality of the liquid in the bottle versus other aspects of the wine that are valued by the market. The approach also allows us to decompose the influence of the expert reviews into components associated with what we define as the quality of the wine versus the pure reputation effect of the expert. The results on expert reviews are consistent with the idea that experts can substantially impact prices through channels other than their signals of quality.
L86|The Effect of Big Data on Recommendation Quality: The Example of Internet Search|Are there economies of scale to data in internet search? This paper is first to use real search engine query logs to empirically investigate how data drives the quality of internet search results. We find evidence that the quality of search results improve with more data on previous searches. Moreover, our results indicate that the type of data matters as well: personalized information is particularly valuable as it massively increases the speed of learning. We also provide some evidence that factors not directly related to data such as the general quality of the applied algorithms play an important role. The suggested methods to disentangle the effect of data from other factors driving the quality of search results can be applied to assess the returns to data in various recommendation systems in e-commerce, including product and information search. We also discuss the managerial, privacy, and competition policy implications of our findings.
L86|MobilePay versus Swipp - Main insights from a Nordic country for mobile payment apps|We describe the development of the market for mobile payments in Denmark. In the first step, we explain the two main competing products as well as their underlying technologies. In the second step, we also analyze the competition within the Danish market from debit card companies and the competition which stems from outside of the banking industry (Apple Pay). Based on our analysis, we derive some managerial as well as policy implications.
L86|Technological Development and Software Piracy|In this paper, we analyze the differences in piracy rates from one country to another. Like previous papers on the topic, we find that more developed countries have lower incentives for pirating. Unlike previous papers, we find that the piracy rate is positively correlated with the tax burden rate but negatively correlated with the domestic market size and exports over GDP. We also separate the impacts of education and R&D on piracy, and find two effects with opposite signs. Moreover, we find that those countries with smaller, more efficient bureaucracies are likely to protect intellectual property more effectively. Finally, we show that the spread of access to the Internet is negatively correlated with the software piracy rate.
L86|Analysis of People's Willingness to Use Personalization Services in Times of Disaster|Japan has experienced major earthquake disasters in the past. The Great East Japan Earthquake of March 11, 2011 caused enormous damage. Subsequently, in April 2016, a major tremor centered in Kumamoto Prefecture in Kyushu also occurred. In the event of such a disaster, it is important to ensure that medical services are available and that a lifeline is secured. The use of information and communication technology, or ICT, is essential in implementing such efforts in an efficient manner. For example, ICT is very helpful in searching for evacuation routes, locating evacuation sites, tracking supply shortages, and understanding the situation at medical facilities. The use of ICT for such purposes requires personal information. Users can find their evacuation routes precisely because their locations are confirmed with GPS. People will also be able to locate medical facilities to receive special treatment if they register beforehand their pre-existing conditions. Thus, personal information utilization services are extremely effective in times of disaster. On the other hand, the use of personal information could raise concerns about privacy violations. While the use of personal information may allow for valuable services, privacy could be violated if data are leaked or handled in an inappropriate manner.
L86|Smart Technologies Applied to the Energy Sector. Renewable Energy Expansion Strengthened by Digital Communications and Distributed Ledger Technologies?|The development of variable renewable energy (VRE) and their massive installation are some of the challenges that the economies of a large part of the world will have to face in the coming years to help ensure a reasonable sustainability of the planet. On the other hand, the advances that have been happening in recent decades in the telecommunications sector and the expansion of the Internet have helped to create a new scenario, giving way to growth opportunities in different economic sectors and new business models. One of the most disruptive tools that has emerged in this new digital ecosystem is what is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). The opportunity and applicability to strengthen VRE expansion is discussed in this article. To this end, selected case studies and main findings of interviews with experts are discussed. The introduction of blockchain technology, in particular in its use as a platform for smart contracts, offers a great potential, highly valued by experts, in addition to adding other relevant characteristics such as efficiency generated in operational terms and traceability, but also new opportunities for consumers and prosumers to build strong energy communities committed with a sustainable energy transaction. However, among the elements to be improved, we highlight the regulatory uncertainty regarding smart contracts´ security in terms of automatic mechanisms and its legal endorsement for use within the EU; adopting standards to facilitate scalability; and other issues of a more technological nature that should also be improved for a massive implementation in terms of optimizing energy efficiency of the model.
L86|Crowdsourced Innovation: How Community Managers Affect Crowd Activities|In this study, we investigate whether and to what extent community managers in online collaborative communities can stimulate crowd activities through their engagement. Using a novel data set of 22 large online idea crowdsourcing campaigns, we find that active engagement of community managers positively affects crowd activities in an inverted Ushaped manner. Moreover, we evidence that intellectual stimulation by managers increases community participation, while individual consideration of users has no impact on user activities. Finally, the data reveal that community manager activities that require more effort, such as media file uploads instead of simple written comments, have a larger effect on crowd participation.
L86|Zukunftsfaktor 5G: Eine ökonomische Perspektive|"Der Megatrend Digitalisierung erfasst immer mehr Bereiche von Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft. Laut Bundesministerium für Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur werden beide Bereiche bald vollständig von Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien durchdrungen sein. Doch diese Verbindung der analogen und digitalen Welt wird nur mit Hilfe einer geeigneten Infrastruktur gelingen. Ein Kernbestandteil ist dabei 5G. Darunter wird die ""kommende Mobilfunkgeneration"" verstanden (BMVI, 2017, 2). Doch 5G ist nicht bloß eine Weiterentwicklung von 4G beziehungsweise LTE, dem aktuellen Mobilfunkstandard. 5G führt gegenüber LTE zu einem wesentlich verbesserten mobilen Breitband, ermöglicht eine umfassende Maschine-Maschine-Kommunikation und auch allgemein eine zuverlässige und verzögerungsfreie Kommunikation (Fuest et al., 2018, 20). Des Weiteren geht 5G ebenfalls mit einer hohen Energieeffizienz einher (Andrews et al., 2014) und ermöglicht das sogenannte Network Slicing (Deutsche Telekom, 2018). Network Slicing beschreibt die Eigenschaft, ein Netz in verschiedene Netze aufzusplitten. Diese virtuellen Netze können sogar zu unterschiedlichen Zwecken eingesetzt werden. Zu diesen zählen beispielsweise die Echtzeit-Kommunikation mittels Video-Chat und einer hohen Datenrate oder das Internet der Dinge mittels Sensoren und einer niedrigen Datenrate. Die Aufteilung des Netzes kann zudem schnell variiert werden. (...)"
L86|Der Einfluss sozioökonomischer Faktoren auf die Nutzung des digitalen Zugangs zu Finanzdienstleistungen: Risikopotenzial für eine informationelle Kluft in den Geschäftsgebieten der Sparkassen|Bisherige Studien haben den digitalen Zugang zu Finanzdienstleistungen untersucht und gut versorgte sowie unterversorgte Regionen in Deutschland identifiziert. Das Vorhandensein eines hinreichend guten digitalen Zugangs sagt aber nichts darüber aus, ob dieser auch genutzt wird, um damit Finanzdienstleistungen nachzufragen. Dieses Papier stellt die Kunden in den Mittelpunkt und untersucht, welche sozioökonomischen Faktoren Einfluss auf die Nutzung des digitalen Zugangs für die Nachfrage nach Finanzdienstleistungen haben. Als Ergebnis können auch jene Attribute benannt werden, die eine sogenannte informationelle Kluft befördern. Ein regionaler Vergleich ermöglicht schließlich eine Aussage dazu, in welchen Gebieten (hier Geschäftsgebiete der Sparkassen) Deutschlands die Gefahr einer informationellen Kluft besonders groß ist. Es zeigt sich, dass dieses Risiko in ländlichen, dünn besiedelten Gebieten, mit einem hohen Durchschnittsalter der Bevölkerung und in Regionen mit einem relativ geringen durchschnittlichen Ausbildungsgrad vergleichsweise hoch ist. Hier droht insofern ein besonders hohes Risiko, dass Menschen infolge der voranschreitenden Digitalisierung von Bankdienstleistungen abgehängt werden und den Zugang zu grundlegenden Finanzdienstleistungen als Basis gesellschaftlicher Teilhabe verlieren.
L86|Competition policy reform in Europe and Germany - Institutional change in the light of digitization|The ubiquitous process of digitization changes economic competition on markets in several ways and leads to the emergence of new business models. The increasing roles of digital platforms as well as data-driven markets represent two relevant examples. These developments challenge competition policy, which must consider the special economic characteristics of digital goods and markets. In Germany, national competition law was amended in 2017 in order to accommodate for digitization-driven changes in the economy and plans for further changes are already discussed. We review this institutional change from an economics perspective and argue that most of the reform's elements point into the right direction. However, some upcoming challenges may have been overlooked so far. Furthermore, we discuss whether European competition policy should follow the paragon of the German reform and amend its institutional framework accordingly. We find scope for reform particularly regarding data-driven markets, whereas platform economics appear to be already well-established.
L86|The brave new world of digital personal assistants: Benefits and challenges from an economic perspective|The paper applies economic theories to give an overview of the emerging phenomenon of digital personal assistants (DPAs). A DPA is an intelligent automated system that interacts with the user through a dialogue in natural language, and meanwhile applying third-party services to obtain information and perform various actions. We analyze the benefits of increasing usage of DPAs, such as reduction of transaction costs, enhanced organization efficiency, procompetitive effects, and boosting the e-commerce economy. Besides benefits, however, adopting DPA in life may also contain some risks and downsides, which may reduce the positive welfare effects or even lead to decreasing welfare: biased services, market power on the DPA market and economic dependence on a dominant DPA, potential leveraging of DPA suppliers' market power into neighboring markets, personalized data (ab)use and privacy, media bias and manipulation of public opinion.

L86|Does the internet increase the job finding rate? Evidence from a period of internet expansion|We examine the impact of household access to the internet on job finding rates in Germany during a period (2006_2009) in which internet access increased rapidly, and job-seekers in-creased their use of the internet as a search tool. During this period, household access to the internet was almost completely dependent on connection to a particular technology (DSL). We therefore exploit the variation in connection rates across municipalities as an instrument for household access to the internet. OLS estimates which control for differences in individual and local area characteristics suggest a job-finding advantage of about five percentage points. The IV estimates are substantially larger, but much less precisely estimated. However, we cannot reject the hypothesis that, conditional on observables, residential computer access with internt was as good as randomly assigned with respect to the job-finding rate. The hypothesis that residential computer access with internet helped job-seekers find work because of its affect on the job search process is supported by the finding that residential internet access greatly increased the use of the internet as a search method. We find some evidence that computer access reduced the use of traditional job search methods, but this effect is outweighed by the increase in internet-based search methods.
L86|"Beyond ""dependent development"" in a high-tech industry? The interplay between domestic institutions and transnational sectoral governance in the trajectories of emerging Polish IT firms"|The present study investigates the relatively successful development of the homegrown IT industry in Poland since the early 1990s. The case is theoretically interesting because it runs counter to the dominant perspective on the economic systems in postcommunist Central Europe, which emphasizes the region's dependency on foreign direct investment (FDI) for industrial development. The empirical analysis focuses on the industry's two key players, Asseco and Comarch, which are among Europe's largest enterprise IT (EIT) vendors. It uses rich historical data to reconstruct the firms' strategies regarding sales market operations, corporate finance, and productive organization. The study's main theoretical interest is to explore how the firms' successful development has been shaped by the interplay between home-country institutions and the governance structure of the transnational EIT industry. The analysis indicates, first, that the firms have benefited from a well-functioning local capital market, the domestic supply of high-skilled labor, and some characteristics of the home country sales market. Second, the study reveals that the firms' development has been conditioned by the ongoing modularization processes in the EIT sector. In their initially home market oriented operations, the analyzed firms focused on the downstream segments of the EIT value chain while sourcing the more high-tech components (e.g. databases) from collaborations with foreign suppliers. In general, the findings contribute to the discussions on catching-up processes in emerging countries, first, by demonstrating the developmental potential related to modularization processes in high-tech industries, and second, by drawing attention to how the globally fragmented production regimes intersect with country-specific institutional frameworks.
L86|"""Brain gain"" on Wikipedia: Immigrants return knowledge home"|Economic literature acknowledges the impact of immigration on cross-border patenting and scientific publications. However, the role of immigration ows in the dissemination of knowledge in a broader sense is yet to be assessed. In this paper, I estimate the effect of immigration on the facilitation of online knowledge reagrding destination countries in the native languages of immigrants. To quantify online knowledge, I focus on one of the world's most viewed online knowledge platforms, Wikipedia. I combine data on immigration ows between the pairs of immigrants' origin and destination countries with contributions to Wikipedia describing the countries of immigrants' destinations in the languages spoken in immigrants' origin countries. I specifically focus on knowledge domains describing science and culture. In order to draw a causal inference, I use shocks to immigration due to economic and political crises as exogenous shocks to Wikipedia content and analyze subsequent changes in the contributions to Wikipedia. An increase in immigration yields more knowledge contributed to Wikipedia about science and culture in destination countries in the native languages of the origin countries. Interestingly, the increase in contributions is driven by anonymous contributors. In the Wikipedia community, these are considered occasional contributors who care personally about the topics they contribute to. The increase in content generated anonymously is driven by longer contributions.
L86|Inside the Engine Room of Digital Platforms: Reviews, Ratings, and Recommendations|The rise and success of digital platforms (such as Airbnb, Amazon, Booking, Expedia, Ebay, and Uber) rely, to a large extent, on their ability to address two major issues. First, to effectively facilitate transactions, platforms need to resolve the problem of trust in the implicit or explicit promises made by the counterparties; they post reviews and ratings to pursue this objective. Second, as platforms operate in marketplaces where information is abundant, they may guide their users towards the transactions that these users may have an interest in; recommender systems are meant to play this role. In this article, we elaborate on review, rating, and recommender systems. In particular, we examine how these systems generate network effects on platforms.
L86|Managing competition on a two‐sided platform|On many two‐sided platforms, users on one side not only care about user participation and usage levels on the other side, but they also care about participation and usage of fellow users on the same side. Most prominent is the degree of seller competition on a platform catering to buyers and sellers. In this paper, we address how seller competition affects platform pricing, product variety, and the number of platforms that carry trade.

For blockchain to fulfill its promise and outcompete centralized firms, it needs to develop new forms of “soft” decentralized governance (anarchic, aristocratic, democratic, and autocratic) that allow networks to avoid bad equilibria.
L86|Platform competition : who benefits from multihoming?|Competition between two-sided platforms is shaped by the possibility of multihoming. If users on both sides singlehome, each platform provides users on either side exclusive access to its users on the other side. In contrast, if users on one side can multihome, platforms exert monopoly power on that side and compete on the singlehoming side. This paper explores the allocative effects of such a change from single- to multihoming. Our results challenge the conventional wisdom, according to which the possibility of multihoming hurts the side that can multihome, while benefiting the other side. This is not always true: the opposite may happen or both sides may benefit.
L86|Linear voting rules|How should a society choose between two social alternatives if participation in the decision process is voluntary and costly and monetary transfers are not feasible? Considering symmetric voters with private valuations, we show that it is utilitarian-optimal to use a linear voting rule: votes get alternativedependent weights, and a default obtains if the weighted sum of votes stays below some threshold. Standard quorum rules are not optimal. We develop a perturbation method to characterize equilibria in the case of small participation costs and show that leaving participation voluntary increases welfare for linear rules that are optimal under compulsory participation.

L86|Consumer Search with and without Tracking|In this paper, I develop a tractable framework with sequential consumer search to address the effect of tracking on market outcomes. Tracking search histories is informative about consumersâ€™ valuations because different consumer types have different stopping probabilities. With tracking, the unique equilibrium price path is increasing whereas without tracking, an average uniform price prevails. Welfare effects largely depend on how tracking affects consumersâ€™ search persistence. For intermediate search costs, tracking based price discrimination exacerbates the holdup problem and leads to inefficiently low search persistence. For high search costs instead, tracking prevents a market breakdown as low prices conditional on short search histories secure consumers a positive surplus from search. Tracking prevails endogenously when consumers can dynamically opt out from tracking. This holds since disclosing their search history is always individually rational for consumers, irrespective of the overall effect on consumer surplus.
L86|A fresh look at zero-rating|We provide an economic assessment of zero-rating offers in the context of mobile internet access services and draw six lessons: (1) Zero-rating can have several different characteristics that crucially affect their economic and welfare assessment. Thus, regulatory interventions must be based on a careful case-by-case analysis. (2) In the context of zero-rating offers, it is often crucial to evaluate the extent to which users are able to activate and deactivate a (throttled) zero-rated tariff option. If activation/deactivation is easy and instantaneous, a sound economic theory of harm for consumers will in many cases be hard to establish. (3) Similarly, if access to zero-rated partner programs is non-discriminatory and entails low barriers to entry, a sound theory of harm for content providers will usually not be given. (4) Zero-rating can be beneficial for consumers and (legal) content providers alike by contributing to a reduction of illegal content. Combined with throttling it can mitigate congestion problems. However, by requiring all content belonging to the same content category to be treated equally with respect to throttling, independent of whether a content provider opted for zero-rating or not, the existing regulation creates a negative externality on those content providers that do not wish to be zero-rated for some reason. (5) Particular attention should be paid to the impact of throttled zero-rating tariffs on the competition between mobile network operators (MNOs) and MVNOs. The latter may not be able to compete on equal footing with MNOs, because they benefit less from the traffic management aspects of zero-rating. (6) Competition among (infrastructure-based) ISPs provides a safeguard against severe rent extraction and, thus, an abuse of throttling and zero-rating as an exploitative device. Therefore, regulators should carefully account for the competitive environment and the existing tariff portfolio and options before deciding to intervene. Competition policy, rather than ex-ante regulation, may be more suitable for this task.
L86|IKT-Sektor in China und Wirtschaftsbeziehungen zu Deutschland|Der Vorstoß chinesischer Unternehmen im Bereich der Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologie (IKT) in Deutschland und der EU ist geprägt von einer starken Stellung chinesischer IKT-Unternehmen in Teilbereichen des Sektors, insbesondere der IKT-Produktion und einem Teilbereich innovativer digitaler Dienstleistungen. Chinas Rolle im IKT-Export bei IKT-Gütern und bei IKTDienstleistungen nimmt längerfristig zu. Der große chinesische Heimatmarkt, eine starke IKT-Forschung, zunehmende staatliche Forschungsförderung und auch die Präsenz leistungsstarker westlicher Firmen (z.B. IBM, Microsoft und SAP) und japanischer sowie koreanischer Tochterunternehmen in China tragen zu digitalen bzw. internetbasierten Innovations- und Wissensdynamik bei; zudem auch das langfristig hohe Wirtschaftswachstum in China. Schließlich bedeutet das strategische Interesse Chinas an der Entwicklung von Industrie 4.0, dass chinesische IKT-Firmen in fortgeschrittenen digitalen Märkten der EU zunehmend aktiv sind und auch über chinesische Tochterfirmen Zugang zur Markt- und Technologiedynamik in Deutschland und anderen EU-Ländern suchen. Es gibt ein strategisches Interesse Chinas, auch stark in IKT-intensiv produzierenden Sektoren – also auf der Anwenderseite – zu investieren, wobei Deutschland hier als Standort bzw. Zielland von besonderem Interesse ist. Summary: The advantage of Chinese firms in the area of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Germany and the EU is characterized by the strong position of Chinese firms in certain ICT sub-sectors, particularly in the fields of ICT-production and of innovative digital services. China’s role in terms of the export of ICT goods and ICT services is increasing over time. The large Chinese domestic market, strong ICT-related research and development, increasing state support measures for research, and the presence of more efficient western firms (e.g. IBM, Microsoft and SAP) as well as Japanese and Korean subsidiaries in China contribute to the digital and Internet-based innovation and growth dynamics; and the long-term high economic growth rates China has experienced. Ultimately, the strategic interest of China will be to develop its own Industry 4.0, to ensure that Chinese ICT firms are increasingly active in digitally advanced markets, and to seek further access to benefit from the market and technology dynamics in Germany and other EU countries. There is also a strategic interest on the part of China to invest strongly in those productive sectors which are ICT-intensive in terms of usage, whereby here Germany could be an attractive location and destination country for investment.
L86|Was Obama Elected by the Internet? Broadband Diffusion and Voters' Behavior in US Presidential Elections|What are the political consequences of the diffusion of broadband internet? We address this question by studying the 2008 US presidential election, the first political campaign where the internet played a key role. Drawing on data from the FEC and the FCC, we provide robust evidence that internet penetration in US counties is associated with an increase in turnout, an increase in campaign contributions to the Democrats and an increase in the share of Democratic vote. We then propose an IV strategy to deal with potential endogeneity concerns: we exploit geographic discontinuities along state borders with different right-of-way laws, which constitute the main determinant of the cost of building new infrastructure. IV estimates confirm a positive impact of broadband diffusion on turnout, while the pro-Democratic Party effect of the internet appears to be less robust.
L86|Communications Technology and Terrorism|By facilitating the flow of information in society, communications technology (CT; e.g., newspapers, radio, television, the internet) can help terrorists to (i) spread their message, (ii) recruit followers, and (iii) coordinate among group members. However, CT also facilitates monitoring and arresting terrorists. This paper formulates the hypothesis that a society’s level of CT is systematically related to terrorism. We introduce a simple theoretical framework, suggesting that terrorism first becomes more attractive with a rise in CT, but then decreases, following an inverted U-shape. Accessing data for 199 countries from 1970-2014, we find evidence for these predictions: Terrorism peaks at intermediate ranges of CT and corresponding magnitudes are sizeable. Our estimations control for a range of potentially confounding factors, as well as country- and year-fixed effects. Results are consistent throughout a battery of robustness checks and placebo regressions. Finally, we find no evidence of a potential reporting bias explaining our findings.
L86|Crowdsourced innovation: How community managers affect crowd activities|In this study, we investigate whether and to what extent community managers in online collaborative communities can stimulate crowd activities through their engagement. Using a novel data set of 22 large online idea crowdsourcing campaigns, we find that active engagement of community managers positively affects crowd activities in an inverted U-shaped manner. Moreover, we evidence that intellectual stimulation by managers increases community participation, while individual consideration of users has no impact on user activities. Finally, the data reveal that community manager activities that require more effort, such as media file uploads instead of simple written comments, have a larger effect on crowd participation.
L86|The wider impacts of high-technology employment: Evidence from U.S. cities|Innovative, high-technology industries are commonly described as drivers of regional development. ‘Tech’ workers earn high wages, but they are also said to generate knock-on effects throughout the local economies that host them, spurring growth in jobs and wages in nontradable activities. At the same time, in iconic high-tech agglomerations like the San Francisco Bay Area, the home of Silicon Valley, the success of the tech industry creates tensions, in part as living costs rise beyond the reach of many non-tech workers. Across a large sample of U.S. cities, this paper explores these issues systematically. Combining annual data on wages, employment and prices from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Consumer Price Index, it estimates how growth in tradable tech employment affects the real, living-cost deflated wages of local workers in nontradable sectors. Results indicate that high-technology employment has significant, positive, but modest effects on the real wages of workers in nontradable sectors. These effects appear to be spread consistently across different kinds of nontradable activities. In terms of substantive wider impacts, tech appears benign, though fairly ineffectual.
L86|The Blockchain Folk Theorem|Blockchains are distributed ledgers, operated within peer-to-peer networks. We model the proof-of-work blockchain protocol as a stochastic game and analyze the equilibrium strategies of rational, strategic miners. Mining the longest chain is a Markov perfect equilibrium, without forking, in line with Nakamoto (2008). The blockchain protocol, however, is a coordination game, with multiple equilibria. There exist equilibria with forks, leading to orphaned blocks and persistent divergence between chains. We also show how forks can be generated by information delays and software upgrades. Last we identify negative externalities implying that equilibrium investment in computing capacity is excessive.Received May 31, 2017; editorial decision July 6, 2018 by Editor Itay Goldstein.
L86|Coopération, dépendance et éviction - Quelle appréhension concurrentielle des liens inter-entreprises dans les écosystèmes de téléphonie mobile ?|This contribution aims at analysing the potential effects of competition law based decisions in the mobile operating systems domain, considering their two-sided structure. Based on the notion of complementary investments, it proposes to investigate the relationships between the pivotal player and its partners. After establishing the economic and technical grounds underlying their contractual relationships, we assess them under the length of competition laws requirements. We show that, despite the gains that can result from these relationships, their asymmetrical nature may induce abuses of dominance or anticompetitive takeovers. However, we stress that competition law based remedies may be poorly efficient to address these issues. View the English version of this paper Cette contribution porte sur les effets des décisions concurrentielles dans le domaine des systèmes d’exploitation mobiles en regard de leur structure de plateforme biface. S’appuyant sur la notion d’investissement complémentaire, elle se propose d’analyser les relations entre la firme pivot de chaque système et ses partenaires. Il s’agit d’évaluer en termes concurrentiels les dispositifs techniques et financiers qui les lient. Au-delà de cette question liée à l’évaluation de leur effet net sur la concurrence, il s’agit également de s’interroger sur les possibles abus d’exploitation et d’éviction qui peuvent résulter de telles relations complémentaires mais asymétriques. Cette contribution discute enfin les possibles effets de remèdes concurrentiels portant sur ces relations.
L86|La dinámica del internet móvil en Colombia, su regulación y la calidad del servicio|En la actualidad, las Tecnologías de la Información y la Comunicación (TIC) son esenciales para el desarrollo de los países y la calidad de vida de las personas; su uso es, cada vez, más masivo y la familiarización con estas crece constantemente. En este sentido, el objetivo principal de este documento es determinar la dinámica de los servicios de internet móvil en Colombia como parte fundamental de las TIC, su penetración, calidad y el costo del servicio respecto a los ingresos totales de los grupos familiares. Así también, se analizan las cifras de uso, cobertura y calidad del internet móvil; y se estudian las resoluciones de la Comisión de Regulación de las Comunicaciones (CRC) y su aplicabilidad con el fin de determinar cuáles prácticas permiten la mejora continua en la prestación, calidad, acceso, tecnología y tarifas para el consumidor.
L86|The effect of big data on recommendation quality: The example of internet search|Are there economies of scale to data in internet search? This paper is first to use real search engine query logs to empirically investigate how data drives the quality of internet search results. We find evidence that the quality of search results improve with more data on previous searches. Moreover, our results indicate that the type of data matters as well: personalized information is particularly valuable as it massively increases the speed of learning. We also provide some evidence that factors not directly related to data such as the general quality of the applied algorithms play an important role. The suggested methods to disentangle the effect of data from other factors driving the quality of search results can be applied to assess the returns to data in various recommendation systems in e-commerce, including product and information search. We also discuss the managerial, privacy, and competition policy implications of our findings.
L86|Tokenomics: Dynamic Adoption and Valuation|We provide a dynamic asset-pricing model of (crypto-)tokens on (blockchain-based) platforms, and highlight their roles on endogenous user adoption. Tokens intermediate transactions on decentralized networks, and their trading creates an inter-temporal complementarity among users, generating a feedback loop between token valuation and platform adoption. Consequently, tokens capitalize future platform growth, accelerate adoption, and reduce user-base volatility. Equilibrium token price increases non-linearly in platform productivity, user heterogeneity, and endogenous network size. The model also produces explosive growth of user base after an initial period of dormant adoption, accompanied by a run-up of token price volatility. We further discuss how our framework can be used to discuss cryptocurrency supply, token competition, and pricing assets under network externality.
L86|Incentives Can Reduce Bias in Online Reviews|Online reviews are a powerful means of propagating the reputations of products, services, and even employers. However, existing research suggests that online reviews often suffer from selection bias—people with extreme opinions are more motivated to share them than people with moderate opinions, resulting in biased distributions of reviews. Providing incentives for reviewing has the potential to reduce this selection bias, because incentives can mitigate the motivational deficit of people who hold moderate opinions. Using data from one of the leading employer review companies, Glassdoor, we show that voluntary reviews have a different distribution from incentivized reviews. The likely bias in the distribution of voluntary reviews can affect workers’ choice of employers, because it changes the ranking of industries by average employee satisfaction. Because observational data from Glassdoor are not able to provide a measure of the true distribution of employer reviews, we complement our investigation with a randomized controlled experiment on MTurk. We find that when participants’ decision to review their employer is voluntary, the resulting distribution of reviews differs from the distribution of forced reviews. Moreover, providing relatively high monetary rewards or a pro-social cue as incentives for reviewing reduces this bias. We conclude that while voluntary employer reviews often suffer from selection bias, incentives can significantly reduce bias and help workers make more informed employer choices.
L86|Successful Crowdfunding Campaigns: The Role of Project Specifics, Competition and Founders’ Experience|We focus on reward-based crowdfunding and identify the basic determinants of successful crowdfunding campaigns including new determinants not analyzed in previous studies. Using a rich database of Kickstarter projects launched during the period from April 2009 to April 2017, we employ an empirical logit model to test the causalities and statistical significance of the selected factors. Our new empirical findings suggest that launching a project campaign during the weekend and during the month with the stronger competition in the form of other launched projects decreases the success rate of the campaign. On the other hand, a longer preparation period on Kickstarter and a higher projects’ density in the given state can increase the chances to succeed. We also conclude that the competition plays the most prominent role in the category of the smallest projects. Conversely, a negative effect of projects launched at weekends and a positive effect of a founder‘s experience is the strongest in the group of the largest projects.
L86|Can Reputation Discipline the Gig Economy? Experimental Evidence from an Online Labor Market|In two experiments, we examine the effects of employer reputation in an online labor market (Amazon Mechanical Turk) in which employers may decline to pay workers while keeping their work product. First, in an audit study of employers by a blinded worker, we find that working only for good employers yields 40% higher wages. Second, in an experiment that varied reputation, we find that good-reputation employers attract work of the same quality but at twice the rate as bad-reputation employers. This is the first clean, field evidence on the value of employer reputation. It can serve as collateral against opportunism in the absence of contract enforcement.
L86|The multistakeholder model of Internet governance, ICANN, and business stakeholders - practices of hegemonic power|This research examines the relationship between the Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and three groups of business stakeholders who participate in the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. The authors argue that ICANN’s use of ‘participatory evangelism’ serves as a device for the production of hegemonic power within the Internet governance model. By performing textual linguistic analysis on archival transcripts of triannual meetings from 2012 until 2016, the study operationalises hegemony as a dependent variable by linking stakeholder participation to the Internet governance policy-making agenda. By first identifying a ‘master variable’ that characterises the most general understanding of the data, statistical methods were used to construct a model with hegemony as a response variable. Furthermore, Analysis of Variance and Panel Data models were applied to measure variation in tone across the three groups of business stakeholders to understand how hegemony is produced. Our findings show that by using language that expresses hesitation and uncertainty, but at the same time is resolute with less complex discourses, the business sector stakeholders contribute to the production of hegemony that would theoretically benefit ICANN. This research underscores the importance of language and discourse as a driver of power within the Internet Governance.
L86|Airbnb, Blablacar, Le Bon Coin ... Pourquoi et comment utilise-t-on les plateformes de consommation collaborative ?|Le succès de Airbnb, Blablacar ou Le Bon Coin témoigne de l’engouement des français pour les plateformes de consommation collaborative. Les récents travaux sur l’économie collaborative et l’économie du partage ont montré la diversité des motivations des utilisateurs : économiques, environnementales, idéologiques. Dans cet article nous cherchons à expliquer les déterminants des usages des plateformes de consommation collaborative, ainsi que des gains monétaires obtenus sur ces plateformes. En exploitant une enquête sur 2000 français âgés de plus de 18 ans, nous trouvons que les individus ayant des utilisateurs de plateformes dans leur entourage, un niveau de vie confortable, un niveau d’éducation élevé, et un niveau de confiance fort envers les autres, sont plus enclins à utiliser des plateformes collaboratives, et ont un usage plus diversifié de ces plateformes. Les effets varient selon le type de plateforme considéré et à l’intérieur de chaque type de plateforme, selon le rôle des utilisateurs (offreurs ou demandeurs). Enfin, les offreurs qui retirent les gains monétaires les plus élevés sur ces plateformes sont ceux qui ont un niveau de vie confortable et un niveau de confiance élevé, suggérant un renforcement des inégalités.
L86|Inside the engine room of digital platforms: Reviews, ratings, and recommendations|The rise and success of digital platforms (such as Airbnb, Amazon, Booking, Expedia, Ebay, and Uber) rely, to a large extent, on their ability to address two major issues. First, to effectively facilitate transactions, platforms need to resolve the problem of trust in the implicit or explicit promises made by the counterparties; they post reviews and ratings to pursue this objective. Second, as platforms operate in marketplaces where information is abundant, they may guide their users towards the transactions that these users may have an interest in; recommender systems are meant to play this role. In this article, we elaborate on review, rating, and recommender systems. In particular, we examine how these systems generate network effects on platforms.
L86|Trust and Disintermediation: Evidence from an Online Freelance Marketplace|As an intermediary improves trust between two sides of its market to facilitate matching and transactions, it faces an increased risk of disintermediation: with sufficient trust, the two sides may circumvent the intermediary to avoid the intermediary's fees. We investigate the relationship between increased trust and disintermediation by leveraging a randomized control trial on a major online freelance marketplace. Our results show that enhanced trust increases the chance for high-quality freelancers to be hired. When the trust level is sufficiently high, however, it also increases disintermediation, which offsets the revenue gains from the increase in the hiring of high-quality freelancers. We also identify heterogeneity across clients and freelancers in their tendencies to disintermediate.
L86|Platform Competition: Betfair and the U.K. Market for Sports Betting|We examine two episodes of strategic interaction in the U.K. betting industry: (i) Betfair (an entrant multi-sided platform, or MSP) vs. Flutter (also an MSP), and (ii) Betfair vs. traditional bookmakers. We find that although Betfair was an underfunded second mover in the betting exchange space, it was able to attract punters at a much faster rate than the better-funded first mover, Flutter. Moreover, while Betfair and traditional bookmakers competed aggressively for market share, they also developed a highly complementary relationship that favored all parties. We discuss implications for research in the economics and management of MSPs. Specifically, we argue that the literature would benefit from work that endogenizes platform design and that considers the possible competitive and cooperative interactions between the business models of traditional incumbents and those of potential innovative MSP entrants.
L86|The Virtual is Reality! On Physical and Virtual Space in Software Firms’ Knowledge Formation|To understand how knowledge is created, it is necessary to unwrap the role played by the physical and virtual spaces in knowledge exchange and formation. The extant research offers interesting findings when it comes to the relationships among regional institutional and organizational characteristics, innovation, and firms’ abilities to link up to global knowledge sources. A focus on the role of informal and low-cost mechanisms, both regional and global, has extended our understanding of their role in knowledge formation. However, the physical space has dominated the discussion in the literature on sources of knowledge formation, while the virtual space has seldom been addressed. The inclusion of the virtual space, both as an interaction space and as a different and complementary dimension, makes it possible to gain new insights into knowledge formation in a digitalizing world. Based on in-depth interviews with small and medium-sized software companies in two urban agglomerations in Norway and Sweden, this paper explores the use of physical and virtual spaces. The findings show that these spaces interact and mutually influence each other. The world is not ‘flattening’ due to ongoing digitalization. Rather, urban agglomerations are still important places in which these spaces are optimized and unified.
L86|Personal And Social Proximity: Shaping Leadership In A Free Software Project|Open software projects are usually portrayed by focusing on charismatic leaders, friendly communities, and meritocratic language. We dig under the surface of this stereotypical picture and analyse the social relationships of the people involved; specifically, whether they are related through personal proximity or they are distant social partners. We contribute to the literature on free/open source innovation in three ways. First, we highlight the continuum of roles played by individual leaders in the open source project, as brokers and/or initiators. Second, we delve deeper in the social networks of the Videolan software community to layout where and how leaders are organised in groups and play the role of brokers and initiators. We study leadership emergence over time by taking into account the context of activities. Finally, we produce a typology of three Videolan communities with specific social networks that evolved over time in terms of leaders and social structure
L86|Does the internet increase the job finding rate? Evidence from a period of internet expansion|We examine the impact of household access to the internet on job finding rates in Germany during a period (2006-2009) in which internet access increased rapidly, and job-seekers increased their use of the internet as a search tool. During this period, household access to the internet was almost completely dependent on connection to a particular technology (DSL). We therefore exploit the variation in connection rates across municipalities as an instrument for household access to the internet. OLS estimates which control for differences in individual and local area characteristics suggest a job-finding advantage of about five percentage points. The IV estimates are substantially larger, but much less precisely estimated. However, we cannot reject the hypothesis that, conditional on observables, residential computer access with internet was as good as randomly assigned with respect to the job-finding rate. The hypothesis that residential internet access helped job-seekers find work because of its effect on the job search process is supported by the finding that residential internet access greatly increased the use of the internet as a search method. We find some evidence that household access to the internet reduced the use of traditional job search methods, but this effect is outweighed by the increase in internet-based search methods.
L86|Special Interest Groups Versus Voters and the Political Economics of Attention|Asymmetric information between voters and legislative representatives poses a major challenge to the functioning of representative democracy. We examine whether representatives are more likely to serve long-term campaign donors instead of constituents during times of low media attention to politics. Combining data on campaign finance donations made by individuals and special interest groups with information on their preferences for particular bills, we construct novel measures of electoral and organized interests pressure that representatives face with regard to specific legislative votes. In our analysis based on 490 roll calls between 2005 and 2014 in the US House of Representatives, we find strong evidence that representatives are more likely to vote with special interests and against constituency interests when the two are in conflict. Importantly, the latter effect is significantly larger when there is less attention on politics. Thereby, we draw on exogenous newsworthy shock events that crowd out news on the legislative process, but are themselves not related to it. The opportunistic behavior seems not to be mediated by short-term scheduling of sensitive votes right after distracting events.

L86|Spatial Persistence of Agglomeration in Software Publishing|We estimate the effects of industrial localization on the spatial persistence of employment in the software industry, using micro-data from Texas for the 2000-2006 period. Locations with an initial concentration of software employment retain an excess number of employees, beyond that expected from job turnover and job persistence at the establishment level. This is not driven by differential establishment growth or survival, but it is due to (a) the retention by establishments in a location of jobs lost by other establishments in that location, and (b) the propensity of software establishments to enter in locations with prior software establishment presence. These findings are more consistent with labor channel effects than with human capital spillovers.
L86|Data Governance in Connected Cars: The Problem of Access to In-vehicle Data|Through the application of the technological solution of the “extended vehicle” concept the car manufacturers can capture exclusive control of the data of connected cars leading to serious concerns about negative effects on competition, innovation and consumer choice on the markets for aftermarket and other complementary services in the ecosystem of connected and automated driving. Therefore a controversial policy discussion has emerged in the EU about access to in-vehicle data and the connected car for independent service providers in the automotive industry. This paper claims that this problem should be seen as part of the general question of the optimal governance of data in the ecosystem of connected and automated mobility. The paper offers an overview about this policy discussion and analyzes this problem from an economic perspective by using a market failure analysis. Besides competition problems (esp. on markets for aftermarket and other services in the connected car) also market failures in regard to technological choice (extended vehicle vs. interoperable on-board application platform) and information and privacy problems (“notice and consent” solutions) can emerge, leading to the question of appropriate regulatory solutions. The paper discusses solutions through data portability, data rights, competition law, and recommends a sector-specific regulatory approach.
L86|WEB 2.0 technologies in companies: attitudes of B&H managers|Objective of the study was to investigate what managers think about the impact of Web 2.0 technologies on business operations. The empirical research was conducted among top and middle managers in companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina during May and June 2015. The results show that, although all respondents do not use these technologies, they have a relatively positive opinion on the application of Web 2.0 technologies in business. According to their opinion, Web 2.0 technologies make the most important contribution to data and information sharing in company and have a significant impact on the quality of communication, both internal and external.These results encourage further research on the application of Web 2.0 technologies in business and the use of all the advantages and benefits they can provide to someone actively using them.
L86|An Assessment of the First Round Impact of Innovation Industries on Europe’s Regional Economies|This paper attempts to give an economic perspective of the impact of the innovation industries. The estimation method used is that of panel data modelling, based on data from regions from European countries, including countries from Central and Eastern Europe, for which exploratory analysis was conducted on the effects of employment counts, number of companies, and wages per capita, in computer and related activities and research and development industries. Higher employment in both industries have positive effects on total employment and GDP/Capita. No sizable displaced workers effects can be seen, as higher employment and wages/capita in innovation industries are accompanied by higher employment and lower unemployment at regional level. Positive effects can be observed for both young and mature workers, and are stronger for the latter, pointing out to strong potential spillover effects. Number of local companies is not a relevant indicator for assessing the influence of research and development activities. All these effects point to the sustainability of innovation industries, which not only lead to increase of GDP per capita, but also show positive spillover effects, increase employment and reduce unemployment. The results for countries from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) have been to some extent less significant, due to several objective factors. The results should also be viewed in the framework of the transition and catch-up period that characterizes the evolution of the CEE economies. The positive effects of strong growth are primarily reflected in GDP growth, and it may be that it takes a while for these effects to propagate in the rest of the economy in terms of job creation and sizable reduction of unemployment. While the current analysis revealed some of the first-round impacts of the innovation industries, much work remains to be done in matching these effects with other determinants of employment and unemployment, which can improve existing models with relevant empirical elements.
L86|Study on the Development of Quality Measurements Models for Steering Business Services in Relation to Customer Satisfaction|The growing competition in the market, higher customer demands and globalisation forces the business service providers to improve their services much faster. Nowadays, it is not enough to provide good quality it is more important to delight the customers and to deliver more than they expect. Likewise, renowned research companies predicted that customer satisfaction will become the competitive differentiator within the next years. Thus, the main reasons of the present study are at first, establishing a common understanding on the term “quality” and presenting the relationship between customer satisfaction and service quality. Secondly, the study summarizes the identified factors, which mostly influence the customer satisfaction, as well as the common methods used to measure service quality in relation to these factors. Thirdly, the authors introduce and explain the newly developed six step model for establishing an effective measurement method for service quality and the proposed three level service quality model with the related measurements and outcomes. Both models will assist business service providers to protect and improve their service quality and with that their customer satisfaction. The methodology used for this research is a systematic literature review focused on subjects of quality, customer satisfaction and best-practice metrics for service quality. In addition, surveys and studies from well-known research companies were evaluated. The outcome of the study is always focused on the business service area.
L86|Price Discrimination and Dispersion under Asymmetric Profiling of Consumers|Two duopolists compete in price on the market for a homogeneous product. They can use a 'profiling technology' that allows them to identify the willingness-to-pay of their consumers with some probability. If both firms have profiling technologies of the exact same precision, or if one firm cannot use any profiling technology, then the Bertrand paradox continues to prevail. Yet, if firms have technologies of different precisions, then the price equilibrium exhibits both price discrimination and price dispersion, with positive expected profits. Increasing the precision of both firms' technologies does not necessarily harm consumers.
L86|Online Banking Acceptance: The Influence of Perceived System Security on Perceived System Quality|Increasing popularity of online banking systems instead of traditional branch networking requires understanding customer behaviors as users of such systems. This research aims to investigate online banking acceptance among Bosnian university students by considering system, user, acceptance and performance related factors by considering a new relationship between perceived system security and perceived system quality. According to the results, the users perceive that (1) online banking system is not secure and poorly qualified but useful and easy to use; (2) the users themselves are slightly capable of using the system; (3) they have intention to use the system but don’t use the system; and (4) they are slightly satisfied with the system and increase their benefits. The results also provide that all hypotheses except the relationship between perceived ease of use and intention to use are supported. Perceived System Security, as a new dimension, is found to have positive effect on Perceived System Quality. It can be implied that if the system is qualified and the users are self-efficient about using the system, they perceive the system as easy to use and useful. It is suggested that banks better take necessary steps to persuade their customers about the system security and usefulness in completing their tasks.
L86|Accountants and the Cloud – Involving the Professionals|As the cloud-based technologies gain more customers each day, the need for understanding the “economics of cloud” arises, together with the need for strategic measurement of different cloud or non-cloud-based infrastructure options. In such context, the option for the cloud technologies cannot be the duty of the IT department only, as the economic drivers are at least as important as the technological ones. Economic measurement of the future cloud computing implementations is required for at least two reasons. First, all types of implementations are investment projects and, by consequence, need to be fully justified before being chosen or rejected. Second, once a cloud strategy is adopted and an infrastructure is implemented, the implementation must be continually monitored, so the organization can be sure that it continues to deliver an optimal return on investment. Gaining maximal return on the implementation of a cloud computing strategy is predicated on the ability to understand the economic metrics. Therefore, the accounting professional can no longer be a simple observer in the process of cloud migration and cloud adoption, but a central piece and a “voice of reason” standing between the typical enthusiasm of the IT department and the typical skepticism of the management.

L86|Privacy and Platform Competition|We analyze platform competition where user data is collected to improve adtargeting. Considering that users incur privacy costs, we show that the equilibrium level of data provision is distorted and can be inefficiently high or low: if overall competition is weak or if targeting benefits are low, too much private data is collected, and vice-versa. Further, we find that softer competition on either market side leads to more data collection, which implies substitutability between competition policy effects on both market sides. Moreover, if platforms engage in two-sided pricing, data provision would be efficient.
L86|Opinion dynamics via search engines (and other algorithmic gatekeepers)|Ranking algorithms are the information gatekeepers of the Internet era. We develop a stylized framework to study the effects of ranking algorithms on opinion dynamics. We consider rankings that depend on popularity and on personalization. We find that popularity driven rankings can enhance asymptotic learning while personalized ones can both inhibit or enhance it, depending on whether individuals have common or private value preferences. We also find that ranking algorithms can contribute towards the diffusion of misinformation (e.g., “fake news”), since lower ex-ante accuracy of content of minority websites can actually increase their overall traffic share.
L86|The Political Impact of the Internet on US Presidential Elections|What are the political consequences of the diffusion of broadband internet? We address this question by studying the 2008 US presidential election, the first political campaign where the internet played a key role. Drawing on data from the FEC and the FCC, we provide robust evidence that internet penetration in US counties is associated with an increase in turnout, an increase in campaign contributions to the Democrats and an increase in the share of Democratic vote. We then propose an IV strategy to deal with potential endogeneity concerns: we exploit geographic discontinuities along state borders with different right-of-way laws, which constitute the main determinant of the cost of building new infrastructure. IV estimates confirm a positive impact of broadband diffusion on turnout, while the pro-Democratic Party effect of the internet appears to be less robust.
L86|The Production of Information in an Online World: Is Copy Right?|This paper documents the extent of copying and estimates the returns to originality in online news production. We build a unique dataset combining all the online content produced by the universe of news media (newspaper, television, radio, pure online media, and a news agency) in France during the year 2013 with new micro audience data. We develop a topic detection algorithm that identifies each news event, trace the timeline of each story and study news propagation. We show that one quarter of the news stories are reproduced online in less than 4 minutes. High reactivity comes with verbatim copying. We find that only 32.6% of the online content is original. The negative impact of copying on newsgathering incentives might however be counterbalanced by reputation effects. By using media-level daily audience and article-level Facebook shares, we show that original content represents 57.8% of online news consumption. Reputation mechanisms actually appear to solve about 40% of the copyright violation problem.
L86|Online exports and the wage gap|The development of the Internet is often seen as a source of demand for skilled workers and therefore a potential driver of the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers. This paper focuses on the impact that international trade in online platforms has on the wage gap. Because online trade allows smaller firms with relatively more unskilled workers to access world markets it can be expected a priori that an expansion of online exports reduces the wage gap. After correcting for potential endogeneity bias in a sample of 22 developing countries for which online trade and wage gap data can be matched, the study finds that a 1 percent increase in the share of online exports over GDP leads to a 0.01 percent decline in the wage gap.
L86|Application bundling in system markets|Motivated by recent investigations over Google's practices in the smartphone industry, we study bundling in markets for devices that allow consumers to use applications. The presence of applications on a device increases demand for it, and application developers earn revenues by interacting with consumers. A firm that controls multiple applications can offer them to device manufacturers either individually or as a bundle. We present a novel mechanism through which anticompetitive bundling can be profitable: Bundling reduces rival application developers' willingness to pay manufacturers for inclusion on their devices, and allows a multiapplication developer to capture a larger share of industry profit. Bundling can also strengthen competition between manufacturers and thereby increase consumer surplus, even if it leads to foreclosure of application developers and a loss in product variety
L86|Wirkung von Live-Chats in Online-Shops auf die Kaufentscheidung<BR>[Effect of Live-Chats in Online-Shops on the Purchase Decision]|Der Umsatz durch E-Commerce und auch die Anzahl der Online-Shopper in Deutschland steigt stetig. Die Online-Shops stehen jedoch vor dem Problem geringer Konversionsraten. Ein Ansatz zur Steigerung der Konversionsraten ist der Einsatz persönlicher Kommunikation in Form von Live-Chats. Es stellt sich nun die Frage, wie der Einsatz von Live-Chats in Online-Shops auf die Kaufentscheidung der Kunden wirkt. In einer Online-Erhebung wurden 385 Personen zu ihren Erfahrungen mit und ihren Erwartungen an Live-Chats befragt. 76 Personen haben bereits eine Beratung via Live-Chat in Anspruch genommen und 105 Personen haben ein Angebot für eine Beratung via Live-Chat erhalten, dies jedoch nicht genutzt. Insgesamt 204 Personen haben noch keine Erfahrungen mit Live-Chats gemacht, 98 dieser Personen könnten sich jedoch eine zukünftige Nutzung vorstellen. Für die empirische Untersuchung wurde ein Modell zur Wirkung von Live-Chats in Online-Shops auf die Kaufentscheidung entwickelt, um daraus Hypothesen abzuleiten, auf deren Grundlage die Untersuchung durchgeführt wurde. Die Hypothesen wurden anhand der Befragungsergebnisse der 76 Personen geprüft, die bereits Erfahrungen mit Live-Chats gemacht haben. Die Prüfung der Hypothesen hat gezeigt, dass qualitativ hochwertige Live-Chats mit einer hohen System-und Informationsqualität, in der Lage sind das wahrgenommene Risiko der Kaufentscheidung zu senken, Vertrauen zu dem Online-Shop aufzubauen und positive Kaufentscheidungen zu begünstigen. Live-Chats stellen daher eine Service-Form dar, die von den bisherigen Nutzern positiv bewertet wird und bieten weiteres Potenzial, da auch viele der bisherigen Nicht-Nutzer eine positive Einstellung zu Live-Chats zeigen und sich eine Beratung in Zukunft vorstellen können. Da ein Teil der Probanden jedoch kein Interesse an einer Beratung via Live-Chat gezeigt hat, sollten Live-Chats die etablierten Serviceformen zumindest in naher Zukunft lediglich ergänzen und nicht ersetzen.
L86|Caracterización de los actores del clúster BPO - ITO - KPO en Cali (2014 - 2016)|Studies based on cluster mapping allow to understand the potential of certain industrial sectors and its relevance in the economy of a region, in such a way that businessmen, the academia and State, can have a reference for decision making that will promote the cluster’s dynamism and as a consequence, the socio-economic development of the region. This document is the result of the study of the socio-economic characterization of the actors, based on the technique of cluster mapping of the sectors BPO KPO and ITO and related to the city of Cali, Valle del Cauca, Colombia in 2014 and 2016. The motivation to carry it out was based on the support that the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali has been providing to the Major’s office of Cali, initially to the “Program of Cluster Promotion and Strengthening of the Secretary of Planning” (Programa de Fomento y Fortalecimiento de Clúster de la Secretaría de Planeación), as support to cluster-related initiatives; in this case, to PacificShore, businessmen that received a copy of this study in June 2016 to be analyzed. More recently (August 2017), the study for the recently constituted Secretary of Economic Development of Santiago de Cali has been updated, that has the purpose of encouraging the development of this type of industries in the city. The version here presented corresponds to the updated study.
L86|Conditional Privacy Rights|People have subjective valuations of privacy. Thus, absent further considerations, efficiency requires that a person be afforded privacy if, and only if, his subjective valuation of privacy exceeds the social value of the information that would be disclosed through a violation of that person's privacy. Absolute regimes that either always allow privacy, or never allow privacy, cannot achieve this result. This article shows that a conditional privacy regime can lead to efficient separation among people based on their subjective valuations of privacy. Moreover, this regime need not inefficiently distort information collection incentives or incentives to refrain from various acts that may generate collectible information.
L86|Big Data, Competition and Market Power|Big data are considered ate same time a promising driver of economic development and a concern for possible manipulation and privacy intrusion. Data diffusion and their uncertain appropriability can make property rights for data less precise. The paper reviews some economic features of data. In many digital markets data can be considered a relevant input but hardly an essential facility. Many data are collected in two-sided market platform and in one side they are used to personalize services and to add quality while on the other side of the platform they contribute to make advertising collection more efficient. So the transfer of personal data can be considered an implicit price for many free information services. Consumers usually are unaware of subsequent pervasive use of their personal data, and therefore give away easily their data. Big data can amplify competitive advantages and related dominant positions, leveraging on information asymmetries. A dominant position obtained through collection and processing of big amount of personal data allow practices such as first degree price discrimination, personalized advertising, artificial degradation of services that sometimes can be considered competitive abuse, but it is difficult that data alone allow such position.
L86|Channels of Impact: User Reviews when Quality is Dynamic and Managers Respond|We examine the effect of managerial response on consumer voice in a dynamic quality environment. We argue that, in this environment, the consumer is motivated to write reviews by, in addition to altruism, the possibility that the reviews will impact the quality of the service directly. We examine this empirically in a scenario in which reviewers receive a credible signal that the service provider is listening. Specifically, we examine the managerial response feature allowed by many review platforms. We hypothesize that managerial responses will stimulate reviewing activity and that, because managers respond more and in more detail to negative reviews, we hypothesize that managerial responses will particularly stimulate negative reviewing activity. Using a multiple-differences specification, we show that reviewing activity and particularly negative reviewing is indeed stimulated by managerial response. Our specification exploits comparison of the same hotel immediately before and after response initiation and compares a given hotels reviewing activity on sites with review response initiation to sites that do not allow managerial response.
L86|Prices of high-tech products, mismeasurement, and the pace of innovation|Abstract Introduction Two recent papers have made compelling cases that mismeasurement of prices of high-tech products cannot explain the slow pace of labor productivity growth that has prevailed since the mid-2000s. Does that result indicate that mismeasurement of high-tech products has limited implications for patterns of economic growth? The answer in this paper is “no.”. Results We demonstrate that the understatement of price declines for high-tech products in official measures has a dramatic effect on the pattern of multifactor productivity (MFP) growth across sectors. In particular, we show that correcting this mismeasurement implies faster MFP growth in high-tech sectors and slower MFP advance outside the high-tech sector. If MFP growth is taken as a rough proxy for the pace of innovation, our results suggest that innovation in the tech sector has been more rapid than the rate that would be inferred from official statistics (and less rapid outside high-tech). Conclusion These results deepen the productivity puzzle. If the pace of innovation in high-tech sectors has been more rapid than indicated by official statistics, then it is perhaps even more puzzling that overall labor productivity growth has been so sluggish in recent years.
L86|Digital Economics|Digital technology is the representation of information in bits. This technology has reduced the cost of storage, computation, and transmission of data. Research on digital economics examines whether and how digital technology changes economic activity. In this review, we emphasize the reduction in five distinct economic costs associated with digital economic activity: search costs, replication costs, transportation costs, tracking costs, and verification costs.
L86|Economic Damage of Cookie Lifetime Restrictions| Over the past few years, regulators have begun to consider restricting a cookie’s lifetime or even banning cookies altogether as a way to protect consumer privacy. Most of this debate has taken place in the absence of any quantified cost-benefit analysis. To begin to fill this gap in the discourse, we estimate the potential economic damage of lifespan restrictions on cookies. Our analysis is based on an empirical study on cookies of 54,127 users who received about 130 million ad impressions over 2.5 years. Only 22% of all cookies increase their daily value over time but the value of that quantile represent 61% of the value of all cookies. This analysis suggests that restricting their lifetime to one year as the European Union proposes (two years as Google advocates) decreases cookie lifetime value by 14.8% (5.9%), which represents a decrease in the value of all cookies of about 7.4% (1.3%). Overall, we find that the average lifetime of a cookie is 215 days (median 68 days) and the average value of a cookie is €1.43 (median €.02).
L86|How do Platform Participants respond to an Unfair Rating? An Analysis of a Ride-Sharing Platform Using a Quasi-Experiment| Online rating systems can lead, on occasion, to reviews that are unfair or unrepresentative of the true quality provided. On the one hand, receiving an unfairly low rating once, might induce someone a platform supplier to exert more effort and receive a better rating the next time. On the other hand, it might dispirit suppliers and make them exert less effort. We use data from a ride-sharing platform in India where driver ratings were made particularly salient to the driver after each trip. Our data suggests that if a customer experiences a ride cancellation, they are more likely to unfairly blame the replacement driver. We use this as a exogenous source of unfair negative ratings for the driver. We show that drivers are more likely to respond negatively to a bad rating and receive subsequently bad ratings if they were blameless for the previous negative rating. This effect is larger in contexts where there is a higher potential for an emotional response and when there is a greater need for driver skill in the subsequent ride.
L86|Features of Application of Software Solutions in Public Projects Risk Management|This article is dedicated to the analysis and risk assessment in project management. At first glance, this is a very widely discussed topic, in which most decisions are known and applied for many years. The change in the business environment and organizational management in recent years imposed a new interpretation of the classic problems in project management. In the public sphere, we witness the ever-expanding range of possibilities for application in different procedures and diversity of implemented projects. This tendency requires analysis of the opportunities offered by some of the most popular software solutions for risk management, which leads to search for capabilities for integration of these solutions with information systems for public projects management. This integration can be considered as a basis for improving the absorption and effectiveness of public funds.
L86|Digital Trade: Developing a Framework for Analysis|This paper explores the definition, measurement, and policy implications of digital trade, proposing a tentative typology of digital trade that can be used to unpack transactions and analyse the issues. Digitalisation is changing what and how we trade: from digital delivery to greater physical trade enabled by digital connectivity. Online platforms mean more small packages crossing borders, while new technologies are changing how services are produced and delivered. Underpinning digital trade is the movement of data: data is a means of production, an asset that can itself be traded, and the means through which some services are traded and GVCs are organised. While there is no single definition of digital trade, there is a growing consensus that it encompasses digitally enabled transactions in trade in goods and services which can be either digitally or physically delivered involving consumers, firms and governments. Unpacking trade transactions along these lines using a tentative typology can help in understanding and identifying issues. For example, measuring digital trade poses challenges ranging from identifying transactions that are digitally enabled to the sectoral classification of services in a transaction, and efforts are underway to better reflect digital trade in trade statistics. For trade policy, the increased bundling of goods and services raises issues about which trade rules (GATT or GATS) apply; trade facilitation is ever more critical for just-in-time delivery and GVCs; and the role of data flows in enabling digital trade may require further attention, along with how to ensure that the gains from digital trade are inclusive, within and across countries.
L86|Maintaing vs. Milking Good Reputation when Customer Feedback is Inaccurate|In Internet transactions, customers and service providers often interact once and anonymously. To prevent deceptive behavior a reputation system is particularly important to reduce information asymmetries about the quality of the o?ered product or service. In this study we examine the e?ectiveness of a reputation system to reduce information asymmetries when customers may make mistakes in judging the provided service quality. In our model, a service provider makes strategic quality choices and short-lived customers are asked to evaluate the observed quality by providing ratings to a reputation system. The customer is not able to always evaluate the service quality correctly and possibly submits an erroneous rating according to a prede?ned probability. Considering reputation pro?les of the last three sales, within the theoretical model we derive that the service provider’s dichotomous quality decisions are independent of the reputation pro?le and depend only on the probabilities of receiving positive and negative ratings when providing low or high quality. Thus, a service provider optimally either maintains a good reputation or completely refrains from any reputation building process. However, when mapping our theoretical model to an experimental design we ?nd that a signi?cant share of subjects in the role of the service provider deviates from optimal behavior and chooses actions which are conditional on the current reputation pro?le. With respect to these individual quality choices we see that subjects use milking strategies which means that they exploit a good reputation. In particular, if the sales price is high, low quality is delivered until the price drops below a certain threshold, and then high quality is chosen until the price increases again.
L86|Regional development in the context of economic reform: The case of Limassol|Regional development occurs in the larger context of national economies. Thus, the elaboration of regional economic development strategies cannot be separated from higher-level economic policy which frames and conditions opportunities and risks for regional development. As a Southern European country undergoing a process of profound structural economic reform, Cyprus provides a case for a policy context aiming towards the emergence of a new model of economic growth. Within this context, the Limassol region as one of the country’s major economic centers with a number of comparatively strong industries can serve as an example of how to promote regional development in the framework of national reform priorities such as moving the national economy closer towards a knowledge- and innovation-driven model. The present study analyses current reform priorities on the national and supra-national level, takes stock of the regional economic structure of Limassol district, and presents some preliminary ideas that could be further explored if and when a comprehensive regional economic development strategy for Limassol were to be elaborated.
L86|The Mediating Role of Job Satisfaction between Transformational Leadership and Organizational Commitment within the SMEs of Karachi|The mediating role of job satisfaction between transformational leadership style and the organizational commitment within the SMEs in Karachi is the aim of this study. The correlation between variables is explored through quantitative methods. Total 190 respondents participated from 49 SMEs in Karachi. The results showed that job satisfaction has significant mediating role between variables of interest. This study confirmed that there is a positive strong correlation between transformational leadership and organizational commitment. Employees having high job satisfaction showed higher organizational commitment. Females scored more in comparison to males in terms of overall organizational commitment. However, males have high affective and normative while females have high continuance commitment.
L86|Freemium as optimal menu pricing|In online contents markets, content providers collect revenues from both consumers and advertisers by segmenting consumers who are willing to avoid advertisements and who are not. To analyze such situations, I construct a model of menu pricing by advertising platforms in two-sided markets. I find that, under certain condition, although a monopolistic platform can choose any menu of price-advertisement pairs, the optimal menu consists of only two services: ad-supported basic service and ad-free premium service. In addition, if the willingness to pay of advertisers is sufficiently high, the basic service is offered for free. This menu pricing is well known as freemium. Furthermore, this binary structure remains to hold under several extensions including duopoly platform competition.
L86|K-Chains: A New Class of Blockchains and Related Turing Machines Based on Quantum Mechanics|Quantum Mechanical principles have brought about a revolution in the way we perceive our world and use technology. One of the possible impacts and usage of Quantum mechanics is in the field of economics. Quantum mechanics can be applied to build a new class of Blockchain systems. This paper explores that possibility. It deals with how Quantum Mechanics can be best implemented to bring into existence a new class of Blockchain systems. These Quantum Blockchains (called K-Chains) will have several advantages like possible Faster-Than-Light (FTL) communication of Transactions, Unlimited network capacity and the revolutionary prospect of an Off-line Blockchain which will not need to be connected to the internet for transactions to occur. Extrapolation of this likelihood can lead to the designing of Quantum Turing Machines which are based on Quantum Blockchain (K-Chain) Technology. Real time information and communication systems spanning distances across light-years will most likely be probable. This can allow Mankind to instantly exchange value and information across vast distances of space almost instantly. The paper starts by briefly explaining the basics of Blockchains, cryptocurrencies and relevant Quantum mechanical concepts. Then we discuss how Quantum mechanics can be amalgamated with Blockchain Technology to achieve K-Chains. Later we will delve into the various impediments that make achieving a Quantum Blockchain (K-Chain) difficult with present day hardware technology. The paper concludes by discussing the various aspects of Quantum Technology, Blockchain Systems and the possibilities of constructing a Blockchain based Quantum Turing Machines.

L86|Roadmap for Renewal: A Shared Platform in the Food Industry|Abstract The majority of digital platform research has focused on consumer-centric platforms. Driven by the vast growth potential of direct consumer market access, industrial communities locked behind the conventional gatekeepers in their respective value chains have lately started to tinker with their own platform creation initiatives. Aided by fifteen food industry actors, we identify two critical managerial prerequisites for and design a six-step roadmap towards a participatory infrastructure platform – a platform that allows platform participants to share proprietary data and – by exploiting the data – to create new artifacts in consumer-centric marketplaces. Beyond product innovations, sharing data also enables new optimization layers for operational efficiencies and increased productivity on the industry level. In exploring the participants’ commitment and willingness to shift towards such a platform model, we found three operational data types that the companies would readily be willing to share: 1) transportation data, 2) warehousing data, and 3) demand/supply data managed with decentralized governance models. In the short term, each data type could provide the foundation for the establishment of a specific type of an operational platform: a transportation platform, a warehousing platform, or a market platform. The latter would provide the long-sought direct access to consumer markets. Building on these models, we identify another three strategic avenues for long-term joint development: 1) algorithmic development and evolution of the platform, 2) cross-industry interoperability of the platform, and 3) interoperability with competing platforms. Laying out a roadmap of evolving platform models towards a consumer-driven business ecosystem, we contribute to the empirical literature on industrial platform creation.
L86|Norwegian and Romanian green cluster experiences for a digital era|Addressing climate change through the reduction of fossil resources dependency requires the transition from fossil-based industrial production to a bio-based (green) industrial structure. The development of bio-based industry clusters might be part of the solution. This paper introduces the ‘bioeconomy’ concept and the Triple Helix model that are useful when examining the development of green industries clusters in the emerging digital era; the Smart City model might promote new ways to create profitable and sustainable businesses. Examples of good practices and clusters for green industries from Norway are provided and some success stories including Romanian firms are presented.
L86|Evaluating Investments in Portability and Interoperability between Software Service Platforms|Within a closed ecosystem, end-users cannot interoperate with other platforms or port their software and data easily without a cost for interface integration or data re-formatting. The customers of these closed software service platforms are locked-in. Potential customers, who are aware of this lock-in issue, are hesitant to adopt a closed software service platform, slowing down the wide deployment of the software service platform. This paper applies an economic perspective to investigate the value creation for providers and users at different levels of interoperability. For the analysis, a value creation model for software service platforms within a software service ecosystem has been developed. Simulations of the value creation model show that, even if investments in interoperability and portability are aimed at addressing user requirements, their impact also drives the providers’ profitability. Furthermore, emerging providers require investing more than market leading providers, as they have less power to set de facto standards. The simulation results also show that there is an optimal level of investments, with respect to profit and return on investments. Overall, from these results, platform providers cannot only obtain an understanding on how investments in interoperability and portability impact cost, enable cost-effective service integration, and create value, but also design new strategies for optimizing investments.
L86|Semantic metadata in the publishing industry – technological achievements and economic implications|Abstract This paper discusses the adoption of new data management practices, known as Linked Data, by publishing companies from a strategic management perspective. It investigates the role of semantic metadata in the creation and exploitation of so called Linked Data ecosystems and discusses organizational effects on business and value creation processes stimulated by the technology. The theoretical assumptions are complemented by two case studies that provide insights how publishing companies use Linked Data technologies to diversify their business, strategically position themselves within emerging business ecosystems and adapt to the affordances of advanced data management practices. The analysis reveals that despite of differences in the adoption strategy both publishing companies have identified Linked Data technologies as the core of their innovation strategy having a profound impact on existing business practices and new strategies of value creation.
L86|Review of information systems research for media industry–recent advances, challenges, and introduction of information systems research in the media industry|Abstract Global media reports clearly show a tremendous increase in spending on Information Technology (IT) and Information Systems (IS) in the media sector. Two main trends are currently visible. First, as stated in McKinsey & Company’s Global Media Report, consumers continuously shift from spending on traditional media products towards rapidly-increasing spending on digital services and media products – consumer patterns have rapidly changed. Second, as stated in Gartner’s reports about the media industry, spending on IT services in the media industry increases gradually, and as a whole, the media industry is the third-largest spender on IT, after banking/finance and manufacturing. Third, as reported by both authors in their works, several facets of the media industry have undergone extreme changes, including business models, declining revenue, content models, management, economics and public funding. The aim of this study is to investigate research work related to IS in the media industry, in particular in the management and economic areas. To conduct this study, we investigated a large corpus of studies that have been contributed to IS research within the Association for Information Systems (AIS) within the past decades. We utilised advanced text mining methods to identify contributions and thematic areas. Our results clearly indicate that there is a significant downward trend of research works dealing with media industry aspects. This trend was a surprise to us, as it contradicts the emergence of new digital technologies which became key drivers in the media industry after 2009. We conclude this article by giving research directions, illustrating the opportunities and importance of investigating media industries within the context of IS, and introducing the research field of Information Systems in the eMedia Industry.
L86|A new bibliographic coupling measure with descriptive capability|Abstract Bibliographic coupling (BC) is an effective measure to estimate the similarity between two scholarly articles (i.e., inter-article similarity between the two articles). It works on out-link references of articles (i.e., those references cited by the articles), and is essential for relatedness analysis and topic clustering of scholarly articles. In this paper, we present a new BC measure DescriptiveBC, which employs the titles of the out-link references to improve BC in two ways: given a target article a, DescriptiveBC provides more accurate information about how (based on numerical inter-article similarity) and why (based on textual descriptive terms) a scholarly article is related to a. Visualization of the information can support the identification, clustering, mapping, and navigation of the related evidence in scientific literature. Empirical evaluation justifies the contributions of DescriptiveBC. Release of the reference titles in each article is thus helpful for the dissemination of research findings in scientific literature, and DescriptiveBC can be incorporated into search engines of scholarly articles to help prospective researchers to navigate through the space of related articles online.

L86|Display advertising’s competitive spillovers to consumer search|We find display advertising influences customer search for both the advertised brand and its competitors. We exploit a natural experiment that randomizes ad delivery on 500 million visits to the Yahoo! homepage and compare visitors’ subsequent activities on Yahoo! Search. In three advertisers’ campaigns, display ads increase searches for advertised brands by 30–45 % and for competitors’ brands by up to 23 %. Strikingly, the total number of incremental searches for competitors is 2–8 times the increase for advertisers’ brands. We discuss how these spillovers create strategic complementarities for search advertisers and reduce firms’ investments in advertising. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
L86|Some Simple Economics of Crowdfunding|It is not surprising that the financing of early-stage creative projects and ventures is typically geographically localized since these types of funding decisions are usually predicated on personal relationships and due diligence requiring face-to-face interactions in response to high levels of risk, uncertainty, and information asymmetry. So, to economists, the recent rise of crowdfunding - raising capital from many people through an online platform - which offers little opportunity for careful due diligence and involves not only friends and family but also many strangers from near and far, is initially startling. On the eve of launching equity-based crowdfunding, a new market for early-stage finance in the U.S., we provide a preliminary exploration of its underlying economics. We highlight the extent to which economic theory, in particular transaction costs, reputation, and market design, can explain the rise of non-equity crowdfunding and offer a framework for speculating on how equity-based crowdfunding may unfold. We conclude by articulating open questions related to how crowdfunding may affect social welfare and the rate and direction of innovation.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

This empirical exercise is done with a special survey focused in lowincome people from developing countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Our methodology is the following. First, we evaluate the determinants of use of each strategy by means of a probabilistic model and we find that education level and age are important determinants of the use of alternatives. Second, we use a Poisson regression model to study the number of strategies used. Although our findings differ among countries, the use of more than one strategy is common in the sample.
L86|In Search of a Definition For the History of Economic Thought|This note discusses some ideas in regards to the character, method, and identity of historians of economic thought. They may be considered “generalist” economists, who hold knowledge of general theories.

Therefore, historians of economic thought have a precise and permanent position within the economicsdiscipline.
L86|Invisible Engines: How Software Platforms Drive Innovation and Transform Industries|Software platforms are the invisible engines that have created, touched, or transformed nearly every major industry for the past quarter century. They power everything from mobile phones and automobile navigation systems to search engines and web portals. They have been the source of enormous value to consumers and helped some entrepreneurs build great fortunes. And they are likely to drive change that will dwarf the business and technology revolution we have seen to this point. Invisible Engines examines the business dynamics and strategies used by firms that recognize the transformative power unleashed by this new revolution--a revolution that will change both new and old industries. The authors argue that in order to understand the successes of software platforms, we must first understand their role as a technological meeting ground where application developers and end users converge. Apple, Microsoft, and Google, for example, charge developers little or nothing for using their platforms and make most of their money from end users; Sony PlayStation and other game consoles, by contrast, subsidize users and make more money from developers, who pay royalties for access to the code they need to write games. More applications attract more users, and more users attract more applications. And more applications and more users lead to more profits. Invisible Engines explores this story through the lens of the companies that have mastered this platform-balancing act. It offers detailed studies of the personal computer, video game console, personal digital assistant, smart mobile phone, and digital media software platform industries, focusing on the business decisions made by industry players to drive profits and stay a step ahead of the competition. Shorter discussions of Internet-based software platforms provide an important glimpse into a future in which the way we buy, pay, watch, listen, learn, and communicate will change forever.

L86|The Economics of Internet Search|This lecture provides an introduction to the economics of Internet search engines. After a brief review of the historical development of the technology and the industry, I describe some of the economic features of the auction system used for displaying ads. It turns out that some relatively simple economic models provide significant insight into the operation of these auctions. In particular, the classical theory of two-sided matching markets turns out to be very useful in this context.
L86|Platform Competition in Two-Sided Markets|" Many if not most markets with network externalities are two-sided. To succeed, platforms in industries such as software, portals and media, payment systems and the Internet, must ""get both sides of the market on board."" Accordingly, platforms devote much attention to their business model, that is, to how they court each side while making money overall. This paper builds a model of platform competition with two-sided markets. It unveils the determinants of price allocation and end-user surplus for different governance structures (profit-maximiz-ing platforms and not-for-profit joint undertakings), and compares the outcomes with those under an integrated monopolist and a Ramsey planner.

Developing countries have demonstrated a comparative advantage in this export sector and the global IT industry can benefit from this developing country advantage. Today, IT is high investment, high risk, and high reward and has graduated from being a critical support function to a key partner, sometimes responsible for directing the strategy of an enterprise. Business and technology managers cannot afford to miss the opportunities provided by the comparative advantage of developing countries in the IT arena.

L86|Projecting the Economic Impact of the Internet|In this paper we analyze the impact of the Internet on the performance of the economy and the standard of living of average Americans. Our analyses illustrate that even though the stock market’s speculative bubble has burst, the Internet will continue to have a significant impact on old economy industries and as a result generate real benefits for the overall economy.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L86|Économie de l'information et Internet|This article presents some pieces of analysis derived from the theory of industrial organisation that shed light on the recent development of economic activities on Internet. The survey draws in a synthetic way from material exposed more extensively in Gaudeul-Jullien [2000], concerning online sales of goods and services. Classification JEL : L86
L86|Interaction et coopération en réseau. Un modèle de gratuité|Interactions between Internet users or network nodes mostly consist of requests. Thus, virtual communities and newsgroup, but also data transmission through Internet networks, rest on systems of bilateral or multilateral requests. This representation of Internet allows us to study the best strategies for the senders of requests. We show that under certain conditions, it is not optimal for the senders to reward the agents who do the requests. Hence free interaction may be a relative efficient model for Internet communities. This model is strenghtened when the senders accept to leave the results of their requests open. This framework helps to better undestand cooperative practices on Internet, like peering agreements among Internet Service Providers or open source software projects. Classification JEL : L86, H4
L86|L'économie du logiciel libre. Organisation coopérative et incitation à l'innovation|An open source software is defined by the availability of its source-code that cannot be privately appropriated. Its production is based on a special cooperative organisation mode, called the “bazaar”, which functions particularly well in the context of Internet. Its functional viability till now was related to the fact that the users and developers of these software products considered themselves in the same category of actors. Today, open source software is entering the market and the existing form of organisation can now be the source of profits. The model’s viability is related to its ability to sustain a high level of innovation. Hence, it depends on individual incentives to participate, and public spiritedness can no longer be relied upon as an effective substitute. Classification JEL : D23, H41, L86, O31, O34
L86|L'évaluation et le financement des start-up Internet|This paper discusses some phenomena in the corporate finance of internet start-ups that emerged during the “internet buble” between 1998-2000. The advent of nternet start-ups had a major impact on the investment flow and the operations of the venture capital industry in the US and in Europe. It is argued that some of these transformations could be explained by the potential for specific agency conflicts in the financing of internet start-ups. The paper then turns to a discussion of initial public offerings and the listing of companies without near-term profitability, the capital structure of start-ups characterized by the dominance of equity, and the absence of dividend pay-outs. Finally, the valuation of companies and innovative techniques that supposedly can overcome obstacles in the accurate valuation of internet start-ups are discussed.

L86|DV-Dienstleister : schwaecheres, aber solides Umsatzwachstum, Perspektiven bleiben guenstig|Der deutsche Markt fuer Software und DV-Dienstleistungen befindet sich weiterhin auf Wachstumskurs. Der Schwung hat aber in den ersten neun Monaten 2000 in diesem wachstumsstarken Wirtschaftsbereich nachgelassen. Auch der Jahresauftakt war nach den aktuellen Befragungsergebnissen verhalten, das Geschaeftsklima hat aber erstmals nach vier Quartalen nicht weiter nachgegeben. Fuer das Winterhalbjahr 2000/2001 hoffen die Unternehmen an ihren alten Wachstumskurs wieder anknuepfen zu koennen, unveraendert beurteilten drei Fuenftel der DV-Dienstleister die Perspektiven als guenstig.
L86|DV-Dienstleister: Schwächeres, aber solides Umsatzwachstum, Perspektiven bleiben günstig|Im Oktober und November 2000 führte das ifo Institut zum 23. Mal seine vierteljährliche Konjunkturumfrage bei DV-Dienstleistern durch. Die aktuelle Geschäftslage hat sich erstmals seit vier Quartalen nicht weiter abgeschwächt. Die Mehrheit (per Saldo + 51 %) der Teilnehmer sprach auch im dritten Berichtsquartal von einem glänzenden Geschäftsverlauf. Für das Winterhalbjahr 2000/2001 hoffen die Unternehmen an ihren alten Wachstumskurs anknüpfen zu können, und drei Fünftel der DV-Dienstleister beurteilte die Perspektiven als günstig. Ein Hemmschuh für das Wachstum der Unternehmen ist nach wie vor der Fachkräftemangel. Rund die Hälfte der DV-Dienstleister leidet darunter. Nicht ganz so ausgeprägt ist der Fachkräftemangel bei den ostdeutschen DV-Dienstleistern, das Problem hat sich aber deutlich verschärft.
L86|Interaction et coopération en réseau. Un modèle de gratuité|[fre] Sur Internet, les interactions entre utilisateurs ou nœuds de réseau prennent le plus souvent la forme de requêtes. Ainsi, les forums et les communautés virtuelles, mais aussi les réseaux physiques, qui supportent Internet, fonctionnent sur la base de requêtes. À partir de cette représentation d'Internet, nous étudions les stratégies ou les modalités optimales de tarification des requêtes. Sous certaines conditions, la gratuité est un modèle d'interaction efficace, permettant de minimiser les coûts de fonctionnement du réseau. Ce principe de gratuité est renforcé lorsque les émetteurs de requête acceptent de ne pas protéger ou de laisser en libre accès le résultat de leurs requêtes. Ce cadre d'analyse permet ainsi de mieux comprendre les pratiques de coopération sur Internet, comme les accords de peering entre opérateurs de réseaux ou le développement de logiciels libres.

L86|L'économie du logiciel libre. Organisation coopérative et incitation à l'innovation|"[eng] The economics of open source software: cooperation and incentives to innovate. . An open source software is defined by the availability of its source-code that cannot be privately appropriated. Its production is based on a special cooperative organisation mode, called the ""bazaar"", which functions particularly well in the context of Internet. Its functional viability till now was related to the fact that the users and developers of these software products considered themselves in the same category of actors. Today, open source software is entering the market and the existing form of organisation can now be the source of profits. The model's viability is related to its ability to sustain a high level of innovation. Hence, it depends on individual incentives to participate, and public spiritedness can no longer be relied upon as an effective substitute. [fre] Un logiciel libre est un logiciel dont le code source est rendu ouvertement disponible et ne peut faire l'objet d'une appropriation privative. Le mode d'organisation coopérative du « bazar », qui en fonde la production, a trouvé dans Internet un support particulièrement puissant et a pu jusqu'ici fonctionner efficacement dans la mesure où utilisateurs et développeurs des produits s'identifiaient en une seule et même catégorie. Aujourd'hui, le logiciel libre prend le virage du marché grand public et cette forme d'organisation collective peut être source de rentes privées. La viabilité de ce modèle est nécessairement dépendante de sa capacité à entretenir une dynamique de l'innovation efficiente. Elle dépend par conséquent d'un problème d'incitations individuelles, auxquelles l'éthique collective ne saurait être considérée comme un substitut efficace."
L86|L'évaluation et le financement des start-up Internet|"[fre] L'évaluation et le financement des start-up Internet. . Cet article analyse quelques phénomènes de finance d'entreprise liés aux start-up Internet, apparus durant la « bulle » des années 1998-2000. À cette période, l'arrivée des start-up Internet a produit un impact majeur sur les flux d'investissement et sur le fonctionnement du secteur du capital-risque aux États-Unis et en Europe. Ces transformations s'expliquent en partie par des problèmes d'agence spécifiques aux start-up Internet, qui sont étudiés dans une première partie. On s'intéresse ensuite successivement à l'introduction et la cotation en bourse de sociétés sans bénéfices à court et moyen terme, à la structure de capital des start-up, marquée par une prédominance des fonds propres, puis au non-paiement de dividendes. Enfin, sont discutés différents modes d'évaluation des sociétés, notamment des méthodes récentes reposant sur la théorie des options réelles et visant à mieux prendre en compte certains caractères spécifiques des start-up.
