L98|Linkages and spillover effects of South African foreign direct investment in Botswana and Kenya|In recent decades, the impact of South African foreign direct investment in Africa has been captured by research and policy. This paper investigates linkages and spillover effects of South African foreign direct investment in Botswana and Kenya. The study uses primary data to investigate qualitative implications. The findings reveal that South African firms operate in sectors including retail, food-processing, and information and communication technology. Linkages forged in these sectors include supply, employee, joint venture, service, and institutional nexuses. Supply and service linkages create observable spillovers which point to the fact that younger local firms tend to benefit from South African firms in terms of technology transfer and training opportunities. Host country policymakers are therefore encouraged to provide favourable incentives for foreign direct investment to promote entrepreneurship. Other policy implications are also discussed.

L98|Assessment of the drafted German Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan|Germany is struggling to meet its 2020 greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and climate goals. Against this background, we analyze the current draft National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) that sets out how Germany aims to achieve its national and European climate goals by 2030. We introduce the current stage of the country’s climate policy and, by looking at the different emission reduction measures under discussion, examine why Germany will probably miss its CO2 emissions reduction goals. We conclude that, based on the climate package announced in September 2019, Germany will get closer to the achievement of its 2030 targets than was anticipated in the NECP draft; nevertheless, the new climate package leaves a significant gap between the new measures and the 2030 climate goals.
L98|Can wholesale electricity prices support “subsidy-free” generation investment in Europe?|Using a Pan-European electricity dispatch model we find that with higher variable renewable energy (VRE) production wholesale power prices may no longer serve as a long-run signal for generation investment in 2025. If wind and solar are to be self-financing by 2025 under the current European market design, they would need to be operating in circumstances which combine lower capital cost with higher fossil fuel and/or carbon prices. In the absence of these conditions, long term subsidy mechanisms would need to continue in order to meet European renewable electricity targets. More VRE production will exacerbate the ‘missing money’ problem for conventional generation. Thus, closures of unprofitable fossil fuel generation would sharpen and increase energy-only prices but would put more pressure on ancillary services markets to support system stability. Thus, the question of the need for a market redesign to let the market guide investments in both renewables and conventional generation would seem to remain.
L98|A Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch Model of the GB Electricity Market – Formulation and Application to Hydro Pumped Storage|We present a well calibrated unit commitment and economic dispatch model of the GB electricity market and applied it to the economic analysis of the four existing hydro pumped storage (PS) stations in GB. We found that with more wind on the system PS arbitrage revenue increases: with every percentage point (p.p) increase in wind capacity the total PS arbitrage profit increases by 0.21 p.p.. However, under a range of wind capacity, the PS’ modelled revenue from price arbitrage is not enough to cover their ongoing fixed costs. Analysing the 2015-18 GB balancing and ancillary services data suggests that PS stations were not active in managing transmission constraints and in fact about 60% of constraint payments went to gas-fired units. However, the PS stations are active in provision of ancillary services such as fast reserve, response and other reserve services with a combined market share of at least 30% in 2018. Stacking up the modelled revenue from price arbitrage with the 2018 balancing and ancillary services revenues against the ongoing fixed costs suggests that the four existing PS stations are profitable. Most of the revenue comes from balancing and ancillary services markets – about 75% – whereas only 25% comes from price arbitrage. However, the revenues will not be enough to cover capex and opex of a new 600 MW PS station. The gap in financing will have to come from balancing and ancillary services market opportunities and less so from purely price arbitrage. Finally, we found that the marginal contribution of most of the existing PS stations to gas and coal plant profitability is negative, while from the system point of view, PS stations do contribute to minimizing the total operating cost.
L98|Prices, Schedules, and Passenger Welfare in Multi-Service Transportation Systems|We consider a multi-service transportation system in which passengers are heterogeneous along two dimensions, namely ideal departure time and value of time, leading to both horizontal and vertical differentiation. We investigate the behavior of passengers, and assess how service pricing and scheduling affect their travel choices and welfare. We show that this depends, first, on whether passengers are uninformed or informed about the timetable of services, supplied at different prices, upon arrival at the station. Besides, given the information passengers hold, it also depends on their (individual-specific) value of time. The market segmentation results accordingly, and is found to be finer, in general, when passengers are informed. Our analysis offers policy-makers a scientifically founded tool to make sensible decisions, based on the exact identification of those who would gain and those who would lose from policy changes. The analysis further highlights the potential benefits of information, and points to the importance of facilitating information accessibility to passengers.

L98|"Use and Abuse of Regulated Prices in Electricity Markets: ""How to Regulate Regulated Prices?"""|We consider the regulation of the tariffs charged by a public utility in the electricity sector. Consumers differ in terms of their demands which are private information. When regulating the firm's tariffs, the government is concerned by redistribution across consumers classes. A conflict between redistribution and screening induces production distortions even when the firm is a monopoly. Introducing competition with an unregulated fringe may improve efficiency but jeopardizes redistribution. In response, the government may now want to manipulate information about the incumbent's cost so as to restrict entry and better promote its own redistributive objective. To prevent such obstacle to entry, the government's discretion in fixing regulated tariffs of the incumbent should be restricted. This can be done by imposing floors or caps on those tariffs and/or by controlling the market share left to the competitive fringe. We highlight the determinants of such limits on discretion and unveil to what extent they depend on the government's redistributive concerns.
L98|Does Increasing Block Pricing Decrease Energy Use? Evidence from the Residential Electricity Market|Many electric utilities in the United States have replaced flat pricing schedules with increasing block prices (IBPs) in an effort to decrease aggregate energy use without imposing costs on low-income households. IBPs are step functions where the price per kilowatt-hour increases as a household uses more electricity. It is not clear, however, in theory or in practice, whether IBPs decrease aggregate energy use and protect low-income households relative to a revenue-neutral flat rate. I use detailed monthly billing records combined with demographic data for 11,745 California households and price differences over time across utility climate zones to estimate price elasticities of energy demand by income. The resulting estimates find that wealthier households are more price elastic than low-income households. I use these elasticities to show that IBPs increase total electricity use relative to a revenue-neutral flat price, therefore failing to achieve their goal of conservation. Finally, this paper finds that IBPs decrease electricity bills for low-income households while pushing costs to high-income households.
L98|“The impact of curbside parking regulations on car ownership”|Car ownership is a major driver of household travel behavior and has a marked impact on transport demand, energy consumption, emission levels and land use. However, just how curbside parking regulations (i.e. paid parking) affects car ownership remains unclear. Here, we employ a two-way fixed effect model using panel data and difference-in-differences estimations to determine the causal impact of changes in parking regulations and the specific impact of the extension of a city-wide parking policy in Barcelona. Our results suggest that the introduction of paid parking to reduce non-resident/visitor demand has a positive impact on resident car ownership levels. Our welfare analysis suggests that the welfare loss derived from the residents’ parking subsidy and their likely increase in car usage can easily offset the benefits derived from visitor-trip deterrence. This being the case, the tradeoff between efficiency and acceptability requires careful consideration.
L98|Experimental Evidence on the Effect of Information and Pricing on Residential Electricity Consumption|This study examines a field experiment in Texas that includes pricing and informational interventions to encourage energy conservation during summer peak load days when the social cost of generation is the highest. We estimate that our critical peak pricing intervention reduces electricity consumption by 14%. Using unique high frequency appliance-level data, we can attribute 74% of this response to air conditioning. In contrast, we find minimal response to active information provision and conservation appeals. A complementary experimental program also lowers nighttime prices during the off-peak season, providing the first evidence of electric vehicle loadshifting in response to price.
L98|Equilibrium trade in automobile markets|We introduce a computationally tractable dynamic equilibrium model of the automobile market where new and used cars of multiple types (e.g. makes/models) are traded by heterogeneous consumers. Prices and quantities are determined endogenously to equate supply and demand for all car types and vintages, along with the ages at which cars are scrapped. The model allows for transactions costs, taxes, flexible specifications of car characteristics, consumer preferences, and heterogeneity. We apply the model to two examples: a revenue-neutral replacement of the new vehicle registration tax with a higher fuel tax and a hypothetical “merger to monopoly” in an oligopolistic new car market. We show substantial gains in consumer welfare from the tax policy change, as well as important effects on government revenues, automobile prices, driving, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, while the merger leads to substantial welfare losses.
L98|The 2018 Indicators on the Governance of Sector Regulators - Part of the Product Market Regulation (PMR) Survey|Complementing the Product Market Regulation (PMR) survey, the Indicators on the Governance of Sector Regulators map the regulatory arrangements of 130 regulators across 38 countries and five network sectors: energy, e-communications, rail and air transport, and water. The indicators are structured along three components: independence, accountability and scope of action.For the 2018 update, the OECD Secretariat and delegates of the Network of Economic Regulators (NER) revised the structure and content of the survey based on new best practice principles, guidance documents and the growing body of work of the NER on the performance of regulators.The analysis shows that, while the governance arrangements of regulators vary considerably across countries and sectors, some key trends and correlations can be observed. These insights can support countries and regulators wishing to benchmark their governance practices and reform their governance arrangements.
L98|The limits of laws: traffic law enforcement in South Africa|The aim of many public policies is to change behaviour. Governments tend to rely on regulations, taxes and subsidies to effect such change. These measures, which affect agents' economic incentives, have a mixed record. A key insight of the New Institutional Economics is that the efficacy of such formal institutions depends on the strength of their enforcement and the extent to which they are compatible with prevailing informal institutions. This paper uses the road safety situation in South Africa as a case study to explore aspects of the relationships among formal institutions, law enforcement and informal institutions. South Africa has a strong suite of road safety laws but poor road safety outcomes. The paper argues that improved law enforcement cannot fully solve the problem; complementary changes to the informal institutions shaping the behaviour of road-users are essential. It points out that institutional economists have to take a greater interest in the insights of research in behavioural economics, behavioural and cognitive science and other disciplines in order to provide useful advice in settings where such change is an important policy objective.
L98|Effective Climate Policy Doesn’t Have to be Expensive| We compare the effectiveness of different climate policies in terms of emissions abatement and costs in the British and German electricity markets. The two countries follow different climate policies, allowing us to compare the effectiveness of a relatively low EU ETS carbon price in Germany with a significantly higher carbon price due to a unilateral top-up tax (the Carbon Price Support) in the UK. We first estimate the emissions offsetting effects of carbon pricing and of subsidized wind and solar feed-in, and then derive the abatement costs of one tonne of CO2 for the different policies. We find that a reasonably high price for emissions is the most cost-effective climate policy, while subsidizing wind is preferable to subsidizing solar power. A carbon price of around EURO 35 is enough in the UK to induce vast short-run fuel switching between coal- and gas-fired power plants, leading to significant emissions abatement at low costs.
L98|A retrospective study on the regional benefits and spillover effects of high-speed broadband networks: Evidence from German counties|There is still hardly any empirical evidence on how divergent broadband technologies, and, by extension, bandwidth levels, influence GDP growth, or on the extent of spatial externalities at a regional level. Our study aims to assess the economic benefits of high-speed broadband networks within and across neighbouring counties in Germany. Utilizing a balanced panel dataset of 401 German counties with data from 2010-2015 as well as different panel estimation techniques, we find that the availability of high-speed broadband (which enables transfer rates of 50 Mbit/sec and higher) has a small but significant positive effect on regional GDP growth in the average German county, when compared to normal broadband availability. Furthermore, we find that broadband deployment in German counties induces substantial economic benefits in terms of direct effects and regional externalities. According to our main estimation results, an increase in bandwidth coverage of 50 Mbit/sec and higher by one percentage point induces arise in regional GDP of 0.05%. This effect is almost doubled if we also take regional externalities into account and is of particular relevance for urban counties. Furthermore, our cost-benefit analysis suggests substantial efficiency gains, as the total economic benefits of subsidy programs to encourage broadband expansion substantially exceeded their associated costs.
L98|The Impact of China’s Electricity Deregulation on Coal and Power Industries: Two-stage Game Modeling Approach|The regulated price mechanism in China’s power industry has attracted much criticism because of its incapability to optimize the allocation of resources. To build an “open, orderly, competitive and complete” power market system, the Chinese government launched an unprecedented marketization reform in 2015 to deregulate the electricity price. This paper examines the impact of the electricity price deregulation in the industry level. We first construct two-stage dynamic game models by taking the coal and coal-fired power industries as the players. Using the models, we compare analytically the equilibriums with and without electricity regulation, and examine the changes in electricity price, electricity generation, coal price and coal traded quantity. The theoretical analyses show that there are three intervals of the regulated electricity sales prices which influence the impact of electricity price deregulation. Next, we collect empirical data to estimate the parameters in the game models, and simulate the influence of electricity deregulation on the two industries in terms of market outcome and industrial profitability. Our results suggest that the actual regulated electricity price falls within the medium interval of the theoretical results, which means the price deregulation will result in higher electricity sales price but lower coal price, less coal traded amount and less electricity generation amount. The robustness analysis shows that our results hold with respect to the electricity generation efficiency and price elasticity of electricity demand.
L98|Evaluating regulatory reform of network industries: a survey of empirical models based on categorical proxies|Proxies for regulatory reforms based on categorical variables are increasingly used in empirical evaluation models. We surveyed 63 studies that rely on such indices to analyze the effects of entry liberalization, privatization, unbundling, and independent regulation of the electricity, natural gas, and telecommunications sectors. We highlight methodological issues related to the use of these proxies. Next, taking stock of the literature, we provide practical advice for the design of the empirical strategy and discuss the selection of control and instrumental variables to attenuate endogeneity problems undermining identification of the effects of regulatory reforms.
L98|Does state aid for broadband deployment in rural areas close the digital and economic divide?|We evaluate the impact of a major European state aid programme for speed upgrades in broadband internet availability applied to rural areas in the German state of Bavaria throughout 2010 and 2011. We use a matched difference-in-differences estimation strategy that compares treated and untreated municipalities that are balanced with respect to funding criteria. We find that aided municipalities have a significantly higher broadband coverage at higher speed than non-aided municipalities. This increase in broadband coverage does not, on average, benefit the local population in terms of increase in local jobs per resident or wages. However, these effects are heterogeneous across skill groups. Furthermore, we find positive effects on the employment rate among residents. Taking these results together suggests that an increase in broadband coverage through state aid protects rural areas from depopulation (while residents work at other locations), but does not contribute to a further closing of the economic divide in the form of creating new jobs.
L98|Redistribution through Income Taxation and Public Utility Pricing in the Presence of Energy Efficiency Considerations|Many OECD countries such as the USA, the UK or Switzerland are concerned with the affordability of utility services and the distributional consequences inherent in the pricing strategy of basic goods and services, such as electricity. However, the effectiveness of the electricity tariff as a redistribution device is questionable in the presence of a progressive income tax schedule. To shed light on this controversy, we structurally estimate a model that combines public utility pricing and income taxation. We employ a large panel data set on about 105,000 households in the Swiss Canton of Bern from 2008 to 2013, including detailed energy consumption and household income and tax payment characteristics. While the theoretical model predicts that electricity prices should be subsidised in the presence of purely income redistribution concerns, we find a positive mark-up of 49%, in our data. This suggests that, in practice, the government is concerned with energy conservation as well as income redistribution.

L98|Electricity market integration and the impact of unilateral policy reforms|We investigate the impact that two German energy reforms—phase-out of nuclear power plants after the Fukushima incident and expansion of renewables due to fixed feed-in tariffs—had on neighbouring countries’ consumers. The unilateral German reforms generated substantial negative and positive impacts, respectively, in neighbouring countries with the highest overall effect of German policy found in France, not Germany; an annual negative impact on consumers of €3.15 billion. We also find significant differences in market integration between neighbouring countries by calculating ratios between the estimated policy decisions’ impacts before and after controlling for interconnector congestion.
L98|Transport liberalization and regional imbalances with endogenous freight rates|This paper develops a tractable two-region New Economic Geography model with footloose capital and endogenous freight rates to investigate the welfare implications and long-run industry reallocation patterns triggered by transport liberalization. Two policy scenarios are considered: one where a unique tariff per route is imposed, independently of the direction of shipment, and one of complete deregulation. Carriers in fully deregulated transport markets are shown to charge higher markups in shipments towards the periphery. This pricing behavior counterbalances the welfare-decreasing agglomeration forces associated with lowering trade costs and ensures welfare gains in both region in the short and long run.
L98|“Major Reforms in Electricity Pricing: Evidence from a Quasi-Experiment”|The global energy mix is being redefined, and with it the power industry’s cost structure. In many countries, electricity-pricing systems are being revamped so as to guarantee fixed-cost recovery, often by raising the fixed charge of two-part tariff (TPT) schemes. However, consumer misperception of TPTs threatens to undermine the policy’s outcome and puts the sector’s much-needed transformation in jeopardy. We conduct a quasi-experiment with data from a major electricity price reform recently implemented in Spain and find robust evidence that consumers are failing to distinguish between fixed and marginal costs. As a result, the policy goal of cost recovery is not being achieved.
L98|Building a stronger and more integrated Europe|Europe’s economy is finally growing robustly. These positive developments provide an opportunity to renew efforts to meet the long-term challenges facing the European Union (EU). The EU’s record on reducing regional income disparities is mixed and this explains some of citizens’ discontent with the European project. Reforming cohesion policy by focusing spending more on items with long-term growth benefits and clear spillovers across borders, including human capital and infrastructure investment could further support income convergence. Higher co-funding rates and less burdensome administration of the cohesion and structural funds could encourage greater spending effectiveness. Sustained improvements in living standards are held back by weak productivity and investment in many countries. Reviving the single market project, by removing remaining barriers in services, energy, digital and transport can help to spur long-term growth. Deepening the single market and faster adoption of digital technologies will create new jobs but put at risk others, perhaps in lagging regions. The EU can help lagging regions catch up by reforming cohesion policy and facilitating firm creation through the removal of barriers across the single market. It can also support better those who lose out from globalisation and are displaced by technological change by making access to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund easier and broadening its scope not only to help workers displaced by globalisation or an economic crisis, but also due to other reasons such as automation. This Working Paper relates to the 2018 OECD Economic Survey of the European Union. (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-european-union-and-euro-area.htm)
L98|From Import Substitution to Integration into Global Production Networks: The Case of the Indian Automobile Industry|This paper examines the growth trajectory and the current state of the Indian automobile industry, paying attention to factors that underpinned its transition from import substitution to integration into global production networks. Market-conforming policies implemented by the government of India over the past 2 decades, which marked a clear departure from protectionist policies in the past, have been instrumental in transforming the Indian automobile industry in line with ongoing structural changes in the world automobile industry. India has emerged as a significant producer of compact cars within global automobile production networks. Compact cars exported from India have become competitive in the international market because of the economies of scale of producing for a large domestic market and product adaptation to suit domestic market conditions. Interestingly, there are no significant differences in prices of compact cars sold in domestic and foreign markets. This suggests that the hypothesis of â€œimport protection as export promotionâ€ does not hold for Indian automobile exports.

This study gives room for an assessment of the societal impact of an ongoing project in the energy sector in Cameroon.

L98|Measuring Long-Run Price Elasticities in Urban Travel Demand|This paper develops a structural model of urban travel to estimate long-run price elasticities. A dynamic discrete choice demand model with switching costs is estimated, using a panel dataset with public market-level data on automobile and public transit use for Chicago. The estimated model shows that long-run own- (automobile) and cross- (transit) price elasticities are more elastic than short-run elasticities, and that elasticity estimates from static and myopic models are downward biased. The estimated model is used to evaluate the response to a gasoline tax. Static and myopic models mismeasure long-run substitution patterns, and could lead to incorrect policy decisions.

L98|Incentive Regulation: Evidence From German Electricity Networks|We propose a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach to estimate the impact of incentives on cost reduction. We show theoretically, and estimate empirically, that German electricity distribution system operators (DSOs) pile up more costs in the year used to determine future prices when subject to a lower-powered regulation mechanism. The difference is particularly significant (about 10% of total cost) for firms in the upper quartile of the efficiency distribution, a pattern which is consistent with the pooling of types under the threat of ratcheting. In light of heterogeneous network reinforcement across DSOs due to local wind and solar power expansion, cost inflation will particularly hit already hard-struck DSOs’ customers.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L98|The Effects of German Wind and Solar Electricity on French Spot Price Volatility: An Empirical Investigation| We examine the relationship between German wind and solar electricity and French spot price volatility. Using hourly data, we find that French imports from Germany driven by German wind and solar electricity sometimes decrease, sometimes increase the volatility of French spot prices. These two opposing effects depend on the shape of the French supply function and on the French demand. We, therefore, estimate different coefficients for imports depending on different demand levels. We acknowledge the endogeneity problem in identifying these effects and employ instrumental variable techniques to circumvent this problem. Our results show the urgent need for further coordination of national energy policies in order to reduce the potential for negative spill over effects of nationally driven energy policies in neighbouring countries as European electricity markets are becoming more integrated.
L98|Mobile Phone Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study assesses how knowledge diffusion modulates the effect of the mobile phone on entrepreneurship in Sub-Saharan Africa with data for the period 2000-2012.The empirical evidence is based on interactive Generalised Method of Moments in which mobile phones are interacted with three knowledge diffusion variables, namely: education, internet penetration and scientific output. Ten variables of entrepreneurship are used. The following three main findings are established. First, the net effects from interacting mobile phones with the internet and scientific publications are negative whereas the corresponding net impact from the interaction between mobile phones and education is positive on the cost of doing business. Second, the mobile phone interacts with education (the internet) to have a positive (negative) net effect on the time needed to construct a warehouse whereas, the corresponding interaction with the internet yields a net negative effect on the time to enforce a contract. Third, there is a positive net effect from the interaction of mobile phones with education on the time to start a business. Given the construction of the education variable, the positive net effects from education are consistent with corresponding negative net effects from the other knowledge diffusion variables. The main policy implication is that mobile phone innovation (by means of internet penetration, scientific output and quality education) decreases constraints of entrepreneurship. Suggestions on how to boost these knowledge diffusion channels are discussed. Other practical and theoretical implications are also covered. To the best our knowledge, this is the first inquiry to assess the relevance of mobile phone innovation in entrepreneurship in Sub-Saharan Africa.
L98|The role of mobile phones in governance-driven technology exports in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study assesses how the mobile phone influences governance to improve information and communication technology (ICT) exports in Sub-Saharan Africa with data from 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments and three main governance concepts are used, namely: (i) institutional (comprising the rule of law and corruption-control); (ii) political (involving political stability/no violence and voice & accountability) and (iii) economic (including regulation quality and government effectiveness) governance. The following findings are established. First, there are positive net effects on ICT goods exports from independent interactions between mobile phones and â€˜political stabilityâ€™ â€˜voice and accountabilityâ€™ and corruption-control. Second, significant net effects are not apparent from independent interactions between mobile phones and government effectiveness, regulation quality and the rule of law. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
L98|Mobile Phone Innovation and Technology-driven Exports in Sub-Saharan Africa|The study investigates how education, scientific output and the internet complement mobile phone penetration to affect technology commodity exports in Sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments. The following main findings are established. First, the internet complements the mobile phone to boost technology goods exports. Second, the internet also complements the mobile phone to boost technology service exports. Third, positive marginal effects are apparent in the roles of educational quality and scientific output on technology goods exports and technology service exports respectively while negative marginal impacts are apparent in the roles of scientific output and educational quality on technology goods exports and technology service exports respectively. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.
L98|The Role of Mobile Phones in Governance-Driven Technology Exports in Sub-Saharan Africa|Abstract This study assesses how the mobile phone influences governance to improve information and communication technology (ICT) exports in sub-Saharan Africa with data from 2000 to 2012. The empirical evidence is based on the generalised method of moments and three main governance concepts are used, namely (i) institutional (comprising the rule of law and corruption control), (ii) political (involving political stability/no violence and voice and accountability) and (iii) economic (including regulation quality and government effectiveness) governance. The following findings are established. First, there are positive net effects on ICT goods exports from independent interactions between mobile phones and ‘political stability’, ‘voice and accountability’ and corruption control. Second, significant net effects are not apparent from independent interactions between mobile phones and government effectiveness, regulation quality and the rule of law. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
L98|The Empirics of Regulatory Reforms Proxied by Categorical Variables: Recent Findings and Methodological Issues|Some regulatory reforms do not change just a specific signal that can be represented by a quantitative continuous variable, such as a tax rate, a price cap, or an emission threshold. The standard theory of reform in applied welfare economics (going back to contributions by e.g. Ramsey, Samuelson and Guesnerie) asks the question: What is the marginal effect on social welfare of changing a policy signal? However, reforms such as privatization, unbundling or liberalization of network industries are often described by ‘packages’ shifting a policy framework. It is increasingly frequent in the empirical evaluation of such reforms to use categorical variables, often in polytomous form, for instance describing unbundling steps (vertical integration, accounting, functional, legal, ownership separation) on a discrete numerical scale, such as those proposed by the OECD and other international bodies. We review recent econometric literature evaluating regulatory reforms using such variables (40 papers) and we discuss some methodological issues arising in this context.
L98|Revisiting the Effect of Crude Oil Price Movements on US Stock Market Returns and Volatility|From mid-2014 to 2016, oil prices plunged rapidly causing significant volatility in the US and global equity markets. This change in crude oil prices occurred after a significant run up in oil prices three to four years earlier. Each change in the growth trajectory of oil prices affects stock market returns. How and why do oil price shocks affect the expected stock market returns among key sectors of the economy? This paper explores this issue by examining how the magnitude of crude oil price changes affect the stock market returns and variances of key producing, banking and consuming segments of the US economy. Our findings provide some explanations for the asymmetric responses to positive and negative oil shocks found in these key sectors of the economy.
L98|Effect of Utility Deregulation and Mergers on Consumer Welfare|In the late 1990s, many U.S. states deregulated electric utilities, allowing for competition among power generators. Deregulated states then adopted a retail choice program, allowing customers to choose their power provider. In addition, a significant merger wave among large utility companies ensued after deregulation. What was the impact of these changes on consumer welfare? While this issue has been widely studied, the results remain ambiguous. This study examines the effects of these events, by analyzing electricity price and output changes among deregulated and regulated states from 2001 through 2014. The study finds that deregulation may have had a positive effect when states adopted certain measures, such as retail choice or fuel changes, that enhanced competition and lowered costs
L98|A Social Cost Benefit Analysis of Grid-Scale Electrical Energy Storage Projects: Evaluating the Smarter Network Storage Project|This study explores and quantifies the social costs and benefits of grid-scale electrical energy storage (EES) projects in Great Britain. The case study for this report is the Smarter Network Storage project, a 6 MW/10MWh lithium battery placed at the Leighton Buzzard Primary substation to meet growing local peak demand requirements. This study analyses both the locational and system-wide benefits to grid-scale EES, determines the realistic combination of those social benefits, and juxtaposes them against the social costs across the lifecycle of the battery to determine the techno-economic performance. Risk and uncertainty from the benefit streams, cost elements, battery lifespan, and discount rate are incorporated into a Monte Carlo simulation. Using this framework, society can be guided to cost-effectively invest in EES as a grid modernization asset to facilitate the transition to a reliable, affordable, and clean power system.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

L98|Welfare and Redistribution in Residential Electricity Markets with Solar Power|An increasing number of households installing solar panels raises two challenges for regulators: network financing and vertical equity. We propose an optimal tariff design for policymakers to incentivise solar panel adoptions, while guaranteeing the sustainability and equitable distribution of network costs. We estimate structural models of energy demand and solar panel adoption, using a unique matched dataset on energy consumption, income, wealth, solar panel installations, and building characteristics for 135,000 households in the Canton of Bern (Switzerland) in 2008-2013. Our counterfactuals recommend the optimal solar panel installation cost subsidies and optimal tariffs to achieve various solar energy targets.
L98|Productive Efficiency and Ownership When Market Restructuring Affects Production Technologies|While the link between the ownership and productive efficiency of firms has been discussed extensively, no consensus exists regarding the superiority of one or the other in non-competitive, regulated environments. This paper applies a flexibleproduction model to test for efficiency differences associated with ownership types while allowing the production to adapt to market restructuring over time. Our empirical setting is based on a new, rich micro dataset of electricity distribution firms operating between 2006 and 2012 in Germany, where the energy transition enforces the adjustment of energy infrastructure. First, our results show that electricity distribution system operators adapted their production technologies over time. Second, there is no empirical evidence that public firms operated any less efficiently than private firms. The empirical findings are relevant to the (re)municipalization debate, which appears to have exaggerated the dichotomy between public and private utilities’ efficiency.
L98|The Impact of Competition Policy Enforcement on the Functioning of EU Energy Markets|We investigate the impact of competition policy enforcement on the functioning of European energy markets while accounting for sectoral regulation. For this purpose, we compile a novel dataset on the European Commission's (EC) and EU member states' competition policy decisions in energy markets and combine it with firm- and sector-level data. We find that EC merger policy has a positive and robust impact on (i) the level of competition, (ii) investment and (iii) productivity. This impact, however, only shows up in low-regulated sectors. Other competition policy tools - EC state aid control and anti-trust, as well as all member state policy variables - do not have a uniform effect on energy markets. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the EC's merger policy actions have been used to overcome obstacles to a well-functioning EU energy sector and may have contributed to the overall development of gas and electricity markets in Europe.
L98|Quasi-fiscal deficits in the electricity sector of the Middle East and North Africa : sources and size|The annual electricity investments needed in the Middle East and North Africa region to keep up with demand have been estimated at about 3 percent of the region's projected gross domestic product. However, in most economies of the region, the ability to make those investments is limited by fiscal and macroeconomic constraints. This paper demonstrates that the solution is readily available: by improving the management and performance of the region's utilities, more than enough resources could be freed up to make the investments needed. The paper presents the first evaluation of the size and composition of the quasi-fiscal deficit associated with the management of the electricity sector in 14 economies in the Middle East and North Africa region. The estimations are for 2013. They show that the average quasi-fiscal deficit is 4.4 percent of gross domestic product (but goes down to 2.9 percent if Lebanon, Djibouti, Bahrain, and Jordan are excluded). Only five economies have a quasi-fiscal deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Qatar, and the West Bank), and hence would not be able to finance the average investment requirement through elimination of inefficiencies. For most economies, the main driver of the quasi-fiscal deficit is the underpricing of electricity, which costs on average 3.2 percent of gross domestic product (but 2.2 percent without Lebanon, Djibouti, Bahrain, and Jordan). Commercial inefficiency comes next, at an average cost of 0.6 percent of gross domestic product. Technical and labor inefficiencies represent, respectively, 0.4 and 0.2 percent of gross domestic product.
L98|Understanding How the Strategic Similarities between Energy Companies Influence the Post-mergers and Acquisitions Performances|The energy sector has experienced rapid evolution in recent years, following the liberalization of the electricity and natural gas markets, driven by the European Union. These developments have led to a certain level of dynamism in Italy, particularly as concerns mergers and acquisitions (M&As) within the sector. This article examines the influence of strategic similarities between the target and bidder companies on their post-M&A performances. The model used involves a hierarchical regression relating the indexes of similarity between the merging companies, regarding their economic-financial management. The results reveal the influence of the strategic similarities and differences on the post-M&A performances of the companies, showing how the positive or negative effect depends on certain characteristics, such as their structure of share capital, business segments and size. The study evidences the strategic variables that should be considered in choosing the optimal target companies.
L98|Efficiency and environmental impacts of electricity restructuring on coal-fired power plants|We investigate the efficiency and environmental impacts of electricity market restructuring by examining changes in fuel efficiency, cost of coal purchases, and utilization among coal-fired power plants based on a panel data set from 1991 to 2005. Our study focuses exclusively on coal-fired power plants and uses panel data covering several years after implementation of restructuring. The estimation compares how investor-owned (IOs) plants in states with restructuring changed their behavior relative to IOs in states without. Our analysis finds that restructuring led to: (1) a 1.4 percent improvement in fuel efficiency, (2) an 8 percent decrease in unit cost of heat input, and (3) a lower capacity factor even after adjusting for cross-plant generation re-allocation due to cost reductions. The estimates imply that restructuring has led to nearly 15 percent savings in operating expenses and up to 7.5 percent emissions reduction among these plants.
L98|Platform intermediation to sponsor alternative fuel vehicles|Many governments promote green technological innovation within the automobile sector as a means of combating climate change. Most of these innovations are driven by alternative fuels. Subsidies for buyers and governmental investment in service infrastructure are widely used. This paper investigates the question of efficient market intervention by considering the two-sided market character of the automobile market. This study shows that network effects, competitive effects triggered by an increase in automobile users, decreasing marginal utilities of additional service stations and, in the case of governmental support, environmental externalities determine the welfare-efficient extent of platform intermediation. Regarding green technologies, the results of the analysis indicate that governmental promotion of service infrastructure is reasonable, although governments should be cautious about subsidizing buyers. Intervention in favor of dirty technologies is rarely justifiable.
L98|A Social Cost Benefit Analysis of Grid-Scale Electrical Energy Storage Projects: Evaluating the Smarter Network Storage Project|This study explores and quantifies the social costs and benefits of grid-scale electrical energy storage (EES) projects in Great Britain. The case study for this report is the Smarter Network Storage project, a 6 MW/10MWh lithium battery placed at the Leighton Buzzard Primary substation to meet growing local peak demand requirements. This study analyses both the locational and system-wide benefits to grid-scale EES, determines the realistic combination of those social benefits, and juxtaposes them against the social costs across the lifecycle of the battery to determine the techno-economic performance. Risk and uncertainty from the benefit streams, cost elements, battery lifespan, and discount rate are incorporated into a Monte Carlo simulation. Using this framework, society can be guided to cost-effectively invest in EES as a grid modernization asset to facilitate the transition to a reliable, affordable, and clean power system.
L98|The Empirics of Regulatory Reforms Proxied by Categorical Variables: Recent Findings and Methodological Issues| Some regulatory reforms do not change just a specific signal that can be represented by a quantitative continuous variable, such as a tax rate, a price cap, or an emission threshold. The standard theory of reform in applied welfare economics (going back to contributions by e.g. Ramsey, Samuelson and Guesnerie) asks the question: What is the marginal effect on social welfare of changing a policy signal? However, reforms such as privatization, unbundling or liberalization of network industries are often described by ‘packages’ shifting a policy framework. It is increasingly frequent in the empirical evaluation of such reforms to use categorical variables, often in polytomous form, for instance describing unbundling steps (vertical integration, accounting, functional, legal, ownership separation) on a discrete numerical scale, such as those proposed by the OECD and other international bodies. We review recent econometric literature evaluating regulatory reforms using such variables (40 papers) and we discuss some methodological issues arising in this context.
L98|The impact of state aid on the survival and financial viability of aided firms|We estimate the causal impact of restructuring aid granted by the European Commission between 2000 and 2012 on the survival and financial viability of aided firms. Using a comprehensive dataset we find that restructuring aid decreases the hazard rate of a market exit by 58–68% and increases firms’ average survival time by 8–15 years, depending on the definition of firm survival. We also find that aid receiving firms have a significantly higher probability to improve their financial viability than the counterfactual group in the longer run.
L98|Public Transport Authorities’ use of Cost-Benefit Analysis in practice|Given the Swedish national goals for transport and infrastructure, economic efficiency is essential also in public transport. In 2003, Ljungberg (2007) sought to answer to which extent PTAs use Cost-Benefit analyses (CBA), a methodology to assess economic efficiency, in their planning of operations and infrastructure. It was found that CBA was seldom used. This paper tries to answer the same question, but for year 2016. The aim of this paper is to see to what extent PTAs are using CBA at the time of the survey, and investigate whether there are any changes with the previous study.
L98|Integration of DERs on power systems: challenges and opportunities|The integration of large amounts of distributed energy resources (DERs) as photovoltaic solar generation, micro-cogeneration, electric vehicles, distributed storage or demand response pose new challenges and opportunities on the power sector. In this paper, we review the current trends on: i) how consumers adopting DERs can self-provide energy services and provide other services at system level, ii) what can be expected at distribution networks and how retail markets will evolve with more proactive and market engaged consumers, iii) what are the effects and integration of DERs on wholesale markets, and iv) what are the challenges that DERs pose on cybersecurity and the opportunities for improving system resilience. Several recommendations are given for achieving an efficient integration of DERs. For instance, the design of a comprehensive system of prices and charges and the elimination of existing barriers for market participation are crucial reforms to achieve a level playing field between distributed and centralized resources when providing electricity services. This paper summarizes part of the work developed under the MIT Utility of the Future study.
L98|Infrastructure Investment, Labor Productivity, and International Competitiveness: The Case of Portugal|This study analyzes the effects of infrastructure investment on labor productivity at the industry level using a newly developed data set for infrastructure investments in Portugal. We consider twenty-two sectors and twelve infrastructure assets. We focus on the differential effects on traded and non-traded sectors. We find, first, that investment in national roads have positive effects, particularly large for public services, while the effects of investments in municipal roads are mixed, and investments in highways have mostly benefited the non-traded sectors. Second, we find that railroad investments, and to a lesser extent airports have clearly biased labor productivity gains toward the non-traded sectors, while the effects of port investments are more muted and mixed. Third, for social infrastructure investments, the effects tend to be large and again particularly favorable to the non-traded sectors. Fourth, for public utilities the effects are in general small, with the exception of investments in telecommunications, which have large positive effects mainly on non-traded sectors. We conclude that infrastructure investments have contributed to the growth of labor productivity in Portugal but have done so in a way that has benefitted mostly non-traded goods sectors. This may be a matter of concern for a small open economy in a currency union and with a development model greatly reliant on exports.
L98|Why Virtuous Supply-Side Effects and Irrelevant Keynesian Effects are not Foregone Conclusions: What we Learn from an Industry-Level Analysis of Infrastructure Investments in Portugal|We use the industry-specific effects of twelve different infrastructure investments in Portugal to inform about the mechanisms through which such investments affect economic activity. Our main findings are as follows. First, demand-side effects that are approximated by adding the short-term and long-term construction effects are very important. They are over 60% of total effects for airport investments, ports, refineries, and water, and over 45% for national roads, municipal roads, telecommunications, health and education. Second, site-location effects that are approximated by real-estate effects are also very significant, in particular for national roads, highways and railroads, with 30%, 35% and 64% of the total effects, respectively. They are negative for water and electricity, and zero for municipal roads, airports, and refineries, and negligible for ports, i.e., all these are cases in which we would expect adverse or small location effects. Third, the functional channel relating to internationally-traded goods, approximated by the effects on the primary sector, on manufacturing, and on transportation, is much less significant, although we estimate meaningful effects on heavy industry from investments in all types of road infrastructures, ports, health, and education, as well as on light industry from ports. Fourth, a functional effect affecting non-traded industries, mostly private and public services is much more relevant. It accounts for more than 30% of the effects in the cases of municipal roads, airports, and refineries, and in excess of 20% for highways, railroads, telecommunications, health and education. The fact that most functional effects accrue to non-traded industries is likely to affect international competitiveness adversely. Naturally, these results cannot be automatically generalized, as the nature of the effects of infrastructure investments crucially depends on the level of development of the country in question, on the maturity of its existent infrastructure systems, and on the rigor of all decisions pertaining to infrastructure investment. Nevertheless, they establish that, as infrastructure investments are concerned, the dominance of virtuous supply side effects is not a foregone conclusion and, conversely, the relevance of Keynesian effects cannot be dismissed.
L98|Infrastructure Investment in Portugal and the Traded/Non-Traded Industry Mix|Using a newly-developed data set for Portugal, we analyze the industry-level effects of infrastructure investment. Focusing on the divide between traded and non-traded industries, we find that infrastructure investments have a non-traded bias, as these shift the industry mix towards private and public services. We also find that the industries that benefit the most in relative terms are all non-traded: construction, trade, and real estate, among the private services, and education and health, amongst the public services. Similarly, emerging trading sectors, such as hospitality and professional services stand to gain. The positive impacts on traded industries are too small to make a difference. These results highlight that infrastructure-based strategies are not neutral in terms of the industry mix. Moreover, with most of the benefits accruing to non-traded industries, such a development model that is heavily based on domestic demand may be unsustainable in light of Portugal’s current foreign account position
L98|Health Care Investments and Economic Performance in Portugal: An Industry Level Analysis|We analyze how public and private health care investments affect economic performance in Portugal. With a newly-developed data set for twenty-two industries, we use a vector autoregressive model to estimate the elasticities and marginal products on investment, employment and output. First, every €1 million invested in health care yields significant positive spillover effects, boosting investment and GDP by €24.74 and €20.45 million, respectively, and creating 188 net jobs. Adversely, net exports deteriorate, as most of the new capital goods are imported. Second, while only 28.2% of the total accumulated increase in GDP occurs within a year, investment is front-loaded with a corresponding 73.8%. Over this period, 68 workers are displaced for every €1 million invested. Third, at a disaggregated level, real estate, construction, and transportation and storage are the three industries where output shares increase the most. Employment shares increase the most in professional services, construction, and basic metals. These results have important policy implications. Health investments enhance long-term performance, but are unhelpful counter-cyclically. Also, they will change the industry mix: construction and professional services are the non-traded industries that will benefit the most, while the traded industries of non-metallic minerals, basic metals, and machinery and equipment benefit much less.
L98|The Political-Economy Implications of the Transition from State-Owned to Mixed-Owned Enterprises: Evidence from the European Gas Sector|This paper analyses how the transition from State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to Mixed- Owned Enterprises (MOEs) in the European gas sector affected the European states’ ability to pursue public policy objectives. More specifically, the analysis focuses on the extent to which public and private interests can be reconciled within MOEs’ strategy. The paper suggests that the rise of profitability as the central objective for MOEs has prevented states from pursuing some, though not all, of the policy objectives that they could pursue before the transition. For example, states can no more pursue large-scale plans of economic and technological development through MOEs, or ensure consumers’ price affordability irrespective of market fluctuations. However, states may still be able to positively contribute to energy security thanks to the major shares held in MOEs, for instance by vetoing divestment from import infrastructure. The analysis suggests the need for states to devise alternative ways to pursue their objectives in the framework of national and European energy policy.
L98|Cost of Service Regulation in U.S. Health Care: Minimum Medical Loss Ratios|A health insurer's Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) is the share of premiums spent on medical claims. The Affordable Care Act introduced minimum MLR provisions for all health insurance sold in fully-insured commercial markets, thereby capping insurer profit margins, but not levels. While intended to reduce premiums, we show this rule creates incentives analogous to cost of service regulation. Using variation created by the rule's introduction as a natural experiment, we find claims costs rose nearly one-for-one with distance below the regulatory threshold: 7% in the individual market, and 2% in the group market. Premiums were unaffected.
L98|Patent Examiner Specialization|We study the matching of patent applications to examiners at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Using test statistics originally developed to identify industry agglomeration, we find strong evidence that examiners specialize in particular technologies, even within relatively homogeneous art units. Examiner specialization is more pronounced in the biotechnology and chemistry fields, and less in computers and software. Evidence of specialization becomes weaker, but does not completely disappear, if we condition on technology sub-classes. There is no evidence that certain examiners specialize in applications that have greater importance or broader claims. More specialized examiners have a lower grant rate and produce a larger narrowing of claim-scope during the examination process. We discuss implications for instrumental variables based on examiner characteristics.
L98|Is Occupational Licensing a Barrier to Interstate Migration?|Occupational licensure, one of the most significant labor market regulations in the United States, may restrict the interstate movement of workers. We analyze the interstate migration of 22 licensed occupations. Using an empirical strategy that controls for unobservable characteristics that drive long-distance moves, we find that the between-state migration rate for individuals in occupations with state-specific licensing exam requirements is 36 percent lower relative to members of other occupations. Members of licensed occupations with national licensing exams show no evidence of limited interstate migration. The size of this effect varies across occupations and appears to be tied to the state specificity of licensing requirements. We also provide evidence that the adoption of reciprocity agreements, which lower re-licensure costs, increases the interstate migration rate of lawyers. Based on our results, we estimate that the rise in occupational licensing can explain part of the documented decline in interstate migration and job transitions in the United States.
L98|Mobile Phone Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study assesses how knowledge diffusion modulates the effect of the mobile phone on entrepreneurship in Sub-Saharan Africa with data for the period 2000-2012.The empirical evidence is based on interactive Generalised Method of Moments in which mobile phones are interacted with three knowledge diffusion variables, namely: education, internet penetration and scientific output. Ten variables of entrepreneurship are used. The following three main findings are established. First, the net effects from interacting mobile phones with the internet and scientific publications are negative whereas the corresponding net impact from the interaction between mobile phones and education is positive on the cost of doing business. Second, the mobile phone interacts with education (the internet) to have a positive (negative) net effect on the time needed to construct a warehouse whereas, the corresponding interaction with the internet yields a net negative effect on the time to enforce a contract. Third, there is a positive net effect from the interaction of mobile phones with education on the time to start a business. Given the construction of the education variable, the positive net effects from education are consistent with corresponding negative net effects from the other knowledge diffusion variables. The main policy implication is that mobile phone innovation (by means of internet penetration, scientific output and quality education) decreases constraints of entrepreneurship. Suggestions on how to boost these knowledge diffusion channels are discussed. Other practical and theoretical implications are also covered. To the best our knowledge, this is the first inquiry to assess the relevance of mobile phone innovation in entrepreneurship in Sub-Saharan Africa.
L98|The role of direct flights in trade costs|Abstract Effects of direct flights on trade costs are investigated using micro price data at the city level. After controlling for local retail/distribution costs, traded input prices are obtained to be further used in the measurement of trade costs across cities through arbitrage conditions. The existence of a direct flight enters trade costs regressions negatively and significantly. The results are shown to be robust to the consideration of many control variables, nonlinearities in the effects of distance on trade costs, possible endogeneity of having direct flights between cities and alternative definitions of the data. The direct flights that are shown to be determined by bilateral air services agreements are further shown to reduce trade costs through an endogeneity analysis; the main policy implications are twofold: (i) international trade policies through aviation services, such as Open Skies Agreements of the US, are alternative trade policy tools to reduce international trade barriers; (ii) direct flights facilitate the integration of internal markets as in the case of European Union.

L98|In the Shadow of a Giant: Medicare’s Influence on Private Physician Payments|We analyze Medicare’s influence on private insurers’ payments for physicians’ services. Using a large administrative change in reimbursements for surgical versus medical care, we find that private prices follow Medicare’s lead. A $1.00 increase in Medicare’s fees increases corresponding private prices by $1.16. A second set of Medicare fee changes, which generates area-specific payment shocks, has a similar effect on private reimbursements. Medicare’s influence is strongest in areas with concentrated insurers and competitive physician markets, consistent with insurer-doctor bargaining. By echoing Medicare’s pricing changes, these payment spillovers amplify Medicare’s impact on specialty choice and other welfare-relevant aspects of physician practices.
L98|Quasi-fiscal Deficits in the Electricity Sector of the Middle East and North Africa: Sources and Size|The annual electricity investments needed in the Middle East and North Africa region to keep up with demand have been estimated at about 3 percent of the region’s projected gross domestic product. However, in most economies of the region, the ability to make those investments is limited by fiscal and macroeconomic constraints. This paper demonstrates that the solution is readily available: by improving the management and performance of the region’s utilities, more than enough resources could be freed up to make the investments needed. The paper presents the first evaluation of the size and composition of the quasi-fiscal deficit associated with the management of the electricity sector in 14 economies in the Middle East and North Africa region. The estimations are for 2013. They show that the average quasi-fiscal deficit is 4.4 percent of gross domestic product (but goes down to 2.9 percent if Lebanon, Djibouti, Bahrain, and Jordan are excluded). Only five economies have a quasi-fiscal deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Qatar, and the West Bank), and hence would not be able to finance the average investment requirement through elimination of inefficiencies. For most economies, the main driver of the quasi-fiscal deficit is the underpricing of electricity, which costs on average 3.2 percent of gross domestic product (but 2.2 percent without Lebanon, Djibouti, Bahrain, and Jordan). Commercial inefficiency comes next, at an average cost of 0.6 percent of gross domestic product. Technical and labor inefficiencies represent, respectively, 0.4 and 0.2 percent of gross domestic product.
L98|US Open Skies Agreements and Unlevel Playing Fields|We examine the relationship between â€˜Open Skiesâ€™ agreements (OSAs) signed between the USA and various countries or regions on these markets and the absence of a so called â€˜level playing fieldâ€™; i.e. the existence of subsidies and other forms of protection that advantage one nationâ€™s airlines over those of co-signatories to an OSA. We argue that under an oligopoly market structure, strategic competition brought about by OSAs creates incentives to subsidize and/or protect domestic airlines. Such incentives are maintained or amplified by political lobbying efforts that bias civil aviation policies towards producer interests over wider measures of economic welfare. We report on financial aid and policies which have co-evolved along with OSAs and which have advantaged US airlines during the OSA period and which suggest that unlevel playing fields have been perpetuated and possibly made more unlevel during the era of OSAs.
L98|One vs. Two Instruments for Redistribution: The Case of Public Utility Pricing|We use data on 180,000 households in the Swiss Canton of Bern and the years 2008-2013 to analyse whether one instrument (the income tax) vs. two instruments (income tax and public utility pricing) are adequate for income redistribution. The results of our structural estimation show that under certai assumptions there is a role for redistribution through public good pricing markups and hence with two instruments being adequate for redistribution.
L98|Disruptive Change in the Taxi Business: The Case of Uber|In most cities, the taxi industry is highly regulated and has restricted entry. Ride sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, which use mobile internet technology to connect passengers and drivers, have begun to compete with traditional taxis. This paper examines the efficiency of ride sharing services vis-a-vis taxis. In most cities with data available, UberX drivers spend a significantly higher fraction of their time, and drive a substantially higher share of miles, with a passenger in their car than do taxi drivers. Reasons for this efficiency advantage are explored.
L98|Appliance Ownership and Aspirations among Electric Grid and Home Solar Households in Rural Kenya|"In Sub-Saharan Africa, there are active debates about whether increases in energy access should be driven by investments in electric grid infrastructure or small-scale ""home solar"" systems (e.g., solar lanterns and solar home systems). We summarize the results of a household electrical appliance survey and describe how households in rural Kenya differ in terms of appliance ownership and aspirations. Our data suggest that home solar is not a substitute for grid power. Furthermore, the environmental advantages of home solar are likely to be relatively small in countries like Kenya, where grid power is primarily derived from non-fossil fuel sources."
L98|Market Impacts of a Nuclear Power Plant Closure|Falling revenues and rising costs have put US nuclear plants in financial trouble, and some threaten to close. To understand the potential private and social consequences, we examine the abrupt closure of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) in 2012. Using a novel econometric approach, we show that the lost generation from SONGS was met largely by increased in-state natural gas generation. In the twelve months following the closure, natural gas generation costs increased by $350 million. The closure also created binding transmission constraints, causing short-run inefficiencies and potentially making it more profitable for certain plants to act noncompetitively.

L98|Mobile phones, institutional quality and entrepreneurship in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study investigates whether mobile phone penetration modulates the effect of different indicators of governance on some indicators of the ease of doing business in Sub-Saharan Africa with data from the period 2000–2012 by employing the Generalised Method of Moments. Three broad concepts of governance are explored: (i) political (comprising voice & accountability and political stability/no violence), (ii) economic (involving government effectiveness and regulation quality) and (iii) institutional (including corruption-control and rule of law). Ten dimensions of entrepreneurship are considered. Two main findings are established with respect to the net effects of the interaction between mobile phones and governance dynamics. They are (1) reduced cost of business start-up procedure, the time to build a warehouse and the time to resolve an insolvency and (2) increased time to enforce a contract, to register a property and to prepare and pay taxes. Implications for theory and policy are discussed. Some of the engaged policy implications include the following. (i) Measures on how to leverage on the potential of mobile phone penetration for entrepreneurship opportunities by addressing challenge of access to and affordability of mobile phones on the one hand and on the other hand, improving on the role of the mobile phone as a participative interface between emerging entrepreneurs and governance. (ii) The relevance of the mobile phone in mitigating information asymmetry between entrepreneurs and government institutions, notably by: reducing government inefficiency (which potentially represents an additional cost to doing business) and decreasing informational rents, bureaucracy and transaction costs.
L98|Drivers and Impacts of Renewable Portfolio Standards|Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPSs) are a key policy measure used by states in the United States to increase their production of renewable electricity. Economic theory shows that RPSs are not first-best policy measures for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions or solving other environmental problems. Nevertheless, they have been politically popular, in part because states hope they will help create new jobs in what the states expect will be a growth industry. Research suggests that RPSs are supported by Democratic legislatures in states with good solar and wind potential, are more likely in states with restructured electricity markets, and are less likely in states heavily dependent on natural gas for electricity generation. Research also suggests that RPSs have been successful at increasing renewable generation capacity, have increased the cost of electricity modestly where they have been implemented, and reduce carbon emissions at a cost roughly consistent with estimates of the social cost of carbon.
L98|Have Renewable Portfolio Standards Raised Electricity Rates? Evidence From U.S. Electric Utilities|" type=""main"" xml:id=""coep12110-abs-0001""> Using a panel dataset of U.S. electric utilities, we investigate the effect of a Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) on the rates of electric utilities affected by the mandate. Our findings are twofold. First, we find that, on average, electric utilities affected by an RPS mandate charged a higher electricity rate. This would suggest that an RPS mandate is a costly constraint on the utilities that have to comply with the requirement. The second finding of our analysis is that marginal increases in a utility's RPS requirement do not necessarily translate into higher electricity rates. This would imply that the costs imposed on utilities affected by the RPS mandate tend to be fixed costs rather than variable costs. We also find that controlling for time-varying unobserved factors at the state level is key to identifying the RPS effect on electricity retail rates. (JEL Q42, Q48, L98)"
L98|Overcoming barriers to electrical energy storage: Comparing California and Europe|Multiple market drivers suggest that electrical energy storage (EES) systems are going to be essential for future power systems within the next decade. However, the deployment of the technology is proceeding at very different rates around the world. Whereas the sector is progressing quickly in California, it is not gaining much traction, so far, in Europe. This research aims to clarify why the prospects for energy storage in Europe are not as good as they are in California. The market and regulatory framework in California and Europe are analysed critically, and changes to overcome the main barriers are recommended. The research shows that the main barriers are: inadequate definition and classification of EES in legislation; lack of markets for some ancillary services; inadequate market design that benefits traditional technologies; and the lack of need for EES in some jurisdictions. The prospects are better in California because regulation is more advanced and favourable for the technology, and regulators are collaborating with developers and utilities to analyse barriers and solutions for the technology. In Europe, there is a need to clarify the definition of EES, create new markets for ancillary services, design technology-neutral market rules and study more deeply the necessity of EES.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L98|Flexible Mixed Logit with Posterior Analysis: Exploring Willingness-to-Pay for Grid Resilience|This paper presents and employs an alternative approach to explore consumer preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for resilience of the electricity grid. The methodological and practical relevance of this approach is demonstrated using the example of the UKs incentive regulation scheme for electricity distribution network operators (DNOs). The estimation strategy exibly accounts for preference heterogeneity in the population, allows for scale heterogeneity (i.e. heterogeneity in the randomness of choice) and exploits individual posterior distributions to improve the estimates. Since the results suggest significant parameter heterogeneity within and across DNOs, it is argued that Ofgem's current method to evaluate consumer preferences and WTP is likely to result in an inefficient level of resilience services. The welfare implications in case of public and private goods and services are discussed. The suggested approach is straightforward to implement, could improve policy evaluations and foster more nuanced and efficient incentive regulation.

L98|Un modelo Casi Ideal de Demanda de Combustibles para la Industria de Transporte|Abstract: This article presents an Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) for different types of fuels in Colombia, focusing specifically on the transport industry. Estimates of price, expenditure and cross elasticities are computed using a Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) model and based on 10 years observations (2003-2012). Results show that diesel and regular gas behave as inelastic goods while natural gas is more elastic. Also, diesel fuels and natural gas seem to behave as substitutes while there’s a complementary relation among the others (regular gas-Diesel; regular fuels-Natural Gas). Regarding the expenditures elasticities, this paper concludes that regular gas and diesel behave as normal goods while natural gas seems be an inferior type of fuel for the transport sector. Resumen: Este paper utilizando el Modelo Casi Ideal de Demanda (AIDS) por medio de ecuaciones aparentemente no relacionadas para la industria de combustibles en el sector transporte en Colombia, analiza las elasticidades precio de la demanda, precio cruzada de la demanda y gasto de la demanda de la Gasolina motor, Diesel y Gas Natural Vehicular (GNV), dada la recomposición que ha presentado esta industria entre el 2003 y 2012, con el objetivo de determinar si estos combustibles se comportan como sustitutos o complementarios y se trata de bienes necesarios o no. Los principales resultados indican que la elasticidad precio de la demanda de la Gasolina y el Diesel son bienes inelásticos, mientras que el GNV se comporta como un bien elástico. Por su parte, por medio de la elasticidad precio cruzada de la demanda, se encuentra que solo el Diesel y el GNV se comportan como bienes sustitutos, mientras que para el resto de relaciones (Gasolina-Diesel y Gasolina-GNV) se observa un comportamiento de complementariedad. Además desde la elasticidad gasto de la demanda se encontró que la Gasolina y el Diesel se comportan como bienes normales, mientras que el GNV resulta ser un bien inferior.
L98|Competitividad en el transporte aéreo en Colombia|En este trabajo se analiza la competitividad del sector del transporte aéreo en Colombia. Para ello se estudia la situación actual, la política pública, el marco institucional, las inversiones públicas y privadas en los últimos veinte años, la cadena de los servicios aeronáuticos, las concesiones aeroportuarias y los factores determinantes de la competitividad de los aeropuertos colombianos. La eficiencia de los aeropuertos es central para lograr altos estándares de la operación aérea y de la competitividad del país. Se calcula entonces una frontera de eficiencia técnica para 22 aeropuertos colombianos usando el método del Análisis envolvente de datos (Data Envelopment Analysis, DEA) y se obtiene un ranquin de aeropuertos. Mediante un modelo de regresión truncada se identifican los factores que explican las diferencias en la eficiencia técnica entre los aeropuertos analizados. De otra parte, la competitividad de los aeropuertos del país se examina bajo dos ópticas: por un lado, con la metodología de la ventaja competitiva (Michael Porter, Índice de Competitividad del Foro Económico Mundial), se construye aquí un índice de Competitividad Aeroportuaria; por otro lado, se examina la incidencia de los costos que los aeropuertos en la competitividad del servicio aéreo. Se concluye que el marco regulatorio e institucional del transporte aéreo ha mejorado pero subsisten problemas de coordinación y cargas regulatorias redundantes para las aerolíneas; aunque las inversiones en infraestructura y tecnología (de tierra y aire) han aumentado de manera sustancial y el modelo de concesión ha sido exitoso, hace falta articular la política sectorial con una visión estratégica del transporte aéreo, como ingrediente central de la competitividad; los aeropuertos concesionados tienen un importante espacio de mejora en cuanto a la reducción de los costos de los servicios no regulados y el desarrollo de nuevos servicios aeroportuarios y, por último, los aeropuertos colombianos, con excepción de ElDorado, comparados con los de la región latinoamericana y con Miami, son relativamente más costosos. Se recomiendan varias acciones: formular una estrategia para la competitividad del sector; fortalecer aún más a la AEROCIVIL en cuanto al tamaño y calidad de su planta de personal; resolver el vacío que existe en cuanto a la regulación del sector en términos de la solución de las fallas del mercado y la fijación de tarifas en los segmentos donde no hay competencia; para ello, habría que poner a operar la Comisión de Regulación de la Infraestructura y Transporte; revisar la metodología para fijar las cargas regulatorias y su proporcionalidad; mejorar la disponibilidad de la información sobre la calidad y la capacidad aeroportuaria del país, así como de los costos de los servicios; definir de manera clara las competencias de las entidades que supervisan y regulan el sector; y, por último, avanzar en el diseño de los contratos de concesión, incorporando lecciones aprendidas, de manera que mejore el enforcement de los contratos y se reduzcan los costos de transacción para los agentes de la cadena de la prestación del servicio aéreo.
L98|EU Competition Policy Enforcement Supports Investment in the Energy Sectors|Energy sectors—primarily power generation and gas production, but also energy transmission and distribution—require significant capital investment in infrastructure. Market structures as well as the degree of competition and regulation are key factors that determine firms’ incentive to invest. Yet the empirical research on the link between these factors and private investment is still quite scarce, especially in the energy sectors. In this study, we empirically examine whether competition policy enforcement and regulatory intervention in European gas and electricity markets affects firms’ incentive to invest. Our findings show that EU merger policy enforcement is significantly related to a higher investment in low-regulated markets.
L98|A (Re)Municipalization Trend among Energy Utilities: Truth or Myth?|In the 1990s, a number of municipalities started privatizing their energy utilities; in recent years, there has been an intensive debate about whether a paradigm shift has taken place since then. Cities and municipalities have considered putting the energy, water, gas and heat supply back into the hands of public companies; Berlin and Hamburg are two prominent examples. But is there really an overarching trend toward (re)municipalization? According to the present study, which evaluates newly available microdata from official statistics, there is no evidence of a comprehensive (re)municipalization. The increase in public enterprises appears to have more to do with general restructuring in the energy sector, and has in fact been less pronounced than has growth in the private sector.
L98|No Differences in Efficiency Between Public and Private Utilities|The increase in municipal economic activity in the utilities sector frequently comes under scrutiny. It is presumed that public utilities have less incentive to provide efficient service than private companies. This could result in excessive costs and prices for end users. New microdata on German energy supply companies allow to conduct an empirical analysis for the whole of Germany for the first time. The findings indicate that there is no difference in efficiency between public and private utilities. This applies to both the competitively structured electricity retail sector and regulated electricity distribution sector. General restructuring in the energy sector such as the increased competitive pressure or the introduction of a more stringent regulatory regime have led to changes in the efficiency of all energy supply companies. The dichotomy between public and private utilities that has been suggested in the (re)municipalization debate therefore appears to be exaggerated.

L98|EU-Wettbewerbspolitik fördert Investitionen in den Energiesektoren|Energy sectors - primarily power generation and gas production, but also energy transmission and distribution - require significant capital investment in infrastructure. Market structures as well as the degree of competition and regulation are key factors that determine firms’ incentive to invest. Yet the empirical research on the link between these factors andprivate investment is still quite scarce, especially in the energy sectors. This study empirically examines whether competition policy enforcement and regulatory intervention in European gas and electricity markets affects firms’ incentive to invest. The findings show that EU merger policy enforcement is significantly related to a higher investment in low-regulated markets. Der Energiesektor zeichnet sich durch den Bedarf an kapitalintensiven Investitionen in Infrastruktur aus – vor allem in der Stromerzeugung und der Gasgewinnung, aber auch in der Energieübertragung und -verteilung. Sowohl die Marktstrukturen als auch der Grad an Wettbewerb und Regulierung sind Schlüsselfaktoren bei der Bestimmung der Investitionsanreize für Unternehmen. Dennoch sind die empirischen Erkenntnisse zum Zusammenhang zwischen diesen Faktoren und privaten Investitionen noch immer recht bescheiden, insbesondere in den Energiesektoren. Die vorliegende Studie untersucht empirisch, ob die Wettbewerbspolitik und regulatorische Eingriffe in die europäischen Märkte für Gas und Strom die Investitionsanreize für Unternehmen beeinflussen. Es zeigt sich, dass die Durchsetzung der EU-Fusionskontrolle signifikant mit höheren Investitionen in weniger regulierten Märkten zusammenhängt.
L98|Trend zur (Re-)Kommunalisierung in der Energieversorgung: ein Mythos?|In the 1990s, a number of municipalities started privatizing their energy utilities; in recent years, there has been an intensive debate about whether a paradigm shift has taken place since then.

The increase in public enterprises appears to have more to do with general restructuring in the energy sector, and has in fact been less pronounced than has growth in the private sector. Nachdem in den 90er Jahren viele Kommunen ihre Energieversorgungsunternehmen privatisiert hatten, ist mittlerweile oft von einem Paradigmenwechsel die Rede. Städte und Gemeinden ziehen demnach in Betracht, die Versorgung mit Strom, Wasser, Gas und Wärme wieder in die Hände öffentlicher Unternehmen zu legen. Die Städte Berlin und Hamburg sind zwei prominente Beispiele dafür. Doch gibt es einen allgemeinen (Re-)Kommunalisierungstrend? Die vorliegende Studie wertet erstmalig verfügbare Mikrodaten der amtlichen Statistik aus und kommt zu dem Schluss: Anhaltspunkte für einen umfassenden (Re-)Kommunalisierungstrend gibt es nicht. Die Zunahme öffentlicher Unternehmen scheint vielmehr auf generelle Umstrukturierungen im Energiesektor zurückzugehen und fällt relativ zum Zuwachs der Privaten geringer aus.
L98|Keine Effizienzunterschiede zwischen öffentlichen und privaten Energieversorgungsunternehmen|The increase in municipal economic activity in the utilities sector frequently comes under scrutiny.

Die Ausweitung der kommunalen Wirtschaftstätigkeit in der Energieversorgung wird oftmals kritisch betrachtet. Es wird vermutet, dass öffentliche Unternehmen im Vergleich zu privaten Unternehmen geringeren Anreizen zu effizienter Leistungserstellung unterliegen. Das könnte überhöhte Kosten und Endkundenpreise zur Folge haben. Neue Mikrodaten deutscher Energieversorgungsunternehmen erlauben erstmals eine deutschlandweite empirische Untersuchung. Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass es keine Effizienzunterschiede zwischen öffentlichen und privaten Unternehmen gibt. Das gilt sowohl für den wettbewerblich organisierten Stromvertrieb als auch für den regulierten Verteilnetzbetrieb. Allgemeine Umstrukturierungen im Energiesektor wie der erhöhte Wettbewerbsdruck oder verstärkte Regulierungsvorschriften haben zu Effizienzänderungen aller Energieversorgungsunternehmen geführt. Die Dichotomie zwischen öffentlichen und privaten Unternehmen, die in der (Re-)Kommunalisierungsdebatte suggeriert wird, scheint daher übertrieben.

L98|Capacity market design options: A dynamic capacity investment model and a GB case study|Rising feed-in from renewable energy sources decreases margins, load factors, and thereby profitability of conventional generation in several electricity markets around the world. At the same time, conventional generation is still needed to ensure security of electricity supply. Therefore, capacity markets are currently being widely discussed as a measure to ensure generation adequacy in markets such as France, Germany, and the United States (e.g., Texas), or even implemented for example in Great Britain.
L98|Asymmetric impacts of European transmission network development towards 2050: Stakeholder assessment based on IRENE-40 scenarios|This paper presents the assessment of stakeholder impacts of European electricity transmission network investments for a set of future system development scenarios. A techno-economic analysis is adopted, which quantifies the economic impacts on different stakeholders including electricity producers, consumers, and network investors, under the future de-carbonisation pathways described in the IRENE-40 scenarios, ranging from 2010 to 2050. To quantify the impact of transmission infrastructure development, for each pathway, two distinct scenarios of future European transmission development are assessed: “low” (no new transmission between 2010 and 2050) and “high” (optimal transmission development between 2010 and 2050 to accommodate the generation pathway).
L98|Capacity payment impact on gas-fired generation investments under rising renewable feed-in — A real options analysis|We assess the effect of capacity payments on investments in gas-fired power plants in the presence of different degrees of renewable energy technology (RET) penetration. Low variable cost renewables increasingly make investments in gas-fired generation unprofitable. At the same time, growing feed-in from intermittent RETs amplifies fluctuations in power generation, thus entailing the need for flexible buffer capacity—currently mostly gas-fired power plants. A real options approach is applied to evaluate investment decisions and timing of a single investor in gas-fired power generation. We investigate the necessity and effectiveness of capacity payments. Our model incorporates multiple uncertainties and assesses the effect of capacity payments under different degrees of RET penetration. In a numerical study, we implement stochastic processes for peak-load electricity prices and natural gas prices. We find that capacity payments are an effective measure to promote new gas-fired generation projects. Especially in times of high renewable feed-in, capacity payments are required to incentivize peak-load investments.
L98|Capacity, investment and market power in the economic value of energy firms|Regulation of energy firms faces the complex problem of balancing private (earning a fair rate of return on investment) and public (assure safe and reliable supply of energy at the lowest possible costs) goals. Tobin's q is a forward looking indicator on investment opportunities and on market power of firms that energy regulators can use for more effective regulation. This paper presents the empirical evidence on the determinants of differences in observed values of Tobin's q for a sample of large listed energy firms from 10 different countries in the period 2000–2006. We find that adjustment costs represent around sixty percent of the difference between economic and book value of the assets for the representative firm, while rents from market power represent the other forty percent. Therefore, across countries there is room for regulatory actions aiming at reducing energy prices, but less than what may be inferred from the observed average q values.
L98|Estimating the willingness to pay for reliable electricity supply: A choice experiment study|This research examines households' willingness to pay (WTP) for an improved electricity service. Households' stated WTP is estimated using the choice experiment (CE) method. The data used in the estimations come from 350 in-person interviews conducted during the period 5–22 August 2008 in North Cyprus. Compensating variation (CV) estimates for a zero-outage scenario are calculated using the parameter estimates from the mixed logit (ML) model; these are 6.65 YTL (Turkish lira) per month (3.02 USD) for summer and 25.83 YTL per month (11.74 USD) for winter. In order to avoid the cost of outages, households are willing to incur a 3.6% and a 13.9% increase in their monthly electricity bill for summer and winter, respectively. The WTP per hour unserved is 0.28 YTL (0.13 USD) for summer, and 1.08 YTL (0.49 USD) for winter. A preliminary cost–benefit analysis indicates that the annualized economic benefits are approximately 42.7 million YTL (19.4 million USD) for the residential sector. This would justify an investment in additional generation capacity of approximately 268MW, which is far more than that which is needed to eliminate the service reliability problem.
L98|Regulation and investment incentives in electricity distribution: An empirical assessment|We analyze the effects of incentive regulation with revenue caps on the investment behaviors of 109 German electricity distribution companies. We hypothesize that with Germany's implementation of incentive regulation in 2009 firms increase their investments in the base year when the rate base is determined for the following regulatory period. We build a model that controls for both firm-specific heterogeneity and ownership. The results show that investments increase after 2009, especially in the base year. We find that publicly owned firms do not exhibit a different investment behavior than private firms. We conclude that a comprehensive assessment of investment decisions should include all institutional aspects of incentive regulation.
L98|Support schemes for renewable electricity in the European Union: Producer strategies and competition|Current discussion about how to reform European support schemes for renewable electricity neglects certain risks of market power in wholesale electricity markets. In a stylized Cournot model of interacting spot and forward electricity markets, I analyze how different price-based support schemes affect producer strategies and, ultimately, competition in the wholesale market. I compare the strategic behavior of renewable and conventional producers in terms of electricity production and forward market sales in the presence of two different price-based support schemes: feed-in tariffs and feed-in premiums. I show that the feed-in premium, which is the European Commission's current scheme of choice, may enhance market power and favor conventional electricity production. It may also reduce the likelihood of achieving the political objective to increase production from renewable energy sources.
L98|Gas-to-power market and investment incentive for enhancing generation capacity: An analysis of Ghana's electricity sector|Ghana's electricity generation capacity is currently insufficient to meet demand, making power outages and load shedding common. The resulting impact is potentially devastating for the country's growth prospects. Traditionally, lack of an affordable and reliable fuel supply for power generation, coupled with ineffective institutions and an unfavourable investment climate, have resulted in Ghana's electricity sector performing poorly. In light of the 2007 discovery of natural gas reserves in Ghanaian waters, this paper examines whether domestic gas could advance the performance of the electricity sector, and if so, how. The results of our analysis show that utilization of gas reserves in Ghana's gas-to-power market is an economically superior strategy compared to an export-oriented utilization scheme. The lack of an effective regulatory framework for investment, skill shortages, and an inefficient electricity pricing structure continue to be the main constraining factors. Our analysis also considers possible approaches to modification of the electricity tariff in order to send the right signal to potential investors in generation capacity, without compromising the affordability of power supply.
L98|The low cost of quality improvements in the electricity distribution sector of Brazil|We analyze the impact of introducing output-based incentives in the price-cap regulatory regime of the Brazilian electricity distribution sector. We focus on the trade-off between operating costs and quality improvement, hypothesizing a positive relationship. Operating costs include maintenance and repair expenses. The regulator sets limits for service continuity and non-technical energy losses in each regulatory period. Service continuity refers to the average length of interruptions in electricity distribution. Non-technical losses refer to losses due to factors specific to the distribution segment. Quality incentives include peer-pressure and penalties/rewards for compliance with minimum quality standards. We model operating costs using a GMM framework to acknowledge endogeneity of variables. The model is dynamic given the inclusion of regulatory lags to recognize past cost behavior. Findings reveal a small trade-off between costs and quality. We conclude that quality improvements are not costly relative to the potential savings from complying with quality standards. We also find that the impact on operating costs is larger when energy losses increase compared to the cost effect due to increases in duration of outages. These findings suggest areas of attention in managerial decision making, and serve as valuable information to the regulator in tailoring quality incentives for this sector.
L98|Public transport governance in the Netherlands: More recent developments|Like in the 2013 version of this paper, it recaps the latest developments in the governance of public transport in the Netherlands, focusing on bus, tram, metro and train concessions. Most of the concessions are competitively tendered, since the introduction of a legal obligation to tender in 2001. Dutch public transport authorities have since chosen a variety of concession setups and forms of contract remuneration. This variety has remained large in terms of ways of tendering, but in addition, the three major cities were allowed in 2012 to choose not to tender out their concessions. This paper again explores that variety and describes recent changes at the national and regional levels from 2013 onwards and looks at the developments that were first coming up in 2012. The paper describes key trends and lessons from the Dutch experience based on a nine-year project drawing lessons on competitive tendering with authorities, operators and consultants, and based on interviews with representative of 13 of the 14 public transport authorities. Key trends are a national focus on rail transport, dealing with austerity measures, implementing the earlier push for defragmentation by the national government, tweaking of the governance and preparing for bigger changes that might have major impacts on the markets for public transport. Finally, the article presents a four phase model of implementation of governance changes after in the introduction of competitive tendering in 2001.
L98|Overcoming barriers to electrical energy storage: Comparing California and Europe|Multiple market drivers suggest that electrical energy storage (EES) systems are going to be essential for future power systems within the next decade. However, the deployment of the technology is proceeding at very different rates around the world. Whereas the sector is progressing quickly in California, it is not gaining much traction, so far, in Europe. This research aims to clarify why the prospects for energy storage in Europe are not as good as they are in California. The market and regulatory framework in California and Europe are analysed critically, and changes to overcome the main barriers are recommended. The research shows that the main barriers are: inadequate definition and classification of EES in legislation; lack of markets for some ancillary services; inadequate market design that benefits traditional technologies; and the lack of need for EES in some jurisdictions. The prospects are better in California because regulation is more advanced and favourable for the technology, and regulators are collaborating with developers and utilities to analyse barriers and solutions for the technology. In Europe, there is a need to clarify the definition of EES, create new markets for ancillary services, design technology-neutral market rules and study more deeply the necessity of EES.
L98|Analysing the potential economic value of energy storage|This paper examines the likely market for electrical energy storage from a market viewpoint, taking market prices as given and determining the extent to which a strategy of arbitrage across the day, buying at the lowest price times at night and selling at the highest times during the early evening, generates profits in the British context. The paper sets out the potential problems as the market moves to absorb increasing amounts of wind, then characterises the nature of prices, which reveals the importance of a strategy in which power is absorbed into store for a relatively few hours of the day and discharged over a relatively few hours. The paper models the ongoing costs of operation and compares them with revenues, but does not consider construction costs. It argues that additional incentives may need to be put into place in order to render storage over relatively longer periods more attractive.
L98|The Energy Union pillars: competitiveness, security and sustainability|This research focuses on the study of energy union, from the perspective of the three pillars: competitiveness, sustainability and security. The author uses descriptive research methodology to analyze the implementation of the main objectives of energy union. The article analyzes, based on the literature in the energy field, the weaknesses and the strengths of each pillar. The study findings show the opportunities, but also the challenges that hinder the development of energy union and identify the priorities for Romania.
L98|Warranty regulation and consumer demand: evidence from China’s automobile market|Abstract Although government regulations on product warranties are common, few studies have empirically examined their effects on product demand. Using a natural experiment, we examine the effect of a newly introduced government warranty regulation in China’s automobile market on product demand. Exploiting the exogenous variation in warranty coverage caused by the regulation, we apply a difference-in-differences analysis and find that the regulation increases the sales of the affected vehicles. Moreover, we find that (1) the demand effects of the regulation decrease as vehicle quality increases, and that (2) these effects are weaker for luxury brand vehicles and stronger for non-luxury vehicles.
L98|Regulations in services sectors and their impact on downstream industries: The OECD 2013 Regimpact Indicator|This document presents the new 2013 set of the OECD Regulatory Impact (REGIMPACT) indicator. It measures the impact of regulatory barriers to competition in non-manufacturing sectors on all industries, through intermediate inputs. The paper describes how the indicator is calculated and discusses a number of challenges and trade-offs when constructing the indicator. They relate to the composition of the indicator, how the slow-moving or time-invariant retail and professional services regulation data are integrated with the annual energy, transport and communication regulation (ETCR) indicator and what sector weights are used for the calculation of the REGIMPACT indicator. The document then compares the 2003, 2008 and 2013 vintages of the REGIMPACT indicator and the alternative (narrow and wide) definitions of the 2013 indicator. Finally, the paper uses sectoral data to illustrate the extent to which different vintages and alternative indicator definitions can possibly influence sector-level panel regression results for outcome variables such as productivity, investment and labour inputs. Réglementation dans les secteurs des services et leur impact sur les industries en aval : la version 2013 de l'indicateur REGIMPACT de l'OCDE Ce document présente une version révisée en 2013 de l'indicateur REGIMPACT de l'OCDE. Il mesure pour chaque industrie, l'impact des obstacles réglementaires à la concurrence, par le biais des intrants intermédiaires dans les secteurs non manufacturiers. Ce document décrit la méthodologie utilisée pour calculer cet indicateur et examine un certain nombre de défis et de compromis liés à sa construction. Ils se rapportent à la composition de l'indicateur, notamment l’intégration de séries avec peu de variation temporelle telles que l’indice de réglementation dans le commerce de détail ou les services professionnels avec les indicateurs annuels de réglementation dans les secteurs de l'énergie, du transport et des télécommunications (ETCR) ainsi qu’aux pondérations sectorielles utilisées pour le calcul de l’indicateur REGIMPACT. Le document compare ensuite les versions 2003, 2008 et 2013 de cet indicateur et les définitions alternatives (étroites et larges) de l'indicateur REGIMPACT. Enfin, le document utilise des données sectorielles pour illustrer dans quelle mesure les différentes versions et définitions peuvent éventuellement influencer les résultats de régression en données de panel au niveau sectoriel pour des variables telles que la productivité, l'investissement et l’emploi.
L98|Priorities for completing the European Union's Single Market|The EU Single Market remains far from completed: progress in goods and services market integration has stalled, financial markets are still fragmented along national lines and the barriers to labour mobility remain high. Restrictive regulation within countries and regulatory heterogeneity across them hamper the internal market, reducing trade and investment flows. Network sectors, such as energy and transportation, are insufficiently interconnected and open to competition, and inefficient as a result. Reinvigorating the single market is one of the key tools to strengthen the recovery of the European Union and restore faster growth of income per capita. To support the recovery, structural reforms that yield short-run as well as long-run gains should be prioritised. Policies enhancing labour and capital mobility are especially relevant, as they provide channels of adjustment to country-specific shocks and reinforce the effectiveness of stabilisation policies. Policies enhancing capital mobility include improved securitisation, better collection and sharing of credit information regarding smaller firms and the convergence of insolvency regimes. Labour mobility within the European Union would profit from reduced administrative and regulatory burden, such as faster recognition of professional qualifications and better portability of social and pension rights. Product markets reforms also have the potential to deliver benefits swiftly, not least by unlocking investment. Regulatory burdens could be alleviated by better impact assessment for legislative proposals and ex post evaluation of policies. Product market reforms in network sectors should include harmonisation of regulations and technical specifications, with the target of establishing single EU regulators. This Working Paper relates to the 2016 OECD Economic Survey of the European Union (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-european-union-and-euro-area.htm) Priorités pour l'achèvement du marché unique dans l'Union Européenne Le marché unique de l’UE est encore loin d’être achevé : les progrès en matière d’intégration des marchés de produits et services marquent le pas, les marchés financiers demeurent fragmentés par pays et les obstacles à la mobilité de la main-d’oeuvre restent nombreux. La réglementation restrictive dans les pays et l’hétérogénéité des réglementations entre eux entravent le marché intérieur, ce qui provoque une réduction des courants d’échanges et des flux d’investissement. Les industries de réseau, comme l’énergie et les transports par exemple, ne sont pas suffisamment interdépendantes et ouvertes à la concurrence, d’où leur inefficience. La redynamisation du marché unique est l’un des principaux outils pour consolider la reprise dans l'Union européenne et renouer avec une croissance plus rapide du revenu par habitant. Pour stimuler la reprise, les réformes structurelles qui sont à l’origine de progrès à court et long terme devraient avoir la priorité. Les mesures qui renforcent la mobilité de la main-d’oeuvre et des capitaux sont particulièrement importantes puisqu’elles offrent des solutions d’ajustement aux chocs propres à certains pays et améliorent l’efficacité des mesures de stabilisation. Les mesures qui renforcent la mobilité des capitaux englobent une titrisation réactivée, un recueil et un partage améliorés des données sur le crédit concernant les petites entreprises et la convergence des régimes de faillite. La mobilité de la main-d’oeuvre au sein de l’Union européenne aurait tout à gagner d’une réduction de la charge administrative et du poids de la réglementation, par exemple via une reconnaissance plus rapide des qualifications professionnelles et une meilleure transférabilité des prestations sociales et droits à pension. Les réformes des marchés de produits sont aussi susceptibles d’avoir des effets positifs rapides, notamment en facilitant l’investissement. Le poids de la réglementation pourrait être allégé grâce à une analyse d’impact de meilleure qualité pour les propositions législatives et à une évaluation ex post des mesures. Les réformes des marchés de produits dans les industries de réseau devraient inclure une harmonisation des réglementations et spécifications techniques dans le but de créer une autorité de régulation unique à l'échelle de l'UE.

L98|Costa Rica: Boosting productivity to sustain income convergence|In the latest 30 years, Costa Rica's real GDP per capita has more than doubled, driven by increasing labour utilisation. Labour productivity has instead stagnated at around 30% of the more advanced OECD countries. Productivity growth has been lacklustre despite the opening up of markets to international competition and large FDI inflows. Several obstacles continue to hamper the development of domestic firms and markets. They have fostered a dual speed economy characterised, on the one hand, by an innovative, productive and export oriented FDI sector – increasingly focussing on high value added sectors – and, on the other hand, a domestic sector – dominated by small firms and focused on traditional industries – that is neither innovative nor very productive. Boosting national productivity to sustain the convergence process towards OECD countries living standards will hinge on creating the right conditions for domestic firms to thrive and become more innovative and productive, while maintaining the long-standing commitment to open international markets and investment. To make this happens the government should: 1) encourage innovation and improving links between domestic and foreign firms by better enforcing and implementing intellectual property rights, shifting public R&D spending towards tertiary education institutions, and improving the coordination of public programmes promoting innovation of local firms and linkages with foreign affiliates; 2) strengthen competition in product markets and ease access to finance for SMEs by eliminating anti-trust exemptions, empowering the competition commission and giving it more independence, reducing barriers to entrepreneurship, ameliorating the corporate governance of state-owned enterprises and creating a level-playing fields between state-owned and private banks; 3) enhance the institutional and legal framework of the transport and other infrastructure sectors by reducing the number of agencies involved in policy development and project executions, and establishing an institutional framework to reduce policy uncertainty and attract more private investment. This Working Paper relates to the 2016 OECD Economic Assessment of Costa Rica (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-costa-rica.htm). Costa Rica: Stimuler la productivité pour soutenir la convergence des revenus Dans les dernières 30 années, le PIB réel par habitant du Costa Rica a plus que doublé, grâce à une utilisation croissante du travail. La productivité du travail a stagné autour de 30% des pays les plus avancés de l'OCDE. La croissance de la productivité a été terne, malgré l'ouverture des marchés à la concurrence internationale et de grandes entrées d'IDE. Plusieurs obstacles continuent d'entraver le développement des entreprises et des marchés intérieurs. Ils ont favorisé une économie à deux vitesses caractérisée, d'une part, par un secteur de l'IDE innovateur, productif et orienté vers l'exportation - se concentrant de plus en plus sur les secteurs à forte valeur ajoutée - et, d'autre part, un secteur domestique - dominé par les petites entreprises et concentré sur les industries traditionnelles - qui ne sont ni innovantes, ni très productives. Stimuler la productivité nationale pour soutenir le processus de convergence vers des pays de l'OCDE le niveau de vie dépendra de la création des conditions pour les entreprises nationales de se développer et de devenir plus innovantes et productives, tout en maintenant l'engagement de longue date pour ouvrir les marchés et les investissements internationaux. Pour que cela arrive, le gouvernement devrait: 1) encourager l'innovation et l'amélioration des liens entre les entreprises nationales et étrangères par une meilleure application et par la mise en oeuvre des droits de propriété intellectuelle, en déplaçant les dépenses de R&D vers les établissements d'enseignement supérieur, et par l'amélioration de la coordination des programmes publics de promotion de l'innovation des entreprises locales et des liens avec des sociétés étrangères affiliées; 2) renforcer la concurrence sur les marchés de produits et de faciliter l'accès au financement pour les PME en éliminant les exemptions anti-trust, habilitant la commission de la concurrence et en lui donnant plus d'indépendance, de réduire les obstacles à l'entrepreneuriat, améliorer la gouvernance des entreprises publiques et la création d'une concurrence equitable entre les banques publiques et privées; 3) renforcer le cadre institutionnel et juridique du transport et d'autres secteurs de l'infrastructure, en réduisant le nombre d'organismes impliqués dans les exécutions de développement des politiques et des projets, et l'établissement d'un cadre institutionnel pour réduire l'incertitude politique et d'attirer davantage d'investissements privés.

L98|A bird-eye view of Costa Rica's transport infrastructure|Costa Rica's transport infrastructure sector has long suffered from insufficient and ineffective investment and maintenance spending, resulting in a congested and poor-quality transport network. Public spending has been below the OECD average and private sector participation is limited. The road network is extensive but of poor quality, railways are in disrepair and only slowly being reactivated after having been shut down in the 1990s, seaports quality and capacity are deficient. Internal transportation overly relies on private road vehicles as the public transport system, especially railways, is inadequate. As a result, the transport sector is the major source of greenhouse emissions. Major challenges hindering the sector performance are: excessive institutional fragmentation, which reduces transparency and accountability of public sector agencies, poor strategic planning, which results in haphazard infrastructure development and poor intermodal connections, aversion to private sector participation and absence of an infrastructure-project pipeline, which discourage private investment, poor project preparation and slow project execution due to no cost benefit analyses, unclear project selection criteria and insufficient stakeholder engagement. This working paper relates to the 2016 OECD Economic Survey of Costa Rica (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-costa-rica.htm). Une vue globale de l'infrastructure de transport du Costa Rica Le secteur des infrastructures de transport du Costa Rica a longtemps souffert des insuffisantes et inefficaces dépenses d'investissement et de maintenance, qui ont déterminé un réseau de transport congestionné et de mauvaise qualité. Les dépenses publiques ont été en dessous de la moyenne de l'OCDE et la participation du secteur privé est limitée. Le réseau routier est vaste, mais de mauvaise qualité, les chemins de fer sont en mauvais état et sont en train d'être lentement réactivé, après avoir été arrêté dans les années 1990, la qualité et capacité des ports maritimes sont insuffisant. Le transport interne repose excessivement sur les véhicules routiers privés puisque le système de transport public, en particulier les chemins de fer, est peu développé. Par conséquent, le secteur des transports est la principale source des émissions à effet de serre. Les défis majeurs qui entravent la performance du secteur sont: la excessive fragmentation institutionnelle, ce qui réduit la transparence et la responsabilité des organismes publics, une mauvaise planification stratégique, qui se traduit par un développement désordonné des infrastructures et des liaisons intermodales insuffisantes, l'aversion à la participation du secteur privé et l'absence d'une liste des projets d'infrastructure, qui découragent l'investissement privé, la faible qualité de la préparation des projets et leur exécutions lent en raison de la manque d'analyses coûts avantages, des critères flous pour la sélection des projets et engagement des parties prenantes insuffisantes.

L98|How Do Product Market Regulations Affect Workers?: Evidence from the Network Industries|Knowing who gains and loses from regulatory reform is important for understanding the political economy of reform. Using micro-level data from 26 countries, this paper studies how regulatory reform of network industries, a policy priority in many advanced economies, influences the labour market situation of workers in network industries. Estimates are identified from changes in a worker’s pay, industry-level employment flows and regulation over time. The main finding is that the regulation of network industries provides workers in this industry with a wage premium and higher employment stability relative to similar workers in other industries. Regulatory reform therefore tends to align labour income and employment stability in the reformed industry with those in other industries. Workers in the reformed industry lose out compared with others, because they no longer benefit from “excess” pay and employment stability. Réglementation des marchés de produits : Quelles conséquences pour le marché du travail dans les industries de réseau ? Pour comprendre l’économie politique d’une réforme réglementaire, il est important de savoir qui seront les gagnants et qui seront les perdants. À partir de microdonnées recueillies dans 26 pays, cet article étudie les incidences que la déréglementation des industries de réseau – une priorité de l’action publique dans de nombreux pays avancés – peut avoir sur la situation des travailleurs employés dans ce secteur. Les effets sont estimés sur la base des variations observées au niveau des salaires, des flux de main-d’oeuvre et de la réglementation. Les principaux résultats de l’analyse montrent que, dans les industries de réseau, la réglementation se traduit par une prime de salaire et une plus grande stabilité de l’emploi que dans les autres secteurs. La déréglementation tend donc à aligner vers le bas les revenus salariaux et le niveau de stabilité de l’emploi des travailleurs concernés, qui sont les perdants de la réforme puisqu’ils ne bénéficient plus du surcroît de salaire et de stabilité dont ils jouissaient auparavant dans leur emploi.
L98|Port Regionalization and Landlocked Hinterland: The Czech Republic|The expansion of the European Union (EU) and economic growth have propelled the devel-opment of intermodal transportation and logistics activities in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Yet, the inland location of most CEE economies requires improved connectivity to port terminals on both the Atlantic/Baltic and Mediterranean/Black Sea ranges. The paper pro-vides a broader research perspective on inland logistics platforms focusing on the CEE region, particularly as it concerns the role of the public sector in port hinterland infrastructure devel-opment. The paper identifies the current bottlenecks in logistics activity in regard to the whole range of the national transport chains. A dual regionalization process is taking place between the ports of the Northern and Mediterranean ranges and that the Northern Range is more ef-fective at servicing the CEE region, including the Czech Republic, in spite of the proximity advantage of Mediterranean ports.
L98|Productivity Trends in the Canadian Transport Sector: An Overview|In recent decades, the overall growth in productivity of many subsectors of the Canadian transportation and warehousing sector has been above average. In particular, while labour productivity (real GDP per worker) grew an average of 0.64 per cent per year between 2000 and 2014 in the transportation and warehousing sector, labour productivity grew an average of 1.83 per cent per year in the truck transportation subsector, 3.25 per cent per year in the air transportation subsector and 2.09 per cent in the train transportation subsector for the same period. Conversely, in the urban transit subsector, labour productivity decreased an average of 0.76 per cent per year between 2000 and 2014. This report provides a detailed analysis of output, input and productivity trends in four subsectors of the Canadian transportation and warehousing sector. It also examines drivers of the productivity growth for each subsector as well as policies that could enable faster growth. Given the impact that the transportation sector has on many Canadian industries as well as the Canadian economy, maintaining productivity growth is important.
L98|The impact of road pricing on accidents: a note on Milan|Abstract This paper aims to evaluate the effects of a road pricing scheme in Milan (the Ecopass) on accidents. As the policy was introduced in January 2008, we exploit this exogenous variation to analyse the trend of the time series of the number of accidents, the number of injuries and deaths and in different areas through a regression discontinuity design approach. We find evidence of an overall reduction in accidents in the whole city ( $$-$$ - 16 %), with a more pronounced effect in the treated area ( $$-$$ - 18.8 %). The effect on severity of accidents is limited as only a significant reduction in the number of injuries could be detected, whereas no effect was found for the number of deaths.
L98|Standortindex DIGITAL: Nützlich zum Erkennen von Handlungserfordernissen im IKT-Sektor?<BR>[Location Index DIGITAL – Useful for Justifying Economic Policy Action Requirements in the ICT Sector?]|Zusammenfassung Beim letzten Nationalen IT-Gipfel der Bundesregierung am 18./19.11.2015 haben die Kanzlerin und der Wirtschaftsminister einhellig hervorgehoben, dass Deutschland hinsichtlich des Digitalisierungsgrades von Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft im internationalen Vergleich allenfalls mittelmäßig abschneiden würde und zudem gegenüber anderen Ländern jüngst auch noch zurückgefallen sei. Diese Urteile wurden mit Ergebnissen einer neuen Studie begründet, in der von einem Marktforschungsunternehmen im Auftrag des Bundeswirtschaftsministeriums ein „Standortindex DIGITAL“ konstruiert und ermittelt wurde. Wie aussagekräftig ist dieses Messinstrument? Der Autor hält diesen Index nicht für geeignet, um darauf wirtschaftspolitische Schlussfolgerungen zu gründen.
L98|Standortindex DIGITAL: Nützlich zum Erkennen von Handlungserfordernissen im IKT-Sektor?|Both the German Federal Chancellor and Minster of Economic Affairs unanimously emphasised at the last “national IT summit” on 18-19 November 2015 that the degree of digitisation in the German economy and society is mediocre when compared internationally, and that in the recent past Germany has even lost ground to other countries regarding the nation’s “ICT isation”. These assessments were justified by the results of a new study commissioned by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs in which a market research firm construed a so called “location index DIGITAL”. The present article shows that the quality of this measurement instrument is poor. As a consequence, the tenability of the economic policy conclusions drawn from the index by high level government representatives is low. Copyright ZBW and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016
L98|Integration and Efficiency of European Electricity Markets: Evidence from Spot Prices|This paper seeks to investigate the current state of market integration among European electricity day-ahead spot prices. We provide reasoning that market integration brings about benefits, such as lower average prices and increased welfare from allocative efficiency. Yet, price convergence leads to higher prices in the low-price market and to lower prices in the high-price market, which creates winners and losers and thus makes the political implementation of market integration cumbersome. In our empirical analysis, we utilize a large sample of hourly spot prices of 25 European markets for the period 01.01.2010-30.06.2015 and combine it with other relevant data such as interconnector capacities and the existence of market coupling. Firstly, empirical results from cointegration analysis indicate that market integration increased from 2010 to 2012 but then declined until 2015, most likely due to increased feed-in from intermittent renewables. Secondly, we empirically assess the speed of adjustment from price shocks and reach the conclusion that the resulting efficiency of integration is rather modest. In general, our findings suggest that integration among European electricity markets has a large potential for improvements from additional capacity investments and further promotion of market coupling.

L98|Cross-Border Technology Differences and Trade Barriers: Evidence from German and French Electricity Markets|" Using hourly data, we show that the convergence of German and French electricity spot prices depends on the employed generation mix structure, on the trade (export/import) capacity between the two countries, and on characteristics of neighbouring markets. Only when German and French electricity markets employ ""similar"" generation mixes price spreads vanish, and the likelihood for congestion of electricity flows is significantly reduced. This implies that, at least, a part of the convergence that was documented in recent literature is spurious, because it is not (only) driven by the forces of arbitrage, but by the similarity of the generation structures. The direction of congestion matters in this regard. Furthermore, we document consistent evidence for the most important predictions of trade theory if markets are characterized by increasing marginal cost (i.e. supply) curves and limited cross-border capacities."

L98|Governmental platform intermediation to promote alternative fuel vehicles|Many governments promote green technological innovation within the automobile sector as a means of combating climate change. Most of these innovations are driven by alternative fuels. Buyer's premiums and governmental investment in service infrastructure are widely used. This paper investigates the question regarding whether market intervention is adequate by considering the two-sided market character of the automobile market. This study shows that network effects, competition effects triggered by more automobile users and decreasing marginal utilities of further service stations determine the welfare-efficient extent of governmental intervention. The results of the analysis indicate that governmental promotion of service infrastructure is reasonable, although governments should be cautious about buyer's premiums.
L98|Cellular Service Demand: Biased Beliefs, Learning, and Bill Shock|Following FCC pressure to end bill shock, cellular carriers now alert customers when they exceed usage allowances. We estimate a model of plan choice, usage, and learning using a 2002-2004 panel of cellular bills. Accounting for firm price adjustment, we predict that implementing alerts in 2002-2004 would have lowered average annual consumer welfare by $33. We show that consumers are inattentive to past usage, meaning that bill-shock alerts are informative. Additionally, our estimates imply that consumers are overconfident, underestimating the variance of future calling. Overconfidence costs consumers $76 annually at 2002-2004 prices. Absent overconfidence, alerts would have little to no effect. (JEL D12, D18, L11, L96, L98)
L98|Infrastructure Quality and the Subsidy Trap|Electricity and water are often subsidized in developing countries to increase their affordability for low-income households. Ideally, such subsidies would create sufficient demand in poor neighborhoods to encourage private investment in their infrastructure. Instead, many regions receiving large subsidies have precarious distribution networks supplying users who never pay. Using a structural model of household electricity demand in Colombia, I predict the change in consumption and profits from upgrading low-quality electricity connections. I show that the existing subsidies, which provide greater transfers to areas with unreliable supply, deter investment to modernize infrastructure. Finally, I analyze alternative programs with stronger investment incentives. (JEL H23, H54, L94, L98, O12, O13)
L98|When Does Regulation Distort Costs? Lessons from Fuel Procurement in US Electricity Generation|This paper evaluates changes in fuel procurement practices by coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States following state-level legislation that ended cost-of-service regulation of electricity generation. I find that deregulated plants substantially reduce the price paid for coal (but not gas) and tend to employ less capital-intensive sulfur abatement techniques relative to matched plants that were not subject to any regulatory change. Deregulation also led to a shift toward more productive coal mines. I show how these results lend support to theories of asymmetric information, capital bias, and regulatory capture as important sources of regulatory distortion.

L98|Pay as You Go: Prepaid Metering and Electricity Expenditures in South Africa|High rates of customer default on utility bills present a barrier to the expansion of electricity access in the developing world. Pre-paid electricity metering offers a technological solution to ensuring timely payment. Using an eleven-year panel of pre-paid electricity customers in Cape Town, South Africa, we describe patterns of purchase behavior across property values, our measure of socioeconomic status. Poorer households buy electricity more often, in smaller increments, and are most likely to buy on payday. These patterns suggest difficulties smoothing income, and reveal a preference for small, frequent purchases that is incompatible with a standard monthly electricity billing cycle.
L98|Open Skies: Estimating Travelers' Benefits from Free Trade in Airline Services|The United States has negotiated bilateral open skies agreements to deregulate airline competition on US international routes, but little is known about their effects on travelers' welfare and the gains from the US negotiating agreements with more countries. We develop a model of international airline competition to estimate the effects of open skies agreements on fares and flight frequency. We find the agreements have generated at least $4 billion in annual gains to travelers and that travelers would gain an additional $4 billion if the US negotiated agreements with other countries that have a significant amount of international passenger traffic.

L98|Asymmetric Incentives in Subsidies: Evidence from a Large-Scale Electricity Rebate Program|Many countries use substantial public funds to subsidize reductions in negative externalities. Such policy designs create asymmetric incentives because increases in externalities remain unpriced. I investigate the implications of such policies by using a regression discontinuity design in California's electricity rebate program. Using household-level panel data, I find that the incentive produced precisely estimated zero treatment effects on energy conservation in coastal areas. In contrast, the rebate induced short-run and long-run consumption reductions in inland areas. Income, climate, and air conditioner saturation significantly drive the heterogeneity. Finally, I provide a cost-effectiveness analysis and investigate how to improve the policy design. (JEL D12, D62, H76, L94, L98, Q48)
L98|Valuing the Wind: Renewable Energy Policies and Air Pollution Avoided|Exploiting variation in the hourly production from wind turbines, this paper quantifies the heterogeneity in the marginal impact of renewable electricity on pollution. The results reveal that output from competing renewable capacity additions—e.g., wind turbines versus solar panels—provide different marginal external benefits. This finding suggests that, if governments continue to subsidize renewables, an emphasis should be placed on designing policies that internalize the heterogeneous benefits. More generally, my results highlight that, by incorrectly assuming renewable electricity is a homogenous good, we will understate the relative efficiency of the first-best pollution prices.

L98|The influence of logistics on the environment in Republic of Guinea|The article discusses the logistics of the Republic of Guinea and its impacts on the environment. The main problems are the emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants, noise, and the tightness of surfaces due to building of infrastructure in the transport sector. Optimization of the supply chain is most often focused on finding the optimization, of flow of costs, time, quality criteria and services. For the use of multi-criteria combinatorial optimization uses several methods to support the optimization, such as the method of multi-criteria decision-making or optimization methods. Following the requirements of sustainable development and green marketing solutions is offered to reduce the pollution created by the logistics infrastructure. But the solutions do not take into account some of the aspects and critical issues that remain unresolved. As a result, we can summarize various elements describing the changes of the environment, such as pressure on the environment, the impact on the population, economy, ecosystems and the response of the society.
L98|Public Engagement in Electricity Network Development: A Case Study of the Beauly–Denny Project in Scotland|Ambitious renewable energy targets and an aging infrastructure necessitate a substantial upgrading and expansion of the electricity transmission networks around Europe and beyond. Although vital for the functioning of the economy, grid development projects are often met by public opposition, which increase costs and lengthy planning processes. The current planning processes have proven ineffective at resolving the conflicts among stakeholders, indicating the need for a new approach. We analyse these issues from an Economic perspective, outlining the economic characteristics of transmission developments and public engagement. We identify previously overlooked features of the planning process that are contributing to the rise in conflicts, public opposition and prolonged project realisation. The Scottish Beauly-Denny high voltage transmission development is discussed in detail and our findings indicate a need for increased engagement with local communities at an earlier stage of planning. Trust between communities, developers and government is important for future negotiations and can be achieved through transparency, specific education and set guidelines for stakeholder engagement in the planning process.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L98|Can current electricity markets cope with high shares of renewables? A comparison of approaches in Germany, the UK and the State of New York|"This paper looks at the empirical and theoretical background to high shares of renewables in the electricity system. First we examine what is meant by ""high shares"" of renewables; next we consider what we mean by electricity ""markets""; then we discuss what the term ""cope with"" implies; before returning to the suitability of ""current"" electricity markets. Second, we turn to three examples of jurisdictions - Germany, the UK and the State of New York in the US - with specific aspirations for decarbonisation and the role of renewables. Each exhibits very different approaches to the way they are adjusting their electricity market design to cope with high shares of renewables. We suggest that a new wave of electricity experiments is beginning around the theme of how to incorporate large shares of intermittent renewable generation in to electricity systems."
L98|In Search of 'Good' Energy Policy: The Social Limits to Technological Solutions to Energy and Climate Problems|This paper seeks to explore the nature of ‘Good’ Energy Policy by offering a multi-disciplinary social science and humanities perspective on policy making. The objective in doing this is to understand how to get from where we are today to a ‘better’ energy policy. We begin by discussing what we mean by ‘policy’. We then go on to characterise and challenge the technologists’ approach to energy policy. Next we discuss some key intellectual starting points that explain why policy making in this area is so difficult. We then turn to a set of multi-disciplinary social science and humanities perspectives on energy policy that together form promising areas for research. These are: perception; quantification; well-being; public trust; role of the state; competence and hubris in delivery; and parallels with healthcare. We close by discussing how these perspectives can illuminate whether a policy is ‘good’, ‘bad’ or something in between.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

L98|Strommarktöffnung in der EU und Folgerungen für die Schweiz|Im Hinblick auf die Diskussion der vollständigen Strommarktöffnung in der Schweiz stellt sich die Frage, inwieweit die Schweiz die Erfahrungen der EU nutzen kann. Die Analyse der Entwicklungen in der EU und Länderstudien für Grossbritannien, Deutschland, Frankreich, Italien und Schweiz zeigt, dass erstens in der EU noch kein Level Playing Field besteht, dass die vollständige Marktöffnung eine wesentliche Herausforderung darstellt, und dass wichtige Wechselwirkungen mit der Energiewende bestehen. Für den Fall der Schweiz ist davon auszugehen, dass eine vollständige Marktöffnung die Kosten der Energiestrategie ceteris paribus erhöhen wird. Vor dem Hintergrund sollte die Schweiz zuerst die Eckwerte der Energiestrategie festlegen und hierauf eine optimale Marktöffnungsstrategie für ihren Elektrizitätsmarkt ableiten.
L98|Top-down and Bottom-up. Testing a mixed approach to the generation of priorities for sustainable urban mobility|This paper contributes to the debate on how to make operational the concept of sustainable urban mobility and advocates the use of a mixed – top-down and bottom-up – approach to the generation of priorities for sustainable urban mobility. In particular, we tested whether a common list of priorities remain valid after a participated scrutiny performed in seven urban areas of southern Italy. The test was based on a 3-steps procedure. In step 1, we used a common conceptual framework (based on Mameli and Marletto, 2014) to generate seven area-specific lists of priorities. In step 2, local stakeholders participated to deliberative meetings aimed at amending or deleting each of the proposed priorities, as well as adding new ones. In step 3, citizens' opinion was gathered through seven sample polls and used to rank the list of priorities resulting from stakeholders' deliberation. The test generated three main results - 1) Deliberation between local stakeholders was useful for adapting common priorities to the characteristics of each area. But, with the exception of Reggio Calabria – an urban area with very specific features –, the structure of the starting common conceptual framework was not altered. 2) Surveys on citizens' opinion were useful, not only for ranking priorities, but also for taking into account the relevant differences between car users and the rest of the population. 3) With great caution, reference may be made to a common set of six top priorities referring to - (accessibility by and economic sustainability of) public transport, air pollution, accidents, greenhouse gasses and transport waste. These top priorities cover all three dimension of sustainability (environmental, social and economic).
L98|Application of Real Options Theory to the Assessment of Public Incentives for Onshore Wind Energy Development in Spain|This paper discusses the important development of electricity production from renewable energy in Spain. The regulatory framework has played a key role in this process, particularly the 661/2007 Royal Decree of May 25. The legislation grants certain rights to promoters. These rights can be characterized as options, allowing us to utilize a signifi cant number of theoretical and empirical studies in the fi eld of fi nancial option pricing in our analysis. Insofar as these derivative assets have underlying real and non-fi nancial assets (i.e., a wind farm), the rights provided for in Royal Decree 661/2007 can be considered real options. In this paper, a method is proposed to evaluate investment projects in Spanish wind power based on the Royal Decree. The value of these projects is certainly affected by the real options contained in the Royal Decree. Finally, public aid granted by the administration for the development of renewable energies is evaluated.
L98|México: políticas industriales y producción de bienes y servicios de tecnologías de la información y la comunicación|En este estudio se investiga hasta qué punto el auge digital ha repercutido en la actividad productiva, la manufactura (bienes tic) y los servicios tic, además de sus potenciales ramificaciones en el resto de la economía mexicana. Se utilizan las matrices de insumoproducto (mip) y se hace referencia a las del Brasil y los Estados Unidos de América. México se ha rezagado, especialmente en la producción de bienes tic, y las cadenas productivas de esta actividad se han debilitado. El sector de servicios tic ofrece un potencial mucho mayor que el aprovechado hasta ahora, con la ventaja de incorporar comparativamente mayor valor agregado y con grandes posibilidades de diversificación. Se considera primordial encontrar políticas industriales más efectivas enfocadas en los sectores de bienes y servicios tic, lo que constituye un desafío, sobre todo si se observan países como el Brasil con enfoques más proactivos, pero con resultados mixtos.
L98|Mexico: industrial policies and the production of information and communication technology goods and services|This study investigates the extent to which the digital boom has had repercussions on productive activity, in terms of both manufacturing (ict goods) and services (ict services), in addition to its potential ramifications in the rest of the Mexican economy. Input-output matrices are used and compared to those of Brazil and the United States. Mexico has fallen behind, particularly in the production of ict goods, and the productive chains of this activity have weakened. The ict services sector offers much greater potential than has been exploited thus far, with the advantage that it involves comparatively more value added and has major diversification possibilities. It is considered essential to find more effective industrial policies targeted on the ict goods and services sectors; but the experience of countries such as Brazil, which have applied more proactive approaches with mixed results, suggests that this will be challenging.
L98|Incentive regulation and utility benchmarking for electricity network security|The incentive regulation of costs related to physical and cyber security in electricity networks is an important but relatively unexplored and ambiguous issue. These costs can be part of cost efficiency benchmarking or, alternatively, dealt with separately. This paper discusses the issues and proposes options for incorporating network security costs within incentive regulation in a benchmarking framework. The relevant concerns and limitations associated with the accounting and classification of network security costs, choice of cost drivers, data adequacy and quality and the relevant benchmarking methodologies are discussed. The analysis suggests that the present regulatory treatment of network security costs using benchmarking is limited to being an informative regulatory tool rather than being deterministic. We discuss how alternative approaches outside the benchmarking framework, such as the use of stochastic cost-benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis of network security investments can complement the results obtained from benchmarking.
L98|The effect of the production tax credit on wind energy production in deregulated electricity markets|This letter estimates the asymmetric influence of the production tax credit on wind energy production. I find that states with deregulated electricity markets were more responsive to the tax incentive than their regulated counterparts. Excluding any external benefits from wind production, this dissimilarity amounts to a monthly difference of up to $464,450 in federal benefits.
L98|China's electricity market restructuring and technology mandates: Plant-level evidence for changing operational efficiency|China's electricity sector has experienced substantial efficiency improvement during the last one and a half decades. The recent literature has mostly attributed the efficiency improvement to the 2002 unbundling reform with little attention paid to the large scale retrofitting process introduced by technology mandates. Using a unique panel dataset for hundreds of power plants from 1997 to 2010, we are able to examine the contributions from technology mandates and market restructuring. We confirm the significant contributions from the unbundling reform but more importantly, technology mandates have contributed at least half of the observed efficiency improvement during this period. The results have significant implications for efficiency and demand forecast in the future.
L98|Dynamic changes in CO2 emission performance of different types of Iranian fossil-fuel power plants|In this paper, the MNMCPI (metafrontier non-radial Malmquist CO2 emission performance index) is applied to study the CO2 emission performance of different types of Iranian fossil-fuel power plants during the period of 2007–2012. The MNMCPI has several advantages, including the ability to apply group heterogeneity as well as its decomposability to different components, which facilitates identifying the effective factors on performance. The results indicate that the gas-fired and combined cycle power plants have a constant trend and show little progression, while the steam power plants have the worst performance. This is due to the factors such as lack of specified regulations about the type of consumed fuels. Moreover, there does not exist any technological leadership among the fossil-fuel power plants. It was also found that even by considering these conditions, proper resource management and utilizing suitable benchmarks can reduce the current level of CO2 emissions in the power plants up to 25%.
L98|Integrating distributed generation: Regulation and trends in three leading countries|This paper explores the trends in the deployment and integration of distributed generation in Germany, Denmark and Sweden. The study concentrates on the regulation of renewable energy generation with a focus on grid access and connection mechanisms. The high rate of distributed generation penetration is mainly based on the early support that these countries gave to the expansion of renewable energy generation – mainly wind and solar – within their respective national policies. Germany and Denmark are the ones with the most sophisticated support schemes, which have shown a dynamic design over time. In terms of connections, Germany has the most favorable connection regime which provides not only priority connection but also priority grid access for generation units that produce electricity from renewable energy sources. Sweden guarantees equal treatment among different technologies (i.e. a non-discrimination principle). High connection costs have been observed specially in Germany and Denmark. The costs of network upgrades are usually socialised across demand customers. However, integration issues should be taken into consideration in order to avoid expansion of distributed generation in a way which unnecessarily raises total system costs, via high connection costs.
L98|Electromobility in Norway: Experiences and Opportunities|Electrification will reduce environmental impacts and greenhouse gas emissions from transport. Electric propulsion is energy efficient, and does not cause local pollution. In 2013 the new vehicle market share of electric vehicles (EVs) was 5.8%. and 80% were owned by private consumers. This paper explores some possible explanations to the Norwegian development by describing the electromobility story, the incentives given and the attitudes among users. A long lasting interaction between private enterprises, public authorities and non-government organizations combined with a taxation system that gives the authorities opportunity to influence vehicle purchase, and to compensate for marketing challenges related to price, have supported the Norwegian diffusion of electromobility. In addition a high share of multi-vehicle households and a publicly supported expansion of charging stations have made range challenges manageable. The Norwegian market is expected to continue to grow as more models are coming into the market and given the governmental decision to extend the economic incentives until the end of 2017. Rapid development of the technology and policies makes firm conclusions for other countries challenging to make. Further research should include several countries and broader cost/benefit and life-cycle analyses.
L98|When supply travels far beyond demand: Causes of oversupply in Spain's transport infrastructure|Spain's transport infrastructure policy has become a paradigmatic case of oversupply and of mismatch with demand. The massive expansion of the country's transport infrastructure over the last decade has not been a response to demand bottlenecks or previously identified needs. For this reason, the intensity of use today on all interurban modes of transport in Spain falls well below that of other EU countries. This paper analyzes the institutional and regulatory factors that have permitted this policy, allowing us to draw lessons from the Spanish case that should help other countries avoid the pitfalls and shortcomings of Spanish policy. Based on our analysis, we also discuss policy remedies and suggest reforms in different regulatory areas, which could help improve the performance of Spain's infrastructure policy.

L98|Public Engagement in Electricity Network Development: A Case Study of the Beauly–Denny Project in Scotland|Ambitious renewable energy targets and an aging infrastructure necessitate a substantial upgrading and expansion of the electricity transmission networks around Europe and beyond. Although vital for the functioning of the economy, grid development projects are often met by public opposition, which increase costs and lengthy planning processes. The current planning processes have proven ineffective at resolving the conflicts among stakeholders, indicating the need for a new approach. We analyse these issues from an Economic perspective, outlining the economic characteristics of transmission developments and public engagement. We identify previously overlooked features of the planning process that are contributing to the rise in conflicts, public opposition and prolonged project realisation. The Scottish Beauly-Denny high voltage transmission development is discussed in detail and our findings indicate a need for increased engagement with local communities at an earlier stage of planning. Trust between communities, developers and government is important for future negotiations and can be achieved through transparency, specific education and set guidelines for stakeholder engagement in the planning process.
L98|In Search of ‘Good’ Energy Policy: The Social Limits to Technological Solutions to Energy and Climate Problems|This paper seeks to explore the nature of ‘Good’ Energy Policy by offering a multi-disciplinary social science and humanities perspective on policy making. The objective in doing this is to understand how to get from where we are today to a ‘better’ energy policy. We begin by discussing what we mean by ‘policy’. We then go on to characterise and challenge the technologists’ approach to energy policy. Next we discuss some key intellectual starting points that explain why policy making in this area is so difficult. We then turn to a set of multi-disciplinary social science and humanities perspectives on energy policy that together form promising areas for research. These are: perception; quantification; well-being; public trust; role of the state; competence and hubris in delivery; and parallels with healthcare. We close by discussing how these perspectives can illuminate whether a policy is ‘good’, ‘bad’ or something in between.
L98|The Persistence of Moral Suasion and Economic Incentives: Field Experimental Evidence from Energy Demand|Firms and governments often use moral suasion and economic incentives to influence intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for various economic activities. To investigate the persistence of such interventions, we randomly assigned households to moral suasion and dynamic pricing that stimulate energy conservation during peak demand hours. Using household-level consumption data for 30-minute intervals, we find significant short-run effects of moral suasion, but the effects diminished quickly after repeated interventions. Economic incentives produced larger and persistent effects, which induced habit formation after the final interventions. While each policy produces substantial welfare gains, economic incentives provide particularly large gains when we consider persistence.
L98|Integrating renewable energy sources into electricity markets: Power system operation, resource adequacy and market design|Focusing on the Italian power system, the article examines how the national regulatory framework has been modified to effectively accommodate and further increase the share of renewable energy in the energy mix while preserving system reliability. This paper argues that operational changes and regulatory measures adopted so far, which are mainly directed to create a level playing field between different energy sources, constitute a short-term response, and thus of limited effectiveness while increasing cost for consumers. To intensify the de-carbonization process of the Italian power system a more fundamental revision of the current market design is required. In this view, an essential ingredient is the future expansion of the electricity grid starting from a clear recognition of energy mix that we intend to reach in the mid/long term.
L98|Effects of fossil fuel prices on the transition to a low-carbon economy|The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the role that fossil fuel prices have in bringing about a transition to a low carbon economy. This is a very broad, complex and potentially ambiguous question. It requires a good understanding of the factors that can shape long run fossil fuel price trends as well as an understanding of how energy transitions take place, and more specifically how an unprecedented policy-driven global energy transition can be orchestrated. The paper starts with the theory and historical evidence of resource and energy prices with a key message that over the very long run prices of energy services have shown a steady decline. The paper explains why a focus on oil is warranted, discusses the key determinants of oil prices and presents a brief history of recent oil price patterns. It also considers the connection of oil prices with recessions, what the future might bring for fossil fuel prices, and the potential implications of an end to cheap oil for the transition to a low-carbon economy. Finally, it looks into some facets of the interaction between fossil fuel prices and climate policy with a special focus on the role of carbon prices and how these must ultimately be part of a much broader strategy for an effective transition to a low carbon economy that is robust to alternative oil price trajectories.
L98|Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) Licensing Terms - Research Analysis of a Controversial Concept|The complexity of standards in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) creates a tension between the need to reward the owners of Standard Essential Patents (SEPs) that may cover standard specifications and the need to make standards available to all for public use. In the last few years, this tension has crystallized into a difficult debate on licensing principles that must be Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND or FRAND licensing). The purpose of this report is to provide a balanced account of the current controversy relating to the FRAND licensing of standard essential patents and to explore future research topics in this area. It draws on the arguments that arose at an expert workshop held under Chatham House rules at the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) and on an extensive review of the related literature.
L98|Do Infrastructure Reforms Reduce the Effect of Corruption? Theory and Evidence from Latin America and the Caribbean|This paper investigates the interaction between corruption and governance at the sector level. A simple model illustrates how both an increase in regulatory autonomy and privatization may influence the effect of corruption. The interaction is analyzed empirically using a fixed-effects estimator on a panel of 153 electricity distribution firms across 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean from 1995–2007. Greater corruption is associated with lower firm labor productivity, but this association is reduced when an independent regulatory agency is present. These results survive a range of robustness checks, including instrumenting for regulatory governance, controlling for a large range of observables, and using several different corruption measures. The association between corruption and productivity also appears weaker for privately owned firms compared to publicly owned firms, though this result is somewhat less robust.
L98|Budgetary Interests and the Degree of Unbundling in Electricity Markets - An Empirical Analysis for OECD Countries|The degree of liberalization in OECD electricity markets varies considerably across countries. Commonly explained by diverging economic performances, corruption levels or government ideologies, this paper suggest another potential reason for cross-national differences in market reforms: given the high financial dependence of regulatory actors on public funding both in the past and nowadays, we expect regulators to increasingly refrain from [foster] the implementation of liberalization steps, the more such measures reduce [raise] the revenues of a tax; this prevents [aims at realizing] substantial decreases [increases] in public revenues (being a major source of regulatory funds) and thus most likely also in the regulators' budgets. Estimation results substantiate these considerations for both the corporate income tax and (in cases of a high price elasticity of power demand) the VAT on electricity.
L98|Does Regulatory Independence Translate into a Higher Degree of Liberalization? - Evidence from EU Energy Regulators|Independent regulatory authorities are a basic prerequisite for a successful liberalization process. However, contrary to what is expected, both graphical analyses and OLS regressions for a small sample of electricity and gas regulators operating in 16 European countries reveal a negative relationship between the authorities' formal autonomy from politicians and the scope of market reforms. These findings might suffer from endogeneity, though, so we draw on political scientists' explanations for diverging independence levels to construct appropriate instruments. The 2SLS-IV results then confirm conventional wisdom: the higher the degree of regulatory autonomy, the higher the level of liberalization.

L98|Prices based on current cost or historical cost: How different are they?|In 1996, The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prescribed total element long-run incremental cost (TELRIC) to determine rates incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) charge for most mandated wholesale services. TELRIC, which bases prices on a hypothetical incumbent that serves current volumes with completely new equipment, was a major departure from the predominant use of historical (or original) costs for regulated prices. The FCC made two exceptions: total service resale of local exchange services and rental of space by cable television providers and competitive local exchange carriers on poles and conduit owned by electric utilities and ILECs are based on original cost calculations. The FCC’s use of both current cost and historical cost methodologies recalls the fierce debates over whether regulated rates should be based on replacement (current) costs or original (historical costs) that preceded the US Supreme Court’s 1944 FPC v Hope decision. Parties advocating low rates favored replacement costs when equipment costs were expected to decrease, but original costs when such asset prices would be expected to increase. The Hope decision upheld the Federal Power Commission’s use of original costs, which subsequently were widely used by federal and state regulators. While rates based on current costs have, indeed, differed in the expected way from the corresponding rates based on historical costs, this paper demonstrates that (1) the large differences expected by conventional wisdom are the result of faulty application of the current cost methodology and (2) proper application substantially narrows the difference between the rates produced by the respective approaches.

L98|The Anatomy of Physician Payments: Contracting Subject to Complexity|Why do private insurers closely link their physician payment rates to the Medicare fee schedule despite its well-known limitations? We ask to what extent this relationship reflects the use of Medicare's relative price menu as a benchmark, in order to reduce transaction costs in a complex pricing environment. We analyze 91 million claims from a large private insurer, which represent $7.8 billion in spending over four years. We estimate that 75 percent of services, accounting for 55 percent of spending, are benchmarked to Medicare's relative prices. The Medicare-benchmarked share is higher for services provided by small physician groups. It is lower for capital-intensive treatment categories, for which Medicare's average-cost reimbursements deviate most from marginal cost. When the insurer deviates from Medicare's relative prices, it adjusts towards the marginal costs of treatment. Our results suggest that providers and private insurers coordinate around Medicare's menu of relative payments for simplicity, but innovate when the value of doing so is likely highest.
L98|Investment, Subsidies, and Universal Service: Broadband Internet in the United States|Access to the internet is critical for participating in modern society, yet, 17% of Americans lack access to broadband internet, according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). A key objective of the FCC is to promote policies that advance the availability of quality telecommunications services across the United States. To that end, the FCC has recently secured funding to provide subsidies to internet service providers on a massive scale, and has been given considerable flexibility in the distribution of these funds. The aim of this paper is to identify the determinants of internet service providers' decisions about entry into new markets and upgrades to existing infrastructure, and to use this information to provide policy recommendations about how to target subsidies in order to best accomplish the longstanding goal of Universal Service. To do this, I develop a dynamic model, which encapsulates potential entrants' decisions to enter new markets as a low-speed or high-speed provider, as well as incumbents' decisions to upgrade their infrastructure, maintain service, or exit markets. I then estimate this model using data from the National Broadband Map, a recent initiative to precisely track availability of broadband internet across the United States. Then, I use this model to perform counterfactuals, which generate predictions of firm behaviors under a variety of proposed subsidy structures.
L98|Raising the Potential of the Domestically Oriented Sector in Germany|Germany’s manufacturing sector, which plays an important role for exports, has been performing well over the past decade in terms of labour productivity growth and international competitiveness. However, the services sector has had much slower growth rates. Competition often appears to be hindered by protection of incumbents. Reforming and deregulating the domestically oriented sectors, including network industries, crafts and professional services would release hidden growth potential and prove beneficial to the economy as a whole. It could also help strengthen domestic demand and reduce dependence on exports. This Working Paper relates to the 2014 Economic Survey of Germany (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-germany.htm). Relever le potentiel des secteurs orientés sur le marché intérieur en Allemagne Au cours de la dernière décennie, le secteur manufacturier allemand, qui joue un rôle important dans les exportations, a enregistré de bons résultats, en termes de hausse de la productivité de la main-d’oeuvre comme de compétitivité internationale. Le secteur des services en revanche affiche des taux de croissance bien plus modestes. Il semble que la concurrence y ait souvent été entravée du fait de la protection des entreprises en place. Réformer et déréglementer les secteurs orientés sur le marché intérieur, notamment les industries de réseau, l’artisanat et les services professionnels, permettrait de libérer le potentiel de croissance caché et serait bénéfique pour l’économie dans son ensemble, et contribuerait en outre à renforcer la demande intérieure et à réduire la dépendance par rapport aux exportations. Ce document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE de l’Allemagne, 2014 (www.oecd.org/fr/eco/etudes/etude-economique-allemagne.htm).
L98|Improving infrastructure in the United Kingdom|The United Kingdom (UK) has spent less on infrastructure compared to other OECD countries over the past three decades. The perceived quality of UK infrastructure assets is close to the OECD average but lower than in other G7 countries. Capacity constraints have emerged in some sectors, such as electricity generation, air transport and roads. Developing and regularly updating a national infrastructure strategy, with the National Infrastructure Plan being a welcome first step in this direction, would contribute to reduce policy uncertainty and tackle capacity constraints in a durable way. The design of coherent development plans by local authorities congruent with the national and local planning systems should continue to improve project delivery. The government intends to finance a large share of infrastructure spending to 2020 and beyond through private capital. Unlocking private investment in a cost effective and transparent way could be supported by further improving incentives for greenfield investment, continuing to carefully assess and record public-private partnerships, and promoting more long-term financing instruments. This Working Paper relates to the 2015 OECD Economic Survey of the United Kingdom (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-united-kingdom.htm). Améliorer les infrastructures au Royaume-Uni Au Royaume-Uni, les dépenses dans les infrastructures ont été inférieures à ce qu’elles ont été dans d’autres pays de l’OCDE au cours des trois dernières décennies. La perception de la qualité des actifs d’infrastructure y est comparable à la moyenne de l’OCDE, mais est plus faible que dans les autres pays du G7. Des contraintes de capacité se sont fait jour dans certains secteurs comme la production d’électricité, le transport aérien ou le réseau routier. L’élaboration et l’actualisation régulière d’une stratégie nationale en matière d’infrastructures, avec le Plan National d’Infrastructure étant une première étape bienvenue en ce sens, contribuerait à réduire les incertitudes au niveau de l’action publique et de s’attaquer de manière durable aux contraintes de capacité. La conception, par les collectivités locales, de plans de développement cohérents conformes aux systèmes de planification nationaux et locaux améliorerait la livraison de projets. Le gouvernement a l’intention de financer une grande partie des dépenses d’infrastructures jusqu’en 2020 et au-delà en mobilisant des capitaux privés. Le déverrouillage de l’investissement privé de manière transparente et avec un bon rapport coût/efficacité pourrait être soutenu en améliorant les incitations à investir dans des installations entièrement nouvelles, de recenser et d’évaluer soigneusement les partenariats public-privé et de promouvoir de nouveaux instruments de financement à long terme.
L98|Research Trends Of Public-Private Partnerships (Ppps) In Poland|Over the last two decades the attention given to the research on Public-private partnerships (PPPs) has been steadily increasing. Literature surveys on the research trends of PPP in English language publications suggest some emerging trends in the topics dedicated to the PPP. A similar compilation of PPP literature is not readily available on the grounds of national scientific research. That is why the aim of the article is to present contemporary trends that are being developed in Poland in the PPP filed. The indication of possible further research in the area of PPP is also an essential issue tackled in this article.
L98|The Willingness To Pay By Households For Improved Reliability Of Electricity Service|This research examines households’ willingness to pay (WTP) for an improved electricity service. Households’ WTP is estimated using the contingent valuation (CV) method on data from 350 in-person interviews in North Cyprus. In order to avoid the cost of outages, households are willing to incur a 13.5% increase in their monthly electricity bill. A cost–benefit analysis (CBA) indicates that the annualized economic benefits of improved reliability of the electricity service would be approximately USD 37.8 million for the residential sector alone. This figure is more than enough to finance the investments needed to completely eradicate any electricity outages. In addition, the fuel savings from substituting the generation of the new plants for the old plants would yield about USD 44.6 million per year in fuel savings. Hence, a change from the current low-reliability policy to one of providing a high-quality service would yield an economic net present value to the residents of North Cyprus of over 2.5 times the investment costs or USD 226 million within five years.
L98|Developing Myanmar’s Information and Communication Technology Sector toward Inclusive Growth|Myanmar’s recent socioeconomic and political reforms have signaled a readiness to reintegrate into the world economy. To leapfrog the economy and accelerate growth, the country should take advantage of digital technology. This paper assesses Myanmar’s information and communication technology sector, identifies constraints the sector faces, and recommends policies that will help the government overcome them. Given limited public resources, Myanmar will need help translating its information and communication technology infrastructure needs into financially viable and bankable projects that can attract private sector financing.
L98|A Typology of Rural Airports in the United States: Evaluating Network Accessibility|Since deregulation of the airline industry in 1978, carriers have largely focused their commercial service efforts on medium and large hub airports located in metropolitan areas with sufficient demand for air travel services. These profitable locations often cross-subsidize service to smaller hubs, which can function as feeder nodes/links to the larger hub-to-hub carrier network. However, as fuel and labor costs continue to increase for commercial carriers, reductions and terminations of air service in smaller rural markets are common, reducing carrier footprints and leaving many regions of the United States without viable air transport options. To be clear, this is not a new development. Many rural and remote airports are all too familiar with service reductions, which is why safeguards such as the Essential Air Service program continue to operate. The purpose of this paper is to explore the network and geographic context of airports in the U.S., evaluating relative accessibility and using this information to develop a typology of rural airports for the U.S. Implications for policy and transportation planning are discussed.
L98|Issues and Options in the Economic Regulation of European Network Security|Incentive regulation needs to adapt to the emerging changes in the operating environment of the electricity networks and take into account the security of these. This paper assesses the current issues and options in economic regulation of network security across the European electricity systems. An output-oriented incentive regulatory approach combines the efficiency promoting mechanisms in a revenue cap framework with output-based incentives such as better provision of network security. Thus, incentive regulation is destined to move from pursuing the optimal to being more practical. The RIIO regulatory framework in the UK and the service quality regulation in Italy provide good examples of application of output-based regulation. We also propose an output-based approach for regulation of network security, which accounts for the risks from natural, accidental and malicious threats. We conclude that regulation for network security may also require looking beyond economic network regulation and focus on the wider security policy and regulation interface considering the risks facing the electricity networks.
L98|Will the U.S. and EU telecommunications policies converge? A survey|Currently, U.S. and EU telecommunications policies differ in many respects. For example, wholesale access to local loops is largely deregulated in the U.S. but continues to be regulated in the EU. Or, the U.S. has an elaborate universal service policy with a set of universal service funds and specific policies for high-cost regions and low-income users, while universal service policies in the EU are much more sporadic. Will the forceful technical and market developments that are associated with IP convergence, next generation access (NGA) and mobile broadband (4G) lead to a convergence of telecommunications policies in the U.S. and EU? Based on a survey of the relevant U.S. and EU related economics literature the current paper addresses this issue for the five policy areas of interconnection, wholesale loop access, net neutrality, spectrum policy and universal service. While IP convergence and the spread of 4G are likely to enhance policy convergence, NGA could have a different effect to the extent that the penetration of and the competitive properties of NGA depend on legacy infrastructures that differ between the two continents.

L98|Dynamics of yardstick regulation: Historical cost data and the ratchet effect|Real life applications of yardstick regulation frequently refer to historical cost data. While yardstick regulation cuts the link between firms own costs and prices firms may charge in a static setting, it does not do so in a dynamic setting where historical cost data is used. A firm can influence the price it will be allowed to charge in the future if its behavior today can affect future behavior of other firms that determines the price this firm will be able to charge later on. This paper shows that, assuming that slack, inflation of costs, is beneficial to firms, a trade-off between short term profit through abstinence from slack in (infinitely) many periods arises. A ratchet effect that yardstick regulation was meant to overcome can occur and firms can realize positive rents because of the use of historical cost data, even if firms are identical. Equilibria with positive slack can exist without any collusion between firms or threat. Moreover, this problem is more severe if the firm with lowest costs of all other firms instead of the average firm is the yardstick.
L98|Do Consumers Respond to Marginal or Average Price? Evidence from Nonlinear Electricity Pricing|Nonlinear pricing and taxation complicate economic decisions by creating multiple marginal prices for the same good. This paper provides a framework to uncover consumers' perceived price of nonlinear price schedules. I exploit price variation at spatial discontinuities in electricity service areas, where households in the same city experience substantially different nonlinear pricing. Using household-level panel data from administrative records, I find strong evidence that consumers respond to average price rather than marginal or expected marginal price. This suboptimizing behavior makes nonlinear pricing unsuccessful in achieving its policy goal of energy conservation and critically changes the welfare implications of nonlinear pricing.
L98|The Costs and Consequences of Clean Air Act Regulation of CO2 from Power Plants|US climate policy is unfolding under the Clean Air Act. Mobile source and construction permitting regulations are in place. Most important, EPA and the states will determine the form and stringency of the regulations for power plants. Various approaches would create an implicit price on emitting greenhouse gases and create valuable assets that would be distributed differently among electricity producers, consumers, and the government. We compare a tradable performance standard with several cap-and-trade policies. Distributing asset values to fossil-fueled producers and consumers has small effects on average electricity prices but imposes greater social cost than a revenue-raising policy.
L98|Why Are Power Plants in India Less Efficient Than Power Plants in the United States?|India's coal-fired generating capacity doubled between 1990 and 2010 and currently accounts for 70 percent of electricity produced. Despite this, thermal efficiency at state-owned coal-fired power plants in India is significantly lower than at plants in the United States. When matched on age and capacity, heat input per kWh was 8 percent higher at Indian plants between 1997 and 2009. This can only partly be explained by the lower heat content of Indian coal. Electricity sector restructuring in the United States improved thermal efficiency at investor-owned plants; however, electricity sector restructuring in India has yet to improve thermal efficiency at state-owned coal-fired power plants.
L98|Pass-Through of Emissions Costs in Electricity Markets|We measure the pass-through of emissions costs to electricity prices. We perform both reduced-form and structural estimations based on optimal bidding in this market. Using rich micro-level data, we estimate the channels affecting pass-through in a flexible manner, with minimal functional form assumptions. Contrary to many studies in the general pass-through literature, we find that emissions costs are almost fully passed-through to electricity prices. Since electricity is traded through high-frequency auctions for highly inelastic demand, firms have weak incentives to adjust markups after the cost shock. Furthermore, the costs of price adjustment are small.
L98|Corporate Incentives and Nuclear Safety|Following electricity market restructuring, approximately half of all commercial US nuclear power reactors were sold by price-regulated public utilities to independent power producers. At the time of the sales, some policymakers raised concerns that these corporations would ignore safety. Others claimed that the sales would bring improved reactor management, with positive effects on safety. Using data on various safety measures and a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, I find that safety improved following ownership transfers and the removal of price regulations. Generation increased, and this does not appear to have come at the cost of public safety.
L98|Efficiency and Substitutability of Transit Subsidies and Other Urban Transport Policies|This paper analyzes the efficiency of and the substitutability between three urban congestion management policies: transit subsidization, car congestion pricing, and dedicated bus lanes. The model features user heterogeneity, cross-congestion effects between cars and transit, intertemporal and total transport demand elasticities, and is simulated using data for London, UK and Santiago, Chile. We find that the substitutability between policies is large and, in particular, the marginal contribution of increased transit subsidies, as other policies are implemented first, diminishes rapidly. Bus lanes are an attractive way to increase frequencies and decrease fares without injecting public funds.
L98|Brazilian Regulatory Interventions, Volatility and Contagion: A VIRF analysis|This paper examines how regulatory interventions can affect the market risk of electricity utilities and telecom carriers traded in the Brazilian stock market (BOVESPA). Our article uses a bivariate Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH - BEKK) model to analyze the impact of two relevant and surprising measures taken by the correspondent Brazilian regulatory authorities in 2012 (one in each sector) on both markets’ volatilities and covariance. We also adopt the volatility impulse response function (VIRF) developed by Hafner & Herwartz (2006) to estimate their persistence. On the one hand, the results indicate that the effects of the telecommunications’ regulatory intervention are negligible but, on the other hand, the impact of the electricity's regulatory measure is significant, long-lasting and contagious.
L98|Harnessing the Power of ICT and Innovation Case Study Singapore|The penetration and effects of ICT varies amongst countries. For small countries like Singapore the effects of ICT is especially prominent. This paper focuses on how Singapore exploited the benefits of ICT by analyzing first the evolution of ICT policies and the important role of the government in its development. Followed by the question how ICT has impacted the country. Looking at the impact of ICT both in the ICT sector as well as the penetration of ICT in households. The conclusions refer to additional actions that the government should focus on to further exploit the benefits of ICT in Singapore.
L98|Competition in Telecommunications and Internet Services: Problems with Asymmetric Regulations|With the digital convergence of internet services markets and telecommunications markets, the issue of a common, consistent regulation has become more important. While Google or Facebook can exploit knowledge about the content of “data mails” or SMS, data protection rules for telecommunication operators are different – they cannot use info about “structural content” and are thus unable to generate high revenues from advertising that is based on knowledge about structural content. Internet service providers thus can cross-subsidize digital communication services and thereby gain market shares - based on cross-subsidization - in traditional telecommunication markets. Thus there is a fundamental inconsistency of regulations for internet service providers and telecommunication operators which should be remedied by new global rules for the emerging global communications market. The EU and the US, as well as other countries, plus the ITU should launch a joint initiative in order to create a global level playing field.
L98|The Role of State-Firm Relationships in Fostering Competitiveness: Telefonicaâ€™s Upgrading|This paper examines the structures behind competitive transformation in telecommunications. The analysis is based on qualitative evidence from Telefonicaâ€™s transformation since the mid-1980s and comparisons with BT, Orange, and Deutsche Telekom. Telecommunications is a critical industry whose services are crucial inputs for most economic activities. Telefonicaâ€™s upgrading remains a rare example in which a non-leading firm reached the efficiency frontier. I argue that Telefonicaâ€™s upgrading cannot be explained without defining business-state interactions in Spain and characterizing the impact of the shift from the natural monopoly to the market paradigm. Spain resolved the tension between government objectives to universalise service and Telefonicaâ€™s concern for profitability through a non-hierarchical system of negotiated interactions and mutual exchanges that helped the state and the incumbent further their respective goals. Overall, this paper enters into the debate about the stateâ€™s role in industrial transformation and provides insights about the conditions that favour competitiveness in telecommunications.
L98|Evaluating a Decade of Mobile Termination Rate Regulation|We reâ€ consider the impact that regulation of call termination on mobile phones has had on mobile customersâ€™ bills. Using a large panel covering 27 countries, we find that the â€˜waterbedâ€™ phenomenon, initially observed until early 2006, becomes insignificant on average over the 10â€ year period, 2002â€“11. We argue that this is related to the changing nature of the industry, whereby mobileâ€ toâ€ mobile traffic now plays a much bigger role compared to fixedâ€ toâ€ mobile calls in earlier periods. Over the same decade, we find no evidence that regulation caused a reduction in mobile operatorsâ€™ profits and investments.
L98|External Constraints Matter for Privatizations|We present an analysis of the share of public ownership in the product market in the OECD countries from 1974 to 2007. Despite much has been said on the broad topic of reforms and regulation, a sector-specific insight is missing. We replicate the analysis of Galasso (2014) by sector of activity accounting both for the dynamic bias of the lagged public ownership and the degree of state ownership at the beginning of the period. At the aggregate level both persistence and initial conditions play a major role, together with the European Single Market Program membership. Specifically, EMU members have a smaller share of public ownership in the electricity sector, while SMP members have less privatized telecommunications. Looking at the sub-sample of years when a change in the share of public ownership occurred, we find a composition effect of SMP: it has a negative impact on public ownership in telecommunications, but a positive one in the rail sector. Overall, we find that the countries in our sample tend to privatize mainly when decision taken at the supranational level (the EU for European countries) push towards this policy.
L98|Regionale Wirtschaftsentwicklung in Ostdeutschland und Sachsen bis 2030: Ergebnisse einer Projektionsrechnung|Das BUNDESMINISTERIUM FÜR VERKEHR UND DIGITALE INFRASTRUKTUR arbeitet derzeit an der Aufstellung eines neuen Bundesverkehrswegeplans, der bis zum Jahr 2015 vorgelegt werden soll. Eine wichtige Grundlage hierfür ist eine realistische Vorausschätzung der künftigen Verkehrsentwicklung in Deutschland nach Regionen und Verkehrsträgern. Diese wiederum muss sich auf kleinräumige Prognosen über die künftige wirtschaftliche Entwicklung in Deutschland stützen. Die vorgestellten Ergebnisse der Projektionsrechnungen deuten darauf hin, dass die Wachstumsperspektiven Ostdeutschlands langfristig zwar positiv sind, die erreichten Zuwachsraten des Bruttoinlandsprodukts aber doch unter jahresdurchschnittlich einem Prozent liegen. Sie bleiben damit hinter der wahrscheinlichen Entwicklung für Westdeutschland zurück. Es ist allerdings auch zu beachten, dass sich der zentrale Wohlstandsindikator, das Pro-Kopf-Einkommen, deutlich günstiger entwickeln wird. So wächst das Pro-Kopf-Einkommen Ostdeutschlands laut der durchgeführten Projektionsrechnung im Jahresdurchschnitt um immerhin 1,33 % und damit in etwa genauso stark wie in Westdeutschland.

La oferta de agua según la estimación realizada hace 10 años en el anterior plan de abastecimiento era de 21 m3/seg; sin embargo, diferentes razones climáticas, ambientales y sociales han comprometido la calidad del agua en la Cuenca Alta del Río de Bogotá, por lo cual las estimaciones se han reajustado hasta 16-19 m3/seg. Lo anterior implica que se deberán efectuar inversiones para atender la demanda creciente de la región. La Empresa de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Bogotá encomendó a Fedesarrollo realizar un análisis de la coyuntura de los recursos hídricos en Bogotá y los municipios de la región. Este estudio se enfoca en la identificación de los diferentes factores que afectan las actuales tendencias de demanda y oferta de agua potable y alcantarillado y su posible impacto a 2032 desde el punto de vista demográfico, económico, territorial y ambiental. Por el lado de la oferta, el creciente deterioro en la calidad de las fuentes hídricas está afectando la capacidad de suministro, pues en ocasiones la captación de agua con características fisicoquímicas adecuadas para el tratamiento no es suficiente. Este deterioro progresivo está ligado al desorden en el crecimiento del territorio, ya que en los últimos años se han asentado actividades humanas en zonas que impactan la calidad del agua. Del lado de la demanda, el crecimiento de la población, el aumento del ingreso de la población y políticas como la del mínimo vital jalonarán el crecimiento del consumo de agua, y la apuesta por una ciudad más compacta implicará una recomposición de la demanda de agua en su interior. Finalmente, como complemento, el estudio también analiza la política del mínimo vital en el servicio de agua en Bogotá, con la cual la administración distrital tiene el objetivo de reducir la desigualdad y generar un mayor ingreso disponible para las familias pobres de la ciudad. Las situaciones descritas, sumadas al envejecimiento de las redes actuales en la ciudad de Bogotá, hacen necesario que se impulsen estrategias de gestión del territorio y mecanismos de financiamiento de nuevas inversiones por parte de la ciudad y la región. En este contexto, este estudio plantea estrategias para una gestión integral del recurso hídrico que permita responder a las necesidades de agua en la región.
L98|La industria en colombia: tres décadas sin política sectorial -Consecuencias sobre empleo e ingresos en el sector-|El artículo busca establecer la relación entre la política pública relacionada con la industria, formulada desde finales de los años 80 en Colombia y las consecuencias que tuvo tanto sobre la configuración productiva como sobre el mundo del trabajo en el sector. Los resultados apuntan a la ausencia de una política industrial activa por parte de los gobiernos de todo el periodo y el énfasis en una estrategia transversal para introducir ciencia y tecnología a los procesos. Sin embargo el análisis evidencia que este propósito se quedó en el enunciado pues no fueron tomadas acciones específicas para lograrlo. Como consecuencia el patrón de crecimiento nacional se desindustrializó. Los impactos para los trabajadores fueron negativos: disminución del empleo manufacturero frente al empleo total, estancamiento relativo de los salarios reales frente al crecimiento de la productividad laboral y aumento de la brecha en la apropiación del excedente generado. La estructura productiva industrial se transformó hacia una mayor intensidad en bienes relacionados con actividades extractivas, en desmedro de las intensivas en conocimiento, contrario a lo que pregonaba la estrategia oficial. Finalmente, la política económica planteada por el gobierno del Presidente Juan Manuel Santos en su primer periodo no se orientó a cambiar estas tendencias de largo plazo.
L98|Flight cancellation as a reaction to the tarmac delay rule: An unintended consequence of enhanced passenger protection|We examine the effects of the US DOT׳s tarmac delay rule (effective April 29, 2010) on flight cancellations and gate departure delays, using carrier-level panel data for the period between May 2008 and April 2012. Our results suggest the DOT׳s investigations of tarmac delay incidents triggered risk-averse behavior by investigated carriers, which increased flight cancellations and gate departure delays to avoid violating the rule. Carriers׳ preemptive flight cancellations are estimated to have affected about 308,900 passengers in 2011 alone. The results also suggest that these side effects persist for at least two years after the investigations, having larger adverse effects on passengers booked on the highest and lowest frequency routes. The costs and benefits of the rule need reevaluation.
L98|Aviation fuel demand development in China|This paper analyzes the core factors and the impact path of aviation fuel demand in China and conducts a structural decomposition analysis of the aviation fuel cost changes and increase of the main aviation enterprises’ business profits. Through the establishment of an integrated forecast model for China’s aviation fuel demand, this paper confirms that the significant rise in China’s aviation fuel demand because of increasing air services demand is more than offset by higher aviation fuel efficiency. There are few studies which use a predictive method to decompose, estimate and analyze future aviation fuel demand. Based on a structural decomposition with indirect prediction, aviation fuel demand is decomposed into efficiency and total amount (aviation fuel efficiency and air transport total turnover). The core influencing factors for these two indexes are selected using path analysis. Then, univariate and multivariate models (ETS/ARIMA model and Bayesian multivariate regression) are used to analyze and predict both aviation fuel efficiency and air transport total turnover. At last, by integrating results, future aviation fuel demand is forecast. The results show that the aviation fuel efficiency goes up by 0.8% as the passenger load factor increases 1%; the air transport total turnover goes up by 3.8% and 0.4% as the urbanization rate and the per capita GDP increase 1%, respectively. By the end of 2015, China’s aviation fuel demand will have increased to 28 million tonnes, and is expected to be 50 million tonnes by 2020. With this in mind, increases in the main aviation enterprises’ business profits must be achieved through the further promotion of air transport.
L98|Marginal abatement cost curves and the optimal timing of mitigation measures|Decision makers facing abatement targets need to decide which abatement measures to implement, and in which order. Measure-explicit marginal abatement cost curves depict the cost and abating potential of available mitigation options. Using a simple intertemporal optimization model, we demonstrate why this information is not sufficient to design emission reduction strategies. Because the measures required to achieve ambitious emission reductions cannot be implemented overnight, the optimal strategy to reach a short-term target depends on longer-term targets. For instance, the best strategy to achieve European's −20% by 2020 target may be to implement some expensive, high-potential, and long-to-implement options required to meet the −75% by 2050 target. Using just the cheapest abatement options to reach the 2020 target can create a carbon-intensive lock-in and make the 2050 target too expensive to reach. Designing mitigation policies requires information on the speed at which various measures to curb greenhouse gas emissions can be implemented, in addition to the information on the costs and potential of such measures provided by marginal abatement cost curves.
L98|Biomass for electricity in the EU-27: Potential demand, CO2 abatements and breakeven prices for co-firing|This paper analyses the potential of biomass-based electricity in the EU-27 countries, and interactions with climate policy and the EU ETS. We estimate the potential biomass demand from the existing power plants, and we match our estimates with the potential biomass supply in Europe. Furthermore, we compute the CO2 abatement associated with the co-firing opportunities in European coal plants. We find that the biomass demand from the power sector may be very high compared with potential supply. We also identify that co-firing can produce high volumes of CO2 abatements, which may be two times larger than that of the coal-to-gas fuel switching. We also compute biomass and CO2 breakeven prices for co-firing. Results indicate that biomass-based electricity remains profitable with high biomass prices, when the carbon price is high: a Euros 16–24 (25–35, respectively) biomass price (per MWhprim) for a Euros 20 (50, respectively) carbon price. Hence, the carbon price appears as an important driver, which can make profitable a high share of the potential biomass demand from the power sector, even with high biomass prices. This aims to gain insights on how biomass market may be impacted by the EU ETS and others climate policies.
L98|A valuation of wind power projects in Germany using real regulatory options|This study evaluates a proposed investment in wind power generation using real options from the regulatory framework applicable to the German market (Europe's largest producer of renewable energy). For this evaluation, we have modelled the primary uncertainties affecting the project and we have incorporated the uncertainties arising from public support for renewable energy. These mechanisms generate RROs (real regulatory options) – not in the hands of the project's promoter – that affect the net present value of the project. The inclusion of these mechanisms enriches and improves the valuation methodology of such projects. The comparative analysis of the case study, using other countries, reinforces the idea that the existing RROs depreciate the net present value of renewable generation projects. We believe that the methodology we propose in our paper can help policy makers to improve their policies to promote renewable energy.
L98|Estimating the impact of low-income universal service programs|This policy study uses U.S. Census microdata to evaluate how subsidies for universal telephone service vary in their impact across low-income racial groups, gender, age, and home ownership. Our demand specification includes both the subsidized monthly price (Lifeline program) and the subsidized initial connection price (Linkup program) for local telephone service. Our quasi-maximum likelihood estimation controls for location differences and instruments for price endogeneity. The microdata allow us to estimate the effects of demographics on both elasticities of telephone penetration and the level of telephone penetration. Based on our preferred estimates, the subsidy programs increased aggregate penetration by 6.1% for households below the poverty line. Our results suggest that automatic enrollment programs are important and that Linkup is more cost-effective than Lifeline, which calls into question a recent FCC (2012) decision to reduce Linkup subsidies in favor of Lifeline. Our study can inform the evaluation of similar universal service policies for Internet access.
L98|Should jet fuel surcharges be regulated, and if so, how?|By adding fuel surcharges to base fares, airlines pass on the impact of higher jet fuel prices to consumers. Given the wide range of design options for fuel surcharge schemes, the reduced price transparency and the question of fair cost recovery, fuel surcharges have become a consumer protection issue. The paper reviews the regulatory approach to fuel surcharges in Brazil, the European Union, Japan and the United States. Further, it addresses the complexity of attempts to construct fuel surcharge schemes that rely on estimates of per-passenger fuel costs. The paper concludes that regulatory activities should aim to include fuel surcharges in all initial fare quotes and advertising. Enforcing fuel surcharge schemes that ensure a fair cost recovery would result in high regulatory costs and would also be in conflict with deregulation policies of removing restrictions on airline pricing.
L98|Efficient frontier analysis of Dutch public transport tendering: A first analysis|Dutch public transport provision has been competitively tendered out increasingly since 2001. Except for the Amsterdam city bus services, all bus transport in the country is carried out under a competitively tendered contact. Several evaluations have been carried out on the effects of competitive tendering in the Netherlands. Elsewhere we have seen stochastic frontier studies used to analyze the effects of governance changes. This paper carries out such a study for the Netherlands.
L98|Workshop 3 Report: Institutional and operational reforms within different socio-economic and cultural contexts|The discussion and conclusions of Thredbo's Workshop 3 are summarized. History and the socio-economic environment is a condition that should be considered as a most important fact when moving into planning public transportation. Contradictory targets should be identified and avoided a priori. Income distribution and spatial segregation should be taken into account, together with the necessary transparency and responsibility of parties involved.
L98|Workshop 4 Report: Governance, ownership and competition in deregulated public transport markets|This workshop discussed the functioning of deregulated public transport markets, examining competition options for deregulated markets. The regulatory needs of such market initiative ‘deregulated’ markets have been considered both from practical and theoretical evidence, covering both local and long-distance markets (bus, coach and rail). Practical evidence has been presented from mature deregulated markets (such as buses in Great Britain outside London) and updates on experiments in countries such as Japan, New Zealand and Sweden. Emerging evidence on the liberalisation and deregulation of long-distance and international markets in Europe and elsewhere was considered, both for coach and rail. The devising of ‘rules of the game’ formed a centrepiece in the discussions, looking at alternative ways to organise the regulatory guidance of such markets.
L98|Analysis of intercity bus markets on long distances in an established and a young market: The example of the U.S. and Germany|Recent deregulation in German long distance bus services lead to highly dynamic developments in this market. Long-distance coach services in the U.S. have been deregulated since the 1980th. The aim of this paper is to compare one established and one young/emerging market with the example of the U.S. and Germany. We first investigate how the framework conditions and market structures have developed in both countries. Based on a unique dataset with more than 2000 US and more than 150 German routes including various variables on long-distance coach services, we analyse in a second step the supply and ticket prices in both markets that results from the different regulative settings. The results show that distance, the number of stops and frequency are highly significant determinants explaining the size of ticket price. Regarding competitive behaviour, we identify operators determining significant lower ticket prices in the markets compared to others. Finally, we consider how the spatial structure in the US influences the supply. We find that spatial distribution of the cities as well as demographic attributes such as the size population and the share of white population are determining the supply of intercity bus services in the US.
L98|Market initiative regimes in public transport in Europe: Recent developments|The role played by market initiative regimes in public transport in Europe is growing. Initially limited to Great Britain outside London (1986), a watered down version was implemented in Sweden in 2012, while the 2013 German public transport law allows increasing the role of ‘commercial’ market initiative. Long-distance coach markets was already based on deregulated regimes in Britain, Norway, Sweden and various Central and Eastern European countries, while Germany deregulated this market in 2013 and Italy soon opens up its market as well. Finally, open access competition on the tracks exists in Germany, Sweden, Austria, Italy and the Czech republic, with spectacular results in at least Italy, while the European Commission is pushing for more. This paper reviews these developments, while comparing some of the regulatory features implemented. It confirms a movement away from dogmatism in some countries but it also finds that insufficient attention is being paid to developing adequate regulation for the functioning of market initiative regimes (the ‘rules of the game’), especially concerning the issue of fare integration, hampering the potential success of the reforms.
L98|Developments in public transport governance in the Netherlands: A brief history and recent developments|This paper describes recent developments in the governance of public transport in the Netherlands, focusing on bus, tram, metro and regional train concessions. Most of these concessions are competitively tendered. Competitive tendering was introduced in 2001 and Dutch authorities have since chosen different concession setups and forms of contract remuneration. This paper explores that variety and describes recent changes at the national and regional levels. The paper describes key trends and lessons from the Dutch experience based on a seven-year project drawing lessons on competitive tendering with authorities, operators and consultants, and based on interviews with 16 of the 19 public transport authorities. Key trends are dealing with fragmentation and maturing governance by fine-tuning incentives and cooperation forms between public transport authorities and operators.
L98|The determinants of CAP reform: learning from the European financial crisis and CAP 2013|There is an ongoing debate on which are the determinants of CAP reform. The economic environment has not been contemplated as a directdeterminant of CAP reform but its proxy, the budget, has not only been looked at as such but underlined as a key cause of CAP reform. This paper argues, however, that the budget does not affect the modus operandi of the CAP. It affects the quantity of support each farmer is going to get and sometimes even the timing of the reform, but not the form it is going to receive it. Other CAP determinants andinternational negotiations in particular, have an impact on the substance of CAP reform. This hypothesis is not contradicted by an analysis of CAP 2013 changes.
L98|Progress with Energy Markets in Europe|This paper examines the European Commission’s review published November 2012 of progress towards competitive energy markets. It examines four aspects of the markets: Wholesale energy markets; Retail energy markets; Corporate structure; Impact of smart meters on competition. It also reviews the changes proposed to British energy markets in the government’s Energy Bill also published in November 2012. The privatisation of gas in 1986 and electricity in 1990 in Britain formed the model for the Commission’s Energy Directives and any changes to the British model brought about by perceived failings of the original model are of relevance to the EU. We mostly focus on electricity in this paper although the arguments concerning gas are usually similar.
L98|Renegotiation of Concession Contracts: Empiricla Evidence for Public Transport Infrastructure in Peru|This paper identifies the determinants of renegotiation of concession contracts in transport infrastructure for public use in Peru. Based on the literature of concession contracts, this paper uses a probit model to estimate the probability of renegotiating these contracts. The results indicated that the probability of renegotiate these concession contracts depends on the number of bidders who participated in the bidding process for each concession, the competition factor (decision variable) that determines the winner of the bid; the bidder's previous experience on other concession contracts; the percentage of land given to the operator at the beginning of the concession; the regulatory mechanism; the degree of autonomy of the regulator (in terms of experience and financial resources), and the exchange rate.
L98|Improving speed and frequency in the European rail system: Impact on accessibility and welfare| The report addresses passenger rail transport and its main purpose is to evaluate if and to what extent, reductions of the travel times or increases in train frequency in the European Railway System may lead to an increase in accessibility for users and a reduction of costs, resulting in an increase of consumer's surplus. Various scenarios considered. Two scenarios simulating increases of all speed to 90 km/h and 200km/h, one scenario assuming a decrease to 45 km/h and a scenario of increasing train frequency by 20% have been tested. The results provide insight into which parts of the rail network can provide higher benefits to the users through the improvement of quality of service.
L98|The impact of socio-economic background on satisfaction: evidence for policy-makers|Consumer satisfaction with utility services has received increased attention from firms, consumer associations, regulators and governments since the 1990s. Evidence is mounting that consumers in specific socio-economic groups express lower satisfaction levels than their peers, at least, in some utility markets. Seeing this as part of their remit to protect consumer welfare, governments and international organizations are exploring possible demand-side policy responses with the intention of ameliorating lower satisfaction levels of these groups of consumers. However, more information on the precise relationships between satisfaction and consumers’ socio-economic background is required if policy is to be proportional and effective. This paper provides new empirical knowledge on this topic by contrasting consumers’ stated and revealed preferences for five utility services (electricity, gas, fixed and cellular telephony and Internet) across twelve European countries. We find strong evidence that consumers’ socio-economic characteristics matter: consumers with lower levels of education, the elderly and those not employed exhibit particular expenditure patterns on, and lower satisfaction levels with, some utility services. However, this relationship is uneven and depends on the socio-economic category and service in question. We conclude by highlighting five findings which may be of use to policy-makers when considering whether demand-side regulatory policies are required Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
L98|Subsidies for renewable energy in inflexible power markets|This paper analyses how short-term operational efficiency and the $$\hbox {CO}_{2}$$ CO 2 emissions of a power system depend on different subsidies for wind power and on the flexibility of the power system. This is analysed in the framework of a numerical power market model, calibrated to Danish data, where the start-up costs and other constraints in fossil-fuelled power plants are taken into account. The main conclusion is that flexibility is crucial for the costs of integrating wind power in an existing system. If thermal power plants are inflexible, subsidies for wind power should strive to increase the flexibility of the market by passing market signals to wind power. A subsidy that conceals market signals from wind power producers (a production subsidy) or disconnects wind power incentives from the market signals altogether (a fixed price) increases costs considerably. An inflexible power system should aim to introduce optimal subsidies (an investment subsidy) instead of production subsidies or a fixed price. The design of the subsidy scheme should take into account both the characteristics of the existing system and the characteristics of renewables.

L98|Winners and Losers in the Liberalized Energy Retail Sector in Hungary: A Co-evolutionary Approach|This paper examines the recent history of the Hungarian energy trading market in a co-evolutionary framework. Hungary is characterized by a mixed ownership structure with mainly multinational incumbents in energy retail and distribution, while the wholesale is dominantly owned by state-owned companies. The legal framework also has dual characteristics, with free-market regulation for industrial consumers and a regulated price regime for households. Our research method follows a longitudinal approach from the period of market liberalization in 2008 until 2013. We identified strong relationship between the individual and sector performance of the trading companies and the current political ideology and institutional regime.
L98|Relations between R_D Activities and Tax Allowances in Hungarian Car Trade Companies|The research, development and innovation (R&D&I) activities of enterprises are highly influenced by the socio-economic environment. The product, process, and organizational innovations of enterprises can be stimulated both by direct and indirect tools. In this study, we listed all the R&D related tax allowances that are part of the corporate income tax regulation. By using primary data (including all Hungarian business associations), we analyzed how the car trading companies could utilize the available tax allowances. Our results showed how effective these tax allowances were in stimulating research and development activities. In our study, our main focus was to identify the reason for the low number of innovation activities.
