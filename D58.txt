D58|Potential Effects of Scaling-up Infrastructure in Peru: a General Equilibrium Model-based Analysis|This study assesses the potential economic impacts of investments dedicated to filling infrastructure gaps in Peru. By using a national database at the firm level, we start by empirically estimating the positive externalities of Peruvian infrastructure on private activities’ output. In the second step, these estimates are introduced in a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model used to conduct counterfactual simulations of various investment plans in infrastructure over a 15-year period. These simulations show to what extent scaling-up infrastructure could be a worthwhile strategy to achieve economic growth in Peru; however, they also show that these benefits depend on the choice of funding schemes related to such public spending.
D58|SSP Long Run Scenarios for European NUTS2 Regions|In this paper we illustrate the development of a modeling framework aimed at producing detailed quantitative estimates for economic variables, consistent with Shared Socio-economic Pathways, and their assumptions about national income and population. Our model not only provides information on industrial production levels, employment, consumption patterns, trade flows and other macroeconomic variables, but disaggregates them further at the sub-national level, for European NUTS2 regions. Estimates are produced by an especially designed dynamic general equilibrium model (G-RDEM), augmented with a regional down-scaling module. The latter takes into account the different sectoral composition of the regional economies, their endowments of primary resources, as well as the possible existence of structural and agglomeration externalities. After describing the methodology, the paper presents an illustrative sample of results produced by the model, focusing on Italian regions and the Shared Socio-economic Pathway 1 in the period 2011-2051.
D58|The Economy-Wide Impact of Subsidy Reform: A CGE Analysis|Oil prices fell from around $US110 per barrel in 2014 to less than $US50 per barrel at the start of 2017. This put enormous pressure on government budgets within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. The focus of GCC economic policies quickly shifted to fiscal reform, including the removal of domestic subsidies on energy products. In this paper we use a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to investigate the economic impact of the gradual removal of subsidies on refined petroleum and electricity, with specific reference to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Our study shows that removing subsidies eliminates a large distortion in the economy. This improves the efficiency of resource use, so that even though employment and capital in most years fall relative to baseline levels, real GDP rises. In addition, we show that fully-funded compensation payments offset the increases in energy prices, leaving economic welfare of the Saudi-national population little affected. Removing the energy subsidies leads to an improvement in the net volume of trade, while leading to a mixed outcome for industries.
D58|Consumption in the Great Recession: The Financial Distress Channel|During the Great Recession, the collapse of consumption across the US varied greatly but systematically with house-price declines. Our message is that household financial health matters for understanding this relationship. Two facts are essential for our finding: (1) the decline in house prices led to an increase in household financial distress (FD) prior to the decline in income during the recession, and (2) at the zip-code level, the prevalence of FD prior to the recession was positively correlated with house-price declines at the onset of the recession. We measure the power of the financial distress channel using a rich-estimated-dynamic model of FD. We find that these channels amplify the aggregate drop in consumption by 7% and 45%, respectively.
D58|FIDELIO 3 manual: Equations and data sources|"FIDELIO (Fully Interregional Dynamic Econometric Long-term Input-Output) is a multi-sectoral model developed by the unit B.5 of the Directorate General Joint Research Centre (JRC) â€” the circular economy and industrial leadership unit. Compared to neoclassical CGE models â€” which assume that the perfect flexibility of prices and quantities ensures the full use of the factors of production at all times â€” FIDELIO integrates some new-Keynesian features: consumption adjusts slowly to its optimal level according to an error correction model and wages do not clear the labour market. The assumptions that prices do not clear the markets and market ""imperfections"" exist generate the dynamics of the model that is solved sequentially (recursive dynamic). In addition, FIDELIO is an econometric model since the calibration of most of the behavioural parameters of the model (dynamic adjustment lags of prices and quantities, and elasticities) is based on econometric estimations.This technical report illustrates the third version of the FIDELIO model, FIDELIO 3. The changes introduced in the subsequent versions of the model have two main objectives. The first one is to increase the coverage of the model. The second one is to improve the efficiency and the capacity of the model to evaluate sustainable production and consumption policies. The aim of this report is twofold. First, it contains all the equations of the current version of the model; second, it illustrates the characteristics of the data used by FIDELIO 3."
D58|Micro-founded tax policy effects in a heterogenenous-agent macro-model|Microsimulation models are increasingly used to calibrate macro models for tax policy analysis. Yet, their potential remains underexploited, especially in order to represent the non-linearity of the tax and social benefit system and interactions between capital and labour incomes which play a key role to understand behavioural effects. Following DeBacker et al. (2018b) we use a microsimulation model to provide the output with which to estimate the parameters of bivariate non-linear tax functions in a macro model. In doing so we make marginal and average tax rates bivariate functions of capital income and labour income. We estimate the parameters of tax functions in order to capture the most important non-linearities of the actual tax schedule, together with interaction effects between labour and capital incomes. To illustrate the methodology, we simulate a reduction in marginal personal income tax rates in Italy with a microsimulation model, translating the microsimulation results into the shock for a dynamic overlapping generations model. Our results show that this policy change affects differently households distinguished by age and ability type.
D58|Skill Complementarity in Production Technology: New Empirical Evidence and Implications|"Matched worker-firm data from Danish manufacturing reveal that 1) industries differ in within-firm worker skill dispersion, and 2) the correlation between within-firm skill dispersion and productivity is positive in industries with higher average skill dispersion. We argue that these patterns are a manifestation of technological differences across industries: firms in the ""skill complementarity"" industries profit from hiring workers of similar skill level, whereas firms in the ""skill substitutability"" industries benefit from hiring workers of different skill levels. An empirical method we devise produces a robust classification of industries into the distinct complementarity and substitutability groups. Our study unveils hitherto unnoticed technological heterogeneity between industries within the same economy, and demonstrates its importance. Specifically, we show through simulations on a simple general equilibrium model that failing to take technological heterogeneity into account results in large prediction errors."
D58|Behavioral characteristics of applied general equilibrium models with variable elasticity of substitution between varieties from different sources|This study explores the behavioral characteristics of the Melitz-type heterogeneous and the Krugman-type homogeneous firm models that endogenize substitution elasticity as an increasing function of the total number of varieties that are available in each destination country/region. Using a case the United States (US) liberalizes imports of manufactured products from China as an example, simulation experiments with a three-region, three-sector applied general equilibrium model of global trade revealed that economic agents comply with more inefficient circumstances when the importer's preference for variety intensifies. Whereas, a more efficient environment enables countries, including those excluded from a free trade agreement, to receive welfare gains when the influence of the total number of varieties to the substitution elasticity becomes strong.

In particular, we study how a targeted public investment policy could protect the most female labour-intensive sectors from increased competition from European products. Using a computable general equilibrium approach, we show that an increase in public investment in the sectors most affected by the implementation of the EPA has a positive impact on women's unemployment rate and wage rates.
D58|Impact of Fiscal Consolidation on the Mongolian Economy|The Government of Mongolia began implementing an IMF program under the Extended Fund Facility agreement (EFF) in May 2017. Under the program, the government has decreased expenditures and increased taxes to achieve debt sustainability via fiscal consolidation and stable growth. At the same time, the government has faced challenges because of its commitment of fiscal consolidation to the IMF: the rising price of fuel and its own fuel-subsidy policies. We used the PEP standard static CGE model to examine the impact of fiscal consolidation on the Mongolian economy under various conditions. Moreover, we used a poverty (microsimulation) model to analyze those impacts at a household level. Our analysis of the impact of fiscal consolidation under pessimistic and optimistic mineral-commodity-price scenarios showed that Mongoliaâ€™s economy was closely tied to international commodity prices. Our examination of the governmentâ€™s alternative policies on fuel subsidies in an environment of fiscal consolidation demonstrated that the effect of increased fuel prices on the economy depended upon government fuel-subsidy policy.
D58|The Economic and Environmental Impact of Foreign Direct Investment on the Mongolian Coal-Export Sector|This paper examines the impact of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) intended to increase the exporting capacity of the coal sector on the Mongolian economy and environment by using a recursive dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model. FDI was used to expand the coal-export sector as well as to construct a railway line connecting the Mongolian main coal reserve and the Chinese border. FDI had a positive impact on macroeconomic variables such as GDP, employment, investment, and household consumption but produced a Dutch disease effect in some sectors. The new railway reduced the environmental impact of transporting coal.
D58|Costs of Energy Efficiency Mandates Can Reverse the Sign of Rebound|Improvements in energy efficiency can reduce costs of consuming services from cars and appliances and result in positive rebound that offsets part of the direct energy reduction. Our analytical general equilibrium model decomposes rebound into direct and indirect effects. A costless technology shock has positive rebound as in prior literature, but a pre-existing energy efficiency standard can negate direct energy savings from that shock. For increased stringency of energy efficiency standards, however, we show how income effects reduce energy use for both services and other goods. We show exactly when those increased costs imply negative total rebound.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D58|Waiting for Affordable Housing in New York City|We develop a new dynamic equilibrium model with heterogeneous households that captures the most important frictions that arise in housing rental markets and explains the political popularity of affordable housing policies. We estimate the model using data collected by the New York Housing Vacancy Survey in 2011. We find that there are significant adjustment costs in all markets as well as serious search frictions in the market for affordable housing. Moreover, there are large queuing frictions in the market for public housing. Having access to rent-stabilized housing increases household welfare by up to $65,000. Increasing the supply of affordable housing by ten percent significantly improves the welfare of all renters in the city. Progressive taxation of higher-income households that live in public housing can also be welfare improving.
D58|Modelling Impact of Moratorium on Electronic Transmissions using CGE: A Critique|The paper presents a detailed critique of estimating economic impact of moratorium on custom duties on electronic transmissions using CGE modelling, which has been undertaken by the European Centre for International Political Economy (ECIPE). Electronic transmissions are ‘on-line’ deliveries of digitizable products like music CDs, films, e-books, software and printed material. Since 1998, moratorium on custom duties on electronic transmissions has been renewed every two years in the WTO. ECIPE paper estimates the economic impact of removal of the moratorium. Using GTAP model, the analysis applies arbitrary tariffs on four broad services sectors and presents the results as economic impact of removal of the moratorium. This is misleading for the policymakers. The model does not have product-level data or dis-aggregated services data in order to identify electronic transmissions. Applying tariffs on broad services sectors also challenges the commitments taken by the developing countries in the GATS.
D58|Heterogeneous effects of single monetary policy on unemployment rates in the largest EMU economies|This paper studies the effects of monetary policy on the national rates of unemployment in Germany, France, Italy and Spain, the four largest economies of the European Monetary Union (EMU), since the introduction of the euro in 1999 and before and after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007-09. Estimating and simulating a version of a canonical medium-scale New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with indivisible labor that incorporates unemployment developed by Galí, Smets and Wouters (2012), the paper compares the relative importance of monetary policy shocks, risk premium shocks, wage markup shocks and labor supply shocks and studies their effects on other labor market variables, such as labor force participation and real wages. We find that the same monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) has had heterogeneous effects on unemployment rates and other labor market variables in these four major EMU economies. Moreover, in all of them monetary policy shocks are the second largest source of unemployment rate variability in the short, medium and long run, only preceded by risk premium shocks. Our results also confirm that the post-GFC zero lower bound environment has rendered ECB's interest rate policy much less powerful in affecting EMU unemployment rates. In addition to the heterogeneity documented in the effects of monetary policy along various labor market dimensions across the countries in our sample, we also reveal that the EMU economies are, further, characterized by important differences along these dimensions with respect to the United States (US).
D58|Top 3: Pension Systems in Denmark, Finland, and the Netherlands|Abstract According to the 2018 Mercer Global Pension index, the pension systems of Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands are the best three in the world. This paper seeks to identify the common elements of success of these three pension systems, including the institutional framework within which they operate. We emphasize the collective and compulsory nature of the earnings-related pension schemes and the important role for social partners in all three pension systems. We also discuss what we believe are the most important challenges these systems face.
D58|A global multi-sectoral model in local currencies|Economic agents make their decisions by focusing on the economic performance of their economies in their currencies rather than in a foreign currency. This shows that a multi-country economic model in local currencies is suitable to analyze global economic issues. However, international input-output tables are denominated in a specific currency such as the US dollar. Employing the OECD Intercountry Input-Output Tables, this paper presents a method to convert the international input-output tables in U.S. dollars and current prices to those in local currencies and constant prices. In addition, the structure of a global model with economies of scale and imperfect competition is illustrated. A numerical example is also demonstrated in order to show the applicability of the model.
D58|Impacto económico del empredimiento en una economía regional: el caso de Andalucía| Although traditionally entrepreneurship has been considered as one of the engines of economic activity, it has not been until recent years that public authorities have made a planned and organized effort to support the entrepreneurial initiative. However, even though many millions of euros are invested annually in this support, the effectiveness of such investment is rarely measured in terms of the impact of entrepreneurial activity on the economy. For this reason, in this paper we analyze the effect of this activity (entrepreneurship) on a regional economy and its impact on it. To do so, we develop a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model for the Andalusian economy for 2015, within a top-down approach. The model is based in the Andalusian Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) updated for the year 2015. A SAM is a statistical-accounting instrument that collects all the information of an economic system and, in addition, closes the circular flow of incomes, considering direct, indirect and induced effects. This gives an overview of the implications of the economic flows on the different sectors of activity and at the same time details and completes them. The SAM for Andalusia 2015 has a disaggregation level of 35 economic activities (27 productive sectors plus 8 endogenous accounts that include items such as capital, consumption, labor, investment, taxes, public sector and sector Exterior). In order to obtain the impact vector for the entrepreneurial activity, necessary to make the estimates for each one of the activity sector, the statistical official information available about business creation in Andalusia has been used. The results will show the effects on Gross domestic product, Productive Output and employment creation and its distribution by sectors of Activity.
D58|On Barriers to Technology Adoption, Appropriate Technology and Deep Integration (with implications for the European Union)|Based on two strands of research, namely ‘barriers to technology adoption’ and ‘appropriate technology’, we propose a formal reappraisal of ‘deep integration’, a broad concept often used in trade policy discussions. We then evaluate the 2004-7 EU enlargement wave utilizing this operational reappraisal. More speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst estimate, using 2007 data, total labor productivity (TLP) in the 27 EU member states, and show that in all but a few sectors, new member states clearly stand below the lower envelope technology frontier of the older members in their use of skilled and unskilled labor. We interpret this as being the result of past barriers to technology adoption that are likely to be removed by the integration process into the EU, with these new counties’ TLP shifting to the incumbent members’ lower envelope. We then explore the potential eﬀects on all 27 EU member states of this ‘deep integration’ experiment using a calibrated intertemporal multisectoral general equilibrium model. Our main ﬁnding is that, for most parameter conﬁgurations, workers’ welfare in incumbent member countries is not negatively impacted despite the rather drastic improvement in competitiveness experienced by new members.
D58|Energy- and multi-sector modelling of climate change mitigation in New Zealand: current practice and future needs|As New Zealand charts its course toward a low-emissions economy, the quality of energy-sector and multi-sector modelling is becoming increasingly important. This paper outlines why models are useful for answering complex questions, provides a stocktake of energy-sector and multi-sector models used for climate change mitigation modelling in New Zealand, and makes suggestions for improving future modelling work. While New Zealand is fortunate to have a range of different modelling tools, these have historically been used in a sporadic and ad hoc way, and underlying datasets are deficient in some areas. As the foundation for a more strategic development of New Zealand’s modelling capability, this paper profiles some of the energy-sector and multi-sector models and datasets currently applied in New Zealand. New Zealand’s modelling capability could be strengthened by collecting and sharing data more effectively; building understanding of underlying relationships informed by primary research; creating more collaborative and transparent processes for applying common datasets; increasing international collaboration; and conducting more integrated modelling across environmental issues. These improvements will require strategic policies and processes for refining model development; providing increased, predictable and sustained funding for modelling activities, underlying data collection and primary research; and strengthening networks across modellers inside and outside of government. Many of the suggested improvements could be realised by creating an integrated framework for climate change mitigation modelling in New Zealand. This framework would bring together a suite of models and a network of researchers to assess climate change mitigation policies regularly. Core elements of the framework would include a central repository of data, input assumptions and scenarios, and a “dashboard” that synthesises results from different models to allow decision-makers to understand and apply the insights from the models more easily.
D58|Land-use modelling in New Zealand: current practice and future needs|New Zealand faces the challenge of using our land in ways that are not only resilient to future pressures and sustain our rural communities but also enhance our natural environment. For the public and private sectors to make robust land-use decisions under uncertainty, high-quality modelling tools and data are essential. The drivers of land-use decisions are complex and models provide a structured methodology for investigating these. While New Zealand is fortunate to have a range of different modelling tools, these have historically been used in a sporadic and ad hoc way, and underlying datasets are deficient in some areas. As the foundation for more strategic development of New Zealand’s modelling capability, this paper profiles the main land-sector and farm- and production-related models and datasets currently applied in New Zealand. It also explores priority policy areas where modelling is needed, such as achieving emission reduction targets; managing freshwater, biodiversity and soil quality; and understanding the distributional impacts of policy options as well as climate change. New Zealand’s modelling capability could be strengthened by collecting and sharing land-use data more effectively; building understanding of underlying relationships informed by primary research; creating more collaborative and transparent processes for applying common datasets, scenarios and assumptions, and conducting peer review; and conducting more integrated modelling across environmental issues. These improvements will require strategic policies and processes for refining model development, providing increased, predictable and sustained funding for modelling activity and underlying data collection and primary research, and strengthening networks across modellers inside and outside of government.
D58|Macroeconomic consequences of the demographic and educational transition in Poland|Soon after the start of the transition to market economy in the early 1990s, Poland has experi- enced both a dramatic decline in the fertility rate and an increase in the share of students among young high-school graduates. These two processes significantly changed the age structure of the population and average income characteristics of households. Using a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous households and uninsured income shocks I try to assess the impact of these demographic and educational changes on the Polish economic performance and inequalities. I find that in the long term the positive effects of educational transition on output per capita more than offset the negative impact of lower fertility, but the outcome strongly depends on the adjustments in the structure of labor demand. I also show that the educational transition increases income and consumption inequalities, while the demographic transition decreases inequality in assets.
D58|Does the foreign sector help forecast domestic variables in DSGE models?|This paper evaluates the forecasting performances of several small open-economy DSGE models relative to a closed-economy benchmark using a long span of data for Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. We find that opening the model economy usually does not improve the quality of point and density forecasts for key domestic variables, and can even cause it to deteriorate. We show that this result can be attributed largely to an increase in the forecast error due to the more sophisticated structure of the extended setup, which is not compensated for by a better model specification. This claim is based on a Monte Carlo experiment in which an open-economy model fails to beat its closed-economy benchmark consistently even if the former is the true data generating process.
D58|Equilibrium foreign currency mortgages|This paper proposes a novel explanation for why foreign currency denominated loans to households have become so popular in some emerging economies. Our argument is based on what we call the debt limit channel, which arises when multi-period contracts are offered to financially constrained borrowers against collateral that is established on newly acquired assets. Whenever the difference between domestic and foreign interest rates is positive, this channel biases borrowers' choices towards foreign currency, even if the exchange rate is known to depreciate as implied by the interest parity condition. We next use a small open economy DSGE model to analyze how the debt limit channel affects agents' choices under uncertainty. The model implies that, if first-order effects related to the debt limit channel are neutralized by appropriate adjustment in debt contracts, the equilibrium share of foreign currency loans is small.
D58|General Equilibrium Rebound from Energy Efficiency Innovation|Energy efficiency improvements “rebound” when economic responses undercut their direct energy savings. I show that general equilibrium channels typically amplify rebound by making consumption goods cheaper but typically dampen rebound by increasing demand for non-energy inputs to production and by changing the size of the energy supply sector. Improvements in the efficiency of the energy supply sector generate especially large rebound because they make energy cheaper in all other sectors. Quantitatively, improving the efficiency of U.S. non-energy supply sectors by 1% would reduce U.S. energy use by 0.58%, with rebound of 28%. General equilibrium channels increase those savings by 19%; however, they reduce the savings from improving the efficiency of the energy supply sector by 65%.
D58|Impacts of a carbon tax across US household income groups: What are the equity-efficiency trade-offs?|This paper assesses the impacts across U.S. household income groups of carbon taxes of various designs. We consider both the source-side impacts (reflecting how policies affect wage, capital, and transfer incomes) as well as the use-side impacts (reflecting how policies alter the prices of goods and services purchased by households). We apply an integrated general equilibrium framework with extended measures of the source- and use-side impacts that add up to the overall welfare impact. Our results indicate that the distributional impacts depend importantly on the nature of revenue-recycling and the treatment of transfer income. In the absence of targeted compensation to achieve distributional objectives, the use-side impacts tend to be regressive while the source-side impacts are progressive, and the progressive source-side impacts tend to offset fully the regressive use-side impacts. Both impacts are considerably larger when one employs the more comprehensive welfare measures introduced in this study. The efficiency costs of targeted compensation to achieve distributional objectives depend critically on the recycling method and compensation target. These costs are an order of magnitude higher when the remaining revenues after compensation are used for corporate income tax cuts, compared with costs when remaining revenues are used other ways. Efficiency costs also rise dramatically when targeted compensation extends beyond the lowest income quintiles.
D58|The Crucial Role of International Trade in Adaptation to Climate Change|Climate change effects on agricultural yields will be uneven over the world with a few countries, mostly in high latitudes, that may experience gains, while most will see average yield decrease. This paper aims at quantifying the role of international trade in attenuating the effects of climate change by allowing the expression of the new climate-induced pattern of comparative advantages. To do this, we develop a quantitative general equilibrium trade model where the representation of acreage and land use choices is inspired from modern Ricardian trade models but also consistent with theoretical and empirical literature on land use choices. The model is calibrated on spatially explicit information about potential yields before and after climate change coming from the agronomic literature. The results show that the climate-induced yield changes generate large price movements that incentivize adjustments in acreage and trade. The new trade pattern is very different from the current one, showing the important role of trade flows in adapting to climate change. This is confirmed by larger welfare losses from climate change when adjustments in trade flows are constrained versus when they are not.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D58|Exploring the General Equilibrium Costs of Sector-Specific Environmental Regulations|The requisite scope of analysis to adequately estimate the social cost of environmental regulations has been subject to much discussion. The literature has demonstrated that engineering or partial equilibrium cost estimates likely underestimate the social cost of large-scale environmental regulations and environmental taxes. However, the conditions under which general equilibrium (GE) analysis adds value to welfare analysis for single-sector technology or performance standards, the predominant policy intervention in practice, remains an open question. Using a numerical computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, we investigate the GE effects of regulations across different sectors, abatement technologies, and regulatory designs. Our results show that even for small regulations the GE effects are significant, and that engineering estimates of compliance costs can substantially underestimate the social cost of single-sector environmental regulations. We find the downward bias from using engineering costs to approximate social costs depends on the input composition of abatement technologies and the regulated sector.
D58|Living Standards Analysis Model: The First Prototype|How do we understand the synergies and trade-offs of a given policy on area beyond that policy, such as the effect of housing on health and on income? How do we choose between policies in completely different areas, such as an education policy and a health policy? Treasury’s Living Standards Framework provides one possible starting point, but it provides little assistance tracing the many dependencies between policy areas. A model that includes those dependencies could help. The Living Standards Analysis Model (LSAM) is designed to do this. A first prototype of the model has just been developed. This model includes all eleven aspects of wellbeing as described by the OECD’s How’s Life? framework and linkages between the different aspects for a small open economy. Most models for studying wellbeing only include one or two aspects, missing the rich set of interactions that can occur with greater coverage. As an early prototype, this version of the model does have many flaws and requires significant further development, but it forms a basis for creating an improved model as well as providing some qualitatively useful results. The model is loosely based on a stocks-and-flows type of model, with a small general equilibrium model covering the market economy part of the model. This paper is focussed on the description of the model.
D58|Impacts of Green Growth Policies on Labour Markets and Wage Income Distribution: A General Equilibrium Application to Climate and Energy Policies|This paper explores the consequences on the labour markets of structural changes induced by decarbonisation policies. These policies are likely going to have consequences on labour-income distribution given i) existing rigidities in the labour markets, and ii) their different impacts on sectors and on job categories. These policies are analysed in a general equilibrium modelling framework, which includes interlinkages between different sectors and regions as well as five different categories of workers.
D58|The Energy Efficiency Rebound Effect in General Equilibrium|We develop a stylized general equilibrium model to decompose the rebound effect of energy efficiency improvements into its partial and general equilibrium components. In our theoretical analysis, we identify key drivers of the general equilibrium rebound effect, including a composition channel, an energy price channel, a labor supply channel, and a growth channel. Based on numerical simulations with both the stylized model as well as a large-scale computable general equilibrium model of the global economy, we show that both general and partial equilibrium components of the rebound effect can be substantial. Our benchmark parameterization suggests a total rebound effect due to an exogenous energy efficiency improvement in the US manufacturing sector of 67% with roughly two-thirds occurring through the partial equilibrium rebound channel and the remaining one-third occurring through the general equilibrium rebound channel.
D58|On Barriers to Technology Adoption, Appropriate Technology and Deep Integration (with implications for the European Union)|Based on two strands of research, namely 'barriers to technology adoption' and 'appropriate technology', we propose a formal reappraisal of 'deep integration', a broad concept often used in trade policy discussions. We then evaluate the 2004-7 EU enlargement wave utilizing this operational reappraisal. More specifically, we first estimate, using 2007 data, total labor productivity (TLP) in the 27 EU member states, and show that in all but a few sectors, new member states clearly stand below the lower envelope technology frontier of the older members in their use of skilled and unskilled labor. We interpret this as being the result of past barriers to technology adoption that are likely to be removed by the integration process into the EU, with these new counties' TLP shifting to the incumbent members' lower envelope. We then explore the potential effects on all 27 EU member states of this 'deep integration' experiment using a calibrated intertemporal multisectoral general equilibrium model. Our main finding is that, for most parameter configurations, workers' welfare in incumbent member countries is not negatively impacted despite the rather drastic improvement in competitiveness experienced by new members.
D58|Impacts of Direct and Indirect Tax Reforms in Vietnam: A CGE Analysis|The study applies a multi-sector multi-household static computable general equilibrium (CGE) tax model to assess the economy-wide impacts of taxes in Vietnam. It examines two tax reform scenarios based on the tax reform plan proposed by the Vietnam Ministry of Finance. The first scenario is increasing the value-added tax (VAT) rate to 12% from the current 10% rate. The second scenario relates to setting a competitive corporate income tax (CIT) rate to the lowest rate in ASEAN (Associations of South East Asian Nations) countries by reducing it from 20% to 17%. Correction of current tax distortions will have positive impacts on labour supply, utility, consumption, output, and welfare of households as they reallocate resources from more to less productive sectors of the economy. The CGE model allows for the finding of the macroeconomic and sectoral effects on prices and outputs, as well as on welfare of households. While this study contributes to the literature on the CGE model for the Vietnam economy, it is a small step for finding the optimal tax structure in Vietnam. It recommends that the Vietnam government should increase the standard VAT rate to 12% and reduce CIT rate to 17% to shift the tax burden from capitalists to consumers.
D58|Removing Fossil Fuel Subsidies to Help the Poor|Phasing out energy subsidies may increase the price of energy and adversely affect the poor. However, the households may benefit from the redistribution of the revenue from this policy in the economy. Here, we investigate the impacts of phasing out energy subsidies and direct transfer of the policy revenue to households. Employing a Computable General Equilibrium model, we measure the impacts on labor-leisure choice and on labor supply. Considering the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke index and the Food Ratio Method, we construct several poverty indices: the Gini index, the ratio of none-food expenditures to food expenditure, the ratio of income of the richest decile to the poorest decile, and the ratio of income of the two richest deciles to the two poorest deciles. We analyze the effects of an increase in energy prices and direct transfer of revenues to the households in the Iranian economy. The findings suggest a considerable improvement in income distribution and a significant improvement in food to non-food ratio. The results also show an improvement in rural-urban income distribution.
D58|An impossibility theorem for wealth in heterogeneous-agent models with limited heterogeneity|It has been conjectured that canonical Bewley–Huggett–Aiyagari heterogeneous-agent models cannot explain the joint distribution of income and wealth. The results stated below verify this conjecture and clarify its implications under very general conditions. We show in particular that if (i) agents are infinitely-lived, (ii) saving is risk-free, and (iii) agents have constant discount factors, then the wealth distribution inherits the tail behavior of income shocks (e.g., light-tailedness or the Pareto exponent). Our restrictions on utility require only that relative risk aversion is bounded, and a large variety of income processes are admitted. Our results show conclusively that it is necessary to go beyond standard models to explain the empirical fact that wealth is heavier-tailed than income. We demonstrate through examples that relaxing any of the above three conditions can generate Pareto tails.
D58|Claiming the Usefulness of Relative Welfare Indicators in General Equilibrium Analysis:A Comprehensive Comparison of VAT Reforms|The evaluation of welfare effects should be clear and presented in an easy to interpret manner. In this paper, we show that on these grounds the true index of cost of living, first introduced by Konüs (1939), is preferable to the standard absolute indicators when evaluating welfare effects in static applied general equilibrium models i.e. the equivalent and the compensated variations. In these applied models, it is customary to use linearly homogeneous utility functions such as Cobb-Douglas or the more general CES specification. Under this class of utilities, the Konüs index is independent of the reference level of utility. This makes this index an unambiguous cost of living indicator. Lastly, to show the convenience of using the Konüs index in empirical work, we have carried out an original exercise with a novel data set for the Spanish economy. We report the macroeconomic and welfare impacts of two alternative Value-Added Tax Reforms through the application of an original simulation strategy.
D58|G-RDEM: A GTAP-Based Recursive Dynamic CGE Model for Long-Term Baseline Generation and Analysis|We motivate and detail the new GTAP-based recursive dynamic economic model (G-RDEM), a computable general equilibrium tool for long-term counterfactual analysis and baseline generation from given gross domestic product (GDP) and population projections. It encompasses an implicitly directly additive demand system (AIDADS) demand system with non-linear Engel curves, debt accumulation from foreign saving and introduces sector specific productivity changes, endogenous aggregate saving rates, as well as time-varying cost shares for value added and individual intermediates. Parameters for these relationships are econometrically estimated or taken from published work. The core of the model is derived from the Global Trade Anaylsis Project (GTAP) standard model and seamlessly incorporated into the modular and flexible CGEBox modelling platform, allowing for combined applications with various other extensions, such as GTAP-agro-ecological zones (AEZ) or GTAP-Water. G-RDEM maintains the flexible aggregation from the GTAP Data Base. It is open source, encoded in General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) and can be steered by a Graphical User Interface, which also encompasses a tool to analyse results with tables, graphs and maps. Existing GDP and population projections from the Socio-Economic Pathways (SSP) 1-5 can be directly incorporated for baseline construction. A comparison of the generated long-term structural composition of the economy against a simple recursive-dynamic variant, derived from the standard GTAP model, shows that G-RDEM brings about much more plausible results, as well as a more realistic, internally consistent representation of the economic structure in a hypothetical future.
D58|Impact Assessment of Scenarios of Interregional Transfers in Colombia|En este trabajo se evalúan los efectos económicos de diferentes escenarios de asignación regional empleados en el esquema actual de transferencias interregionales en Colombia, destacando los posibles compromisos entre la eficiencia y la equidad regional. Las simulaciones realizadas en el trabajo, utilizando un modelo de equilibrio general computable interregional, contribuyen al análisis del impacto del crecimiento relacionado con algunos de los objetivos generales que persiguen los gobiernos centrales al asignar transferencias subnacionales a los gobiernos locales. En este sentido, se simulan escenarios contra factuales en los que las políticas redistributivas están diseñadas para evaluar los posibles resultados del Producto Bruto Regional. Los resultados muestran que cuando la distribución se lleva a cabo sobre la base del tamaño de la población regional, hay ganancias potenciales en el crecimiento nacional junto con un aumento en las disparidades regionales. Sin embargo, cuando la distribución se lleva a cabo de acuerdo con otros criterios redistributivos, como el número de personas en condición de pobreza o las brechas horizontales de equidad fiscal, existen mejoras potenciales en la desigualdad regional, a pesar de estar acompañadas de efectos negativos del crecimiento. En este sentido, si se prioriza el criterio redistributivo para compensar la reducción del crecimiento, las regiones que enfrentan un aumento neto en las transferencias deben asignar los recursos adicionales para mejorar en términos de Productividad Total de los Factores (PTF), específicamente, priorizando en inversiones que mejoran la PTF en el largo plazo, tales como aquellas en capital humano enfocadas a la educación y la salud. **** ABSTRACT: We assess the economic effects of different scenarios of regional allocation of the current interregional transfers’ scheme in Colombia, highlighting potential tradeoffs between regional equity and efficiency. The simulations conducted in this work, using an interregional computable general equilibrium model, contribute to the analysis of the growth impact related to some of the broad objectives that central governments pursue when allocating subnational transfers to local governments. We simulate counterfactual scenarios in which redistributive policies are designed to assess potential Gross Regional Product (GRP) outcomes had they been applied to the Colombian economy. The results show that when the distribution is carried out based on regional population shares, there are potential gains in national growth together with an increase in regional disparities. However, when the distribution is carried out according to other redistributive criteria, such as the number of people impoverished or the horizontal equity gaps, there is a potential improvement in regional inequality despite negative growth effects. In this sense, if we prioritize the redistributive criterion in order to offset the reduction of growth, regions that face a net increase in transfers should allocate the additional resources to improve in terms of Total Factor Productivity (TFP), specifically, in long-term TFP-enhancing investments, such as human capital in the form of education and health outcomes.
D58|The energy efficiency rebound effect in general equilibrium|We develop a stylized general equilibrium model to decompose the rebound effect of energy efficiency improvements into its partial and general equilibrium components. In our theoretical analysis, we identify key drivers of the general equilibrium rebound effect, including a composition channel, an energy price channel, a labor supply channel, and a growth channel. Based on numerical simulations with both the stylized model as well as a large-scale computable general equilibrium model of the global economy, we show that both general and partial equilibrium components of the rebound effect can be substantial. Our benchmark parameterization suggests a total rebound effect due to an exogenous energy efficiency improvement in the US manufacturing sector of 67% with roughly two-thirds occurring through the partial equilibrium rebound channel and the remaining one-third occurring through the general equilibrium rebound channel
D58|MegBec - Un modèle d’équilibre général calculable multirégional du Québec|This document presents the MegBec multiregional model of Quebec, a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with 16 “analytic” regions. The model is based on a social accounting matrix (SAM) with 44 industries and 63 products. The first part of the document describes how the SAM was constructed. First, a SAM for Quebec as a whole was elaborated, using the 2011 Statistics Canada supply and use tables. Regional SAMs were built from that one by distributing values across regions following several key indicators, particularly the regional GDP estimates of the Institut de la statistique du Québec. The resulting discrepancy in each region between salaries received and paid is attributed to worker commuting; origin-destination flows were estimated using cross-entropy minimization from Statistics Canada’s 2011 Census commuting data. Discrepancies between regional absorption and production are attributed to interregional trade; bi-lateral flows are generated by simulation using a gravity model. Attraction factors – key parameters in the gravity model – are obtained by aggregating attraction factors constructed at the finer Municipalité Régionale de Comté (MRC) spatial scale, according to network distances, in minutes, between population-weighted centroids. The second part of the document persents the model itself, whose specification is more or less standard for dynamic multiregional CGE models. In particular, trade between regions follows the Armington imperfect substituability hypothesis: supply is apportioned according to constant-elasticity-of-transformation (CET) functions, and demand according to constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) functions. Regional labor markets are characterized by the presence of unemployment, the rate of which depends on the level of wages, following a wage curve. Interregional worker commuting flows are logistic functions of regional wage rates. The document includes several appendices, one of which describes the reference scenario and the closure rules that are applied by default in the model. Ce document présente le modèle multirégional du Québec MegBec, un modèle d’équilibre général calculable (MEGC) dynamique séquentiel où l’on distingue 16 régions dites « régions analytiques ». Il s’appuie sur une matrice de comptabilité sociale (MCS) avec 44 industries et 63 produits. La première partie du document décrit le processus d’élaboration de la MCS. D’abord on a élaboré une MCS du Québec dans son ensemble, à partir des tableaux de ressources-emplois de 2011 de Statistique Canada. À partir de cette MCS, les matrices régionales ont été construites en répartissant les valeurs entre régions selon plusieurs clés, en particulier les estimations du PIB des régions de l’Institut de la statistique du Québec. L’écart qui en résulte dans chaque région entre salaires reçus et salaires payés est attribué au navettage des travailleurs; les flux origine-destination ont été estimés par la méthode de minimisation de l’entropie croisée à partir de données de navettage du recensement de 2011 de Statistique Canada. Les écarts entre l’absorption et la production régionales par produit sont attribués aux échanges interrégionaux, qui sont générés par simulation au moyen d’un modèle gravitaire. Les facteurs d’attractivité, paramètres critiques du modèle gravitaire, sont obtenus par agrégation de facteurs d’attractivité construits à l’échelle plus fine des MRC, selon les distances réticulaires en minutes entre centroïdes pondérés par la population. La deuxième partie du document présente le modèle lui-même, dont la spécification est grosso modo conforme à la structure classique des MEGC multirégionaux dynamiques. En particulier, le commerce entre les régions suit l’hypothèse de substituabilité imparfaite d’Armington : l’offre se distribue suivant des fonctions de distribution de l’offre à élasticité de transformation constante (CET) et la demande suivant des fonctions de répartition de la demande à élasticité de substitution constante (CES). Les marchés régionaux du travail sont caractérisés par la présence de chômage, dont le taux dépend du niveau des salaires, selon une courbe salaire-chômage (wage curve). Le navettage interrégional des travailleurs suit un modèle de fonction logistique des salaires régionaux. Le document compte plusieurs annexes, dont l’une décrit le scénario de référence et expose les règles de fermeture appliquées par défaut dans le modèle.
D58|The Impact of Microcredit on Farms and Rural Household: A Literature Review of Experimental Studies|In this article, we review the literature on the best ways to identify the causal effects of microcredit, present, and discuss some empirical results of the impact of microcredit on the adoption of innovations, investments, farm incomes, and profits. The results of empirical studies converge toward a positive impact of access to microcredit on the adoption of agricultural technology and investment. In terms of the effect on the technical efficiency of farms, agricultural income and profit, and consumption, the results do not all point in the same direction. The effects of microcredit are likely to vary depending on the context of the study.

D58|Can environmental taxes and payments for ecosystem services regulate pollution when the resilience of water bodies is surpassed?|Resumen: La naturaleza incierta de la propiedad de resiliencia de los cuerpos de agua y los efectos acumulativos de la polución hacen que los instrumentos económicos tradicionales de regulación ambiental no sean suficientes para asegurar la provisión sostenible de agua potable. Los Pagos por servicios ecosistémicos (PSA) no valoran todos los servicios que los ecosistemas proveen y hay incentivos escasos a demandarlos dada su naturaleza de bienes públicos. Se requieren impuestos ambientales más altos que consideren que los cuerpos de agua tienen un nivel muy bajo de capacidad de resiliencia. / Abstract : The uncertain nature of the resilience of water bodies and the cumulative effects of pollution make traditional economic instruments for environmental regulation not enough to ensure the provision of drinking water. Payments for ecosystem services (PES) do not value all the services that ecosystems provide and there are scarce incentives to demand them given its nature of public good. High environmental taxes that consider water bodies to have a very low level of resilience will be required.

D58|Política comercial agrícola: nivel, costos y efectos de la protección en Colombia|Tras la ola de procesos de apertura comercial en el mundo, en las décadas finales del siglo pasado, el análisis de la política comercial pareció haber perdido importancia, tornándose incluso aparentemente irrelevante, tanto en el ámbito académico, como en el político. Dos hechos determinaron, sin embargo, la resurgencia del tema: el primero, el considerable incremento en la aplicación de medidas no arancelarias al comercio internacional, y segundo la emergencia de nuevos modelos, nuevas metodologías y especialmente mejores fuente de información, que permiten una mejor comprensión, tanto de los efectos de los acuerdos bilaterales, como de la implementación unilateral de políticas comerciales. La protección arancelaria y para-arancelaria ha sido una pieza fundamental de la política comercial agrícola del país. Sus resultados han sido, sin embargo, decepcionantes: en la última década, el valor de la producción agrícola a precios básicos ha pasado de representar el 5.9% del PIB en 2005, a 4.6% en 2014. Las exportaciones, por su parte, a precios básicos, han pasado del 1% del PIB al 0.6%, mostrando inequívocos signos de bajo dinamismo. Dados los diversos impactos derivados de la protección al sector agropecuario colombiano, Fedesarrollo en asocio con la Universidad EAFIT, adelantaron el presente estudio que tiene como objetivo establecer la situación actual de la protección agrícola en Colombia y los efectos y los costos que ella representa para los sectores agrícola y agroindustrial así como para los consumidores finales. El estudio consta, además de la introducción, de nueve capítulos. En el primer capítulo se revisa el tema del impacto teórico que la protección tiene sobre los sectores protegidos, sobre la economía en su conjunto y sobre el bienestar de la sociedad. En el segundo se presenta una breve descripción de la evolución de la política comercial agrícola desde mediados del siglo XX. En el tercero se presenta la evolución de la producción y el comercio agropecuario y agroindustrial del país durante las últimas décadas y se detallan las principales características del comercio agrícola de exportación e importación. En el capítulo cuatro se analiza, para el período 1990-2015, la evolución del arancel nominal de los bienes agropecuarios y agroindustriales, el comportamiento de las franjas de precios para algunos de estos productos y se calcula el arancel efectivo de las importaciones agropecuarias y agroindustriales. En el capítulo cinco se hace un análisis de la evolución de las medidas no arancelarias (técnicas y no técnicas) aplicadas a las importaciones agropecuarias y agroindustriales adoptadas en Colombia desde la liberación comercial de los años noventa. En el capítulo seis se presentan los resultados de los principales estudios realizados recientemente sobre los niveles de la protección a la agricultura colombiana y los niveles de apoyo recibidos por los productores agropecuarios. En el capítulo siete se hace un análisis sobre los efectos de la protección sobre la producción, el comercio y el consumo de los principales productos importables agropecuarios y agroindustriales. En el capítulo ocho se hace una breve revisión de literatura reciente sobre el uso de modelos de equilibrio general computable en el análisis de políticas comerciales y se presenta el modelo que EAFIT ha desarrollado para medir estos efectos y los resultados y las conclusiones básicas de los ejercicios realizados sobre el manejo de la política comercial agropecuaria en Colombia. Finalmente, en el capítulo nueve se realiza una simulación alternativa de la eliminación total y parcial de las medidas arancelarias y no arancelarias en la economía, siguiendo los ejercicios presentados en el capítulo anterior, utilizando el modelo de equilibrio general computable de Fedesarrollo, distinto al utilizado en el capítulo ocho, con el fin de darle robustez y consistencia a los resultados encontrados.
D58|Melitz in GTAP Made Easy: The A2M Conversion Method and Result Interpretation|Since the 1970s the Armington approach has been the workhorse specification of trade in CGE models. Under Armington, agents substitute between products from different countries. Conceptually, Melitz provides a more attractive approach in which substitution is between products from different firms, rather than countries. Other attractive features of Melitz are allowance for: monopolistic competition; and economies of scale from fixed establishment costs for firms and fixed set-up costs on trade links. In this paper we show how an Armington model can be converted to Melitz by adding a few equations and introducing closure swaps, with little change to existing code. We apply our Armington-to-Melitz method to the Armington-based GTAP model to derive GTAP-A2M. Then we show how results from a CGE model with Melitz industries can be interpreted and justified via back-of-the-envelope calculations. Finally, we review the strengths and weaknesses of GTAP-HET, an alternative Melitz-based version of GTAP.
D58|SinoTERM365, Bottom-up Representation of China at the Prefectural Level|The TERM methodology requires relatively modest data requirements to create a multi-regional, sub-national CGE database. SinoTERM365 is an extreme form of stretching available data, with the master database representing 162 sectors in 365 prefectural regions of the Chinese economy. A collaborative effort is envisaged among users to enable ongoing improvements to the database. The TERM approach facilitates rapid amendments to the database when improved data are available. The alternative, to wait until better data emerge before building a model, may result in less detail and a less versatile framework for analysis. In our example, we consider a downturn in use of coal and coal-generated electricity in China.
D58|What Explains the Variety of Reform Outcomes Across Countries?|Suppose an identical regulatory reform is adopted simultaneously across a number of countries. We argue that the reformers will grow differently after the reform. To understand the reasons behind the eventual outcome divergence, we set up a tractable general equilibrium (GE) model to study how firms of different size grow after a regulatory reform. The reform reduces the costs to start, operate and close a business. The regulatory cost is modeled as lost labor hours. The model predicts that larger firms will grow faster than smaller firms after the reform. We then take the model predictions to the largest global publicly available firm-level data set, the Enterprise Surveys (ES), which encompasses 121,991 firm-level observations from 2006 to 2015 in 136 countries and territories and 211 country-years. We merge the ES data with the Doing Business indicators. We then test the theoretical predictions, which are broadly confirmed in the data. Thus, based on the notable differences of firm-size distributions across countries which are fairly stable over time, identical reforms may produce a variety of growth outcomes across countries.
D58|A Business-cycle-model with Monopolistically-competitive Firms and Calvo Wages: The Case of Bulgaria after the Introduction of the Currency Board (1999-2016)|We augment an otherwise standard business cycle model with a richer government sector, and add monopolistic competition in the product market, and rigid prices, as well as rigid wages a la Calvo (1983) in the labor market. This specification with the nominal wage rigidity, when calibrated to Bulgarian data after the introduction of the currency board (1999-2016), allows the framework to reproduce better observed variability and correlations among model variables, and those characterizing the labor market in particular. As nominal wage frictions are incorporated, the variables become more persistent, especially output, capital stock, investment and consumption, which helps the model match data better.
D58|On the Numerical Structure of Local and Nationwide Government Spending Multipliers: What Can We Learn from the Greek Crisis?|We develop a multiregional general equilibrium model for Greece to simulate the short run impacts of temporary deficit-financed rises in government spending. It has been recognized that the fiscal multiplier is a function of structural features of the economy and policy reaction parameters. Moreover, the debate on the magnitude of the multiplier along the business cycle has also been the subject of disputed debates. On these grounds, we look at the Greek case by calibrating the model using data for distinct states of the Greek economy during the development of the recent crisis. Whether this matters for local and nationwide multipliers depends on qualitative differences of the numerical structures of the model. Our results imply that structural coefficients have a strong effect on government spending impact multipliers. In the case of Greece, lack of information on the changing magnitudes of behavioral parameters over time adds another layer of uncertainty to this debate.
D58|Job creation and economic impact of renewable energy in Netherlands|This study evaluates the economic impact of a shift towards renewable electricity mix in the Netherlands using the neo-Keynesian CGEM ThreeME (Multi-sector Macroeconomic Model for the Evaluation of Environmental and Energy policy). This scenario has been inspired by the Urgenda's report ‘Energy 100% Sustainable in the Netherlands by 2030’, which have been quantified using the Energy Transition Model (ETM) developed by Quintel. Using the output of the ETM regarding the change in the electricity generation shares as input in ThreeME, we derive the impact in terms of key economic variables (GDP, employment, investment, value-added, prices, trade, tax revenue, etc.). We find that transition to renewable energy may have a positive impact on the Dutch economy, creating almost 50 000 new jobs by 2030 and adding almost 1% of gross domestic product
D58|The economic impacts of UK trade-enhancing industrial policies and their spillover effects on the energy system|The wider impacts of energy policy on the macro-economy are increasingly recognised in the academic and policy-oriented literatures. Additionally, the interdependence of energy and economy implies that a (policy) change in the non-energy system impacts on the energy system. However, such spillovers on the energy system have not been extensively researched. We begin by analysing the impacts of export promotion policies - a key element of the UKâ€™s Industrial Strategy - on the energy system and energy policy goals. As the impacts of such policies are, in large part, transmitted via their effects on the economy, we adopt a computable general equilibrium model - UK-ENVI - that fully captures such interdependence. Our results suggest that an across-the-board stimulus to exports increases total energy use significantly. This does not come directly through energy exports, but indirectly through the energy sectorsâ€™ linkages to other sectors. Export led growth therefore impacts on energy use - and significantly so. This in turn is likely to have an adverse impact on emission targets. Policy makers should be aware of the fact that a successful implementation of the Industrial Strategy may create significant tensions with the UKâ€™s Clean Growth Strategy, for example, and with the goals of energy policy more generally. The importance of this effect will in practice depend upon: the mix of goods and services that are exported (an issue that we shall address once the export strategy is published); the success of low-carbon policies. Ultimately, a knowledge of the nature and scale of these spillover effects of economic policies on the energy system creates the potential for more effective and efficient policy making.
D58|Can vehicle efficiency beat fuel efficiency in cutting fuel use|This paper demonstrates the importance of considering both energy and non-energy efficiency improvements in the provision of energy intensive household services. Using the example of private transport, we analyse whether vehicle efficiency can beat fuel efficiency in cutting fuel use. We find that this ultimately depend on the elasticity of demand for transport, the substitutability between vehicles and fuels and the initial share of fuel use in private transport. The framework also allows to identify Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmultiple benefitsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of technical progress in private transport by considering both the ability of such policy to reduce fuel demand and to increase the consumerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surplus. We extend the partial equilibrium framework by using computable general equilibrium (CGE) simulations to identify the system-wide impacts on total fuel use of the two alternative efficiency changes. Simulation results suggest that the substitution effects identified in the partial equilibrium analysis are an important element in determining the change in total fuel use resulting from these consumption efficiency changes. However, the identification of associated changes in intermediate fuel demand, plus the potential expansionary effects of the improvements in household efficiency transmitted through the labour market can generate general equilibrium effects that vary substantially from those derived using partial equilibrium analysis.
D58|The importance of energy price stickiness and real wage inflexibility for the time paths of rebound effects|There has been some controversy over the relative sizes of the short- and long-run rebound effects associated with energy efficiency improvements. Theoretical analysis by Wei (2007) and Saunders implied that the rebound effects would always be greater in the long-run than in the short-run. However, Allan et al (2007) and Turner (2009) found evidence from Computable General Equilibrium simulations that contradicted this result. In this paper we systematically explore the impact of energy price stickiness and real wage inflexibility for the evolution of rebound effects. We find that: the degree of energy price, but not wage, stickiness is an important determinant of the time path of rebound effects and of its relative size in the short- and long-runs; and that there is considerable variation in the scale of rebound effects through time, even where short-run rebound effects are lower than in the long-run. However, the most significant finding overall is that rebound reflects the system-wide interaction between energy producing and energy using sectors.

D58|The economic impacts of UK fiscal policies and their spillover effects on the energy system|The energy system and the economy are inextricably intertwined. While this interdependence is, of course, widely recognised, it has not featured prominently in assessing the likely impact of economic policies. In principle, broad fiscal policies are likely to have a significant influence on key elements of the energy system, the neglect of which may lead to inefficiencies in the design of appropriate energy and economic policies. The importance of this in practice depends on the strength of the spillover effects from fiscal policy instruments to energy policy goals. This is the focus of this paper. We employ a multi-sectoral computable general equilibrium (CGE) approach for the UK which allows us to track the impact of key fiscal policy interventions on key goals of economic and energy policies. Overall, our results suggest that a double dividend - a simultaneous stimulus to the economy and a reduction in emissions â€“ induced by an increase in current public spending or a hike in the income tax rate seem unlikely in the UK context. Nonetheless, there are undoubted differential spillover effects on key components of the energy system from tax and public spending interventions that may prove capable of being exploited through the coordination of fiscal and energy policies. Even if it seems doubtful that fiscal policies would be formulated with a view to improved coordination with energy policies, policymakers should at least be aware of likely direction and scale of fiscal spillover effects to the energy system.
D58|Exploring Long Run Structural Change with a Dynamic General Equilibrium Model|In this paper we present a computable general equilibrium model (G-RDEM), specifically designed for the generation of long run scenarios of economic development, featuring a non-homothetic demand system, endogenous saving rates, differentiated industrial productivity growth, interest payments on foreign debt and time-varying input-output coefficients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model of this kind. We illustrate how parameters of the five modules of structural change have been estimated, and we test the model by comparing its results with those obtained by a more conventional recursive dynamic CGE model. Both models are driven by the same GDP and population data, exogenously provided by the IPCC Shared Socio-economic Pathway 3. GDP levels determine the endogenous productivity parameters. Population affects the definition of per capita income, which in turn affects the household demand system and the variation of input-output coefficients. Information on the demographic structure is also employed to modify the aggregate saving rate parameters. It is found that the two models do produce different findings, both globally and at the regional and industrial level. Understanding the origins of such differences sheds some light on how mechanisms of structural change operate in the long run.
D58|Efficiency Units of Labor: Life-Cycle Profiles Estimates from the CPS 1987-2017|This note provides a set of estimates of the efficiency units profiles that workers supply over the life-cycle in the U.S. labor market. These are helpful for the calibration of OLG models. I rely on data from the March CPS in the 1987-2017 period, and use both non-parametric and parametric estimation methods. Irrespective of the methodology used to obtain the profiles, I find that they differ in essential features from the ones that are typically used in applied work. In terms of the quantitative answers obtained from a life-cycle OLG model with idiosyncratic income shocks and incomplete markets, the discrepancies in the efficiency units profiles are found to be sizable. In terms of consumption equivalent variation, households' welfare decreases by up to 5 percentage points when moving from the standard profiles to the ones estimated here. Quantitatively, the specific profile used have also a substantial impact on the variables that are typically analyzed with this class of models, such as the saving behavior over the life-cycle and the concentration of wealth.

D58|The EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement and its relevance for the Austrian Economy|Since the beginning of 2017, a paradigm change in international trade policy is observed. While the protectionist agendas are on the rise, the EU and Japan signed an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) on 17 July 2018. It is the most ambitious agreement of the EU with any Asian state. The study estimates the effect of the EU-Japan EPA for Austria based on qualitative analysis and a structural gravity model. The model predicts small but positive effects of around 0.01% of GDP for Austria. Highest gains are expected for manufactured goods, particularly in the medium- and high-tech sectors.

Die Studie schätzt die Effekte des EU-Japan-EPA für Österreich mithilfe von qualitativen Analysen und einem strukturellen Gravitationsmodell ab. Für Österreich wurde ein kleiner, aber positiver Effekt von rund 0,01% des BIP errechnet. Es wird erwartet, dass vor allem der Fertigungsbereich in Mittel- und High-Tech-Sektoren von diesem Abkommen profitieren wird.
D58|Impacts of consumers' electricity price misperceptions|Empirical findings indicate that a large share of households misperceives electricity prices and is not able to make deliberate choices in energy service consumption, which leads to biased consumption decisions and thus to inefficient energy use. To investigate the impact of misperceived electricity prices on the derived demand for electricity, the economy and domestic CO2 emissions, we make use of a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The model allows us to take the narrow interweaving of production and consumption sectors into account to investigate the repercussions on supply and demand in Germany and Europe. Providing information on electricity prices or the most efficient utilisation can stimulate reductions in electricity consumption if households are aware of possible trade-offs. However, if consumers perceive the electricity price to be much higher than it actually is, providing information on the true electricity price might turn out to be counter-productive in terms of electricity consumption and domestic CO2 emissions.
D58|Optimal fiscal policy with Epstein-Zin preferences and utility-enhancing government services: lessons from Bulgaria (1999-2016)|This paper explores the effects of fiscal policy in an economy with Epstein-Zin (1989, 1991) preferences, with indirect (consumption) taxes, and all (labor and capital) in- come being taxed at the same rate. To this end, a dynamic general-equilibrium model, calibrated to Bulgarian data (1999-2016), is augmented with a government sector. Two regimes are compared and contrasted - the exogenous (observed) vs. optimal policy (Ramsey) case. The focus of the paper is on the relative importance of consumption vs. income taxation, as well as on the provision of utility-enhancing public services. The main findings from the computational experiments performed in the paper are: (i) The optimal steady-state income tax rate is zero; (ii) The benevolent Ramsey planner provides the optimal amount of the utility-enhancing public services, which are now 25% higher; (iii) The optimal steady-state consumption tax needed to finance the optimal level of government spending is more than fifty percent higher, as compared to the exogenous policy case.
D58|Modelling the G20|World leaders have declared the G20 to be the premier forum for economic cooperation. But as its influence and policy agenda has grown, so too has the need to be able to effectively model the G20 and the implications of its policy agenda. The paper introduces the G-Cubed (G20) model: a multi-country, multi-sector, intertemporal general equilibrium model of the G20. The paper gives an overview of the model and highlights its key features through four simulated shocks, all of which relate to the G20’s goal of reducing global current account imbalances: a fiscal shock (reducing the fiscal deficit in the United States), a productivity/fiscal shock (increasing infrastructure investment in Germany), a consumption shock (increasing domestic consumption in China) and the collective impact of all three shocks occurring simultaneously. The results demonstrate that, to be effective, any model of the G20 must reflect the complex trade and financial linkages between countries, the structural differences across G20 economies and the short-term rigidities observed empirically in the data, as well as a high level of disaggregation across economies, markets and sectors. The simulations show that reducing current account imbalances through these policies often comes with a real economic cost. The results also explain some of the shifts in global current account balances observed since 2007.
D58|Introducing Roy-like Worker Assignment into Computable General Equilibrium Models| This paper develops a new CGE model incorporating a Roy-like worker assignment in which heterogeneous workers endogenously sort into different technologies based on their comparative advantage. The model predicts significantly higher welfare-improving effects of trade liberalization due to technology-upgrading mechanism.
D58|Optimal fiscal policy in the presence of VAT evasion: the case of Bulgaria|This paper explores the effects of fiscal policy in the presence of a VAT evasion channel, and then compares and contrasts two regimes - the exogenous vs. optimal policy case. To this end, a dynamic general-equilibrium model, calibrated to Bulgarian data (1999-2014), is augmented with a government sector. The main findings from the computational experiments performed in the paper are: (i) The optimal steady-state income tax rate is zero; (ii) The benevolent Ramsey planner provides the optimal amount of the valuable public services, which are now three times lower; (iii) The size of the grey sector is twice lower; (iv) optimal steady-state consumption tax needed to finance the optimal level of government spending is twice lower, as compared to the exogenous policy case.
D58|Modelling Electric Vehicles as an Abatement Technology in a Hybrid CGE Model|We present a novel methodology to quantify the social costs and benefits (net social costs) of electric vehicles as an endogenous, demand-driven abatement technology in a general equilibrium framework. This new costing approach relates general equilibrium effects resulting from an increased market penetration of electric vehicles to the external environmental and health effects of the corresponding change in emissions. To this end, we develop a hybrid model combining a computable general equilibrium (CGE) with a discrete choice (DC) model that is capable of depicting an endogenous demand-driven uptake of alternative fuel vehicles. The discrete choice model of the consumer purchase decision between conventional, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles is directly integrated into the CGE model. This hybrid CGE-DC model features a detailed accounting of vehicle fleet development, including yearly numbers of vehicle purchases and cohort depreciation. It depicts nine households differentiated by the degree of urbanization and education, accounts for detailed consumer preferences for the purchase of a passenger vehicle and mode choice decisions. The hybrid CGE-DC model is additionally hard-linked to a bottom-up module for elektricity production by several technologies to provide input for an established impact pathway analysis to quantify the external costs relating to the changed composition of the vehicle fleet and technologies to generate electricity. We apply this methodology to Austria as an empirical example, considering current measures and trends for the uptake of electric vehicles into the vehicle fleet. In particular, we quantify the net social costs of additional measures to foster the introduction of electromobility that are part of the current policy discussion in Austria, and thus provide a blueprint for further application in different national contexts.

D58|A DSGE Model to Evaluate the Macroeconomic Impacts of Taxation|As recognized, taxation is not only an instrument for government to collect revenues from the economic agents but also an instrument of fiscal policy to influence the agents’ behaviour. In this work, we develop a DSGE model to assess the macroeconomic impact of three tax items (taxes on individual income, on firms’ income and on consumption) on the dynamics of both individual tax items and on the aggregate revenues as well. Moreover, we also intend to evaluate how macroeconomic aggregates behave in a presence of stochastic shocks in taxation.
D58|Growth versus equity: A CGE analysis for effects of factor-biased technical progress on economic growth and employment|With factor-biased technical progress described as labor-saving and skill-biased technical changes, there are concerns that technological innovation can lead to unemployment and widen inequality in the economy. This study explores impacts of factor-biased technical changes on the economic system in terms of economic growth, employment, and distribution, using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The results show that technological innovation contributes to higher level of economic growth with productivity improvements. However, our analysis suggests that economic growth accompanied by skill- and capital-biased technical progress disproportionately increases demand for capital and high-skilled labor over skilled and unskilled labor. This shift in the value-added composition is found to deepen income inequality, as more people in higher income groups benefit from skill premium and capital earnings. Our results suggest that policymakers should prepare a wide range of policy measures, such as reforms in educational programs and taxation systems, in order to ensure sustainable growth.
D58|The efficiency cost of protective measures in climate policy|Despite recent achievements towards a global climate agreement, climate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions remains quite heterogeneous across countries. Energy-intensive and trade-exposed (EITE) industries in industrialized countries are concerned on stringent domestic emission pricing that puts them at a competitive disadvantage against producers of similar goods in other countries with more lenient emission regulation. This paper focuses on climate policy design in the United States of America (US) and compares the economic implications of four alternative protective measures for US EITE industries: (i) output-based rebates, (ii) exemptions from emission pricing, (iii) energy intensity standards, and (iv) carbon intensity standards. Using a large-scale computable general equilibrium model we quantify how these protective measures affect competitiveness of US EITE industries. We find that protective measures can improve common trade-related competitiveness indicators such as revealed comparative advantage or relative world trade shares but at the same time may lead to a decline in the output value for EITE industries because of negative income effects. The economy-wide cost of emission abatement under protective measures increase as compared to uniform emission pricing stand-alone such that the gains of protective measures for EITE exports may be more than compensated through losses in domestic EITE demand.
D58|REDD policy impacts on the agri-food sector and food security|Recent research shows that the combined contributions of deforestation, forest degradation and peat land emissions account for about 15% of greenhouse gas emissions. The REDD policy which preserves forests and values standing forests, enables substantial emission reductions. Since agricultural production and area expansion is a primary driver of tropical deforestation, REDD policies might limit the expansion possibilities of agricultural land use and therefore influence competitiveness of the agricultural sector, agricultural prices, trade patterns, agricultural production and therefore food security in the world. This paper studies the impact of REDD policies on the agri-food sector and food security with a global CGE model called MAGNET using a scenario approach. It focuses on the restrictions on agricultural land expansion within the REDD policy package. Simulation results show that REDD policies start to affect the agri-food sector in some lower developed countries if more than 15% of potentially available agricultural areas are protected from deforestation. A stringent REDD policy that protects 90% of land reserves that could potentially be used for agriculture production results in a global real agricultural price increase of almost 7.6%, and a worldwide agricultural production decrease of 1.7%. Regional differences are large, with real agricultural price changes ranging from 4% in North America to about 24% in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia. Food access rapidly deteriorates for low-income population in these regions in the case of high forest protection levels. Compensatory payments are necessary from a food security point of view if the level of forest protection increases. Our results indicate that from a food security perspective REDD policy should stop short of trying to protect more than 40% of global carbon if the compensation mechanism is not effectively implemented within REDD.
D58|A CGE analysis of a rate-based policy for climate change mitigation|We conducted a computable general equilibrium analysis of a policy to regulate carbon dioxide emissions per unit of production in Japan. It is often claimed that regulations based on emission rates might lead to an increase in carbon dioxide emissions but would not suppress economic growth. This study shows that in the short run, a rate-based policy does not lead to an increase in emissions. We also compared a rate-based policy with a cap-and-trade policy and found that the former leads to a greater reduction in the real GDP than the latter. Furthermore, the change in output tends to be more evenly distributed under a rate-based policy than under with a cap-and-trade policy, although the former is inferior in terms of cost-effectiveness.
D58|Automation and Inequality with Taxes and Transfers|The dependence of real income and inequality on changes in factor abundance, total factor productivity, factor bias, the relative cost of capital goods and the progressivity of the tax system are quantified using an elemental general equilibrium model with three households. Observed declines in low-skill labour shares are shown to have been generic in the OECD and to have been responsible for most of the increase in US inequality between 1990 and 2016. The widely anticipated future twist away from low-skill labour toward capital is then examined, in combination with expected changes in population and its skill composition. With downward rigidity of low-skill wages the potential is identified for unemployment to rise to extraordinarily high levels. Productivity growth at twice the pace since 1990 is shown to limit this, though it does not slow the concentration of income. The superior policy response is shown to be a generalization of the US “earned income tax credit” system, with financing from taxes on consumption, rather than capital income.
D58|Modelling a complex world: improving macro-models|Macro models have come under criticism for their ability to understand or predict major economic events such as the global financial crisis and its aftermath. Some of that criticism is warranted; but, in our view, much is not. This paper contributes to the debate over the adequacy of benchmark DSGE models by showing how three extensions, which are features that have characterized the global economy since the early 2000s, are necessary to improve our understanding of global shocks and policy insights. The three extensions are to acknowledge and model the entire global economy and the linkage through trade and capital flows; to allow for a wider range of relative price variability by moving to multiple-sector models rather than a single good model; and to allow for changes in risk perceptions which propagate through financial markets and adjustments in the real economy. These extensions add some complexity to large-scale macro-models, but without them policy models can oversimplify things, allowing misinterpretations of shocks and therefore costly policy mistakes to occur. Using over-simplified models to explain a complex world makes it more likely there will be ‘puzzles’. The usefulness of these extensions is demonstrated in two ways: first, by briefly revisiting some historical shocks to show how outcomes can be interpreted that make sense within a more complex DSGE framework; then, by making a contemporary assessment of the implications from the proposed large fiscal stimulus and the bans on immigration by the Trump administration which have both sectoral and macroeconomic implications that interact.
D58|Automation and Inequality in China|In transitional economies like China, comparatively low real wages imply sub-OECD labor and skill shares of value added and comparatively high capital shares. Despite rapid real wage growth, however, rather than converge toward the OECD, China’s low-skill labor share has been falling, due to structural and technical change. Here this dependence is quantified using an elemental national model with three households. Since 1994, a third of the total change in the Gini coefficient is estimated to be due to structural change and the rest to mainly skill-biased technical change. Widely anticipated further twists away from low-skill labor toward capital are then examined, assuming downward rigidity of low-skill wages and transfers that sustain low-skill welfare via taxes on capital income. The potential is identified for unemployment to rise extraordinarily, with negative effects mitigated if the population declines or if the share twists are accompanied by very strong total factor productivity growth.
D58|Evaluación de una política de sustitución de energías fósiles para reducir las emisiones de carbono|Background: The energy reform from 2008 promotes the generation and use of renewable energy. Methods: The aim of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of an environmental policy which promotes the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy through tax policy, using a general equilibrium model. Results: Results show that the efficacy of an environmental policy depends on the elasticity of substitution existing in the economy. Conclusions: It is crucial to invest in research and in the development of technology that promotes technological change and fosters greater use of renewable energy, particularly in the most polluting productive sectors in Mexico. It also shows that it is necessary to accelerate energy transition, using clean energy sources as part of the policies and strategies to mitigate greenhouse gases.// Antecedentes: La reforma energética del 2008 promueve la generación y el uso de las energías renovables. Métodos: El objetivo de este trabajo es evaluar la efectividad de una política ambiental que promueva la sustitución de energías fósiles, por energías renovables a través de una política fiscal, para ello se utiliza un modelo de equilibrio general. Resultados: Los resultados muestran que la eficacia de una política ambiental depende de la elasticidad de sustitución existente en la economía. Conclusiones: Resulta crucial invertir en la investigación y el desarrollo de tecnología que promueva el cambio tecnológico y propicie un mayor uso de las energías renovables, sobre todo en los sectores productivos más contaminantes en México. Asimismo, se muestra que es necesario acelerar una transición energética, que utilice fuentes de energía limpia, como parte de las políticas y estrategias de mitigación de gases de efecto invernadero.
D58|Comparison of Various Business Cycle Models for Pakistan|In this paper, we compare the performance of different models, on two data frequencies, in terms of matching the business cycle moments of Pakistani economy. Out of the four models, two are simple real business cycle models for Pakistan introduced in Choudhary and Pasha (2013), and the other two are benchmark models [Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) and Garcia-Cicco et al. (2010)] from the literature for explaining the business cycles in emerging and developing economies. This paper calibrate these models for Pakistan and evaluate their performance in terms of matching second order moments from the actual data at both annual and quarterly frequency. We find that even though no single model is able to match all the relevant moments for all the important macroeconomic variables at both frequencies, the augmented RBC model with FDI shock (Choudhary and Pasha, 2013) performs relatively better.
D58|Extending the Public Sector in the ICES Model with an Explicit Government Institution| This paper aims to present an extension of the ICES model to capture the public sector. Departing from a demand system mainly derived from the GTAP model, ICES-XPS model disentangles the private and the public actors. The paper reviews the changes in both the database and the model equations following the existing literature and considering the availability of data as well. The model is then tested with a series of simple experiments to highlight its contribution to economic analysis in which the public sector may play an important role. Finally, we show the flexibility in the closure rule of the public sector that allows addressing different policy research questions.

D58|Macroeconomic implications of switching to process-emission-free iron and steel production in Europe| Options to significantly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions in line with long-term political targets include switches in production technologies to those free of industrial process emissions. Exemplifying this transition, we analyse such a switch of the European iron and steel industry and its sectoral, macroeconomic and social implications. We employ a recursive-dynamic multi-region multi-sector computable general equilibrium approach in order to cover feedback effects originating from the integration of European sectors in a globally embedded context. Against the backdrop of a globally implemented CO2 price trajectory, we investigate how the range of macroeconomic implications depends on (i) the timing of the switch (either starting early in 2020 or late in 2035) and (ii) the investment and operating cost of two promising low-carbon technologies. We distinguish between high-cost and low-cost technological specifications, though both face cost disadvantages relative to conventional iron and steel production for current intermediate inputs and primary factors. An early implementation of a `high-cost' technological alternative further reduces long-term GDP in 2050 among EU regions (-2.3% to -0.5% as compared to -1.4% to -0.3% for a late implementation starting in 2035). By contrast, GDP implications in 2050 seem to be unconstrained by early or late implementation of a `low-cost' technology (regional range of -0.3% to 0.9% for both). However, welfare is reduced, particularly during the initial implementation phase since additional investment to build up new facilities reduces output available for other consumption needs. This `build-up' might represent a barrier to such transitions, as the generation to decide on implementation and potentially bearing (macro)economic costs might not be the generation benefitting from it.
D58|Fostering Renewables and Recycling a Carbon Tax: Joint Aggregate and Intergenerational Redistributive Effects|A rising share of renewables in the energy mix pushes up the average price of energy - and so does a carbon tax. However the former bolsters the accumulation of capital whereas the latter, if fully recycled, does not. Thus, in general equilibrium, the effects on growth and intertemporal welfare of these two environmental policies differ. The present article assesses and compares these effects. It relies on a computable general equilibrium model with overlapping generations, an energy module and a public finance module. The main result is that an increasing share of renewables in the energy mix and a fully recycled carbon tax have opposite (though limited) impacts on activity and individuals’ intertemporal welfare in the long run. The recycling of a carbon tax fosters consumption and labour supply, and thus growth and welfare, whereas an increasing share of renewables does not. Results also suggest that a higher share of renewables and a recycled carbon tax trigger intergenerational redistributive effects, with the former being relatively detrimental for young generations and the latter being pro-youth. The policy implication is that a social planner seeking to modify the structure of the energy mix while achieving some neutrality as concerns the GDP and triggering some proyouth intergenerational equity, could usefully contemplate the joint implementation of higher quantitative targets for the future development of renewables and a carbon tax fully recycled through lower proportional taxes.
D58|Dynamic Impacts on Growth and Intergenerational Effects of Energy Transition in a Time of Fiscal Consolidation|Social planners in most western countries will be facing two long-lasting challenges in the next years: energy transition and fiscal consolidation. One problem is that governments might consider that implementing an energy transition could get in the way of achieving a fiscal consolidation. If so, interrupting the energy transition in a time of fiscal consolidation would involve significant aggregate impacts on activity and intergenerational redistributive effects. This article tries to assess them empirically. It relies on an overlapping-generations framework in a general equilibrium setting, with a detailed energy module. The model is parameterized on data provided by OECD/IEA for France. Different results emerge. Renouncing to the energy transition would slightly foster the level of GDP during the next 10 to 15 years - depending on the dynamics of the prices of fossil fuels on world markets - but weigh on it more significantly afterwards (up to -1% in 2050). If the prices of fossil fuels keep increasing in the future, implementing an energy transition could have broadly the same favourable effects on the GDP level in the long run as those of a fiscal consolidation diminishing significantly public spending instead of raising taxes. In the long-run, the GDP would be maximized by implementing an energy transition and simultaneously lessening the public deficit by lowering some public expenditure, a policy that would entail an overall gain of around 1,6% of GDP in 2050. Stopping the energy transition would also bring about intergenerational issues. It would be detrimental to the intertemporal wellbeing of almost all cohorts alive in 2010. A fiscal policy with lower public expenditures and frozen tax rates may be still more favourable to young and future generations than implementing an energy transition. However, renouncing to an energy transition would annihilate most of these pro-youth effects.
D58|Trade and Fiscal Deficits, Tax Reform, and the Dollar: General Equilibrium Impact Estimates|"Advocates of using a border tax adjustment (BTA) to shift the corporate profits tax to a ""destination"" basis argue that such an arrangement would not be protectionist, because the import tax and export subsidy would be fully offset by an induced appreciation of the dollar. To examine this claim, this study applies an updated and extended general equilibrium model from the author's 2005 book, The United States as a Debtor Nation. Cline finds that across various scenarios, the dollar appreciation typically would be less than half the amount needed to offset fully the BTA. Advocates of the BTA implicitly assume a strong, prompt expectational boost to the dollar upon announcement of the shift. Instead, market practitioners and mainstream macroeconomic models see the interest rate as the main driver of the exchange rate. Although an incipient rise in the trade balance would indeed put upward pressure on the interest rate and thus the exchange rate, it would also result in reduced investment. With the trade deficit equal to investment minus saving (I–S = M–X), reduced investment would tend to set the new equilibrium at a lower trade deficit before the interest rate would rise sufficiently to boost the dollar to a level that would completely offset the BTA.to about 12 and 14 percent of riskweighted assets, respectively. These levels are, respectively, about one-fourth to one-half higher than the Basel III capital requirements for the large global systemically important banks (G-SIBs)."
D58|The long-awaited rise of the middle class in Latin America is finally happening|In many developing countries, the supply of skilled workers is likely to continue to be stronger than demand, and this should drive down the skill premium and reduce inequality. Within the limitations of any exercise based on simulations, this paper finds that the recently observed reduction in inequality in Latin America may continue. Building on counterfactual scenarios projecting economic and demographic (including age and education) growth, the paper also highlights that by 2030 the long-awaited rise of the middle class in Latin America will be in full swing, as its share will be 43 percent of the total population, twice the value in 2005. This achievement is not guaranteed, as countries with large initial inequalities will have to achieve very high rates of inclusive growth. At the same time, a larger middle class is likely to exert a stronger influence on international and domestic policy making.

D58|Comment on Suzuki’s rebuttal of Batra and Casas|Batra and Casas (1976) claimed that ‘a strong Rybczynski result’ arises in the three-factor two-good general equilibrium trade model. In subsequent comments, Suzuki (1983) contended that this could not be the case. Among his comments, Suzuki found that the set of three equations holds for the Allen-partial elasticity of substitution under the assumption of perfect complementarity, and he applied these to his analysis. In the following, I demonstrate that these are impossible, hence his dissenting proof is not plausible.
D58|Measuring the true index of cost of living under general equilibrium|We show that the index of cost of living introduced by Konüs (1939) is numéraire dependent in a general equilibrium setting. This dependency gives rise to ambiguity situations for the interpretation of the index. To correct for this ambiguity we show that we need to neutralize the standard Konüs index using a price index. This correction eliminates the interpretational problem due to, and inherited from, the selection of the numéraire. We also provide a simplified expression of the index for the case of homothetic utilities. Two numerical examples show the discrepancies between the literal estimates, as they would be used under partial equilibrium, and the neutralized version. The discrepancies would give rise to erroneous assessments in the evaluation of the welfare effects resulting from the adoption of new policies.
D58|Demand-Driven Structural Change in Applied General Equilibrium Models|This study analyzes the variations in industrial structure induced by income-sensitive patterns of final consumption, and how these changes can be captured by a multi-sector numerical model with a flexible demand system. We focus, in particular, on the estimation of parameters for an AIDADS (An Implicitly, Directly Additive Demand System) specification. We then test the latter by inserting it in the ENVISAGE global general equilibrium dynamic model, which is run under the SSP2 scenario from 2011 to 2050. It is found that time-varying income elasticity can generate sizable variations in the industrial structure. This finding has important practical implications, particularly when structural models are applied at a medium and long term horizon.
D58|Privatisation and the unusual case of Belarusian accession to the WTO|The accession negotiations of Belarus to the WTO are unusual since, due to its obligations in the Eurasian Economic Union, WTO accession is not expected to impact its tariffs or formerly substantial trade distorting agricultural subsidies. Nonetheless, we estimate that WTO accession will increase welfare by 8.8 percent per year in Belarus in the medium term. We show that inclusion of (i) foreign direct investment; (ii) reduction on non-discriminatory barriers against services providers; and (iii) our model with imperfect competition and endogenous productivity effects together produce esti-mated gains eleven times larger than a model of perfect competition with only cross-border trade in services. Our analysis is enabled by our production of a dataset on both discriminatory and non-discriminatory barriers in services and their ad valorem equivalents. Based on a new dataset on labor productivity by sector and type of ownership, in our central model we estimate that privatization will increase welfare by 35.4 percent. We find substantial variance in the estimated gains from privatiza-tion depending on model assumptions; but all the estimates of the impacts of privatization indicate substantial welfare gains.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D58|Wealth distribution with random discount factors|To explain the Pareto tail behavior empirically observed in wealth distributions, the quantitative macro literature has occasionally assumed that agents have random discount factors. This paper formally proves that the stationary wealth distribution in a simple Huggett model with random discounting has power law tails and characterizes the Pareto exponents analytically. I find that in general there is no clear relationship between the return on wealth and inequality and that the Pareto exponent is highly sensitive to the persistence of the discount factor process. I also provide a practical guidance for how to characterize the Pareto exponents in richer models.
D58|Fat tails and spurious estimation of consumption‐based asset pricing models|The standard generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation of Euler equations in heterogeneous-agent consumption-based asset pricing models is inconsistent under fat tails because the GMM criterion is asymptotically random. To illustrate this, we generate asset returns and consumption data from an incomplete-market dynamic general equilibrium model that is analytically solvable and exhibits power laws in consumption. Monte Carlo experiments suggest that the standard GMM estimation is inconsistent and susceptible to Type II errors (incorrect non-rejection of false models). Estimating an overidentified model by dividing agents into age cohorts appears to mitigate Type I and II errors.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D58|Paris after Trump: An Inconvenient Insight|With his announcement to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement US President Donald Trump has snubbed the international climate policy community. Key remaining parties to the Agreement such as Europe and China might call for carbon tariffs on US imports as a sanctioning instrument to coerce US compliance. Our analysis, however, reveals an inconvenient insight for advocates of carbon tariffs: given the possibility of retaliatory tariffs across all imported goods, carbon tariffs do not constitute a credible threat for the US. A tariff war with its main trading partners China and Europe might make the US worse off than compliance with the Paris Agreement but China, in particular, should prefer US defection to a tariff war.
D58|Recovery is Never Easy - Dynamics and Multiple Equilibria with Financial Arbitrage, Production and Collateral Constraints|We develop a simple general equilibrium model to study the interactions between financial arbitrage and the real economy under collateral constraints. In good times, arbitrage activities help boost the production sectors by providing external funds to capital investment. However, when exposed to adverse shocks and panic market reactions, arbitrage also amplifies the financial distress and makes it easier for the economy to fall into self-fulfilling crises. Moreover, the possibility of regime switches triggered by exogenous shocks also complicates the path to recovery. The combination of financial distress and pessimistic market anticipation not only slows down the recovery process, but also can trap the economy in a less healthy steady state.
D58|Arbitrage Crashes, Financial Accelerator, and Sudden Market Freezes|We develop an infinite horizon model that links the intermediation in both the financial and real sectors. Intermediaries provide market liquidity and exploit the arbitrage profits in segmented financial markets. To do so, they use their productive capital as collateral. We show that the weakened intermediation and arbitrage losses are mutually reinforcing during an economic downturn. This forces intermediaries to de-lever and leads to liquidity spirals in both financial and real sectors. Also, the distress might further open up the possibility of sudden run-like market freezes, where intermediaries are denied access to renewed funding through arbitrage. We evaluate the effect of three intervention policies: direct purchase of distressed assets, interest rate cuts, and capital injection. We find that capital injection is most effective as it loosens the margin requirement. The interest cut is least effective because it exacerbates the capital misallocation.
D58|Family Economics Writ Large|Powerful currents have reshaped the structure of families over the last century. There has been (1) a dramatic drop in fertility and greater parental investment in children; (2) a rise in married female labor-force participation; (3) a significant decline in marriage; (4) a higher degree of positive assortative mating; (5) more children living with a single mother; and (6) shifts in social norms governing premarital sex and married women's roles in the workplace. Macroeconomic models explaining these aggregate trends are surveyed. The relentless flow of technological progress and its role in shaping family life are stressed.
D58|Un modelo de equilibrio general dinámico para la evaluación de la política económica en Colombia|Este documento presenta un modelo de equilibrio general dinámico para el análisis de la economía colombiana. A diferencia de la mayoría de modelos de equilibrio general aplicado, este integra simultáneamente (i) el modelamiento dinámico de la toma de decisiones; (ii) la posibilidad de simular política económica discrecional; y (iii) un tratamiento explícito de los encadenamientos intersectoriales en la economía. Gracias a esto, resulta idóneo para responder preguntas que no se prestan para ser estudiadas con otros modelos económicos, como los modelos de equilibrio general dinámico estocástico (DSGE) o los modelos de equilibrio general computable (CGE). El trabajo consta de cuatro capítulos. En el primero se hace una detallada revisión de la literatura, tanto teórica como de modelos aplicados al caso de Colombia. Queremos con ello hacer plena claridad respecto del vacío que pretendemos llenar con nuestro trabajo. El segundo capítulo desarrolla el modelo mientras que en el tercero se presenta la calibración de los parámetros. El cuarto capítulo se presenta un par de simulaciones para ilustrar el uso del modelo.
D58|Updating USAGE: Baseline and Illustrative Application|USAGE is a dynamic, CGE model of the U.S. economy created at CoPS in collaboration with the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC). The model has been used by and on behalf of: the USITC; the U.S. Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Energy, Transportation and Homeland Security; private sector organizations such as the Cato Institute and the Mitre Corporation; and the Canadian Embassy in Washington DC. To keep the model relevant for policy analysis, it must be updated periodically. This paper describes a major update of USAGE undertaken for the USITC. In accordance with the CoPS contract with the USITC, the update task was to: 1. build a NAICS-based database at the 400-industry level for USAGE using the 2007 BEA benchmark input-output tables; 2. update this database to 2014; 3. create a baseline projection starting from the base year of 2014 and proceeding at 5 year intervals to 2024; and 4. conduct an illustrative USAGE policy simulation around the baseline. At the completion of this work in August 2016, the ITC requested a fifth task: 5. update from 2007 to 2015 rather than 2014 and create a baseline from 2015 to 2020. This paper describes how we undertook the five tasks.
D58|University location and city development: the effects of Victoria University on the Western Melbourne economy|Does the presence of a local university affect the economic development of an area within a large city? This paper focuses on the Western region of Melbourne, which accounts for 18 per cent of the city's population of 4.5 million. Only one of Melbourne's seven universities has located campuses in Western Melbourne, a region containing many areas of social disadvantage. The importance of the University to the region's economy in 2013 is analysed with the aid of a 6-region CGE model, four of the regions covering Greater Melbourne. The analysis is undertaken by simulating a counterfactual that there was no university in the region during the period 1992 to 2013. Under the counterfactual, students who in actuality had studied in Western Melbourne in the period are assumed to have either attended a university in another Melbourne region or forgone a university education. The simulation accounted for a relocation of both the University's demand-side impacts (operating expenditures and student living costs) and its supply-side impacts (knowledge effects). A particular feature of the analysis was the estimation of the interregional relocation of local productivity effects flowing in 2013 from returns to the stocks of human capital and research knowledge accumulated over the years from 1992. For the human capital effects this involved, for each Melbourne region, undertaking detailed estimates of changes in annual university completions, annual migration rates, labour force participation rates, interregional commuting and returns to university qualifications. Key assumptions related to the effects of university proximity on tertiary participation and of place of study on regional attachment. For local R&D effects, regional estimates were made of annual R&D expenditure, knowledge decay, returns to R&D expenditure and regional knowledge spillovers. The simulation results suggested that the presence of a university in Western Melbourne had a significant effect on the region's GDP, but due to interregional commuting the local university had a more muted effect on the real consumption of the region's households.
D58|An Application of the Integrated Economic-Environmental Modelling Framework to Guatemala's Forest and Fuelwood Sector|This paper develops and operationalizes the Integrated Economic-Environmental Modelling (IEEM) platform which integrates environmental data organized under the first international standard for environmental-economic accounting with a powerful economy-wide modelling approach. IEEM enables the ex-ante economic analysis of public policies and investment on the economy and the environment in a quantitative, comprehensive and consistent framework. IEEM elucidates the two-way interrelationships between the economy and environment, considering how economic activities depend on the environment as a source of inputs and as a sink for its outputs. In addition to standard economic impact indicators such as gross domestic product, income and employment, IEEM generates indicators that describe policy impacts on the use of environmental resources, wealth and environmental quality which together determine prospects for future economic growth and well-being. To illustrate the analytical capacity of IEEM, the model is calibrated with Guatemala's environmental-economic accounts and applied to analysis of its forest and fuelwood sector where negative health and environmental impacts arise from inefficient household fuelwood use.
D58|Biome composition in deforestation deterrence and GHG emissions in Brazil|We analyze the Brazilian commitments to COP21 under different scenarios, with a general equilibrium model of Brazil developed for land use change and GHG emissions analysis. The model is dynamic, inter-regional and bottom-up, and here distinguishes 16 regions and 6 biomes. We simulate different scenarios of future deforestation, including the halt of illegal deforestation, the restoration of 12Mha of forests, and replacing deforestation in the Amazon biome by deforestation in the Cerrado biome. Our analysis shows that the restoration of 12 Mha of forests would be enough to meet Brazil's 2025 commitments with no other extra GHG savings efforts, but would not meet 2030 commitments. Exchanging deforestation in the Amazon biome for deforestation in the Cerrado biome would seriously compromise the accomplishment of the targets. We note that emissions in the general economy are increasing in Brazil, suggesting that other efforts must be made to meet the COP21 targets.
D58|A decomposition and microsimulation analysis of occupational wage growth in Australia, 2010-2017|Dynamic historical and comparative static decomposition CGE simulations are a powerful tool for understanding structural change and its impacts. In this paper, we examine the impact on wages of three sets of structural drivers: macroeconomic factors, qualification supply, and technical change. To the CGE analysis, we add a microsimulation analysis. Microsimulation addresses a shortcoming in CGE modelling, which is that the household sector is represented by one or several representative agents. With the representative agent treatment, CGE modelling is unable to capture all of the diversity in the household sector in relation to the levels of income, sources of income, and composition of expenditure by different households. Over the study period of 2010 to 2017, average growth in real wages in Australia was weak. Growth in high-wage occupations was generally stronger than growth in low-wage occupations, resulting in a widening gap between the wages of the highest- and lowest-paid workers. Over the period, key results from our research indicate that: (a) Macroeconomic factors played a role in determining overall wage growth, but did not explain the disparity between wage growth at the occupational level; (b) Strong growth in the supply of qualifications at the level of bachelor degree level and above detracted from wage growth in the high-skill occupations; (c) Skill-biased technical change in favour of the high-skill occupations led to relatively strong growth in the wages of high-skill occupations, an effect that dominated the results; and (d) Relatively strong growth in the wages of high-skill occupations added disproportionately to the incomes of high-income households and led to an increase in household income disparities and an increase in the relative poverty rate. However, this result did not take into account possible changes in occupation by households over the study period. With the wages of low-skilled occupations falling further below average, a change of occupation, rather than a pay-rise in their existing occupations, was a better prospect for low-income households to avoid falling into absolute or relative poverty. The decomposition analysis could be extended to a broader analysis of structural change in the Australian economy, and may be the subject of future research. The links built for this analysis between CGE modelling and microsimulation also suggest scope for future research. An earlier version of results reported here was presented at the Melbourne Economic Forum on December 12, 2017. We are grateful to members of the Forum including Peter Dixon, James Giesecke, Craig Emerson and Mark Wooden for valuable feedback.
D58|On the Geography of Global Value Chains|This paper studies the optimal location of production for the different stages in a sequential global value chain. We develop a general-equilibrium model featuring a proximity-concentration tradeoff: slicing global value chains across countries allows to better exploit agglomeration economies, but such fragmentation comes at the cost of increased transportation costs. We show that, other things equal, it is optimal to locate relatively downstream stages of production in relatively central or well-connected locations, while upstream stages of production are optimally assigned to more remote locations. We illustrate this result by working out the optimal location of production for a few basic topologies featuring a low number of countries and stages. Exact solutions to the problem for a larger number of countries and stages are computationally complex, but can be obtained using combinatorial optimization tools. We apply the model to study the optimal specialization within chains in eleven countries in Factory Asia.
D58|Multifactor CES elasticity and productivity growth : a cross-sectional approach|Sector-wise productivity growth is measured, along with the sectoral elasticity of substitution, under the multifactor CES framework by regressing the growth of factor-wise cost shares against the growth of relative factor prices. We use linked input–output tables for Japan and Korea as the data sources for factor price and cost shares in two temporally distant states. We then construct a multisectoral general equilibrium model using the system of estimated CES unit cost functions and evaluate the economy-wide distribution of exogenous productivity gains in terms of welfare. Further, we examine the differences between models based on a priori elasticities such as the Leontief and the Cobb–Douglas systems.
D58|Japan–Korea Trade Liberalization Revisited: The Role of Armington Elasticities|The elasticity of substitution between foreign and domestic products, i.e., Armington elasticity, is measured by way of two-state calibration according to the temporally distant observations of the market shares, and associated price changes. Along with the sector-wise multifactor CES elasticity estimated using the linked input-output tables, we integrate domestic production of the two countries (Japan and the Republic of Korea) with bilateral trades and construct a bilateral general equilibrium model. Thereupon, we perform an economic assessment of trade liberalization between the two countries.
D58|Latent Tastes, Incomplete Stratification, and the Plausibility of Vertical Sorting Models|Abstract This paper uses the 2011 Phoenix Area Social Survey to evaluate the plausibility of the assumptions made with pure characteristics sorting models to rationalize incomplete stratification of households across local communities by income. The analysis with the New Ecological Paradigm, a well-recognized index of environmental attitudes, confirms the correlations in equilibrium outcomes implied by these models. As a result, it provides the first empirical support for the role of differences in the tastes for public goods as one explanation that provides the rationale for the commonly observed sorting outcomes.
D58|Social conflict and wage inequality|Abstract This paper studies the relationship between social conflict and skilled–unskilled wage inequality through the three-sector general equilibrium approach. In the basic model without the urban unskilled minimum wage, we find that when the government enhances the degree of controlling social conflict, the skilled–unskilled wage inequality will be narrowed down (resp. widened) if the urban skilled sector is more capital intensive (resp. labor intensive) than the urban unskilled sector. The extended models address the issue under different economic structures or different types of social conflict. In the extended model with the urban unskilled minimum wage, we find that the skilled–unskilled inequality will be widened when the degree of controlling social conflict is increased. In other extended models, we find that the above obtained results are still robust.
D58|House Prices, Geographical Mobility, and Unemployment|Geographical mobility correlates positively with house prices and negatively with unemployment over the U.S. business cycle. I present a DSGE model in which declining house prices and tight credit conditions impede the mobility of indebted workers. This reduces the workers' cross-area competition for jobs, causing wages and unemployment to rise. A Bayesian estimation shows that this channel more than quadruples the response of unemployment to adverse housing market shocks. The estimation also shows that adverse housing market shocks caused the decline in mobility during the Great Recession. Absent this decline, the unemployment rate would have been 0.5 p.p. lower.
D58|Medición de los efectos de un aumento del 20% de las tarifas de Estados Unidos sobre la economía mexicana a través de modelización multisectorial|The goal of this research is to simulate the possible effects of the 20% increase in tariffs on the Mexican economy. The price model used is based on a general equilibrium linear model. With this price model, the estimate of the impact of the effects of a US tariff increase of 20% on the Mexican economy is roughly estimated, simulating this increase on prices in the rest of the world. In this way, it is possible to calculate the effects on consumer prices and welfare represented in this case by the CPI. The main result shows that the impact of the increase of the prices of the rest of the world to the increase of the tariffs in the United States on the CPI is inflationary with an increase of around 4%.
D58|¿Cómo se ha comportado el sector turístico andaluz en la crisis económica? Reflexiones sobre turismo sostenible y el desarrollo regional|Assessing the effects of tourism activities on regional development is not a common practice, although its benefits for the host economies are widely highlighted. This work focuses on Andalusia to analyze these effects during the crisis period. To do so, a Social Accounting Matrix based model is employed, which depicts Tourism activities as a key sector for the regional economy. Additionally to the structural analysis, a bunch of socio-economic data is analyzed to determine whether the role of the Tourism within the regional economy is sustainable or a simple result of the current framework. Within the latter, employment data is studied in a detailed way since Tourism play a role of the major importance in job creation at regional level. The preliminary results point out that the relevance of Tourism in the regional economy comes from the crisis and the declining behavior of the remaining sectors rather than the own characteristic of the sector. Moreover, the work highlights the weaknesses of the sector and the lack of development of a system of sustainable tourism indicators.
D58|Optimal policy design: A CGE approach|In this paper we extend an existing computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to perform optimal policy design exercises. Specifically, to an otherwise standard CGE model, we add an objective function that allows us to compute optimal values for selected policy variables. In turn, the CGE model operates as the constraint of the optimization problem. In addition, we illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach to optimal policy design. For this purpose, we develop an exercise with real data from Argentina.
D58|One Size May Not Fit All: Welfare Benefits And Cost Reductions With Differentiated Household Electricity Rates In A General Equilibrium Model|We consider optional TOU (time-of-use) pricing for residential consumers as an alternative to a single TOU or flat rate structure offered by a publicly regulated electricity supplier. A general equilibrium model is developed and used to explore and quantify the effects of optional pricing on welfare, consumption, and production costs. The model assumes that households can be classified into internally homogeneous groups with differing utility functions, incomes, demand elasticities, and committed consumption requirements. Substitution for electricity among TOU periods and between electricity and other goods is allowed for in the model on the demand side, and differing TOU-specific marginal costs on the supply side. The supplier in the model offers to each household a menu of possible rate sets obtained by maximizing a collective welfare function subject to three types of restriction: Pareto efficiency (no household is worse off under the proposed pricing scheme than under the current pricing scheme); incentive compatibility (every household weakly prefers its set of rates to the sets chosen by other households); breakeven supplier revenue (aggregate revenue must equal aggregate cost). The model is calibrated realistically with three household groups and three distinct TOU costing periods, and used in a series of simulation experiments, including experiments with alternative demand elasticities and marginal cost parameters. The use of optional pricing is shown to increase overall consumer welfare and reduce average production cost. However, the distribution of welfare effects can be uneven, with the highest income group dominating the market to the relative disadvantage of the lowest group. To deal with that situation an alternative strategy with a targeted rate structure for the lowest income group is proposed, corresponding to a modified version of the model specified in which some incentive compatibility restrictions are relaxed. Simulations show that the strategy can be effective in bringing about a more equitable distribution of welfare gains while still maintaining optional TOU pricing.
D58|Intertemporal CGE Analysis of Income Distribution in Turkey|This study focuses on the effects of public policies on the size distribution of income in Turkey. To this end, an intertemporal dynamic equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents in a small open economy framework is constructed. This study serves several extensions to the literature via its algebraic structure and the calibration process in which various micro-level data sets are utilized. The results reveal that, in line with the previous findings of the literature, increasing budget allocations to unilateral social transfer programs has no significant effect on the size distribution of income and has adverse effects on the labor market decisions of relatively poor laborers. On the contrary, subsidizing the cost of labor has positive impacts on labor supplies and the size distribution of income improves in favor of relatively poor households.
D58|Strategic Effects of Investment and Private Information: The Incumbent’s Curse|We study a two-period entry model where the incumbent, privately informed about his cost of production, makes a long run investment choice along with a pricing decision. Investment is costreducing and its effects are assumed to differ across incumbent’s types, as a result investment plays a double role as a commitment variable and, along with price, as a signal. We ask whether and how investment decisions allow the incumbent to limit entry into the market. We find that the incumbent will never undertake strategic investment to deter profitable entry, because when incumbent’s costs are private information the signaling role of investment cancels out its value of commitment.

D58|Public Finance in a Nutshell: A Cobb Douglas Teaching Tool for General Equilibrium Tax Incidence and Excess Burden|To help first- or second-year graduate students in economics apply their theoretical training, this paper shows how to solve a simple and intuitive computable general equilibrium (CGE) model using a calculator. Because this simplified Harberger model uses Cobb Douglas functional forms for utility and production, one can solve for all input and output prices and quantities with no taxes and then solve for exact measures of output with a large tax change (not using derivatives). We then show how to solve simultaneously for capital and labor prices (incidence on the sources side of income), for both output prices (incidence on the uses side), for exact measures of overall welfare loss such as the equivalent variation, for excess burden and marginal excess burden, and for the effects on revenue in the form of a Laffer Curve.
D58|Multi-objective local environmental simulator (MOLES 1.0): Model specification, algorithm design and policy applications|This paper describes MOLES 1.0, an integrated land-use and transport model developed with Object-Oriented Programming principles in order to combine selected characteristics from Spatial Computable General Equilibrium and microsimulation models.
D58|Boon or Bane? Trade Sanctions and the Stability of InternationalEnvironmental Agreements|In spite of scientific agreement on the negative effects of anthropogenic climate change, efforts to find cooperative solutions on the international level have been unsatisfactory so far. Trade sanctions in the form of import tariffs are one principal measure discussed as a means to foster cooperation. Former studies have concluded that import tariffs are an effective mechanism to establish international cooperation. However, most of these studies rely on the assumption that outsiders are not able to retaliate, i.e. to implement import tariffs themselves. In this paper we use combined analytical and numerical analysis to investigate implications of retaliation. We find a threshold effect: below a certain coalition size the effect of retaliation predominates and decreases incentives to be a coalition member. In coalitions above the threshold size the effect of trade sanctions that stabilizes coalitions dominates and enables the formation of larger stable coalitions. Our analysis suggests that only after a sufficiently large climate coalition has already been formed, the threat of trade sanctions might be an effective stick to establish the grand coalition.
D58|On the Effect of an Increase in the VAT on Electricity in Portugal|In this paper we analyze the budgetary, economic, distributional and environmental effects of a permanent increase in Portugal of the value added tax on electricity spending. The analysis in conducted in the context of a new multi-sector and multi-household dynamic general equilibrium model of the Portuguese economy. Simulation results suggest that a permanent increase in the VAT on electricity from 6% to 23% has positive budgetary and environmental effects but both come at the cost of detrimental economic and distributional effects. As economic performance in Portugal improves and the public budgetary situation becomes less constraining, it is inevitable that pressure will mount for this increase in the VAT rate on electricity to be reversed. This mixed bag of results provides an important element in this debate. Reverting to a VAT tax rate of 6% on electricity, would improve economic performance and have positive distributional effects. From this perspective such reversion would be desirable. The question is then whether or not the public budget can somehow compensate for the loss of revenues in a way that would not eliminate the positive economic and distributional effects of such reversion.
D58|Decomposing the Marginal Excess Burden of Australia’s Goods and Services Tax|We estimate the marginal excess burden of the GST and its components. Our results show that the GST is highly distortionary in its treatment of intermediate inputs and investment, but is efficient as applied to household consumption. We also estimate the general equilibrium effects of changes to the GST base and rate, and its removal from investment. The general equilibrium estimates support the marginal excess burden estimates. Our results suggest that the efficiency of the GST could be improved by broadening the consumption base or removing it from investment. Simply increasing the GST rate would be welfare decreasing.
D58|Macroeconomic Effects of a Low-Carbon Electricity Transition in Kenya and Ghana: An Exploratory Dynamic General Equilibrium Analysis|The present study applies purpose-built dynamic computable general equilibrium models for Ghana and Kenya with a disaggregated country-specific representation of the power sector to simulate the prospective medium-run growth and distributional implications associated with a shift towards a higher share of renewables in the power mix up to 2025. In both countries the share of fossil-fuel-based thermal electricity generation in the power mix will increase sharply over the next decade and beyond according to current national energy sector development plans. The overarching general message suggested by the simulation results presented here is that in both countries it appears feasible to reduce the carbon content of electricity generation significantly without adverse consequences for economic growth and without noteworthy distributional effects.
D58|Huggett economies with multiple stationary equilibria|I obtain a closed-form solution to a Huggett economy with constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) utility when the vector of individual state variables follows a VAR(1) process with an arbitrary shock distribution. The stationary equilibrium is unique if the income process is AR(1), but not necessarily so otherwise. With Gaussian shocks, I provide general sufficient conditions for the existence of at least three equilibria when the income process is either ARMA(1,1), AR(2), or has a persistent-transitory (PT) representation with negatively correlated shocks. The possibility of multiple equilibria calls for caution in comparative statics exercises and policy analyses using heterogeneous-agent models. As an illustration I provide an example in which the welfare implication of changing the income risk goes in opposite directions depending on the choice of equilibrium.
D58|Critique of impact assessment of regional trade agreements using non-tariff measures|Are cent study undertaken by Kawasaki (2017) uses a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to estimate the impact of removal tariffs and non-tariff measures on trade flows and the overall gross domestic product (GDP) of the remaining 11 countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP11) partner countries. This note attempts to provide insights into such estimations so as to help in real impact assessments of the tariff and non-tariff provisions of agreements such as the TPP11. It warns that policy makers who seek to rely on such studies need to be aware of the large number of assumptions that underlie the quantification of the non-tariff measures, including that regulation is necessarily negative for trade, and other limitations of the methodology used. The paper also notes these are only one aspect of the broader economic impacts of an agreement that includes chapters on intellectual property, investor protections, government procurement, and state-owned enterprises, among others.
D58|Economic Liberalization and urban unemployment in the presence of informal sector|In this paper, we construct a three sector general equilibrium model of a small open economy with informal sector. The paper examines the impact of less protectionist policy on the output levels, factor prices, and the level of urban employment. Here, it has been shown that the urban unemployment rate has been lowered with the contraction of import competing manufacturing sector consequent upon a reduction in tariff. The informal intermediate sector has contracted as well. It is further shown here that there is a possibility of expansion of exportable agricultural sector with increased wage rate. The paper is then extended to introduce foreign capital inflow and examine on the output effects and the level of unemployment. Interestingly, in the extended model urban unemployment is aggravated due to an inflow of foreign capital.
D58|General Equilibrium Impacts VAT and Corporate Tax in Thailand|We construct a CGE model of Thailand in order to assess economy wide impacts of reforms in the value added tax (VAT) and corporate income tax (CIT) on welfare and reallocation of resources across production sectors in the Thai economy. Our model was calibrated to the micro consistent benchmark data set contained in the Input-Output Table published in 2010 by the Office of National Economics and Social Development Board (NESD) with some restructuring into 18 sectors. The general algebraic modelling system (GAMS) was used to estimate the parameters of the model. The findings reveal that aggregate net changes in welfare of 10 percent VAT are better than zero percent VAT. Thus, increasing VAT from 7 to 10 percent becomes desirable policy action on the basis of economy wide welfare analysis because utility from the public services for the households more than compensates their loss of utility due to higher taxes. On the net welfare basis, the decreasing CIT rate from 30 to 20 percent is more preferable policy than 23 percent CIT. This model based analysis is a unique contribution to the current literature on impacts of VAT and corporate income tax in the Thai economy though further scope remains for full impact analysis of comprehensive reforms such as the GST with dynamic model and multi households.
D58|Impacts of GST reforms on efficiency, growth and redistribution of income in India: A Dynamic CGE Analysis|Goods and service tax (GST) introduced as a ‘good and simple tax’ on 1 July 2017 by the Modi government is the boldest measure of tax reform so far in India. The major aim of this paper is to evaluate the micro and macro impacts of the goods and services taxes (GST) using a dynamic computable general equilibrium model of the Indian economy. This is an original contribution as no such work is found in the literature. This paper applies a dynamic CGE model calibrated to the micro-consistent input-output data of the Indian economy to assess impacts of GST on the efficiency in allocation of resources among production sectors, growth of income and employment over time, the redistribution of income among households in India. While GST reforms will improve specialization in productions of goods and services among the major economic sectors of India by removing distortions in the production and distribution of goods and services, transparency it brings in the tax system will help to maintain above seven percent continuous growth rate in output, investment and physical capital. It also promotes expansion in human capital and the financial system. Anti-corruption measures including recent demonetization of large denomination notes and digitization of economic transactions along with GST reforms will add to infrastructure including construction and expansion of communication networks, massive electrification, development of rail, road, air and shipping networks. By creating better opportunities for education and training for the younger generation, health services for all continuous reforms in direct and indirect taxes will bring speedier growth of income and employment along with more balanced distribution of income.
D58|An Economic General Equilibrium Model for Evaluation of Production Support Policies in Developing Countries|This paper introduces a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model for the evaluation of production support policies in developing countries. It is a multi-sector, multi-market, multi-household model appropriate for what-if policy analysis. We describe the main aspects of the model. The model assumes small open economy, imperfect capital mobility, imperfect substitution between imported and domestic commodity, nested CES structure in production, nested CES structure in consumption, and heterogeneity of domestic products in one category. We consider transport margin, wholesale margin, import tariffs, import subsidy, production tax, value added tax, goods and services tax, and other transfer payments. We calibrate the model based on the 2001 Micro Consistent Matrix of Iran. The initial validation tests approve the validity of the model.
D58|Financial Development and Long-Run Volatility Trends|"Countries with more developed financial markets tend to have significantly lower aggregate volatility. This relationship is also highly non-linear---starting from a low level of financial development the reduction in aggregate volatility with respect to financial deepening is far more significant than it is when the financial market is more developed. We build a fully-fledged neoclassical growth model with an endogenous financial market of credit arrangements and private debt to rationalize these stylized facts. We show how financial development that promotes better credit allocations under more relaxed borrowing constraints can reduce the impact of non-financial shocks (such as TFP shocks, government spending shocks, preference shocks) on aggregate output and investment, and why this volatility-reducing effect diminishes with continuing financial liberalizations. Our simple model also sheds light on a number of other important issues, such as the ""Great Moderation"" and the simultaneously rising trends of dispersions in sales growth and stock returns for publicly traded firms.

D58|Search, Matching, and Training|We estimate a partial and general equilibrium search model in which firms and workers choose how much time to invest in both general and match-specific human capital. To help identify the model parameters, we use NLSY data on worker training and we match moments that relate the incidence and timing of observed training episodes to outcomes such as wage growth and job-to-job transitions. We use our model to offer a novel interpretation of standard Mincer wage regressions in terms of search frictions and returns to training. We use our model estimates to investigate the impact of minimum wages on training and outcomes, and find significant impacts on both of these dimensions for sufficiently high minimum wage values.

D58|How Robust are Estimates of the Rebound Effect of Energy Efficiency Improvements? A Sensitivity Analysis of Consumer Heterogeneity and Elasticities|Economy-wide rebound effects may undermine climate policies relying on energy efficiency improvements. However, available rebound estimates diverge widely. We illustrate the crucial role of model assumptions of household heterogeneity and elasticities. A computable general equilibrium model of the Austrian economy incorporates multiple household groups with heterogeneous preferences and analyzes how improving efficiency by 10% affects household fossil fuel consumption. In the base model, economy-wide rebound is 65%; different household groups show direct rebound of 8-12%; thus, indirect rebound mainly contributes to economy-wide rebound. A sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation varies elasticities between household groups, namely substitutability between material and energy goods, and between different energy goods. In 160 simulation runs, the economy-wide rebound emerges as rather robust. By contrast, direct rebound varies widely among household groups and attains 30%, where reciprocal feedback between groups builds up. In the base model, a fossil fuel tax rate of 43% neutralizes the economy-wide rebound. When elasticities in 180 simulation runs are varied, this tax rate spans from 15% to 80%. Thus, rebound estimates and derived policy advice, such as specific rates and numbers, should be treated with great caution, unless elasticity parameters are reliable and account for heterogeneous consumer preferences.
D58|Comparison of Various Business Cycle Models for Pakistan|In this paper, we compare the performance of different models, on two data frequencies, in terms of matching the business cycle moments of Pakistani economy. Out of the four models, two are simple real business cycle models for Pakistan introduced in Choudhary and Pasha (2013), and the other two are benchmark models [Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) and Garcia-Cicco et al. (2010)] from the literature for explaining the business cycles in emerging and developing economies. This paper calibrate these models for Pakistan and evaluate their performance in terms of matching second order moments from the actual data at both annual and quarterly frequency. We find that even though no single model is able to match all the relevant moments for all the important macroeconomic variables at both frequencies, the augmented RBC model with FDI shock (Choudhary and Pasha, 2013) performs relatively better. [SBP Working Paper Series No.89].
D58|Intertemporal hybrid modeling of energy policy in Poland: how to avoid biased results|In the coming decades the energy sector in Poland will undergo a substantial transition towards low carbon usage which will have a preponderant impact on the economy. Several modernization scenarios for energy policy are currently being discussed and not yet concluded. The main objective of the paper is to provide a tool that allow to simulate such scenarios and to show the impact into the whole economy by accounting for complex set of linkages between energy sector and other parts of economy. Those scenarios should assume, in different proportions, increasing use of nuclear energy, renewable sources and natural gas in exchange for reduction of carbon.Energy is a crucial economic input circulating in the economy, widely utilized as production factor and consumed in different forms by households. For this reason, any changes in energy will have a preponderant impact on the entire economy, thus partial equilibrium modeling is not sufficient. Currently there is no appropriate research tool in Poland which could accommodate complex structure of different energy sources and wide linkages of the energy sector to assess economy-wide impacts of the energy policy in longer horizon for Poland. We propose a hybrid general equilibrium modeling that incorporates energy technologies (bottom-up approach) directly into macroeconomic structure (top-down approach).By accounting for wide adjustments in the economy, while controlling for all major constraints - such as energy balance and available capital stock - the model can give a unique and detailed insight into the future shape of energy sector and low carbon economy in Poland.Based on the model outcomes we can state that simulation results can be very much biased even if the model is properly calibrated. We present several issues that should prevent modelers to supply results to policy-makers without careful tests. The immediate source of ?strange? results is wrong model design to study specific topics. The lack of formal tests to validate computable general equilibrium models should not be a pass for unreasonable results. Our study helps to understand the source of selected ?strange? results.
D58|Edgeworth box economies with multiple equilibria|Abstract We derive sufficient conditions for the existence of multiple equilibria in two-good, two-agent pure exchange economies with heterogeneous but symmetric preferences with identical Bernoulli utilities. When preferences are non-homothetic (for example, quadratic, quasi-linear, or HARA), multiple equilibria are possible even with identical endowments.
D58|General economic equilibrium with financial markets and retainability|Abstract A theory of economic equilibrium for incomplete financial markets in general real assets is developed in a new formulation with currency-denominated prices. The “goods” are not only commodities, and they can influence utility through retention as an alternative to consumption. Perfect foresight is relinquished in a rolling horizon approach to markets which lets agents pursue long-term interests without being sure of future prices. The framework is that of an economy operating in a fiat currency that agents find attractive to retain, in balance with other needs. The attractiveness comes from Keynesian considerations about uncertainty which until now have not been brought in. The existence of equilibrium is established directly—not just generically—and moreover under weaker assumptions on endowments than before, except that utility functions are taken to be concave. Agents do not need to start out with, or end up with, positive amounts of everything. With a single currency denominating the units of account in all states, price indeterminacy is avoided and all contracts issued in the financial markets can be interpreted as “real contracts.” Derivative instruments and collateralized contracts based on money prices are thereby encompassed for the first time. Transaction costs on sales of contracts, generated endogenously, lead to bid–ask spreads and in particular to a gap between interest rates for lending and borrowing money.
D58|Energy efficiency as an instrument of regional development policy? Trading-off the benefits of an economic stimulus and energy rebound effects|Previous studies show that improving efficiency in household energy use can stimulate a national economy through an increase and change in the pattern of the aggregate demand. However, this may impact competitiveness. Here we find that in an open region, interregional migration of workers may give additional momentum to the economic expansion, by relieving pressure on the real wage and the CPI. Furthermore, the stimulus will be further enhanced by the greater fiscal autonomy that Scotland is set shortly to enjoy. By considering a range of CGE simulation scenarios we show that there is a tension between the economic stimulus from energy efficiency and the scale of rebound effects. However, we also show that household energy efficiency increases do typically generate a â€œdouble dividendâ€ of increased regional economic activity and a reduction in carbon emissions.
D58|Can a reduction in fuel use result from an endogenous technical progress in motor vehicles? A partial and general equilibrium analysis|In this paper we employ a partial equilibrium approach to model private transport consumption as a household self-produced commodity formed by vehicle and fuel use. We show that under certain conditions vehicle-augmenting technical improvements can reduce fuel use. We then extend the analysis through Computable General Equilibrium simulations for the UK in order to investigate the wider implications of vehicle-augmenting efficiency improvements when prices and nominal income are endogenous. With a conventional macroeconomic approach, improvements in the efficiency of household consumption simply change the composition of household demand. However, when we adjust the consumer price index for changes in the price of private transport service (not observable via a market price), as advocated in Gordon (2016) there is an additional supply-side stimulus to competitiveness.
D58|Disaggregation of the 2010 UK Social Accounting Matrix to report household income quintiles|Social Accounting Matrices (SAM) are used as the main data source for Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models, which in turn can be used to simulate economic shocks and study their economy-wide impact. However, SAMs usually include highly aggregated categories of final consumers, therefore preventing the use of CGE models to study the impact of economic shocks on economic agents with specific characteristics. For this type of analysis, it is necessary to disaggregate the economic agent of interest in the SAM. This paper presents an approach by which it is possible to disaggregate the households in the UK SAM in quintiles based on their gross weekly income. The necessary steps to disaggregate the households are presented in detail, along with the supporting datasets and variables required to replicate the disaggregation approach for future SAMs.
D58|Is the production function Translog or CES? An empirical illustration using UK data|Computable general equilibrium (CGE) studies are increasingly in-terested in informing keys parameters of their models using empirical data. Energy and environmental CGE ndings have been found to be particularly sensible to changes in the values of the elasticities of substitution between inputs of production. Although applied econometric literature provides numerous estimates of substitution elasticities obtained from fexible functional forms cost or production functions, the number of papers dealing with Constant Elasticities of Substitution (CES) production functions, generally favoured in a CGE framework, is still limited. The contribution of this paper is to estimate the substitution relationship between energy and other inputs for the United Kingdom using a new approach that allows to understand whether a nested CES production function is adequate to describe the true input-output relationship. Moreover, the approach can be used to obtain an indication on which nested structure should is the most appropriate for the data considered. Findings suggest that the analysed dataset might support a four-input nested CES production function where the energy-capital are combined in an inner nest.
D58|Measuring the influence of energy prices within the price formation mechanism| Environmental economics has proposed the taxation on energy as an effective way to mitigate the pollution caused by the production and use of energy based on fossil fuels. From a practical point of view, however, taxes on energy are thought to have a detrimental impact on the economy that reduce competitiveness and diminish economic welfare, especially if the tax burden is (completely or partially) translated to final prices. This paper provides a method to analyse by how much energy prices influence the price formation mechanism of an economy. The model used, which captures the general equilibrium channels existing among energy activities, the rest of the production system and households, is based on the accounting identities reflected in a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM). The SAM price model allows to identify the role of energy prices into the cost transmission and the price definition process. The empirical application, which is for the Catalan economy, shows a considerable influence of energy prices on both production and final prices. The results also show that the different forms of energy exert asymmetric impacts on the costs of sectors and consumers. Keywords: energy prices, cost linkages, price transmission, social accounting matrix. JEL Classification: C69. D58. Q41.
D58|Automation and inequality with taxes and transfers|The dependence of real income and inequality on changes in factor abundance, total factor productivity, factor bias, the relative cost of capital goods and the progressivity of the tax system are quantified using an elemental general equilibrium model with three households. Observed declines in low-skill labour shares are shown to have been generic in the OECD and to have been responsible for most of the increase in US inequality between 1990 and 2016. The widely anticipated future twist away from low-skill labour toward capital is then examined, in combination with expected changes in population and its skill composition. With downward rigidity of low-skill wages the potential is identified for unemployment to rise to extraordinarily high levels. Productivity growth at twice the pace since 1990 is shown to limit this, though it does not slow the concentration of income. The superior policy response is shown to be a generalization of the US “earned income tax credit” system, with financing from taxes on consumption, rather than capital income.
D58|Assessing Kuwaiti Energy Pricing Reforms|From mid-2014 Kuwait has experienced a substantial drop in its petroleum export price and,consequently, government revenue, causing a severe fiscal deficit and impaired economic performance. Cutting energy subsidies has become a policy priority. In the face of widespread opposition, the government raised gasoline prices in August 2016, proclaiming such reform the key to solving economic problems; yet recent policy discussions have not addressed the mechanism of pricing reforms. The paper offers a quantification and assessment of energy pricing reform in the current low petroleum price environment via a general equilibrium model of the Kuwaiti economy that embodies the structure of its economy and its labor market, its oligopolistic industries, and external flows associated with its sovereign wealth fund. Simulations clarify the required adjustments, including the seldom discussed expatriate labor exit and the decline in oligopoly rents. While necessary, subsidy reform implies trade-offs, notably between fiscal stabilization and cost of living sustainability. The results confirm that successful implementation must be accompanied by carefully designed mitigation measures and associated microeconomic reforms.
D58|Automation and inequality in China|In transitional economies like China, comparatively low real wages imply sub-OECD labor and skill shares of value added and comparatively high capital shares. Despite rapid real wage growth, however, rather than converge toward the OECD, China’s low-skill labor share has been falling, due to structural and technical change. Here this dependence is quantified using an elemental national model with three households. Since 1994, a third of the total change in the Gini coefficient is estimated to be due to structural change and the rest to mainly skill-biased technical change. Widely anticipated further twists away from low-skill labor toward capital are then examined, assuming downward rigidity of low-skill wages and transfers that sustain low-skill welfare via taxes on capital income. The potential is identified for unemployment to rise extraordinarily, with negative effects mitigated if the population declines or if the share twists are accompanied by very strong total factor productivity growth.
D58|Demand-Driven Structural Change in Applied General Equilibrium Models|This study analyzes the variations in industrial structure induced by income-sensitive patterns of final consumption, and how these changes can be captured by a multi-sector numerical model with a flexible demand system. We focus, in particular, on the estimation of parameters for an AIDADS (An Implicitly, Directly Additive Demand System) specification. We then test the latter by inserting it in the ENVISAGE global general equilibrium dynamic model, which is run under the SSP2 scenario from 2011 to 2050. It is found that time-varying income elasticity can generate sizable variations in the industrial structure. This finding has important practical implications, particularly when structural models are applied at a medium and long term horizon.
D58|Economic effects of climate change in developing countries: Economy-wide and regional analysis for Ethiopia|Quantifying the economic effects of climate change is a crucial step for planning adaptation in developing countries. This study assesses the economy-wide and regional effects of climate change induced productivity and labor supply shocks in agriculture in Ethiopia. The study shows, in worst case scenario, the effects on national GDP may add up to -8% with uneven regional effects ranging from -10% in agrarian regions (e.g. Amhara) to +2.5% in urbanized regions (e.g. Addis Ababa). Cost-free exogenous structural change scenarios in labor markets and transaction costs may offset about 20-30% of the ripple effects of climate change. Therefore, the ongoing structural transformation in the country may underpin the resilience of the economy to climate change. Nevertheless, given the role of agriculture in the current economic structure of the country and the potency of biophysical impacts of climate change, adaptation in the sector is indispensable. Otherwise, climate change may hamper economic progress of the country, and make rural livelihood unpredictable.
D58|General equilibrium effects of public adaptation in agriculture in LDCs: Evidence from Ethiopia|Ethiopia is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. This is because its important economic sector, agriculture, is virtually rain-fed. The role of the sector in the current economic structure and the potency of the anticipated biophysical impacts of climate change necessitates proactive adaptation in agriculture. This, however, breeds questions of adaptation costs and adaptation finance. This study attempts to derive plausible range of planned adaptation costs in agriculture along with their economy-wide and regional effects in Ethiopia. It also assess the economy-wide and regional effects of the likely options available to a government of a least-developed country to finance adaptation in agriculture. The results show that planned public adaptation in agriculture puts pressure on government surplus, impedes on manufacturing and private services, and GDP of urbanized regions. As such, it may strain the current macroeconomic endeavors of the country which puts government driven structural transformation and reducing fiscal deficit relative to GDP at the center. Government of Ethiopia may reconcile this by laying out incentives to urban agriculture and private investment in agriculture. Besides, foreign support in the form of biotechnology transfer and debt-relief may help to control the side effects of grants on foreign exchange market and trade balance.
D58|Redistributive effects of the US pension system among individuals with different life expectancy|We investigate the differential impact that pension systems have on the labor supply and the accumulation of physical and human capital for individuals that differ by their learning ability and levels of life expectancy. Using a general equilibrium model populated by overlapping generations, in which all population groups interact through the pension system, the labor market, and the capital market, we show that the increasing gap in life expectancy by socioeconomic status makes the US pension system progressively more regressive and explains the increasing per capita income gap across ability groups.
D58|Paris after Trump: An Inconvenient Insight|With his announcement to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement US President Donald Trump has snubbed the international climate policy community. Key remaining parties to the Agreement such as Europe and China might call for carbon tariffs on US imports as sanctioning instrument to coerce US compliance. Our analysis, however, reveals an inconvenient insight for advocates of carbon tariffs: Given the possibility of retaliatory tariffs across all imported goods, carbon tariffs do not constitute a credible threat for the US. A tariff war with its main trading partners China and Europe might make the US worse off than compliance to the Paris Agreement but China, in particular, should prefer US defection to a tariff war.
D58|Boon or Bane? Trade Sanctions and the Stability of International Environmental Agreements|In spite of scientific agreement on the negative effects of anthropogenic climate change, efforts to find cooperative solutions on the international level have been unsatisfactory so far. Trade sanctions in the form of import tariffs are one principal measure discussed as a means to foster cooperation. Former studies have concluded that import tariffs are an effective mechanism to establish international cooperation. However, most of these studies rely on the assumption that outsiders are not able to retaliate, i.e. to implement import tariffs themselves. In this paper we use combined analytical and numerical analysis to investigate implications of retaliation. We find a threshold effect: below a certain coalition size the effect of retaliation predominates and decreases incentives to be a coalition member. In coalitions above the threshold size the effect of trade sanctions that stabilizes coalitions dominates and enables the formation of larger stable coalitions. Our analysis suggests that only after a sufficiently large climate coalition has already been formed, the threat of trade sanctions might be an effective stick to establish the grand coalition.
D58|Counting the Cost of Drought Induced Productivity Losses in an Agro-Based Economy: The Case of Uganda|Climate variability can affect economies directly through its impact on agricultural output, and indirectly, through its effect on the activities of down-stream industries and household welfare. This paper uses a Computable General Equilibrium model with a disaggregated agricultural sector to analyse the impact of a drought on the Ugandan economy. The losses were assessed with respect to GDP, agricultural output, employment, the trade balance and household consumption. The drought effects were shown to vary by sector. The fall in employment within the agricultural industries was less compared to the output losses. At a macro level, exports declined, while at a household level, the terms of trade gains mitigated part of the potential welfare losses thereby reducing consumption, but to a lesser degree. The findings indicate that a drought can cause substantial losses to the economy. The need for targeted interventions to mitigate such drought impacts is therefore critical.
D58|Mega External Preferential Trade Agreements and Their Impacts on Indian Economy|This study examines the impacts on India of three mega external preferential trading agreements (PTAs) from which the country is excluded using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model combined with POVCAL poverty analysis tool. The simulation results show that each of these PTAs cause considerable trade diversion. However, the impacts on Indiaâ€™s trade flows, domestic output, returns to factors, aggregate welfare, inequality and poverty levels are rather small. In contrast, multilateral trade liberalization has significantly large and favourable impacts on all these variables. In particular, welfare improves by 1.7 per cent of GDP, inequality falls by over half percentage point and poverty head count lowers by 12.3 per cent over base levels under a multilateral free trade scenario. These results suggest that the country should continue with its efforts for achieving a multilateral trade agreement. At the same time, the country should hedge against the possibility that a global trade agreement does not materialize. One way to protect the countryâ€™s interest is to aggressively pursue preferential trading arrangements in parallel with key members of these three mega PTAs. This is likely to ensure that the country does not lose market share due to preference erosion.
D58|The Role of Money in Explaining Business Cycles for a Developing Economy: The Case of Pakistan|In this paper, we establish the empirical linkages between nominal and real variables of Pakistani economy using both annual and quarterly data. The focus of our empirical analysis has been limited to the post financial liberalization period starting in early 1990s. Furthermore, this paper theoretically evaluates the role of money and monetary policy in propagating business cycle fluctuations of Pakistani economy using different ways of introducing the role of money via money in utility (MIU) and cash in advance constraint (CIA) as well as with different formulation of monetary policy either through a money growth rule or Taylor type interest rate rule.
D58|VAT Evasion in Bulgaria: A General-Equilibrium Approach|This paper utilizes an otherwise standard micro-founded general-equilibrium setup, which is augmented with a revenue-extraction mechanism to assess the magnitude of VAT evasion. The model is calibrated to Bulgaria after the introduction of the currency board (1999-2014), as one of the very few countries in Europe with a nondifferentiated consumption tax rate, and an economy where VAT revenue makes almost half of total government tax revenue. A computational experiment performed within this setup estimates that on average, the size of evaded VAT is a bit more than onefourth of output, an estimate which is in line with the figures provided in both Philip (2014) and the European Commission (2014). In addition, model-based simulations suggest that increases in spending on law and order could generate substantial welfare gains by decreasing VAT evasion.

D58|Making the case for supporting broad energy efficiency programmes: impacts on household incomes and other economic benefits|In recent years, an overly narrow focus on rebound effects has limited the extent of researcher and policy attention afforded to the wider multiple benefits of increased energy efficiency. The objective of this paper is to focus policy attention on the sustained added value to the economy that is created as result of improving energy efficiency in the residential sector. Governments around the world are committed to increasing energy efficiency more generally, but often focus public support in low income households where energy poverty is a particular concern. However, governments operate in a context of multiple objectives where energy efficiency is expected to deliver significant reductions in carbon emissions alongside sustainable economic development. We use a UK CGE model to consider the general effects of supporting increases in energy efficiency in residential energy use. Our results demonstrate that the increase in GDP, and economic activity more generally, triggered by increased energy efficiency delivers more in terms of increased household incomes than the efficiency improvement itself. We find that the more wide ranging the boost to energy efficiency, the greater the economic expansion and associated returns are likely to be, and the less the means of financing through public budgets will erode the benefits over time.
D58|Analysing job creation effects of scaling up infrastructure spending in South Africa| In a first for South Africa, this article draws on literature on infrastructure productivity to model dynamic economy-wide employment impacts of infrastructure investment funded with different fiscal tools. Using a dynamic computable general equilibrium model, the South African investment plan is modelled, given the infrastructure externality. Alternative fiscal scenarios to finance the policy are modelled in the article. In the long run, unemployment decreases for all types of workers under one of the scenarios. In the short run, only elementary occupation workers benefit from a decrease in unemployment; for the rest, unemployment rises.
D58|Input--output linkages and the propagation of domestic productivity shocks: assessing alternative theories with stochastic simulation| Relatively small sectoral productivity shocks could lead to sizable macroeconomic variability. Whereas most contributions in the literature analyze the issue of aggregate sensitivity using simple general equilibrium models, a novel approach is proposed in this paper, based on stochastic simulations with a global computable general equilibrium model. We find that the variability of the GDP, induced by sectoral shocks, is basically determined by the degree of industrial concentration as measured by the Herfindahl index of industrial value added. The degree of centrality in inter-industrial connectivity, measured by the standard deviation of second-order degrees, is mildly significant, but it is also correlated with the industrial concentration index. After controlling for the correlation effect, we find that connectivity turns out to be statistically significant, although less so than granularity.
D58|Impact of EU agricultural policy on developing countries: A Uganda case study| Despite substantial reforms, the European Union (EU)'s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is still criticised for its detrimental effects on developing countries. This paper provides updated evidence on the impact of the CAP on one developing country, Uganda. It goes beyond estimating macrolevel economic effects by analysing the impacts on poverty. The policy simulation results show that eliminating EU agricultural support would have marginal but nonetheless positive impacts on the Ugandan economy and its poverty indicators. From the perspective of the EU's commitment to policy coherence for development, this supports the view that further reducing EU agricultural support would be positive for development.
D58|Fertilizer subsidies and food self-sufficiency in Indonesia| Indonesia is a net importer of almost all of its staple foods. National self-sufficiency in food, especially the main staple, rice, is a core objective of economic policy. Poverty reduction is also a core policy objective. Since the 1970s, Indonesia has used agricultural input subsidies, especially on fertilizer, to stimulate agricultural production, largely in pursuit of the goal of rice self-sufficiency. More recently, it has also used output protection, especially in rice, for the same purpose. This article utilizes a multisectoral, multihousehold general equilibrium model of the Indonesian economy to study the trade-offs between the goals of self-sufficiency and poverty reduction when two alternative means are used to achieve them: a fertilizer subsidy, on the one hand, and output protection, on the other. It does this by analyzing the aggregate and distributional effects of these two sets of policies and by comparing their effects with nonintervention. The analysis shows that, in terms of its effects on poverty, a fertilizer subsidy can be a more effective instrument for achieving the goal of rice self-sufficiency than final product import restrictions.
D58|International Commodity Prices and Inequality in Indonesia|There has been an increasing attention to the recent increase in Indonesian inequality. From 2009 to 2011, Gini coefficient increased from 0.37 to 0.41, the highest ever recorded in Indonesian history. During the same period, the world prices of many Indonesian export commodities doubled. As those sectors, particularly mining, is highly capital intensive and skilled-labor intensive, this may increase the returns to factors more intensively used in those sectors, and thus has a tendency to increase inequality. Using the INDONESIA-E3 model, a Computable General Equilibrium model of an Indonesian economy, this paper investigates to what extent the increase in the world prices of Indonesian main commodity export (estate crops and mining) contributes to the increase in inequality in Indonesia. The impact of increases in the prices of 8 main Indonesian export commodities was simulated during the period of 2009-2011. The result suggests that they indeed increase inequality, yet with a magnitude of only a quarter of the increase in Gini coefficient observed during the period of 2009 to 2011. The dominant factors behind the increase in Gini coefficient can be traced to the increase in the world price of mining commodities rather than estate crops. The effect of increases in the world prices of rubber, palm oil, coffee, and tea is negligible and poverty-reducing in rural areas. On the other hand, the effect of the increase in the world price of coal, oil, gas, and metals generates a significant increase in inequality. These findings suggest that, from the perspective of equality, restricting export of estate crops commodities in the midst of the commodity booms will not be favorable to the poverty reduction agenda, particularly in rural areas.
D58|Aging, Taxes and Pensions in Switzerland|The gains in life expectancy are expected to double the dependency ratio and increase population by 10% in Switzerland until 2050. To quantify the effects on pensions, taxes and social contributions, we use an overlapping generations model with five margins of labor supply: labor market participation, hours worked, job search, retirement, and on-the-job training. A passive fiscal strategy would be very costly. A comprehensive reform, including an increase in the effective retirement age to 68 years, may limit the tax increases to 4 percentage points of value added tax and reduce the decline of per capita income to less than 6%.
D58|Estimation of Climate Change Damage Functions for 140 Regions in the GTAP 9 Database|Climate change damage (or, more correctly, impact) functions relate variations in temperature (or other climate variables) to economic impacts in various dimensions, and are at the basis of quantitative modeling exercises for the assessment of climate change policies. This document provides a summary of results from a series of meta-analyses aimed at estimating parameters for six specific damage functions, referring to: sea level rise, agricultural productivity, heat effects on labor productivity, human health, tourism flows, and households' energy demand. All parameters of the damage functions are estimated for each of the 140 countries and regions in version 9 of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP 9) Data Base. To illustrate the salient characteristics of the estimates, the change in real gross domestic product is approximated for the different effects, in all regions, corresponding to an increase in average temperature of +3°C. After considering the overall impact, the paper highlights which factor is the most significant one in each country, and elaborates on the distributional consequences of climate change.
D58|Job displacement risk and severance pay|This paper is a quantitative, equilibrium study of the insurance role of severance pay when workers face displacement risk and markets are incomplete. A key feature of our model is that, in line with an established empirical literature, job displacement entails a persistent fall in earnings upon re-employment due to the loss of tenure. The model is solved numerically and calibrated to the US economy. In contrast to previous studies that have analyzed severance payments in the absence of persistent earning losses, we find that the welfare gains from the insurance against job displacement afforded by severance pay are sizable.
D58|Water Scarcity and Irrigation Efficiency in Egypt|This study provides quantitative assessments of the impacts of efficiency enhancement for different types of irrigation water under water scarcity conditions. It employs a single country CGE (STAGE 2) model calibrated to an extended version of a recently constructed SAM for Egypt 2008/09. The SAM segments the agricultural accounts by season and by irrigation scheme, including Nile- and groundwater-dependent as well as rain-fed agricultural activities. The simulations show that Egypt should manage potential reductions in the supply of Nile water with more efficient irrigation practices which increase the productivity of Nile water, groundwater and irrigated land. The results suggest a more ambitious plan to boost irrigation efficiency for summer rice would be desirable in order to outweigh any potential shrinkage in output and exports. Furthermore, even doubling all non-conventional water resources is not sufficient to compensate the potential adverse impacts of Nile water losses. This highlights the importance of irrigation efficiency for the Egyptian economy.
D58|Bubble Economics How Big a Shock to China’s Real Estate Sector Will Throw the Country into Recession, and Why Does It Matter?|How far do China’s property prices need to drop in order to send the country into a recession? What does this question tell us about the way Bubble Economies work? In this paper, we develop a theory of Bubble Economics – non-linear and often “systemic” (in the mathematical sense of the word) forces which cause significant misallocations of resources. Our theory draws on the standard elements of most stories of Bubble Economics, looking at the way banking, construction, savings/investment, local government and equities sectors interact. We find that Bubble Economies’ GDP growth can depend on property prices changes differently at different times -- depending on risks building up in the economy. We argue that a tacit, implicit Bubble Risk Factor might provide a way of understanding a key variable academics and practitioners omit when they try to explain how economies (mis)allocate resources during bubbles. A 15%-20% property price drop could cause recession, if China’s economy resembles other large economies having already experienced property-related asset crises. However, a 40% decline would not be out of the question.
D58|Optimal fiscal policy with utility-enhancing government spending, consumption taxation and a common income tax rate: the case of Bulgaria|This paper explores the e ffects of fi scal policy in an economy based on indirect taxes, and one that is constrained to taxing all (labor and capital) income at the same rate. The focus of the paper is on the relative importance of consumption vs. income taxation, as well as on the provision of utility-enhancing public services. To this end, a Real-Business-Cycle model, calibrated to Bulgarian data (1999-2014), was set up with a richer public finance side. Bulgarian economy was chosen as a case study due to its major dependence on consumption taxation as a source of tax revenue. To illustrate the e ffects of fiscal policy, two regimes were compared and contrasted to one another - exogenous vs. optimal (Ramsey) policy case. The main fi ndings from the computational experiments performed are: (i) The optimal steady-state (capital and labor income) tax rate is zero, as it is the most distortionary tax to use; (ii) The optimal steady-state consumption tax (the only source of revenue) has to almost double to finance the optimally-set level of government purchases.

D58|Is consumption-Laffer curve hump-shaped? The role of VAT evasion|This paper shows a standard RBC model, when augmented with a VAT evasion channel, where evasion depends on the consumption tax rate, can produce a hump-shaped consumption Laffer curve. Furthermore, when the evasion channel is turned off, the hump in the Laffer curve disappears, resulting in a monotone relationship between the VAT rate and both the consumption and total tax revenue. This result comes in stark contrast to Hiragara and Nituhara (2015), who generate a peaking curve for consumption tax revenue in a model with a separable utility in consumption and leisure and no evasion. Their results are contingent on implausible values for elasticity parameters, and in addition predict a revenue-maximizing consumption tax rate which is implausibly high. The paper contributes to the public finance literature by providing evidence for the importance of the evasion mechanism, while at the same time adding to the debate about the existence of a peak tax rate for consumption tax revenue.
D58|Optimal Fiscal Policy in the Presence of VAT Evasion: The Case of Bulgaria|This paper explores the effects of fiscal policy in the presence of a VAT evasion channel, and then compares and contrasts two regimes - the exogenous vs. optimal policy case. To this end, a dynamic general-equilibrium model, calibrated to Bulgarian data (1999-2014), is augmented with a government sector. The main findings from the computational experiments performed in the paper are: (i) The optimal steady-state income tax rate is zero; (ii) The benevolent Ramsey planner provides the optimal amount of the valuable public services, which are now three times lower; (iii) The size of the grey sector is twice lower; (iv) optimal steady-state consumption tax needed to finance the optimal level of government spending is twice lower, as compared to the exogenous policy case.
D58|Competition In Public School Districts: Charter School Entry, Student Sorting, And School Input Determination|This article develops and estimates an equilibrium model of charter school entry, school input choices, and student school choices. The structural model renders a comprehensive and internally consistent picture of treatment effects when there may be general equilibrium effects of school competition. Simulations indicate that the mean effect of charter schools on attendant students is positive and varies widely across locations. The mean spillover effect on public school students is small but positive. Lifting caps on charter schools would more than double entry but reduce gains for attendant students.
D58|National climate policies in times of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)|Given that the carbon price in the EU Emissions Trading System is only around 5€/tCO2 while consensus about a more stringent EU climate policy is very unlikely in the near future, we explore the potential scope and optimal design of additional national climate policies in the current EU policy framework. In particular, we suggest to implement a type of carbon price floor in the national EU ETS sectors that either allows for i) shifting emissions to non-ETS sectors like housing and transport or ii) retiring EU-wide emission allowances. In a simple theoretical framework with two countries and two sectors, we show that these two policy options are efficient up to a certain carbon price threshold. Moreover, efficiency is the highest at an optimal carbon price level equaling a weighted sum of the price differentials between ETS and non-ETS sectors. In order to determine the empirical relevance, we conduct a numerical partial equilibrium analysis of the EU carbon market in 2020. We find that Germany shows the highest potential to reduce EU-wide inefficiencies. With a price floor of 36€/tCO2 in 2020, Germany could reduce national climate policy costs by 13% if emissions are shifted from the ETS to non-ETS sectors. If they are willing to take on additional costs by retiring emission allowances, they are able to reduce EU ETS emissions by 1.6%.
D58|Bubble-driven business cycles|The 2007-2008 financial crisis highlighted that a turmoil in the financial sector including bursting asset price bubbles can cause pronounced and persistent fluctuations in real economic activity. This justifies the consideration of evolving and bursting asset price bubbles as another source of fluctuations in business cycle models. In this paper rational asset price bubbles are incorporated into a life-cycle RBC model as first developed by Ríos-Rull (1996). The calibration of the model to the post-war US economy and the numerical solution show that the model is able to depict plausible bubble-driven business cycles. In particular, the model generates i) a higher and empirically more plausible volatility of consumption at the cost of ii) a lower and empirically less plausible contemporaneous correlation of consumption with output than the life-cycle RBC model without bubbles.
D58|Trade in Carbon and the Effectiveness of Carbon Tariffs|Carbon-based import tariffs are discussed as policy measures to reduce carbon leakage and increase the global cost-effectiveness of unilateral CO2 emission pricing. We assess how the potential of carbon tariffs to increase cost-effectiveness of unilateral climate policy depends on the magnitude and composition of carbon embodied in trade. For our assessment, we combine multi-region input-output (MRIO) analysis with computable general equilibrium (CGE) analysis based on data from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) for the period 1995 to 2007. The MRIO analysis confirms that carbon embodied in trade has sharply increased during this period. Yet, the CGE analysis suggests that the effectiveness of carbon tariffs in reducing leakage and improving global-cost effectiveness of unilateral climate policy does not increase over time, whereas the potential to shift the economic burden of CO2 emissions reduction from abating developed regions to non-abating developing regions increases substantially.
D58|The Macroeconomic Impact of Remittances: A Sending Country Perspective|Remittances are for a large number of developing countries the most important source of foreign funding. Destination countries of migration, however, fear a outflow of financial funds. Using data for Germany, we analyze the impact of remittances and migration on one of the major sending countries of remittances and the third biggest exporter in the world. For this purpose, we develop a dynamic open-economy general equilibrium model with altruistic households. By estimating the interrelation between household characteristics and remittances, we are able to derive altruism coefficients for different types of households. Households with a higher altruism coefficient derive higher utility from consumption by distant relatives and send more remittances. We endogenize remittances flows by applying these coefficients to our model. Remittance outflows have then a depreciating effect on the real exchange rate and provide incentives to reallocate resources from the non-tradable goods to the tradable goods sectors. In the case of Germany, this translates into a opposite Dutch disease phenomenon.
D58|A Quantitative Model of Bubble-Driven Business Cycles|The 2007-2008 financial crisis highlighted that a turmoil in the financial sector including bursting asset price bubbles can cause pronounced and persistent fluctuations in real economic activity. This justifies the consideration of evolving and bursting asset price bubbles as another source of fluctuations in business cycle models. Business cycle models should therefore include asset price bubble as another source for fluctuations. In this paper rational asset price bubbles are incorporated into a life-cycle RBC model as first developed by Ríos (1996). The calibration of the model to the post-war US economy and the numerical solution show that the model is able to depict plausible bubble-driven business cycles. In particular, the model generates i) a higher and empirically more plausible volatility of consumption at the cost of ii) a lower and empirically less plausible contemporaneous correlation of consumption with output than the life-cycle RBC model without bubbles.
D58|Trade In Carbon And The Effectiveness Of Carbon Tariffs|Carbon-based import tariffs are discussed as policy measures to reduce carbon leakage and increase the global cost-effectiveness of unilateral CO2 emission pricing. We assess how the potential of carbon tariffs to increase cost-effectiveness of unilateral climate policy depends on the magnitude and composition of carbon embodied in trade. For our assessment, we combine multi-region input-output (MRIO) analysis with computable general equilibrium (CGE) analysis based on data from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) for the period 1995 to 2007. The MRIO analysis confirms that carbon embodied in trade has sharply increased during this period. Yet, the CGE analysis suggests that the effectiveness of carbon tariffs in reducing leakage and improving global-cost effectiveness of unilateral climate policy does not increase over time, whereas the potential to shift the economic burden of CO2 emissions reduction from abating developed regions to non-abating developing regions increases substantially.
D58|The Efficiency Cost of Protective Measures in Climate Policy|Despite recent achievements towards a global climate agreement, climate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions remains quite heterogeneous across countries. Energy-intensive and trade-exposed (EITE) industries in industrialized countries are particularly concerned on stringent domestic emission pricing that may put them at a competitive disadvantage with respect to producers of similar goods in other countries without or only quite lenient emission regulation. This paper focuses on climate policy analysis for the United States of America (US) and compares the economic implications of four alternative protective measures for US EITE industries: (i) output-based rebates, (ii) exemptions from emission pricing, (iii) energy intensity standards, and (iv) carbon intensity standards. Based on simulations with a large-scale computable general equilibrium model for the global economy we quantify how these protective measures affect competitiveness of US EITE industries. We find that while protective measures can attenuate adverse competitiveness impacts measured in terms of common sector-specific competitiveness indicators, they run the risk of making US emission reduction much more costly than uniform emission pricing stand-alone. In fact, the cost increase is associated with negative income effects such that the gains of protective measures for EITE exports may be more than compensated through losses in domestic EITE demand.
D58|The Strategic Value of Carbon Tariffs|We ask whether the threat of carbon tariffs might lower the cost of reductions in world carbon emissions by inducing unregulated regions to adopt emission controls. We use a numerical model to generate payoffs of a game in which a coalition regulates emissions and chooses whether to employ carbon tariffs against unregulated regions. Unregulated regions respond by abating, retaliating, or ignoring the tariffs. In the Nash equilibrium, the use of tariffs is a credible and effective threat. It induces cooperation from noncoalition regions that lowers the cost of global abatement substantially relative to the case where the coalition acts alone. (JEL D58, F13, F18, H23, Q54, Q58)
D58|Interaction of biofuel, food security, indirect land use change and greenhouse mitigation policies in the European Union| The European Union is putting a lot of effort in mitigating climate change effects and lessen the dependence of fossil fuels. Several policies are being proposed in the Renewable Energy Directives (RED), such as increasing the share of renewable sources in fuel mix, specific increases in fuel production? and anti-dumping strategies. However, these policies raise concerns with respect to competition with food production, and indirect increases GHG emissions caused by land use change. Our study evaluates the RED policies together with additional climate mitigation policies using a computable general equilibrium modeling. Our results suggest that, for the case of the European Union (EU), an increase in biofuel production does not represent a threat in food security. In addition, we found that the land use change in the EU are modest compared to previous studies in developing regions. Our findings illustrate how the imposition of a regime can vary depending on the economic development of a region.
D58|Adapting to Climate Change: an Analysis under Uncertainty|Climate change is a phenomenon beset with major uncertainties and researchers should include them in Integrated Assessment Models. However, including further dimensions in IAM models comes at a cost. In particular, it makes most of these models suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this study we benefit from a state-reduced framework to overcome those problems. In an attempt to advance in the modelling of adaptation within IAM models, we apply this methodology to shed some light on how the optimal balance between mitigation and adaptation changes under different stochastic scenarios. We find that stochastic technology growth hardly affects the optimal bundle of mitigation and adaptation whereas uncertainty about the value of climate sensitivity and the possibility of tipping points hitting the system change substantially the composition of the optimal mix as both persuade the risk-averse social planner to invest more in mitigation. Overall, we identify that including uncertainty into the model tends to favour (long-lasting) mitigation with respect to (instantaneous) adaptation. Further research should address the properties of the optimal mix when a stock of adaptation can be built.
D58|Implications of Trans-Pacific Partnership for the US Dairy Industry| The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement would reduce or eliminates tariff and nontariff barriers to trade and increase investment among the parties. Dairy exporting countries in the TPP, including the United States, will compete for market share. This study aims to investigate the possible change in dairy trade flows if the TPP agreement is enacted and the implications for the US dairy industry. An empirical trade simulation model is developed focusing on US dairy trade to analyze the potential impacts.
D58|The cost of failing to prevent gas supply interruption: A CGE assessment for Peru|Since 2000, there has been a noticeable progress in social and economic indicators of Peru. Even though the country risk has diminished dramatically, several threats remain. One of the key ones is the possibility of involuntary (transitory or permanent) interruptions of the natural gas pipeline transportation system. Given the significant endowments of natural gas reserves in Peru (Camisea gas field) and its relevance in the economy, shortages of natural gas due to pipelines failures can wreak havoc because it is important from the government revenue and it is a basic input for domestic manufacturing and household energy consumption. Earthquakes, unexpected social unrest or intentional actions could interrupt the service of some of the fundamental pipelines of the grid. One pipeline with three branches connects the upstream to the distribution centers. To take into account the economy wide impact of the interruption of gas supply we built a CGE model considering modifications of relative prices, markets reactions and income effects. We simulate different scenarios considering the three most important branches of the Camisea pipeline. The results show that those shocks would represent an important decline of GDP in the short run when substitution is limited (about or 0.2% by day) and an abrupt reduction of welfare for households. The estimated daily cost is in the range of 335 million of USD for the worst case scenario.
D58|Remittances and the Redistributive Policy in Ghana: A Computable General Equilibrium Approach|This paper numerically explores the distributive policy for improving both welfare and income inequality with increased remittances in Ghana within a computable general equilibrium (CGE) framework. Our simulation results show that the government can improve both welfare and inequality by using a government surplus generated by increased remittances without any additional revenue resources. If the government is concerned about inequality, then the surplus for more direct transfers to the rural household results in the best outcome. On the other hand, if the government is concerned only about welfare, then a policy to use the surplus for more government spending on education or health achieves the largest welfare gain through its direct demand effect. While the Ghanaian economy can enjoy the largest welfare gain as a whole when the surplus is used for more government spending on education or health, the increased welfare gain will be more distributed to the government sector in comparison with the case when the surplus is used for more direct transfers to the rural household.
D58|Climate change damage (or, more correctly, impact) functions relate variations in temperature (or other climate variables) to economic impacts in various dimensions, and are at the basis of quantitative modeling exercises for the assessment of climate change policies. This document provides a summary of results from a series of meta-analyses aimed at estimating parameters for six specific damage functions, referring to: sea level rise, agricultural productivity, heat effects on labor productivity, human health, tourism flows and households' energy demand. All parameters of the damage functions are estimated for each of the 140 countries and regions in the GTAP9 dataset. To illustrate the salient characteristics of our estimates, we approximate the change in real GDP for the different effects, in all regions, corresponding to an increase in average temperature of +3°C. After considering the overall impact, we highlight which factor is the most significant one in each country, and we elaborate on the distributional consequences of climate change|No abstract is available for this item.
D58|A DGSE model to assess the post-crisis regulation of universal banks|The 2007-08 financial crisis led to a global overhaul of prudential regulatory instruments. At an international level, the new Basel III regulation increased capital requirements and also introduced two liquidity ratios, for the short and long term. This Rue de la Banque provides our latest estimates of the new regulation’s long-term impact on bank lending and gross domestic product, which appears limited. It also highlights the complementarity that can arise between solvency and liquidity objectives, the degree of substitutability that can appear between the two new liquidity ratios, and the role of sovereign bonds in the new regulation.
D58|Impacts of Emerging Asia on African and Latin American Trade: Projections to 2030|Rapid growth in Asia’s emerging economies has boosted export earnings of resource-rich economies over the past decade. Whether or not those high growth rates continue, how will structural changes in Asia alter the relative importance of their imports of primary products? This paper projects production and trade patterns of Africa and Latin America to 2030 under various growth and policy scenarios in Asia, using the GTAP model of the global economy. We compare a projection assuming relatively conservative economic growth in China and India with a projection in which those economies continue to grow rapidly (albeit slower than in the previous decade). We then compare our conservative growth baseline with two alternative scenarios: one assuming Africa and Latin America choose to invest more in public agricultural R&D to take advantage of Asian import growth; the other assuming China and India dampen that import growth by restricting their imports of key foodgrains (following the historical pattern of economies such as Japan and Korea). The final section summarizes the results and draws out policy implications for Latin America and Africa.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

D58|Fiscal Policy Matters A New DSGE Model for Slovakia| The paper sets out a multiple-trend DSGE model designed, calibrated and estimated to match key stylized facts about the Slovak economy. The model includes a detailed fiscal policy block that allows a thorough analysis of fiscal policy measures and evaluate country’s fiscal policy credibility using interest rate spreads. The estimated model is firstly employed to identify the structural economic shocks that drive the economy and determine the sources of the forecast uncertainty. The empirical analysis emphasizes the importance of the foreign shocks on domestic GDP, trade and employment growth and high influence of productivity shocks on inflation and labour market dynamics. Next, using the model we study the response of the economy to a technology shock and to a foreign demand shock under alternative fiscal adjustment scenarios. We find that a well-designed programme involving increases in transfers as well as tax cuts can stabilize the economy in the short run and improve longer-term growth prospects following a shock with adverse fiscal implications. We analyse the consequences of fiscal policy shocks in and away from the steady state of the model. The exercise yields implied fiscal multipliers that are in line with standard literature. Raising capital and labour tax especially is particularly bad for the real economy, mainly in the long run. On the other hand, cutting subsidies and unproductive government consumption are the least harmful way of reducing spending, while reduction in the public wage bill and public investment has negative implications on household consumption and wealth.
D58|Aging, Taxes and Pensions in Switzerland|The gains in life expectancy are expected to double the dependency ratio and increase population by 10% in Switzerland until 2050. To quantify the effects on pensions, taxes and social contributions, we use an overlapping generations model with five margins of labor supply: labor market participation, hours worked, job search, retirement, and on-the-job training. A passive fiscal strategy would be very costly. A comprehensive reform, including an increase in the effective retirement age to 68 years, may limit the tax increases to 4 percentage points of value added tax and reduce the decline of per capita income to less than 6%.
D58|Extent of Expected Pigouvian Taxes and Permits for Environmental Services in a General Equilibrium Model with a natural capital constraint|This paper presents a general equilibrium model to analyze the influence that a contaminating sector has on a natural system’s capacity of resilience, the provision of a public utility service and social welfare, in which the level and capacity to respond to resilience are uncertain, so a probability distribution for the growing loss of resilience with pollution going from a prudent state to an imprudent is defined. And examines first the incidence of expected Pigouvian taxes and finds that these taxes are not enough to maintain resilience because of the cumulative effect of pollution and also that society prefers a prudent tax. Furthermore, the transaction of Permits for Environmental Services (PES) between sector that provides the public utility service and the contaminating sector is allowed. This shows a redistribution of resources very much in favor of the contaminating sector, and there are no incentives to invest in these payments unless the affected have additional objectives for the maximization of private benefit.
D58|Modelling the Impacts of a Cut to Company Tax in Australia|We investigate the impact of a cut to the company tax rate using a miniature version of the Vic-Uni computable general equilibrium model of the Australian economy with additional detail on ownership of physical capital. Because of Australia's system of dividend imputation, a change to the company tax rate only affects the final post-tax rate of return for foreign investors. Therefore a cut to the company tax rate would transfer government revenue to foreigners, and add to pressure on government to reduce spending or to raise personal taxes. We concur with the Treasury's finding that a cut to the company tax rate would attract more foreign investment to Australia, making workers more productive and increasing wages and output. However, there is a lag between new investment activity and capital growth, and a large share of future company profits will accrue to foreign investors. We also find that increased wages will reduce returns to domestically owned capital. While the impact on national production, as measured by GDP, will be positive, this is not a suitable measure of national benefit. The right indicator of national benefit is the impact of a company tax rate cut on national income and we find that this will fall.

D58|Melting Ice Caps and the Economic Impact of Opening the Northern Sea Route|One consequence of melting Arctic ice caps is the commercial viability of the Northern Sea Route, connecting East Asia with Europe. This represents a sizeable reduction in shipping distances and average transportation days compared to the conventional Southern Sea Route. We examine the economic impact of opening this route in a multiâ€ sector Eatonâ€“Kortum model with intermediate linkages. We find remarkable shifts in trade flows between Asia and Europe, diversion of trade within Europe, heavy shipping traffic in the Arctic and a substantial drop in Suez traffic. Projected shifts in trade also imply substantial pressure on an already threatened Arctic ecosystem.
D58|Interest Rate Effects Of Demographic Changes In A New Keynesian Life-Cycle Framework|This paper develops a small-scale DSGE model which embeds a demographic structure within a monetary policy framework. We extend the tractable, though non-monetary overlapping-generations model of Gertler (1999) and present a small synthesis model which combines the set-up of Gertler with a New-Keynesian structure, implying that the short-run dynamics related to monetary policy are similar to the paradigm summarized in Woodford (2003). In sum, the model offers a New-Keynesian platform which can be used to investigate in a closed economy set-up the response of macroeconomic variables to demographic shocks, similar to technology, government spending or monetary policy shocks. Empirically, we use a calibrated version of the model to discuss a number of macroeconomic scenarios for the euro area with a horizon of around 20 years. The main finding is that demographic changes, while contributing slowly over time to a decline in the equilibrium interest rate, are not visible enough within the time horizon relevant for monetary policy-making to require monetary policy reactions.

D58|The dynamics of capital accumulation in the US: simulations after piketty|Abstract We develop a dynamic model where a competitive firm uses labor and capital, with market clearing rates of return. Individuals are heterogeneous in skills, with an endowment in capital/wealth increasing in skill. Individuals aspire to a socially determined consumption level, with a constant marginal propensity to consume out of income above this level. We also study three variants of the model: one with a higher rate of return for large capitals than for smaller ones, one with a capital levy financing a lump sum transfer, and one with social mobility. We calibrate the model to the US economy and obtain that a steady state exists in all variants, and we obtain convergence to the steady state from the 2012 US wealth distribution. The reduction in the level of the aspirational consumption level is the only way to create wealth for the bottom half of the distribution.
