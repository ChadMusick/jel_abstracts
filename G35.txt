G35|Payout policy and ownership structure: The case of Islamic and conventional banks|Using a sample of Islamic and conventional financial institutions domiciled in 16 countries for the period 2000-2015, we examine how ownership structure affects dividend policy. Our main findings indicate that ownership identity is important in explaining dividend policy in these banks, albeit in different patterns. In particular, the results suggest that government ownership seems to exert negative effects on dividend payouts in both types of banks, which is in line with the preference of governments towards bank stability. With respect to family ownership, the impact is negative for conventional banks but positive for Islamic ones, consistent with agency theory. These results are to some extent similar in the case of foreign ownership where it is associated with a higher payout policy in Islamic banks, but not significant in conventional ones. Our results are robust to an array of additional analyses including propensity score matching.
G35|Biased beliefs, costly external finance, and firm behavior : A Unified theory|Overconfidence and overextrapolation are two behavioral biases that are pervasive in human thinking. A long line of research documents that such biases influence business decisions by distorting managers' expected productivity. We propose a new mechanism in which the biases change firms' precautionary motives when external financing is costly, finding that the influences of biases on investment, payouts, and refinancing are stronger for financially weaker firms. Moreover, biased and rational firms display di erential responses to economic booms and busts holding financial positions constant. Our work illustrates that managerial traits, when interacting with imperfect capital markets, drive firm dynamics in business cycles.
G35|What Do Insiders Know? Evidence from Insider Trading Around Share Repurchases and SEOs|We examine the nature of information contained in insider trades prior to corporate events. Insiders’ net buying increases before open market share repurchase announcements and decreases before SEOs. Higher insider net buying is associated with better post-event operating performance, a reduction in undervaluation, and, for repurchases, lower post-event cost of capital. Insider trading predicts announcement returns and, for repurchases, the long-term drift following events. Overall, our results suggest that insider trades before corporate events contain information about changes both in fundamentals and in investor sentiment. Information about fundamentals is incorporated slowly into prices, while information about mispricing is incorporated faster.
G35|Short-Term Debt and Incentives for Risk-Taking|"We challenge the view that short-term debt curbs moral hazard and analytically demonstrate that, in a world with financing frictions and fair debt pricing, short-term debt increases incentives for risk-taking. To do so, we develop a model in which firms are financed with equity and short-term debt and cannot freely optimize their default decision because of financing frictions. Using this model, we show that short-term debt can give rise to a ""rollover trap,"" a scenario in which firms burn revenues and cash reserves to absorb severe rollover losses. In the rollover trap, shareholders find it optimal to increase asset risk in an attempt to improve interim debt repricing and prevent inefficient liquidation. These risk-taking incentives do not arise when debt maturity is sufficiently long."
G35|Corporate Cash Holdings: Stock Liquidity and the Repurchase Motive|We document that enhanced stock liquidity increases a firm’s propensity to hold cash. Endogeneity is addressed using a difference-in-differences approach based on tick-size decimalization. Our finding is surprising in light of the view that improved stock liquidity reduces financial constraints. We propose that firms hold cash also to buy back shares and higher stock liquidity strengthens this incentive. Tests are supportive. Endogeneity is controlled for using the introduction of repurchase safe harbor rules. We conclude that with respect to the effect of stock liquidity on cash holdings, the repurchase motive dominates the real investments motive.

G35|Dividend Policy Decisions and Ownership Concentration: Evidence from Thai Public Companies|In this paper we examine the relationship between ownership concentration and dividend policy for Thai publicly listed companies. High family ownership firms have higher dividend payouts than low family ownership firms, which we interpret to mean high family ownership firms follow a more rational dividend policy. This finding is consistent with the prediction that agency conflicts between the managers and shareholders are lower at firms with a controlling shareholder. The evidence is robust through different econometric specifications, robust when the level used to determine the extent of family ownership (family control) is lowered to 10 percent of the outstanding shares, and robust to the inclusion of the ownership wedge as a proxy for the severity of agency conflicts.
G35|Do Short-Term Incentives Affect Long-Term Productivity?|Previous research shows that stock repurchases that are caused by earnings management lead to reductions in firm-level investment and employment. It is natural to expect firms to cut less productive investment and employment first, which could lead to a positive effect on firm-level productivity. However, using Census data, we find that firms make cuts across the board irrespective of plant productivity. This pattern seems to be associated with frictions in the labor market. Specifically, we find evidence that unionization of the labor force may prevent firms from doing efficient downsizing, forcing them to engage in easy or expedient downsizing instead. As a result of this inefficient downsizing, EPS-driven repurchases lead to a reduction in long-term productivity.
G35|What if dividends were tax-exempt? Evidence from a natural experiment|We study the effect of dividend taxes on the payout and investment policy of listed firms and discuss their implications for agency problems. To do so, we exploit a unique setting in Switzerland where some, but not all, firms were suddenly able to pay tax-exempted dividends to their shareholders following the corporate tax reform of 2011. Using a difference-in-differences specification, we show that treated firms increased their payout by around 30% compared to control firms after the tax cut. Differently, treated firms did not concurrently or subsequently increase investment. We show that the tax-inelasticity of investment was due to a significant drop in retained earnings ̶ as the rise in dividends was not compensated by an equally-sized reduction in share repurchases. Furthermore, treated firms did not raise more equity than control firms. Lastly, we show that an unintended consequence of cutting dividend taxes is to mitigate the agency problems that arise between insiders and minority shareholders.
G35|The impact of financialisation on the wage share: a theoretical clarification and empirical test|It is frequently asserted that financialisation has contributed to the decline in the wage share. This paper provides a theoretical clarification and a systematic empirical investigation. We identify four channels through which financialisation can affect the wage share: (1) enhanced exit options of firms; (2) rising price mark-ups due to financial overhead costs for businesses; (3) increased competition on capital markets and shareholder value orientation; and (4) the role of household debt in increasing workers’ financial vulnerability and undermining their class consciousness. The paper compiles a comprehensive set of empirical measures of financialisation and uses it to test these hypotheses with a panel regression of 14 OECD countries over the 1992-2014 period. We find strong evidence for negative effects of financial liberalisation and financial payments of non-financial corporations on the wage share that are in the same order of magnitude as the effects of globalisation.
G35|The corporate sector and the current account|"In this paper, we analyze how corporate sector behavior has affected national current account balances in a sample of 25 countries for the period 1980-2015. A consistent finding is that an increase (decrease) in corporate net lending leads to an increase (decrease) in the current account, controlling for standard current account determinants. We disentangle the current account effects of corporate saving and investment and we explore a number of alternative explanations of our results, including incomplete piercing of the ""corporate veil"", by households, foreign direct investment activities, a temporary crisis phenomenon, and changes in income inequality. We conclude that corporate sector saving is an important driver of macroeconomic trends and that the rise of corporate net lending especially in a number of current account surplus countries has contributed considerably to global current account imbalances."

G35|Global Uncertainty and Firm Investment: Empirical Assessment|Using firm-level data from 36 countries, we estimate the effect of global uncertainty on corporate investment and financial decisions. Eleven global uncertainty measures that encompass macro, micro, and higher-order dimensions of uncertainty are employed. We find that while Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) measures negatively affect investment, non-EPU measures have positive effects. In 2010s, EPU and non-EPU measures exhibit notably different behaviors which appear to considerably influence our results. We also explore how firm- and country-specific characteristics affect the relationship between uncertainty and investment. The negative effects of EPU measures on investment are stronger for firms with high investment irreversibility and high leverage, but no such effect is observed from non-EPU measures. In countries with deeper credit markets, investment decisions are less sensitive to uncertainty. Regarding financial decisions, (1) increased EPU measures lead to increased cash holdings, while an increase in most other uncertainty measures reduces them and (2) except for Global EPU, most uncertainty measures are negatively associated with dividend payouts. Overall, our results reveal that contrary to a substantial body of recent scholarly work, the uncertainty-investment relation is sensitive to uncertainty measures and sample periods and different uncertainty measures have differential effects on cash holdings and dividend payouts.
G35|Golden Age of Capitalism: The effect of education on growth and inequality|This study explores the effect of education on the balance between income per capita and income distribution using the TEVECON model in which growth and development are driven by innovation, giving rise to new sectors. Our results can explain the Golden Age of Capitalism (1950 -1973), characterized by high growth rates and low inequality. Our experiments varying investment in education and its allocation to two social classes define a range of education policies that can lead to many combinations of income per capita and income distribution. We find that education can affect both the creation of high income per capita and income distribution, but it does not always guarantee ``positive'' economic outcomes in terms of the variables we investigate. Thus, of the development paths, our results include both scenarios similar to that described by the Kuznets curve and less ``virtuous'' ones similar to that detected by Piketty and Saez, in which economic progress is accompanied by increasingly inegalitarian income distribution. Moreover, our model predicts that even in highly developed economic systems, different education policies can give rise to combinations of high income per capita and low inequality or low income per capita and low inequality. In this context, a shift from a regime of high growth and falling income inequality, similar to the one observed in the 1950s to 1980s (P1), to a regime of lower growth and increasing income inequality, similar to the one observed in the 1980s to 2000s (P2), could have been produced by a transition from falling inequality in the distribution of education in P1 to rising inequality in the distribution of education in P2. Education alone cannot be considered to be the cause of the transition over P1-P2. Other factors such as liberalization and deregulation that began in the 1980s and increasing globalization, which has been greatly accelerated by the emergence of China, help transform the economic system in the same broad direction. In a general sense, our study shows that while education can greatly contribute to economic development, it is not an intrinsically beneficial force leading automatically to a richer and fairer society.
G35|Dancing With Activists|An important milestone often reached in the life of an activist engagement is entering into a “settlement” agreement between the activist and the target’s board. Using a comprehensive hand-collected data set, we analyze the drivers, nature, and consequences of such settlement agreements. Settlements are more likely when the activist has a credible threat to win board seats in a proxy fight and when incumbents’ reputation concerns are stronger. Consistent with incomplete contracting, face-saving benefits and private information considerations, settlements commonly do not contract directly on operational or leadership changes sought by the activist but rather on board composition changes. Settlements are accompanied by positive stock price reactions, and they are subsequently followed by changes of the type sought by activists, including CEO turnover, higher shareholder payouts, and improved operating performance. We find no evidence to support concerns that settlements enable activists to extract rents at the expense of other investors. Our analysis provides a look into the “black box” of activist engagements and contributes to understanding how activism brings about changes in target companies.
G35|Resolutions to flip-over credit risk and beyond|Abstract Given a risk outcome y over a rating system {R_i }_(i=1)^k for a portfolio, we show in this paper that the maximum likelihood estimates with monotonic constraints, when y is binary (the Bernoulli likelihood) or takes values in the interval 0≤y≤1 (the quasi-Bernoulli likelihood), are each given by the average of the observed outcomes for some consecutive rating indexes. These estimates are in average equal to the sample average risk over the portfolio and coincide with the estimates by least squares with the same monotonic constraints. These results are the exact solution of the corresponding constrained optimization. A non-parametric algorithm for the exact solution is proposed. For the least squares estimates, this algorithm is compared with “pool adjacent violators” algorithm for isotonic regression. The proposed approaches provide a resolution to flip-over credit risk and a tool to determine the fair risk scales over a rating system.
G35|A History of Australian Equities|This paper presents stylised facts about the historical Australian equity market, drawn from a new hand-collected unit record dataset on listed companies from 1917 to 1979. Among other things, I show that: i) dividends for the early 20th century were lower than previously believed; ii) the realised returns on equities has averaged about 4 percentage points above that on government bonds since 1917, somewhat lower than previous estimates; iii) the share of profits paid out as dividends increased substantially after the introduction of franking credits in the 1980s; iv) the current industry composition of the stock exchange is atypical relative to history, despite it being dominated by essentially the same companies for the past century; and v) price-to-earnings ratios are currently almost exactly at their very long-run average, in contrast with the experience of some of other countries.
G35|Capital accumulation and corporate portfolio choice between liquidity holdings and financialisation|Most models of investment decisions utilised in macroeconomic models take free or perfect competition as explicit or implicit assumption. However, the oligopolistic structure of most real markets lead to corporate strategic behaviours that can produce very different results. Strategic decisions, connected with agency problems, can play a major role in producing financialisation and timing the rhythms of real investment. The paper deals with both mainstream and heterodox contributions that analyse the effects of corporate governance and strategic behaviours on portfolio management and investment decisions in big corporations, seeking to determine how these effects might play a major role in producing growing liquidity holdings and financialisation. The main objective is to understand whether these models can explain the tendency to place growing shares of social surplus in speculative financial channels, thereby contributing to long-term real stagnation.
G35|Rethinking Capital Regulation: The Case for a Dividend Prudential Target|The paper investigates the effectiveness of dividend-based macroprudential rules in complementing capital requirements to promote bank soundness and sustained lending over the cycle. First, some evidence on bank dividends and earnings in the euro area is presented. When shocks hit their profits, banks adjust retained earnings to smooth dividends. This generates bank equity and credit supply volatility. Then, a DSGE model with key financial frictions and a banking sector is developed to assess the virtues of what shall be called dividend prudential targets. Welfare-maximizing dividend-based macroprudential rules are shown to have important properties: (i) they are effective in smoothing the financial cycle by means of less volatile bank retained earnings, (ii) they induce welfare gains associated to a Basel III-type of capital regulation, (iii) they mainly operate through their cyclical component, ensuring that long-run dividend payouts remain unaffected, (iv) they are flexible enough so as to allow bank managers to optimally deviate from the target, and (v) they act as an insurance scheme for the real economy. Keywords : macroprudential regulation, capital requirements, dividend prudential target, financial stability, bank dividends
G35|Dividend payout ratio follows a Tweedie distribution: International evidence|Dividend policy is still a largely discussed issue in corporate finance literature. One of the main indicators used in analysing the dividend policy is the dividend payout ratio. Using a database consisting of 12,085 companies operating in 73 countries, for the period 2008-2014, the authors found that the dividend payout ratio follows a Tweedie distribution, and not a normal one. This distribution is stable over time for the entire analysed period. In addition, it describes the case of almost all the countries included in the sample. Thus, a better estimation of the probability that dividend payout ratio is lower or higher than a benchmark can be provided. Also, an analysis of dividend policy, distinctly considering payer versus non-payer companies, can offer additional important information for both practitioners and academics.
G35|The Information Content of Dividends: Safer Profits, Not Higher Profits|Contrary to the central prediction of signaling models, changes in profits do not empirically follow changes in dividends. We show both theoretically and empirically that dividends signal safer, rather than higher, future profits. Using the Campbell (1991) decomposition, we are able to estimate expected cash flows from data on stock returns. Consistent with our model’s predictions, cash-flow volatility changes in the opposite direction from that of dividend changes and larger changes in volatility come with larger announcement returns. We find similar results for share repurchases. Crucially, the data supports the prediction - unique to our model - that the cost of the signal is foregone investment opportunities. We conclude that payout policy conveys information about future cash flow volatility. Our methodology can be applied more generally to overcoming empirical problems in testing theories of corporate financing.
G35|Eclipse of the Public Corporation or Eclipse of the Public Markets?|Since reaching a peak in 1997, the number of listed firms in the U.S. has fallen in every year but one. During this same period, public firms have been net purchasers of $3.6 trillion of equity (in 2015 dollars) rather than net issuers. The propensity to be listed is lower across all firm size groups, but more so among firms with less than 5,000 employees. Relative to other countries, the U.S. now has abnormally few listed firms. Because markets have become unattractive to small firms, existing listed firms are larger and older. We argue that the importance of intangible investment has grown but that public markets are not well-suited for young, R&D-intensive companies. Since there is abundant capital available to such firms without going public, they have little incentive to do so until they reach the point in their lifecycle where they focus more on payouts than on raising capital.
G35|What Is the Impact of Successful Cyberattacks on Target Firms?|We examine which firms are targets of successful cyberattacks and how they are affected. We find that cyberattacks are more likely to occur at larger and more visible firms, more highly valued firms, firms with more intangible assets, and firms with less board attention to risk management. These attacks affect firms adversely when consumer financial information is appropriated, but seem to have little impact otherwise. Attacks where consumer financial information is appropriated are associated with a significant negative stock market reaction, an increase in leverage following greater debt issuance, a deterioration in credit ratings, and an increase in cash flow volatility. These attacks also affect sales growth adversely for large firms and firms in retail industries, and there is evidence that they decrease investment in the short run. Affected firms respond to such attacks by cutting the CEO's bonus as a fraction of total compensation, by reducing the risk-taking incentives of management, and by taking actions to strengthen their risk management. The evidence is consistent with cyberattacks increasing boards' assessment of target firm risk exposures and decreasing their risk appetite.
G35|Investment Returns and Distribution Policies of Non-Profit Endowment Funds|We present the first estimates of investment returns and distribution rates for U.S. non-profit endowment funds, based on a comprehensive sample of 29,762 organizations drawn from Internal Revenue Service filings for 2009-2017. Non-profit endowments badly underperform market benchmarks, with median annual returns 4.46 percentage points below a 60-40 mix of U.S. equity and Treasury bond indexes, and statistically significant alphas of -1.10% per year. Smaller endowments have less negative alphas than larger endowments, but all size classes significantly underperform. Higher education endowments, the majority of the $0.7 trillion asset class, do significantly worse than funds in other sectors. Distribution ratios are conservative, well below the funds’ long-run returns. Donors increase contributions when endowment returns are strong, with an elasticity of about 0.18 between net-of-market investment returns and new donations.
G35|Growing pension deficits and the expenditure decisions of UK companies|Large deficits have opened up on defined benefit pension schemes in the United Kingdom since 2007, and at the same time investment expenditure has been subdued; this is a common phenomenon in other countries too. We use privileged access to a unique new data set from The Pensions Regulator and two identification schemes to investigate the effects of deficits and deficit recovery plans on UK companies’ dividends, investment, wages and cash holdings. Identification is based on the close relationship between low long-term interest rates and pension deficits; and the external regulation of pension schemes by The Pensions Regulator. We show that firms with larger pension deficits voluntarily pay lower dividends, but they do not invest less. However, firms that are required to make deficit recovery contributions by the regulator have lower dividend and investment expenditure compared to other firms, and more so if they are financially constrained. These effects are large for some individual companies, but macroeconomically small compared to the stimulus offered by the Bank of England’s quantitative easing policy.
G35|Треба Ли Компанијама Управљати У Интересу Акционара?<BR>[Whether Companies Need to Be Managed in the Interests of the Shareholders?]|Serbian. Једна од основних и широко заступаних поставки корпоративног управљања јесте управљање предузећима у интересу акционара, односно власника предузећа. Овај концепт заснован је на аргументима да власници имају најјачи интерес у предузећу и да од тог интереса директно зависи ефикасност пословања, док су истовремено интереси акционара најмање заштићени међу интересима свих конституената. У неким земљама тај концепт уздигнут је до апсолута (у САД као једини интерес који треба штитити истиче се интерес акционара), али и тамо где то није случај, односно где се респектују и интереси других конституената, интерес акционара је неприкосновен и истиче се у први план. У раду се разматрају основи и модалитети којима се у различитим земљама и различитим условима мотивише такав облик корпоративног управљања, као и консеквенце које такви захтеви и њихово испуњавање производе. Посебно се указује на крах концепције максимизације тржишних вредности акција, која је била изузетно популарна у последњим деценијама 20. и почетком овог века. One of the basic and widely represented corporate governance settings is corporate governance in the interests of shareholders, or company owners. This concept is based on the arguments that the owners have the strongest interest in the company and that the efficiency of the business depends directly on this interest, while at the same time the interests of shareholders are at least protected among the interests of all constituents. In some countries, this concept has been elevated to the absolute (in the United States as the only interest to be protected, the interest of shareholders is emphasized), but where this is not the case, or where the interests of other constituents are respected, the interest of the shareholders is inviolable and stands out in the first plan. The paper discusses the basis and modalities that motivate different forms of corporate governance in different countries and different conditions, as well as the consequences that such requirements and their fulfillment produce. In particular, the crash of the concept of maximizing the market value of shares, which was extremely popular in the last decades of the 20th and the beginning of this century, is particularly indicative.
G35|Passing the dividend baton: The impact of dividend policy on new CEOs' initial compensation|We examine how firms’ dividend policy affects the initial compensation of their new CEOs. We focus on new CEOs to isolate the effect of dividends on compensation and to provide new insights into an aspect largely neglected in compensation research. We show that the dividend payout is positively related to new CEO compensation and that this positive relation remains after addressing potential endogeneity concerns. Further, the positive effect of dividends is stronger for firms with no dividend cuts over the past two, three and four years, firms with relatively high institutional ownership, and those with strong boards, consistent with new CEOs receiving higher pay as compensation for greater dividend pressure.
G35|Elective Stock and Scrip Dividends|We investigate firms’ decisions to pay elective stock dividends, known in the UK as scrip dividends. Scrip dividends give investors the choice between receiving new shares or the equivalent value as a cash dividend. UK firms paying scrip dividends are more likely to be financially constrained, and scrip dividends are used more when access to external financing is costly. Our results are robust to using the 2008 financial crisis as an exogenous shock to credit supply. Cash preservation is the most important corporate incentive to use scrip dividends as they tend to be distributed in combination with dividend cuts and with major corporate investments such as debt-financed mergers and acquisitions. Analysis of US dividend reinvestment plans by which investors purchase new shares confirms firms’ cash-preservation motives.
G35|Growing pension deficits and the expenditure decisions of UK companies|Large deficits have opened up on defined benefit pension schemes in the UK since 2007, and at the same time investment expenditure has been subdued; this is a common phenomenon in other countries too. We use privileged access to a unique new dataset from The Pensions Regulator and two identification schemes to investigate the effects of deficits and deficit recovery plans on UK companies’ dividends, investment, wages and cash holdings. Identification is based on the close relationship between low long-term interest rates and pension deficits; and the external regulation of pension schemes by The Pensions Regulator. We show that firms with larger pension deficits voluntarily pay lower dividends, but they do not invest less. However, firms that are required to make deficit recovery contributions by the regulator have lower dividend and investment expenditure compared to other firms, and more so if they are financially constrained. These effects are large for some individual companies, but macro-economically small compared to the stimulus offered by the Bank of England’s quantitative easing policy.
G35|Business investment, cash holding and uncertainty since the Great Financial Crisis|The Lehman Brothers event in 2008 created a large uncertainty shock that triggered an economic slowdown lasting a decade. The macroeconomic effects are well documented, but the effect on business decisions much less so. In this paper, we explore corporate data to investigate how economic uncertainty affected investment, dividend payouts and cash holdings, based on over 10,000 UK firm-year observations. We offer new insights into the relationship between business decisions and uncertainty, by exploiting two surveys of macroeconomic uncertainty from professional forecasters and CFOs collected by the Bank of England. These data demonstrate that heightened economic uncertainty lowered investment even after controlling for investment opportunities, sales growth, and the firm’s own stock volatility. Economic uncertainty also explains the rise in cash holdings and the fall in payouts. Hence, our results help explain why UK firms invested so little and held so much cash at a time of historically low interest rates, and also why they paid out smaller dividends. These results may help explain recent sluggish productivity in the UK economy, and they also are important, because they provide a benchmark for future studies of Brexit-related uncertainty.
G35|The Relative Announcement Effects of Ordinary Dividends, Special Dividends and Share Buybacks in New Zealand|This study first examines investor reactions to three types of cash disbursement announcement in the New Zealand context: increases in ordinary dividends, notification of special dividends, and the first disclosure of a share repurchase programme. Secondly it investigates whether the disbursement type is influenced by any company characteristic. Event study methodology is employed. The market model is used to create abnormal returns (ARs) on the dates of the announcements and these ARs are then subjected to T-tests and then a Kuskal-Wallis test to determine if they differ across the three announcement types. Given that dividends and earnings are announced simultaneously, a restricted least squares regression procedure is used to separate these two effects out. A multinomial logistic regression is then used to determine if any inherent company characteristic (size, leverage, liquidity risk, profitability level) influences a company’s choice of disbursement type. In the New Zealand context, investors react more dramatically to announced increases in ordinary dividends and special dividends than to announcements of share buybacks. With respect to the influence of company characteristics, share buybacks tend to be a disbursement preference for larger companies. The findings provide no support for any preference for buybacks as a substitute for dividends in the New Zealand context. This study breaks new ground in considering the relative attractiveness of the three disbursement types in New Zealand.
G35|A Corporate Financing-Based Asset Pricing Model|I show that an asset pricing model for the equity claims of a value-maximizing firm can be constructed from its optimal financial contracting behavior. I study a dynamic contracting model in which firms trade off the costs and benefits of a given promise to pay external lenders in a specific economic state. Deals between firms and financiers reveal the importance of that state for firm's equity value, namely the stochastic discount factor the firm responds to. I empirically evaluate the model in the cross section of expected equity returns. I find that the financial contracting approach goes a long way in rationalizing observed cross-sectional differences in average returns, also in comparison to leading asset pricing models. In addition, the model discloses that two easily measured variables, the growth rates on net worth and profitability, generate sizeable cross-sectional spreads in returns. Finally, a calibrated version of the model is broadly consistent with observed corporate policies of US listed firms.
G35|The (Self-)Funding of Intangibles|In response to technological change, U.S. corporations have been investing more in intangible capital. This transformation is empirically associated with lower leverage and greater cash holdings, and commonly explained as a precautionary response to reduced debt capacity. We model how firms' payout and cash holding policies are affected by this shift. Our insight is that the creation of intangibles is largely achieved by human capital investment and requires lower upfront outlays. Firms can self-finance the retention of human capital by granting deferred equity compensation. Interestingly, retaining cash and repurchasing shares enhances the value of unvested equity, thereby facilitating retention and reducing equity dilution. Our empirical evidence confirms that firms with higher intangible investment have lower upfront investment needs. They make similar payouts as tangible investment firms, suggesting they are not on average more financially constrained. They also tend to grant more deferred equity and prioritize repurchases over dividends in particular when their stock volatility is high, in line with our model's predictions.

G35|What is the Impact of Successful Cyberattacks on Target Firms?|We examine which firms are targets of cyberattacks and how they are affected. We find that cyberattacks cause firms to reassess the risks that they are exposed to and their consequences, so that they have real effects on firm policies even when targets are not financially constrained. Cyberattacks are more likely to occur at more visible firms, firms with more intangible assets, and firms with less board attention to risk management. Attacks where personal financial information is appropriated are associated with a negative stock-market reaction, a decrease in sales growth for large firms and retail firms, an increase in leverage, a deterioration in financial health, and a decrease in investment in the short run. Firms further respond to cyberattacks by reducing CEO bonuses and risk-taking incentives and by strengthening their risk management.
G35|Does Capital Flow More to High Tobin's Q Industries?|We examine whether capital flows more to high Tobin's q industries and find that it flows more to high q industries from 1971 until 1996 but not from 1997 to 2014. This change is due to a decrease in the q-sensitivity of equity funding resulting mostly from the increased q-sensitivity of repurchases after 1996. The increase in intangible assets, the aging of American firms, and the impact of the China shock explain much of the change in the q-sensitivity of equity funding and repurchases. The results are robust to how q is estimated and to a non-q measure of growth opportunities.
G35|The Effect of Foreign Cash Holdings on Internal Capital Markets and Firm Financing|Prior to 2018, U.S. repatriation taxes motivated companies to retain cash offshore. Using confidential jurisdiction-specific data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, we find that firms with high tax-induced foreign cash have approximately 3.3 percent higher domestic liabilities relative to other multinationals, equivalent to $152.2 million more domestic debt per firm, or approximately $98.9-$141.9 billion in aggregate. We next examine motives for firms with tax-induced foreign cash to borrow domestically, finding this behavior is associated with shareholder payouts and some domestic investment spending. Finally, repatriations and intercompany loans from foreign subsidiaries act as substitutes and complements, respectively, to external borrowings.
G35|Do Boards Of Directors Affect CEO Behavior? Evidence From Payout Decisions|We test the ability of boards of directors to eliminate the negative impact of CEO behavior on payout policy. We contribute to the literature by testing the ability of boards to influence CEO payout propensity. First, we show that if the compensation scheme of a CEO does not stimulate him or her to take more risk, the level of payout will be higher. Second, by introducing an index of corporate governance quality we show that corporate governance tools may reduce the negative effects of CEO risk preferences: in companies with good corporate governance, the risk preferences of the CEO do not affect payout decisions. Third, based on a set of specifications for risk preferences, we show how the impact of CEO attitudes to risk influences the types of payouts
G35|Growth-Rate and Uncertainty Shocks in Consumption: Cross-Country Evidence|"We provide new estimates of the importance of growth-rate shocks and uncertainty shocks for developed countries. The shocks we estimate are large and correspond to well-known macroeconomic episodes such as the Great Moderation and the productivity slowdown. We compare our results to earlier estimates of ""long-run risks"" and assess the implications for asset pricing. Our estimates yield greater return predictability and a more volatile price-dividend ratio. In addition, we can explain a substantial fraction of cross-country variation in the equity premium. An advantage of our approach, based on macroeconomic data alone, is that the parameter estimates cannot be viewed as backward engineered to fit asset pricing data. We provide intuition for our results using the recently developed framework of shock-exposure and shock-price elasticities."
G35|Dividends from Unrealized Earnings and Default Risk|Using hand-collected data on Israeli firms’ unrealized earnings and debt restructurings following adoption of the IFRS, we investigate whether and how dividend payments based on unrealized revaluation earnings affect a firm’s default risk. Our results indicate that in the era of fair value accounting, the origin of the dividend payout—coming from unrealized versus realized earnings—has a significant effect on a firm’s default risk above and beyond the effect of the extent of the payment. Specifically, controlling for various determinants of financial risk, including the amount of the dividends paid (originating from either realized or unrealized earnings), companies are over three times more likely to subsequently require debt restructuring if they distribute dividends based on unrealized earnings. However, this enhanced risk seems to be mispriced by the market; firms that distribute dividends based on unrealized earnings exhibit an insignificantly different cost of debt than firms that never do so.
G35|Transitory versus Permanent Shocks: Explaining Corporate Savings and Investment|We model the investment and cash policies of a firm facing financing frictions, transitory cash flow shocks, and permanent productivity shocks. While cash holdings increase and investment and Tobin's $q$ decrease with the volatilities of either type of shocks, a higher correlation between these shocks makes the firm hold less cash, invest more, and become more valuable. We verify these predictions on a large sample of U.S. firms using estimates of permanent and transitory cash flow shocks obtained via structural estimation. Our results suggest that corporate policies and valuations are better understood when distinguishing between permanent and transitory cash flow shocks.
G35|Transmission of Uncertainty Shocks: Learning from Heterogeneous Responses on a Panel of EU Countries|Numerous recent studies, starting with Bloom (2009), highlight the impact of varying uncertainty levels on economic activity. These studies mostly focus on individual countries, and cross-country evidence is scarce. In this paper, we use a set of (panel) BVAR models to study the effect of uncertainty shocks on economic developments in EU Member States. We explicitly distinguish between domestic, common and global uncertainty shocks and employ new proxies of uncertainty. The domestic uncertainty indicators are derived from the Business and Consumer Surveys administered by the European Commission. The common EU-wide uncertainty is subsequently derived by means of a factor model. Finally, the global uncertainty indicator - inspired by Jurado et al. (2015) - is extracted as a common factor from a broad set of forecast indicators that are not driven by the business cycle. The results suggest that real output in EU countries drops after spikes in uncertainty, mainly as a result of lower investment. Unlike for the U.S., there is little evidence of activity overshooting following this initial fall. The responses to uncertainty shocks vary across Member States. These differences can be attributed not mainly to different shock sizes, but rather to cross-country structural characteristics. Member States with more flexible labour markets and product markets seem to weather uncertainty shocks better. Likewise, a higher manufacturing share and higher economic diversification help dampen the impact of uncertainty shocks. The role of economic openness is more ambiguous.
G35|Uncertainty spillover and policy reactions|Spells of uncertainty are argued to cause rapid drops in economic activity. Wait and see behavior and risk aversion in combination with other frictions can make periods of increased uncertainty an important driver of the business cycle. Emerging economies may endure even stronger and prolonged recessions following a global uncertainty shock, as credit constraints in shallow financial markets limit smoothing. Active policy responses often exacerbate the cycle. The present study uses a novel proxy of uncertainty – inspired on Jurado et al. (2015) – in which I extract a common factor that is not driven by the business cycle from a broad set of forecast indicators. I then estimate an interacted panel VAR on a large set of developed and emerging economies over the period 1990Q1-2014Q3 to test responses to shocks to uncertainty. Emerging markets suffer a larger fall in consumption and investment as uncertainty spreads globally. The main finding is that more developed financial markets are key to dampen the transmission of the shock. Fiscal policy is an alternative, but only if there is sufficient fiscal space to smooth shocks. Monetary policy dampens the effects of uncertainty under a fixed peg better than in a floating exchange rate regime.

Los comportamientos de «esperar y ver» y de aversión al riesgo, junto con otras fricciones, pueden originar que los periodos de incremento de la incertidumbre se conviertan en impulsores importantes del ciclo económico. Las economías emergentes pueden padecer las recesiones más fuertes y prolongadas que se producen tras un choque de incertidumbre global, en la medida en que las restricciones al crédito en los mercados financieros superficiales limitan el suavizamiento. Las respuestas de política activas exacerban a menudo el ciclo. El presente estudio utiliza un indicador novedoso de la incertidumbre – inspirado en Jurado et al. (2015) – en el que se extrae un factor común no impulsado por el ciclo económico, de un conjunto amplio de indicadores de pronóstico. A continuación se estima un VAR de panel interactuado para un amplio conjunto de economías desarrolladas y emergentes durante el periodo 1990Q1-2014Q3, con el propósito de probar las respuestas a los choques a la incertidumbre. Los mercados emergentes sufren mayores caídas de consumo e inversión a medida que se expande la incertidumbre a nivel global. El principal hallazgo es que los mercados financieros más desarrollados son esenciales para amortiguar la transmisión del choque. La política fiscal es una alternativa, pero únicamente si existe suficiente espacio fiscal para suavizar los choques. La política monetaria amortigua mejor los efectos de la incertidumbre cuanto existe un tipo de cambio fijo, en comparación a los regímenes de tipo flotante.
G35|The Long-Term Consequences of Short-Term Incentives|This paper shows that short-term stock price concerns induce CEOs to take value-reducing actions. Vesting equity, our measure of short-term concerns, is positively associated with the probability of a firm repurchasing shares, the amount of shares repurchased, and the probability of the firm announcing a merger and acquisition (M&A). When vesting equity increases, stock returns are more positive in the two quarters surrounding both repurchases and M&A, but more negative in the two years following repurchases and four years following M&A. These results are inconsistent with CEOs buying underpriced stocks or companies to maximize long-run shareholder value, but consistent with these actions being used to boost the short-term stock price and improve the conditions for equity sales. Overall, by identifying actions that carry clear value implications, this paper documents the long-term negative consequences of short-term incentives.
G35|Cash, Financial Flexibility, and Product Prices: Evidence from a Natural Experiment in the Airline Industry|Corporate cash holdings impact firms' product pricing strategies. Exploiting the Aviation Investment and Reform Act of the 21st Century as a quasi-natural experiment to identify exogenous shocks to competition in the airline industry, I find that firms with more cash than their rivals respond to intensified competition by pricing more aggressively, especially when there is less concern of rival retaliation. Financially flexible firms based on alternative measures respond similarly. Moreover, cash-rich firms experience greater market share gains and long-term profitability growth. The results highlight the importance of strategic interdependencies across firms in the effective use of flexibility provided by cash.
G35|Corporate Deleveraging and Financial Flexibility|Most firms deleverage from their historical peak market-leverage (ML) ratios to near-zero ML, while also markedly increasing cash balances to high levels. Among 4,476 nonfinancial firms with five or more years of post-peak data, median ML is 0.543 at the peak and 0.026 at the later trough, with a six-year median time from peak to trough and with debt repayment and earnings retention accounting for 93.7% of the median peak-to-trough decline in ML. The findings support theories in which firms deleverage to restore ample financial flexibility and are difficult to reconcile with most firms having materially positive leverage targets.
G35|Capital Share Dynamics When Firms Insure Workers|Although the aggregate capital share for U.S. firms has increased, the firm-level capital share has decreased on average. The divergence is due to the largest firms. While these mega-firms now produce a larger output share, their labor compensation has not increased proportionately. We develop a model in which firms insure workers against firm-specific shocks. More productive firms allocate more rents to shareholders, while less productive firms endogenously exit. Increasing firm-level risk delays the exit of less productive firms and increases the measure of mega-firms, raising the aggregate capital share and lowering it on average. We present evidence supporting this mechanism.
G35|Earnings and Dividend Announcements: Are They Interactive? Evidence from the French Context|In this study, we examine abnormal stock returns surrounding contemporaneous earnings and dividend announcements in order to shed more light on the substantive relationship between these two financial signals. Our focus is to investigate the possible complementary or substitutive effect on a sample of French firms. The empirical evidence indicates that information content of dividends should be examined jointly with earnings announcement. The coefficients of all the dummy variables are uniformly negative and significant above the 1% confidence level. These results are inconsistent with those of Kane et al. (1984). The significant coefficients support the corroboration hypothesis showing a negative interaction between earnings and dividends. This evidence suggests that investors evaluate the two announcements as two offsetting effects in order to meet any unexpected change in the firm’s financial policy.
G35|Uncertainty and firm dividend policy—A natural experiment|We examine how firms respond to uncertainty around U.S. tax policy changes, namely the individual level tax rate increases set to take effect on January 1, 2011 and January 1, 2013. We provide evidence that firms time the uncertainty in the tax environment and revise their dividend policy to an expected tax increase. We find that firms are likely to initiate their dividends or intensively increase their existing dividend amount one year before the expected tax increase. In addition, in 2012 when there is much less uncertainty on dividend tax changes than in 2010, firms are less likely to initiate a regular dividend but are more likely to initiate special dividends. The results suggest that firms facing less tax uncertainty are less likely to make long-term commitments on regular dividend payments but are more likely to take advantage of the last-minute low tax benefits by issuing special dividends. Furthermore, the response to the possible elimination of a tax cut was strongest in firms with high levels of tax-affected ownership, supporting the argument that when facing policy uncertainty, firms behave to prepare for the worst scenarios from the viewpoint of the shareholders, which in this case is a tax increase.
G35|Dividend policy and earnings management across countries|This paper examines whether dividend policy is associated with earnings management and whether the relationship varies across countries with wide-ranging degrees of institutional strength and transparency. Based on a sample of 23,429 corporations from 29 countries, we show that dividend payers manage earnings less than dividend non-payers, and that this evidence is stronger in countries with weak investor protection and high opacity. Further, we find that dividend payers manage earnings less when they issue equity following dividend payments, and that this result is more pronounced in countries with weak institutions and low transparency. Overall, our evidence suggests that firms may employ dividend policies associated with less earnings manipulation to mitigate agency concerns and to establish credible reputation, thereby facilitating access to external funds.
G35|Stock liquidity and dividend payouts|This study investigates the informational effect of stock liquidity on dividend payouts. Using a sample of Chinese listed firms during 2000–2014, we find a positive relation between stock liquidity and dividend payouts. This result is robust to the use of alternative measures of liquidity, and holds after we control for endogeneity concerns. In accord with our hypothesis that stock liquidity provides information and increases insiders' incentive to pay out dividends, we find that the positive relation between stock liquidity and dividend payouts is more pronounced when the information environment is opaque, and when conflict between controlling shareholders and minority investors is severe. Further, market reactions to regulatory stipulations requiring dividend payouts are more favorable for firms with low stock liquidity, suggesting that legal provisions and regulations are substitutes for stock liquidity. Finally, we rule out several alternative explanations concerning the governance of non-controlling blockholders and the alleviation of manager-shareholder agency conflict.
G35|Managerial innovation incentives, management buyouts, and shareholders' intolerance of failure|This study demonstrates that, apart from managerial agency problem, shareholders' intolerance of failure also deteriorates managerial innovation incentives in public firms. Furthermore, management buyouts improve the innovation intensity, even if managers gain no excess value from the buyouts in collaboration with private equity firms. The study provides insights into the interrelation between firms' innovation, corporate governance, and dividend policy. It presents a rationale behind empirical evidence of a positive relationship between management buyouts and innovation intensity. It provides empirical implications on firms' characteristics that facilitate management buyouts and the return and risk structure of private equity firms.
G35|Do what you did four quarters ago: Trends and implications of quarterly dividends|By analyzing the inter-temporal structure of quarterly dividends, we show that as more firms announce dividend increases exactly every four quarters, dividend policy has become more persistent and more predictable. Recently, nearly 60% of all dividend increases have been announced in four-quarter cycles. Valuation, earnings stability, and size are positively related to the propensity to adopt four-quarter cycles. More importantly, we provide evidence that this structure is incorporated into market participants' expectations about future dividend announcements. These findings may provide an explanation for two phenomena described in the literature: the declining information content of dividends and the higher degree of dividend smoothing.
G35|Political freedom and corporate payouts|We study the effect of a country's political freedom status on corporate payouts around the world. In both OLS and two-stage regressions, we find that firms in less free countries pay out more cash, suggesting that low political freedom is associated with a less friendly investment environment. Consistent with this view, we further find that firms reduce payouts when a country's political freedom status improves, while they tend to pay out past excess cash and cut future investment in the face of a deterioration in political freedom. In additional analysis, we also find that firms in less free countries do not pay out cash mainly to ease agency concerns: cash payouts in these countries are more volatile and hence less valuable.
G35|The impact of board gender composition on dividend payouts|This paper investigates whether female independent directors are more likely to impose high dividend payouts. We find evidence that firms with a larger fraction of female directors on their board have greater dividend payouts. This finding is robust to alternative econometric specifications, and alternative measures of dividend payouts and female board representation. The positive effect of board gender composition on dividends remains when we employ propensity score matching, the instrumental variable approach, and difference-in-differences approach to address potential endogeneity concerns. Furthermore, we find that board gender composition significantly increases the dividend payout only for firms with weak governance, suggesting that female directors use dividend payouts as a governance device.
G35|The effect of ownership concentration and composition on dividends: Evidence from Latin America|We analyze a unique data set of publicly traded firms based in six Latin American countries to study the joint effect of ownership concentration and composition on dividend policy. We find that when ownership concentration is high and the largest investor is identified as an individual, firms tend to pay fewer dividends consistent with individual investors extracting benefits from minority shareholders. However, if the largest shareholder is based in a common law country, the dividend paid is significantly higher. Finally, greater ownership by the second largest shareholder decreases firm dividends suggesting the monitoring role of a large shareholder.
G35|The relationship among information asymmetry, dividend policy and ownership structure|This study examines the relationship among information asymmetry, dividend policy and ownership structure for Chinese listed firms from 2003 to 2012. We find that firms with higher information asymmetry are less likely to pay dividends. Further, the sample is divided into state-controlled and non-state-controlled firms, and the results show that state-controlled firms with higher information asymmetry would pay higher dividends compared to non-state-controlled firms. In addition, we find that the split share structure reform enhanced information transparency, leading to a positive moderating effect on the relation between information asymmetry and dividend policy.
G35|Multinational firms and cash holdings: Evidence from China|To adapt to globalization, Chinese multinational firms have more exploitation of cash. This paper shows that Chinese multinational corporations (MNCs) do not hold significantly more cash relative to domestic firms unless these multinationals heavily relay on the foreign sales. In addition, the multinationals of non-State-Owned Enterprises (Non-SOEs) exhibit the insignificant difference in cash holdings for non-multinationals. We also find that Chinese MNCs invest more but are less profitable, especially in non-SOE subsample. Overall, we conclude that the need of cash liquidity of multinational corporations in China is different from those in U.S.
G35|On optimal joint reflective and refractive dividend strategies in spectrally positive Lévy models|The expected present value of dividends is one of the classical stability criteria in actuarial risk theory. In this context, numerous papers considered threshold (refractive) and barrier (reflective) dividend strategies. These were shown to be optimal in a number of different contexts for bounded and unbounded payout rates, respectively.
G35|The diffusion of corporate governance to emerging markets: Evaluating two dimensions of investor heterogeneity|This study investigates whether foreign institutional investors can enhance shareholder value in emerging markets. We pay special attention to two dimensions of investor heterogeneity: whether investors declare themselves to be activists, and whether activists come from countries with strong traditions of investor activism (identified by the incidence of hostile takeovers in their respective home countries). First, using an event study approach with regard to announcements of block purchases by foreign institutional investors in Korea, we find that stock prices increase only when foreign institutional investors declare themselves to be activists (increasing on average by 3% over a 20-day window). Second, we find that positive stock price reactions are more pronounced when the activist investors come from source countries with strong traditions of investor activism (increasing on average by 7% over a 20-day window). Third, we find that target firms are more likely to reduce cash holdings, raise leverage ratios, and peg dividend payouts, stock repurchases, and CEO turnover more closely to changes in earnings, but only if foreign activists come from countries with strong traditions of activism. We address possible selection bias by propensity score matching.
G35|Creditor rights, culture and dividend payout policy|We study how creditor rights and culture interact with one another to influence corporate dividend payout policy. Where creditor rights are strong, creditors accept the status quo, which are large dividends in individualist and small dividends in collectivist traditions, respectively. Culture influences dividend payout where creditor rights are weak. In collectivist countries where group cohesion among corporate stakeholders results in perceived lower agency costs of debt and equity, creditors place few if any restrictions on dividend payout given weak creditor rights. In contrast, in individualist traditions, creditors continue to restrict dividend payouts under weak creditor rights. Our findings emphasize the importance of accounting for the interactions between creditor rights and culture in determining dividend policy.
G35|Dividends and earnings quality: Evidence from China|This paper investigates the association between dividend payouts and earnings quality for Chinese listed firms. The results show that dividend payouts are associated with more persistent earnings, higher accrual quality, and greater earnings informativeness, confirming the hypothesis on information content of dividends for Chinese firms. Further analyses show that the relationship between dividends and earnings could change with factors influencing the incentives to pay dividends. We find that the positive impact of dividend payouts on earnings quality is reduced for firms conducting equity refinancing. We also find evidence that the state ownership can reduce the information-conveying role of dividends.
G35|Reputation and Investor Activism|We show that an activist's reputation is a critical determinant of the success of their campaigns. We model reputation as target managers' belief about the activist's willingness to initiate a proxy fight. Our model indicates reputation, rather than stake size, induces managers to settle without a proxy fight. We present empirical evidence supporting our model's predictions: target companies more-frequently increase payouts, change management or board composition, engage in a merger or acquisition, or otherwise reorganize in response to high reputation activist campaigns, while target actions are not sensitive to the activist's stake size.
G35|The global rise of corporate saving|The sectoral composition of global saving changed dramatically during the last three decades. Whereas in the early 1980s most of global investment was funded by household saving, nowadays nearly two-thirds of global investment is funded by corporate saving. This shift in the sectoral composition of saving was not accompanied by changes in the sectoral composition of investment, implying an improvement in the corporate net lending position. We characterize the behavior of corporate saving using both national income accounts and firm-level data and clarify its relationship with the global decline in labor share, the accumulation of corporate cash stocks, and the greater propensity for equity buybacks. We develop a general equilibrium model with product and capital market imperfections to explore quantitatively the determination of the flow of funds across sectors. Changes including declines in the real interest rate, the price of investment, and corporate income taxes generate increases in corporate profits and shifts in the supply of sectoral saving that are of similar magnitude to those observed in the data.
G35|R&D activity and dividend policy of companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange|For the last several decades, the rules determining dividend policy of companies have been questioned by researchers worldwide. Due to a variety of factors influencing managers’ decisions on dividend payouts, the issue has been named “the dividend puzzle”. The following research focuses on two determinants of dividend policy – research and development activity and government ownership of companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange over the period 1992-2016. We utilize a non-parametric statistical approach to financial data obtained from 296 companies to verify how both factors influence the dividend policy of companies. We find that both, R&D activity and government ownership, have an adverse impact on dividend payouts. The first section of the paper presents the literature review and research hypotheses. The second section presents utilized methods and the data sample. Section three shows obtained results, and finally, the last section concludes.
G35|Factors Affecting Dividend Policy on Non-Financial Companies in Indonesia|"""Objective – The objective of this study is to obtain empirical evidence and analyse the factors that affect the dividend policy of non-financial firms listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange. The factors studied include liquidity, leverage, growth, price/earnings, size, earnings per share, price to book ratio, ownership, age of the firm, floating rate, profitability, and free cash flow. Methodology/Technique – The sampling method used in this study is purposive sampling, in which the samples are taken based on suitable characteristics of the population to generate representative samples. The total number of samples in this study are 105 non-financial firms listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange between 2011 and 2015. The hypothesis is tested by using multiple regression analysis. Findings – The results of this study show that earnings per share, price to book ratio, and floating rate affect the dividends policy while liquidity, leverage, growth, price/earnings, size, ownership, age of the firm, profitability, and free cash flow has no effect on dividend policy. Novelty – The study findings contribute the companies to establish an appropriate dividend policy to satisfy the interest of both parties that is companies future growth and its investors."""
G35|Determinant of Debt Policy: Empirical Evidence from Indonesia|"""Objective – The objective of this study is to observe the effects of managerial ownership, institutional ownership, dividend policy, firm growth, business risk, liquidity, and profitability on debt policy. Methodology/Technique – Using the purposive sampling method, secondary data were retrieved from 16 firms that fulfil the criteria of this study. Analysis was made through the multiple regression method. Findings – The results of this research indicate that: (1) managerial ownership has a significantly negative effect on debt policy, (2) institutional ownership has no positive effect on debt policy, (3) dividend policy has no negative effect on debt policy, (4) firm growth has no positive effect on debt policy, (5) business risk has a significantly positive effect on debt policy, (6) liquidity policy has a significantly negative effect on debt policy, (7) profitability has no negative effect on debt policy, (8) managerial ownership, institutional ownership, dividend policy, firm growth, business risk, liquidity, and profitability, simultaneously, have a significant effect on debt policy. Novelty – This study implies that all the independent variables are related to debt policy, simultaneously. This shows that the regression model has an appropriate fit in estimating the accrual value of the model."""
G35|Does dividend tax impede competition for corporate charters?|We develop a model of jurisdictional competition for corporate charters among the states in which a firm’s agency cost depends on the federal dividend income tax rate and the takeover regulations of its domicile state. When firms are mobile across states, the federal dividend income tax rate affects both the intensity of competition among the states and the equilibrium level of state takeover regulations. Our model shows that increasing dividend tax rate weakens the competition for corporate charters under a condition: dividend-paying and the market for corporate control are complementary corporate governance mechanisms. This condition holds empirically, suggesting that dividend tax not only discourages firms from paying dividends but also weakens their corporate governance by disincentivizing states to improve their corporate laws.
G35|Does the Catering Theory of Dividend Apply to the French Listed Firms?|This paper tests the catering theory of dividend in the French market. It investigates how prevailing investor’s demand for dividend payers proxied by the dividend premia affects the dividend policy. The dividend premia are measured at the market level and at the firm level. We find that the market demand for dividends measured by dividend premia affects the decision to start, to continue or to omit to pay dividends and the decision to increase the dividends. However, catering theory does not seem to affect the magnitude of the dividend changes since most results are not significant.
G35|Share Repurchases and CEO Ownership|When a firm repurchases shares, does the equity stake of its CEO change? To answer this question, we study a sample of 1200 publicly-traded US firms between 2006 and 2014. Because of the distribution of CEO ownership, we employ a multinomial logit model. We address the potential endogeneity of share repurchases in the model with a control-function approach. The analysis suggests that CEOs tend not to change their equity holdings in a share repurchase, but that the decrease in shares outstanding increases the fraction of the firm that they own. This, in turn, is likely to influence the firm’s decision-making and efficiency. Market undervaluation does not appear to induce the CEO to buy shares herself, but there is evidence that it does induce the firm to repurchase more shares.
G35|The impact of nominal stock price on ex-dividend price responses|Abstract In this paper, we examine whether nominal stock price can help to explain the ex-dividend day anomaly where stock prices drop by less than the dividend amount on the ex-dividend date. We find that stocks with lower nominal prices have ex-dividend day price drops that are more consistent with theoretical predictions based on an efficient market. After controlling for factors that have been previously documented to influence ex-dividend day stock price behavior, price-drop-to-dividend ratios are closer to one for lower priced stocks. To further explore this phenomenon, we examine the change in the price-drop-to-dividend ratio around stock splits. Firms that split their shares have a larger price-drop-to-dividend ratio after the split, and companies that reverse split their shares have a smaller price-drop-to-dividend ratio after the split. Our evidence indicates that ex-dividend day stock price behavior is influenced by the nominal price of a share and that this relation could also influence the decision to split a firm’s shares.
G35|Price Risk, Production Flexibility, and Liquidity Management: Evidence from Electricity Generating Firms|Production inflexibility together with product price uncertainty creates price risk, which is a potentially important factor for firms’ liquidity management. One industry for which price risk can be measured is the electricity producing industry. We use data on hourly electricity prices in 41 markets to measure fluctuations in output prices and information on over 60,000 power plants to approximate firms’ flexibilty to vary output quantities. Our results suggest that higher electricity price volatility leads to increased cash holdings, but only in firms using inflexible production technologies. This effect is robust to a number of specification choices including instrumenting for volatility in electricity prices using weather forecast data. After deregulation, firms hold 20-25% more cash, suggesting that the process of deregulation increases the risk firms’ face. Price risk affects cash holdings most in financially constrained firms, and in firms that cannot easily hedge the electricity price through derivative markets. Capital market liquidity and balance sheet liquidity appear to be substitutes for one another.
G35|Understanding the Rise in Corporate Cash: Precautionary Savings or Foreign Taxes|What has driven the dramatic rise in U.S. corporate cash? Using non-public data, we show that the run-up is not uniform across firms but is concentrated in the foreign subsidiaries of multinational firms. Standard precautionary motives explain only domestic cash holdings, not these burgeoning foreign cash balances. Falling foreign tax rates, coupled with relaxed restrictions on income shifting, are the root of the changing foreign cash patterns. Firms with intellectual property have the greatest ability to shift income to low tax jurisdictions, and their foreign subsidiaries are where we observe the largest accumulations of cash.
G35|Determinants of Payout Policy and Investment Attractiveness of Companies Listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange|Making decisions concerning the payout policy depends on many diversified neoclassical and behavioral determinants. Although these factors are well-described in the literature, there is still a research gap concerning the lack of a comprehensive impact model of payout policy determinants on the investment attractiveness of shares. The aim of this paper is to present the diverse nature of relationships between different forms of cash transfer to the shareholders and investments attractiveness of public companies in the context of determinants of payout policy. The possibility to achieve this objective was conditioned by empirical verification of research hypothesis stating that the diversify of payout forms is accompanied by the different determinants of payout policy which condition an effective investment of stock investors capital. The empirical research was conducted on the electromechanical companies which were listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in years 2006-2015. The data for analysis were mainly collected from database Notoria Service SA and Stock Exchange Yearbooks. The calculations were carried out using the methodology of taxonomic measure of investment attractiveness, as well as dividend premium and share repurchase premium. The final conclusion of our research is that the companies conducting the payout policy in different forms of cash transfer differ in terms of many characteristics, such as: financial standing, market value, ownership structure, company’s size and age. Moreover, their investment attractiveness differs according to regularity of payment, stock exchange situation and shareholders preferences. The value added of this paper is a new approach to the evaluation of capital investment with a special emphasis on the determinants of payout policy.
G35|Politique de distribution de dividendes des sociétés cotées sur les marchés en développement : Cas de la BRVM<BR>[Dividend policy of companies listed in developing financial markets: Case study of the BRVM]|This study was initiated to identify the stylized facts of the dividend policy of companies listed at the BRVM. To achieve this, data on the annual results and dividends distributed over the period 2011-2016 were mobilized. These were analyzed using descriptive statistic and econometric techniques. From this analysis, we can conclude that the decision to pay a dividend is influenced by the amount and the change in operating income, the previous period’s dividend amount. it is very resilient. On average, 71% of companies choose this option each year and pay on average a dividend of 5,87 € for each share issued and with an average return between 6.22% and 7%. This dividend is growing at around 5% per annum. These results provide an answer to the readability of the dividend policy in a developing financial market such as BRVM. They question the validity of the models developed in the context of advanced markets and tested in the specific case of the WAEMU zone, a developing economy.
G35|Average pay in banks: do agency problems and bank performance matter?|Abstract We study the determinants of average pay across all levels of staff seniority for UK banks between 2003 and 2012. We show that pay is affected by agency problems but not by bank operating performance. Average pay does not depend on accounting outcomes at the bank level. By contrast, average pay is positively affected by the presence of a Remuneration Committee and the proportion of Non-Executives on the Board. These findings contribute to the existing literature in two ways. First, this is the first empirical study to directly compare the relative explanatory power of two theories of the determinants of bank pay (governance structures and bank performance). By finding empirical support for one theory but not the other, we identify dysfunctions in the determination of pay in banks. Second, our study considers a broader set of bank employees than any earlier research in this field, allowing us to identify more general patterns. Our results have practical implications for bank shareholders and regulators, suggesting the need for greater transparency in governance of bank pay.
G35|Unemployment Risk and Payout Policies|This paper argues that workers’ unemployment risk may induce firms to adopt conservative payout policies. I show that firms increase their dividend payout following sharp increases in unemployment insurance generosity, that reduce workers’ personal losses due to layoffs. Firms increase payout by about 6% following positive changes in protection for unemployed workers that are plausibly unrelated to macroeconomic conditions. This effect is driven by firms with poor growth prospects, high labor intensity, and in more volatile industries, suggesting that public insurance crowds out private insurance by firms. Thus, labor market considerations play an important role in shaping firms’ payout decisions.
G35|"A Panel Analysis of the Impact of Dividend per Share, Dividend Changes and Dividend Payout Ratio on Companies Performance: An Empirical Test of ``the Dividend Signaling Hypothesis"""|The goal of this paper is to examine the dividend behaviour, as well as to test the dividend signalling hypothesis among South African companies listed on the JSE. The signalling hypothesis predicts that changes in dividend pay-out act as signals of the future performance of the company. To test this, the relation between dividend per share, dividend changes and dividend pay-out ratio with earnings per share and future changes in earnings growth was examined. Panel data estimation techniques are applied to a sample of 31 listed companies on the JSE over the time period 1990-2015. The results of the analysis provide consistent support for the predictions of the dividend signalling hypothesis. The analysis under pay-out and earnings growth suggest that the pay-out ratio is positively and significantly related to the expected future earnings growth for the individual companies listed on the Johannesburg securities exchange. The dividend per share and the change in dividend per share are also positively and significantly related to earnings per share and future earnings growth respectively.
G35|Long-Term Stagnation And Financialisation. A Theoretical Comparison Between Kaleckian And Neo-Marxist Approaches|Subsequent to the financial crisis of 2007-2008 there has been a revival of theories on the possibility of a “secular stagnation”. Some of these theories hark back to Alvin Hansen’s doctrine, developed on Keynesian bases. Nevertheless, they have shifted attention toward a disproportion between saving and investment only explained on the basis of demographic and technological factors, typical of a neoclassical framework of growth theory. However, the idea that neo-capitalist economies have an inherent tendency to stagnation has also long been the main research objective of many heterodox economists, in particular Kaleckian and neo-Marxist, who found stagnation to be a major result of the monopolistic nature of big corporations and the features of their monopolistic forms of competition. The paper deals with some of these theories and focuses on the role that corporate governance in big corporations can play in producing growing corporate savings and putting them into financial channels.
G35|Effect Of Repurchase Announcement On The Polish Alternative Stock Market|In recent years open-market share repurchase programs have become an important payout policy not only for U.S. firms, but also European. Vast literature has examined the effect of share repurchase announcement on developed countries, especially the U.S. Relatively little research has yet been published examining the emerging markets reaction on share repurchase programs. This study attempts to extend the knowledge with the information content of buy back announcements in Poland. The main aim of the study is to test the informational con-tent of share repurchase announcements on the Polish alternative stock market us-ing event study methodology. Our sample was formed by identifying share repur-chase announcements reported by companies listed on the NewConnect Stock Ex-change over the period 2007-2016. Due to the results of prior studies which give support for positive market reaction on share repurchase announcements (i.a. Ikenberry, Lakonishok and Vermaelen, 1995; Grullon and Michaely, 2002; Chan, Ikenberry, Lee, Wang, 2010) we hypothesize that firms announcing share repurchases on NewConnect experience positive valuation effects.
G35|Corporate Responses to the Repatriation Incentives and Domestic Production Activities Deduction|The 2004 American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA or the Act) sought to encourage U.S. companies to repatriate foreign earnings and invest them domestically in an effort to increase capital spending and employment. This investigation looks at how the two tax provisions in AJCA, i.e., the repatriation tax holiday and the domestic production activities deduction (DPAD), affected domestic investment and payout behaviors. An examination of repatriating firms based on the tightness of their capital constraints shows that the tax incentives fail to induce non-constrained, repatriating firms that benefit from DPAD to reinvest the capital domestically. Only capital-constrained, repatriating firms benefitting from DPAD increase domestic investment and reduce share repurchases; however, these firms also increase their cash dividend payments. The findings should be useful to policymakers as they consider modifying the corporate tax structure to increase domestic investment by encouraging U.S. firms to repatriate foreign earnings and reinvest them domestically.
G35|Towards neutral distribution taxes and vanishing tax effects in the European Union|The European Union (EU) has no explicit common income tax law. Nevertheless, Court of Justice decisions have driven EU member states to adopt more similar corporate tax systems, and thus, to align the tax treatment of corporate profit distributions - dividends and capital gains. This paper empirically analyzes the influence of the tax preferences of individual and corporate shareholders for the two corporate distribution types - dividends or capital gains - from 1990 to 2012. In the first years of the observation period, European tax systems have provided opposing tax advantages, where individual shareholders have preferred capital gains and corporate shareholders have preferred dividends. To account for these differences depending on the firm's shareholder structure, we derive firm-specific tax preferences for profit distributions. Our empirical analysis reveals that - in line with current literature - the firm-specific tax preferences indeed affect dividend payments. Moreover, we show that in contrast to our detailed study, a simplified approach to measure tax effects on distributions overestimates this influence. In subsequent years, as European Court of Justice decisions have indirectly aligned EU corporate tax systems, we find that tax preferences have converged to a great extent with the tendency to equal tax treatment of dividends and capital gains for both - individual and corporate - shareholder groups. In line with this development, we find that the association of tax preferences and distribution policies vanishes in the last years of the observation period. Our study implies that the EU common regulatory framework, even in the absence of explicit law, can affect corporate distribution decisions and foster neutral taxation of dividends and capital gains across EU member states.
G35|Results and financial situation of firms in 2015|The article looks at the financial situation of non-financial corporations in Belgium over the period from 1 january to 31 December 2015. After briefly describing the methodology and the population studied, it presents an extrapolation of the main operating result items for 2015, with a sectoral, regional and size breakdown. The article then assesses the financial situation of companies as regards profitability, solvency, dividend payout policy as well as credit risk.
G35|Levered Returns|Do financial markets properly reflect leverage? Unlike Gomes and Schmid (2010) who examine this question with a structural approach (using long-term monthly stock characteristics), my paper examines it with a quasi-experimental approach (using short-term a discrete event). After a firm has declared a dividend (i.e., after the news release), but in the few days that precede the payment date, an investor in the traded equity owns a claim to the dividend cash plus the remaining firm equity within the corporate shell. After the payment date, the shell contains only the dividend-sans-cash firm equity. The empirical evidence confirms rational increases in volatilities but shows unexpected decreases in average returns. The best explanation is behavioral.
G35|Corporate Deleveraging|Proactive deleveraging from all-time peak market leverage (ML) to near-zero ML and negative net debt is the norm among 4,476 nonfinancial firms with five or more years of post-peak data. ML is 0.543 at the historical peak and 0.026 at the later trough for the median firm in this sample, with a six-year median time from peak to trough. These deleveraging episodes are largely proactive, with debt repayment and earnings retention accounting for 93.7% of the peak-to-trough decline in ML for the median firm. Attenuated deleveraging, with ML staying well above zero, is the norm at 3,118 firms that are delisted due to financial distress within four years of peak. Leverage is path dependent, with the key to explaining whether ML is high or low at the post-peak trough being how high it was at the peak and prior trough and whether the firm has had only a short time to deleverage, e.g., due to distress-related delisting. The findings are consistent with proactive deleveraging to avoid distress and to restore financial flexibility, and are hard to reconcile with materially positive target leverage ratios.
G35|Why Does Capital No Longer Flow More to the Industries with the Best Growth Opportunities?|With functionally efficient capital markets, we expect capital to flow more to the industries with the best growth opportunities. As a result, these industries should invest more and see their assets grow more relative to industries with the worst growth opportunities. We find that industries that receive more funds have a higher industry Tobin’s q until the mid-1990s, but not since then. Since industries with a higher funding rate grow more, there is a negative correlation not only between an industry’s funding rate and industry q but also between capital expenditures and industry q since the mid-1990s. We show that capital no longer flows more to the industries with the best growth opportunities because, since the middle of the 1990s, firms in high q industries increasingly repurchase shares rather than raise more funding from the capital markets.
G35|Theoretical Models of Dividend Policy|Why do modern corporations pay dividends and how does dividend policy affect company’s performance remain controversial theoretical questions in both developed and emerging markets. This paper aims to describe concepts and empirical evidence about three of the most widely discussed theories: namely the theory of the dividend payment preference, the theory of irrelevance, and the theory of tax benefits from profit reinvestment. This is a preliminary stage of a study of the dividend policy of publicly traded companies in Bulgaria. By using these theories the future research of data will be based on the achievements of world science and the applied models will be comparable with the results obtained in other countries.
G35|Dividends as Reference Points: A Behavioral Signaling Approach|We outline a dividend signaling model that features investors who are averse to dividend cuts. Managers with strong unobservable cash earnings pay high dividends but retain enough to be likely not to fall short next period. The model is consistent with a Lintner partial-adjustment model, modal dividend changes of zero, stronger market reactions to dividend cuts than increases, comparatively infrequent and irregular repurchases, and a mechanism that does not depend on public destruction of value, which managers reject in surveys. New tests involve stronger reactions to changes from longer-maintained dividend levels and reference point currencies of American Depository Receipt dividends.

G35|The investment-profit nexus in an era of financialisation and globalisation. A profit-centred perspective|During the past decades, the link between profits and domestic investment has weakened in the biggest high-income economies. The present contribution explores this relaxation of the profits-investment nexus through a profit-centred perspective. Focusing on the impact of the origins and uses of profits, we study the investment behaviour of non-financial corporations in relation to their profits at the macro level since 1980, a period marked by financialisation and globalisation. We contrast three competing hypotheses – the Revenge of the Rentiers, the Financial Turn of Accumulation and Globalisation – and test them through a macro panel data analysis for France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States over the period 1980-2012.
G35|Are banks’ below-par own debt repurchases a cause for prudential concern?|In the lead-up to the implementation of Basel III, European banks bought back debt securities that traded at a discount. Banks engaged in these Liability Management Exercises (LMEs) to realize a fair value gain that the accounting and prudential rules exclude from regulatory capital calculations, this to safeguard the safety and soundness of the banking system. For a sample of 720 European LMEs conducted from April 2009 to December 2013, I show that banks lost about 9.3 billion euros in premiums to compensate investors for parting from their debt securities. This amount would have been recognized as Core Tier 1 regulatory capital, if regulation would accept the recognition of fair value gains on debt. The premiums paid are particularly high for the most loss absorbing capital securities. More importantly, the premiums increase with leverage and in times of stress, right when conserving cash is paramount to preserve the safety and soundness of the banking system. These results weaken the case of the exclusion from regulatory capital of unrealized gains that originate from a weakened own credit standing.
G35|Capital depreciation and the underdetermination of rate of return: A unifying perspective|This paper shows that the notion of rate of return is best understood through the lens of the average-internal-rate-of-return (AIRR) model, first introduced in Magni (2010a). It is an NPV-consistent approach based on a coherent definition of rate of return and on the notion of Chisini mean, it is capable of solving the conundrums originated by the rate-of-return notion and represents a unifying theoretical paradigm under which every existing measure of wealth creation can be subsumed. We show that a rate of return is underdetermined by the project’s cash-flow stream; in particular, a unique return function (not a unique rate of return) exists for every project which maps depreciation classes into rates of return. The various shapes a rate of return can take on (internal rate of return, average accounting rate of return, modified internal rate of return, etc.) derive from the (implicit or explicit) selection of different depreciation patterns. To single out the appropriate rate of return for a project, auxiliary assumptions are needed regarding the project’s capital depreciation. This involves value judgment. On one side, this finding opens terrain for a capital valuation theory yet to be developed; on the other side, it triggers the creation of a toolkit of domain-specific and purpose-specific metrics that can be used, jointly or in isolation, for analyzing the economic profitability of a given project. We also show that the AIRR perspective has a high explanatory power that enables connecting seemingly unrelated notions and linking various disciplines such as economics, finance, and accounting. Some guidelines for practitioners are also provided.
G35|Market Reaction to Actual Daily Share Repurchases in Greece|The stock market reaction around the announcement date of actual share repurchases, the factors that affect the size of that reaction, and the motives behind share acquisitions are examined. A unique, hand-collected dataset is used, including public announcements of companies traded on the Athens Stock Exchange. Consistent with the price support hypothesis, companies repurchase when their share price exhibits a declining trend, whereas the short-term market reaction is not statistically significant. Large firms and firms with low book-to-market ratio repurchase when their stock has underperformed the market. Small firms and firms with high book-to-market ratio repurchase even though their shares have not experienced abnormal declines. The market reacts more favorably to buybacks by small firms and firms with high book-to-market ratio. Long-term abnormal returns are higher for repurchasing firms compared to non-repurchasing controls, and depend positively on the frequency of repurchases and the stated reason for program authorization.
G35|Market Reaction to Stock Repurchases in Greece|This paper examines open market stock repurchases by Greek firms, using a unique dataset covering the period 2000-2010. Positive and statistically significant cumulative average abnormal returns are observed around the date of repurchase program authorizations. Investors react more to authorizations of initial programs than to subsequent programs. After the implementation of the EU Market Abuse Directive in Greece, investors react more favorably to buyback announcements. The reason for initiating a repurchase program, as stated by the companies, is directly related to the market valuation of the program. The paper identifies the characteristics of firms that announce dividend changes, given the decision to initiate a stock buyback. The regression results appear to support the hypothesis of signaling undervaluation.
G35|Financialisation of wages and works councils’ policy: Profit sharing in the German metalworking and electrical engineering industries|Profit sharing wages are of growing importance in Germany. They are indicating a nascent trend of financialisation of wages. However, little is known about the regulation of profit sharing wages especially on plant level and the way they affect the policies of works councils. Plant level wage policy is a subject of codetermination according to the German Works Constitutions Act, and wage policy has always been one of the most crucial topics of works councils’ activities. What is the role works councils play regarding the negotiation and regulation of profit sharing wages? What is the collective interest they define and pursue in this respect? And what are the effects of wage financialisation on the legitimacy of works councils? These questions are analysed with respect to the development of profit sharing wages in the German metalworking industry. Based on a variety of research methods, our analysis shows that profit sharing wages are a source of legitimacy for the works councils. In many cases the works councils, usually regarded as victims of financialisation, are actively striving for the financialisation of wages in their companies. However, they have to cope with the problem that profit sharing nowadays is based on a redistribution of income between capital and labour, between firms and between different categories of employees.
G35|Dividend Taxation of Non-listed Companies, Resource Allocation and Productivity|Abstract We consider the taxation of non-listed companies and their owners in Finland. We analyse how the current highly non-linear dividend taxation influences the allocation of labour and capital across different firms, average labour productivity and the equilibrium wage level. To this end, we use a general equilibrium model of firm investment where firms may have different production technologies. We find that the current tax system is likely to distort resource allocation compared to linear dividend taxation. This works to lower the average labour productivity as well as the general wage level.
G35|Connections Between Corporate Governanc E, Corporate Savings And Business Cycles In The Economic Literature Around The Great Depression|Corporate savings , which could play a major role in producing financial crises , receive scant analytic attention today . By contrast, they saw a glorious period of analysis from the late 1920s to the early 1950s, around the Great Depression. D uring the twenties the corpora tions were accused of contributing to the stock exchange boom by lending out part of their cash balances . In the thirties they were accused of contributing to the stagnation of the economic system by holding excess cash balances. Two different approaches d istinguished the study of retained earnings in the forties and fifties. One approached this phenomenon in connection with investigation into cyclical fluctuations in the economy, while the other analysed the relationship between the rights and interests of the stockholders and those of the management in individual enterprises. The paper deals with some of these seminal contributions, including those by Sergei P. Dobrovolsky and Friedrich A. Lutz
G35|Agency costs, executive incentives and corporate financial decisions|This paper investigates the roles of executive incentive structures in creating and mitigating investment-related agency costs. A model is developed which shows that underinvestment and overpayment of dividends are always expected to prevail when managers are offered short-term incentives, while overinvestment and underpayment of dividends are likely to exist when managers are offered long-term incentives. Using a large sample of non-financial US-listed firms over the period 1992â€“2009, it is found that managers underinvest and overpay dividends when offered vested stocks, but overinvest and underpay dividends when offered option incentives. An increase in these incentives, however, mitigates these problems. The results also suggest that, if properly constructed, long-term incentives might be superior to short-term incentives, and should be used alone in designing the optimal incentive package under certain conditions.
G35|Financial constraints and dividend policy|Using a sample of US listed firms over the 1989â€“2012 period, we find that financially constrained dividend-increasing firms experience superior short-run abnormal stock returns, but suffer worse operating performance compared to similar unconstrained firms. More specifically, constrained firms in more competitive industries realize poorer long-run and operating performance. Likewise, constrained firms that increase dividends during the financial crisis also deliver inferior post-dividend-increase long-run return than do unconstrained firms. We also find evidence that constrained firms show worse stock market reaction to new equity issue announcements following dividend increase, but display a positive market response if they potentially have high investment growth opportunities. Our results are robust to alternative financial constraint proxies and abnormal return measures.
G35|Why do firms pay stock dividends: Is it just a stock split?|This paper examines why firms choose to pay stock dividends. Using a sample of listed Chinese firms we find that older, more profitable firms with lower leverage, higher levels of retained earnings, private ownership prior to listing, that invest more in fixed assets and operate in regions with lower shareholder protection are more likely to pay stock dividends. Consistent with stock dividends substituting for stock splits, our evidence indicates that the initiation of a stock dividend is associated with a significant positive market reaction and increased analyst following. These results suggest that firms use stock dividends to attract analystsâ€™ attention. In addition, the positive announcement effect for stock dividends increases with the size of the split factor, suggesting that management use stock dividends to keep the firmâ€™s stock price within its acceptable trading range.
G35|A contemporary view of corporate finance theory, empirical evidence and practice|This article uses a survey of Australian corporate treasurers to shed light on the gap between the theory and practice of corporate finance in Australia. Seven areas are examined: capital structure, payout policy, cash holdings, initial public offerings, seasoned equity offering, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate governance. We also exploit the global financial crisis (GFC) to examine the effect of liquidity shocks on a firmâ€™s capital structure choices. We then compare our Australian survey results with results from a comprehensive US survey conducted by Graham and Harvey. Our survey shows that the board of directors plays the most important role in determining capital structure decisions and that corporate treasurers play the most important role in cash holding decisions. This contrasts with the academic literature that has typically focused on the role of chief executive officer (CEO) in both capital structure and cash holding decisions. In addition, our respondents do not view the tax advantage of interest deductibility to be of first order of importance for debt issuance choices, which contrasts with most of the US empirical studies. Finally, we juxtapose the theoryâ€“practice perspective, with a review of the most recent 5â€‰years (2011â€“2015) of corporate finance research published in the leading Asia Pacific Basin finance journals.
G35|The influence of the CEO and the largest shareholder on dividend payout policy in Thailand|In a setting of weak law enforcement and low investor protection, minority shareholders may find it difficult to extract cash from a company. This paper examines whether or not the CEO and the largest shareholder affect dividend decisions. Using a sample of Thai firms, I find that the CEO tenure and the ownership of the largest shareholder increase the likelihood of a dividend payout. As a result of high commitment and incentives, CEOs and the largest shareholder use dividend payments as a mechanism to mitigate free cash flow problems and reduce potential expropriation of minority shareholders. In addition, the possibility of a dividend payout decreases if firms are controlled by domestic financial institutions. Domestic financial institutions seem to play a significant role in monitoring management teams; consequently, the need for a dividend payment in alleviating agency costs is lower than other firms. Moreover, firms are more likely to pay dividends when they have higher profitability and a lower leverage ratio.
G35|Liquidity management with decreasing returns to scale and secured credit line|Abstract This paper examines the dividend and investment policies of a cash constrained firm, assuming a decreasing-returns-to-scale technology and adjustment costs. We extend the literature by allowing the firm to draw on a secured credit line both to hedge against cash-flow shortfalls and to invest/disinvest in a productive asset. We formulate this problem as a two-dimensional singular control problem and use both a viscosity solution approach and a verification technique to get qualitative properties of the value function. We further solve quasi-explicitly the control problem in two special cases.
G35|The Mismeasure of Mammon: Uses and Abuses of Executive Pay Data|On April 7, 2016, the Wall Street Journal ran an article headlined â€œCEO pay shrank most since financial crisis,â€ while on May 27, 2016, a similar New York Times story declared â€œTop CEO pay fell â€“ yes, fell â€“ in 2015.â€ Unfortunately, both the Journal and the Times mismeasured the actual take-home pay of each and every one of these CEOs in 2014 and 2015. The reason for this mismeasure is that both articles relied on â€œfair valueâ€ estimates of the stock-based pay of these CEOs as reported in the Summary Compensation Table of the definitive proxy statement (Form DEF 14A) that each publicly listed company files annually with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Yet the very same proxy statements also report the actual realized gains of these CEOs in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested Table. It is the realized gains on stock-based pay, not fair-value estimates, that enter into the total compensation that a CEO actually takes home and reports as income in his or her income-tax return. Moreover, including actual realized gains instead of estimated fair value of stockâ€“ based pay in the measure of total executive compensation can make a big difference. In 2014 average total compensation of the 500 highest-paid executives named on corporate proxy statements based on actual realized gains was $34.3 million, with 81 percent coming from stock-based pay. But average total compensation of the 500 highest paid based on estimated fair value was $19.3 million, with 62 percent attributable to stock- based pay. The excess of total actual realized-gains compensation over total estimated fair-value compensation was greatest in those years when the stock market was booming. Why would the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times report estimates of executive pay when they could be reporting the CEOsâ€™ actual pay? In this paper, we answer this question by explaining the origins of the â€œfair valueâ€ estimates of stock-based pay and how the obsession with these estimates by the SEC, relying on the business-run Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), has relegated to statistical obscurity executivesâ€™ readily available, accurate, and actual realized gains from stock-based pay. We use Standard & Poorâ€™s ExecuComp database to document that a) stock-based pay, in the forms of realized gains from stock options and stock awards, dominates both the size of and the changes over time in the total compensation of the highest-paid senior executives; and b) the fair-value estimates of stock-based pay tend to understate, often substantially, the realized gains from stock-based pay that these executives actually receive. An irony is that even critics of excessive executive pay, most notably the AFL-CIO on its Executive Paywatch website, use the fair-value estimates when the actual CEO compensation numbers would reveal a much larger ratio of CEO pay to the earnings of the average worker. Indeed, as we discuss in the conclusion to this paper, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, this mismeasure of executive pay has become institutionalized in U.S. government policy in the SECâ€™s Pay Ratio Disclosure Rule, which beginning in 2017 requires every company to publish the ratio of CEO to median-worker pay. Under this rule, the SEC requires companies to use the fair-value measure of CEO pay. The Pay Ratio Disclosure Rule is supposed to provide the public with a company-level indicator of income inequality. Instead it will tend to underestimate inequality, substituting fictitious estimates for actual known amounts of income that CEOs put into their bank accounts and declare in their income-tax returns.
G35|Numerical approximation of a cash-constrained firm value with investment opportunities|We consider a singular control problem with regime switching that arises in problems of optimal investment decisions of cash-constrained firms. The value function is proved to be the unique viscosity solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Moreover, we give regularity properties of the value function as well as a description of the shape of the control regions. Based on these theoretical results, a numerical deterministic approximation of the related HJB variational inequality is provided. We finally show that this numerical approximation converges to the value function. This allows us to describe the investment and dividend optimal policies.
G35|The payout behaviour of German savings banks|Our analysis finds that despite the growing number, the majority of savings banks currently do not make any payouts. Furthermore, savings banks distribute only a small part of their net profit to the shareholders. This means that they can still build up capital even if they make payouts. Savings banks also hold significantly more capital than is called for by the regulatory framework. Finally, the regression analysis shows that savings banks that have less capital distribute profits to their shareholders considerably less frequently. This correlation has intensified since 2009, even though the Savings Banks Acts (Sparkassengesetze) were relaxed in individual federal states. All in all, our results therefore indicate that payouts do not currently pose a threat to the capital adequacy of most savings banks.
G35|On the Timing and Pricing of Dividends: Comment|"I present novel empirical evidence on the term structure of the equity risk premium. In contrast to previous research that documented high discount rates for the short-term component of the market portfolio, I show evidence for an unconditionally flat term structure of equity risk premia. The tension with previous literature arises largely as a result of differential treatments of heterogeneous investment taxes, manifested in micro evidence on abnormal equity returns on ex-dividend days, and liquidity. The results not only help resolve an important recent ""puzzle"" but provide further important insights on the role of investment taxes in asset pricing."
G35|On the Timing and Pricing of Dividends: Reply|Schulz (2016) replicates the findings of van Binsbergen, Brandt, and Koijen (2012)--henceforth, BBK--and agrees that the average pretax returns on short-term dividend strips are higher than those of the index, but argues that the after-tax returns are not. He thus provides a possible economic interpretation of the results in BBK: taxes. Schulz (2016) estimates the differential tax rates of dividends versus capital gains from ex-dividend day returns. We show that these estimated tax rates are suspect and imprecisely measured, peaking at over 100 percent in some periods. The results in BBK are robust to using tax rates from the literature (Sialm 2009). The arguments in Schulz (2016) thus crucially depend on implausibly large tax estimates. We further discuss two other financial market imperfections discussed in the literature and show that they are also unlikely to explain the results in BBK.
G35|Sticky Leverage|We develop a tractable general equilibrium model that captures the interplay between nominal long-term corporate debt, inflation, and real aggregates. We show that unanticipated inflation changes the real burden of debt and, more significantly, leads to a debt overhang that distorts future investment and production decisions. For these effects to be both large and very persistent, it is essential that debt maturity exceeds one period. We also show that interest rate rules can help stabilize our economy.
G35|Study on the Stock Market Evolution of Companies Listed on Bucharest Stock Exchange|The present study pursues highlighting the perspective of the Romanian stock market on the value of listed companies during a period fully marked by the presence of the global financial crisis. To this purpose I have analyzed 36 companies listed on Bucharest Stock Exchange for a reference period of 5 years, i.e. 2009-2013. The study aimed to determine the level of the most relevant stock exchange indicators, respectively, the Price to Earnings Ratio, Price to Book Value and Dividend Yield and their evolutionary analysis, including by comparison with the average levels of the activity sectors that the companies which form the structure of the sample belong to.
G35|An Integrated Model for the Cost-Minimizing Funding of Corporate Activities over Time|To enhance the value of a firm, the firm¡¯s management must attempt to minimize the total discounted cost of financing over a planning horizon. Unfortunately, the variety of sources of funds and the constraints that may be imposed on accessing funds from any one source make this exercise a difficult task. The model presented and illustrated here accomplishes this task considering issuing new equity and new bonds, refunding the bonds, borrowing short-term from financial institutions, temporarily parking surplus funds in short-term securities, repurchasing its stock, and retaining part or all of a firm¡¯s earnings. The proportions of these sources of funds are determined subject to their associated costs and various constraints such as not exceeding a specific debt/equity ratio and following a stable dividend policy, among others.
G35|Bank Capital and Dividend Externalities|Dividend payouts erode equity capital and affect the relative value of claims on a bank. Through this channel, when banks have contingent claims on each other, one bank’s capital policy affects the equity value and risk of default for other banks. When such externalities are strong, bank capital becomes a public good, whereby the private equilibrium features excessive dividends and inefficient recapitalization relative to the efficient policy that maximizes total banking sector equity. We relate these implications to the observed bank behaviour during the crisis of 2007–2009.
G35|Dividend Policy In Regulated Network Industries: Evidence From The Eu|" type=""main"" xml:id=""ecin12238-abs-0001""> We study the dividend policy of firms in regulated network industries, focusing on the impact of different regulatory regimes and government control. We link payout and smoothing decisions to different regulatory mechanisms (cost-based vs. incentive regulation) and state versus private ownership. We test our predictions on a panel of listed European electric utilities, accounting for potential endogeneity of the choice of regulatory and ownership patterns. We find that incentive-regulated firms smooth their dividends less than cost-based regulated firms and that they report higher target payout ratios. Consistent with the interest group theory of regulation, we find that incentive regulation schemes are less likely when the state is still an important shareholder in the sector. Additionally, our results show that government control undermines the efficiency-enhancing effects of incentive regulation on dividend policy, for example, lower smoothing is only due to private firms.

G35|Corporate Governance Of Banks: A Survey|This paper reviews the empirical literature on the corporate governance of banks. We start by highlighting the main differences between banks and non-financial firms and focus on three characteristics which make banks special: (i) regulation, (ii) the capital structure of banks, and (iii) the complexity and opacity of their business and structure. Next, we discuss the characteristics of corporate governance in banks and how they differ from the governance of non-financial firms. We then review the evidence on three governance mechanisms: (i) boards, (ii) ownership structures, and (iii) executive compensation. Our review suggests that some of the empirical regularities found in the literature on corporate governance of nonfinancial institutions, such as the positive (negative) association between board independence (size) and performance, do not hold for banks. Also, existing work provides less than conclusive results regarding the relation between different governance mechanisms and various measures for banks' performance. We discuss potential explanations for these mixed results.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
G35|The Determinants of Dividend Payment: the Effect of the Legal and Contractual Obligatory Minimum in Brazilian Companies|This study seeks to identify the effects of the mandatory dividend in determinants of companies listed on the BM&FBovespa to pay dividends, demonstrating that the methodology proposed is a step forward in the pursuit of these determinants, mirroring the reality of actual willingness to pay. To accomplish this was used a tobit model with instrumental variables, separating the sample into three groups: the Complete Sample, ABOVE group and MINIMUM group. In total, were analyzed 1531 dividend distributions from 2007 to 2013. It was found that there is strong empirical evidence that companies paying dividends above the mandatory feature different determinants of those who only pay this. Thus, the existence of companies in the sample who pay only the mandatory dividend influence on the regression coefficients, resulting in significant biases for dividend determinants in Brazil. Because companies that pay above mandatory are the real makers of the decision to pay dividends, as companies only pay the mandatory simply comply with the legislation.
G35|Corporate Policies with Permanent and Transitory Shocks|We model the financing, cash holdings, and hedging policies of a firm facing financing frictions and subject to permanent and transitory cash flow shocks. We show that permanent and transitory shocks generate distinct, sometimes opposite, effects on corporate policies and use the model to develop a rich set of empirical predictions. In our model, correlated permanent and transitory shocks imply less risk, lower cash savings, and a drop in the value of credit lines. The composition of cash-flow shocks affects the cash-flow sensitivity of cash, which can be positive or negative. Optimal hedging of permanent and transitory shocks may involve opposite positions.
G35|Rollover Traps|We model the effects of debt maturity and cash holdings on default risk. When firms have short-term debt outstanding, negative operating shocks lead to a drop in liquid reserves and may cause firms to suffer losses when rolling over their debt, due to weaker fundamentals. This amplification mechanism gets more pronounced as debt maturity decreases, increases default risk, and can give rise to a rollover trap, a scenario in which firms burn their cash flows and cash reserves due to severe rollover losses. High exposure to rollover risk can also make claimholders risk-loving and lead distressed firms to implement gambling strategies.
G35|Does Opaqueness Make Equity Capital Expensive for Banks?|Bank managers often claim that equity is expensive, which contradicts the Modigliani-Miller irrelevance theorem. An opaque bank must signal its solvency by paying high and stable dividens in order to keep depositors tranquil. This signalling may require costly liquidations if the return on assets has been poor, but not paying the dividend might trigger a run. A strongly capitalised bank should keep substantial amounts of risk-free yet non-productive currency because the number of shares is high, which is costly. The dividend is informative of the state of the bank; rational depositors react to it.
G35|Dividend payments in companies with foreign direct investors|Direct investors income (mainly dividends) are an important part of the negative current account balance of the balance of payments. The authors verified the impact of the factors presented in the literature on the dividend payout decisions of companies with foreign direct investors in terms of their significance and the direction of impact. In the analysis authors estimated tobit models on panel data for the years 2012–2014. The analysis was based on a balanced panel comprising 3437 units.
G35|Does Gender-Balancing the Board Reduce Firm Value?|This research advances the hypothesis that female leaders (CEO, chair, and director) of a microfinance institution (MFI) give more priority to the poorest families in loan provision than male leaders. We differentiate between a depth and a width dimension of financial inclusion. The data set is a unique global panel of MFIs collected from MFI raters’ reports. Our sample is also unique in the sense that about one third of all MFIs have a female CEO. The problem of endogeneity for the female leader is resolved by running Heckman’s two-step endogenous dummy variable estimation with instrument for the female leader. We find evidence for greater depth financial inclusion (smaller average loan, more gender biased) with a female leader, but not for width financial inclusion (credit client growth). The female leaders exhibit greater altruism, greater competition avoidance, but not greater risk aversion than male peers.
G35|Field-of-Study Homogamy|This paper reports evidence on the strong tendency of the college educated to match with partners who graduated in the same field of study-a dimension of assortative matching that has been overlooked thus far. We employ Labor Force Survey data covering most EU countries to measure the extent of field-of-study homogamy in prevailing married and cohabiting couples within several years of college graduation. We find that field-of-study homogamy increases almost immediately after graduation to reach very high levels, especially for spouses working in the same industry, and that it varies dramatically across countries. Graduates in Social Sciences display a particularly strong tendency towards homogamy and also have the highest matching theory-implied match gains from homogamous matches.
G35|Understanding Bank Payouts during the Crisis of 2007-2009|We provide an extensive analysis of the payout policy of U.S. banks in 2007-2008 to identify the main drivers of their payout decisions. We use established models that relate dividends to fundamentals to provide a benchmark for the normal level of payouts. Based on these models, bank dividends appear excessive in 2007, but not in 2008. We exploit cross-sectional heterogeneity to examine why bank payouts change during the crisis. Banks with low capital ratios have low abnormal payouts during the crisis, and banks with high managerial ownership also have lower payouts. Managers of banks that reduce dividends in 2008 buy more shares than before the crisis. Finally, we examine the correlation between dividends and future performance, as well as announcement returns around dividend changes and repurchases. We find that banks that reduce dividends in 2008 perform worse in 2009, but we do not find that announcements of dividend cuts are associated with a significant negative price reaction in 2007-2008. Our results in general do not support the active wealth transfer hypothesis and provide mixed evidence on banks fearing the adverse effect of dividend cuts.
G35|Liquidity, innovation, and endogenous growth|"We study optimal liquidity management, innovation, and production decisions for a continuum of firms facing financing frictions and the threat of creative destruction. We show that financing constraints lead firms to decrease production but may spur investment in innovation (R&D). We characterize which firms should substitute production for innovation in the face of constraints and thus display a ""gambling"" type of behavior. We embed our firm dynamics into a model of endogenous growth and show that financing frictions have offsetting effects on economic growth. JEL Classification: D21, G31, G32, G35, L11"
G35|Why Does Capital No Longer Flow More to the Industries with the Best Growth Opportunities?|With functionally efficient capital markets, we expect capital to flow more to the industries with the best growth opportunities. As a result, these industries should invest more and see their assets grow more relative to industries with the worst growth opportunities. We find that industries that receive more funds have a higher industry Tobin's q until the mid-1990s, but not since then. Since industries with a higher funding rate grow more, there is a negative correlation not only between an industry's funding rate and industry q but also between capital expenditures and industry q since the mid-1990s. We show that capital no longer flows more to the industries with the best growth opportunities because, since the middle of the 1990s, firms in high q industries increasingly repurchase shares rather than raise more funding from the capital markets.
G35|Corporate Deleveraging|Proactive deleveraging from all-time peak market leverage (ML) to near-zero ML and negative net debt is the norm among 4,476 nonfinancial firms with five or more years of post-peak data. ML is 0.543 at the historical peak and 0.026 at the later trough for the median firm in this sample, with a six-year median time from peak to trough. These deleveraging episodes are largely proactive, with debt repayment and earnings retention accounting for 93.7% of the peak-to-trough decline in ML for the median firm. Attenuated deleveraging, with ML staying well above zero, is the norm at 3,118 firms that are delisted due to financial distress within four years of peak. Leverage is path dependent, with the key to explaining whether ML is high or low at the post-peak trough being how high it was at the peak and prior trough and whether the firm has had only a short time to deleverage, e.g., due to distress-related delisting. The findings are consistent with proactive deleveraging to avoid distress and to restore financial flexibility, and are hard to reconcile with materially positive target leverage ratios.
G35|Learning, Termination, and Payout Policy in Dynamic Incentive Contracts|We study a principal–agent setting in which both sides learn about future profitability from output, and the project can be abandoned/terminated if profitability is too low. With learning, shirking by the agent both reduces output and lowers the principal’s estimate of future profitability. The agent can exploit this belief discrepancy and earn information rents, reducing his incentives to exert effort. The optimal contract controls information rents to improve incentives by distorting the termination decision. Our results capture the transition from a young, financially constrained firm to a mature firm that pays dividends. For young firms, poor performance permanently raises the termination threshold, as doing so lowers information rents. Mature firms pay smoothed dividends and have a fixed termination threshold. Dividend smoothing occurs because earnings surprises are used to adjust financial slack in line with profitability. When profitability only reflects the agent’s private ability, a simple equity contract is optimal.
G35|Market Reaction on Dividend Announcement in Oman: An Event Study Methodology|The paper is an empirical study to examine the impact of dividend announcement both cash and stock on the share price performance in Oman. A sample of 21 companies listed in Muscat Securities Market pertaining to different sectors which have made dividend announcement consequently from 2012 to 2015 are taken. The study adopts the event study methodology. A window of 39 days (19 days prior and 19 days post announcement and dividend announcement date) is taken as to examine the market reaction to the dividend announcement. The fi ndings show that there is an increase in the share price and has resulted in positive average abnormal return especially in the post dividend declaration period in Oman context.
G35|Stock Price Volatility and Role of Dividend Policy: Empirical Evidence from Pakistan|Despite years of empirical research, the linkage between dividend policy and stock price volatility (SPV) remains controversial among the researchers and scholars. This research endeavors to figure out the relationship between SPV and dividend policy of listed companies in Pakistan. A sample of 50 firms, based upon consistent dividend paying behavior, listed on Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) has been selected from non-financial sectors, for the period of 2005-2012. Multiple regressions analyses have been carried on by applying random effect model on panel data i.e., for empirical estimation and robustness, panel estimated generalized least squares methods is used for finding relationship between dividend policy (dividend payout [DP] and dividend yield [DY]) and SPV after controlling for firm size (FS), asset growth (AG), long-term debt (LD), earning volatility (EV) and earnings per share (EPS). The study has found significant negative relationship between SPV and dividend policy variables i.e., DP and DY. Study has also found significant positive relationship between control variables (AG, EV and EPS) and SPV in KSE. But in case of the remaining two control variables i.e., FS and LD, these were found to be negatively related to SPV. The findings of this research are expected to contribute to dividend policy literature by providing evidence from Pakistani stock market to prior studies done in developed and developing countries
G35|Does Basil III Implementation Impact on Financial Performance? Evidence from Omani’s Commercial Banks|This research aims to investigate and examine the impact Basel III implementation on financial performance of commercial banks in Omani. The annual data for all Omani commercial banks during 2013-2015 are used for calculating key financial ratios in order to assess the impact of Basel III implementation on financial performance in Omani commercial banks. To test whether there is a relationship between Basel III implementation and profitability in commercial banking sector, the research used a correlation analyses model, Ordinary and least square estimation obtained from an SPSS 17.0 package is adopted to analyze the relationship between the variables, where financial performance or profitability of commercial banks was measured in terms of return on assets, return on equity, efficiency ratio (EFR), net interest margin (NIM) and debt-to equity ratio. The findings of the research established a positive impact of Basel III implementation on financial performance of commercial banks in Oman, however this impact is not statically significant.
G35|Comparative Study on Performance of Islamic Banks and Conventional Banks: Evidence from Oman|This research aims to examine and compare the performance for Islamic banks (IBs) and conventional banks (CBs) in Oman during 2013-2015. Financial ratio analyses are employed to measure profitability, solvency and capital adequacy of seven CBs and two IBs. Independen samples t-test was used to determine the whether there is a difference in the performance for IBs and CBs. The finding of the research establishes that CBs are more profitable and significantly different from IBs in terms of return on assets, return on equity and net profit margin. While, IBs were performing better in term of efficiency ratio, debt to assets ratio. Debt to equity ratio and credit to deposits ratio total credit to total debit. The difference is statistical significant
G35|The cost of financial flexibility: Evidence from share repurchases|Over the last two decades, share repurchases have emerged as the dominant payout channel, offering a more flexible means of returning excess cash to investors. However, little is known about the costs associated with payout-related financial flexibility. Using a unique identification strategy, we document a significant cost. We find that actual repurchase investments underperform hypothetical investments that mechanically smooth repurchase dollars through time by approximately two percentage points per year on average. This cost of financial flexibility is correlated with earnings management, managerial entrenchment, and less institutional monitoring.
G35|Governance and post-repurchase performance|Payout policies based on share repurchase programs provide greater flexibility than do those based on cash dividends. We develop and test an empirical model in which strongly governed companies outperform weakly governed companies after announcing share repurchase programs. Our findings include positive associations between strong governance and both post-announcement adjusted operating performance and abnormal stock returns. The results are robust to sample selection bias, different sample criteria, governance measurement, and various control variables. In addition, governance strength is associated with larger post-announcement changes in CEO incentive compensation and merger and acquisition activity, both of which we argue are consistent with strongly governed companies using the financial flexibility derived from choosing share repurchases over cash dividends to drive better performance. Consistent with current literature on attenuation of former anomalies, the associations we find between governance and post-announcement performance tend to disappear in the latter half of our sample period.
G35|Leveraged buybacks|Debt-financed share buybacks generate positive short-term and long-run abnormal stock returns. Leveraged buyback firms have more debt capacity, higher marginal tax rate, lower excess cash and lower growth prospects ex ante, increase leverage and reduce investments more sharply ex post than cash-financed buyback firms. Firms that are over-levered ex-ante are associated with lower returns and real investments following leveraged buybacks. The lower announcement returns of over-levered firms are concentrated on firms with weaker corporate governance. The evidence is consistent with leveraged buybacks enabling firms to optimize their leverage, on average benefiting shareholders. The benefits decrease with a firm's leverage ex ante.
G35|The shadow costs of repos and bank liability structure|Making use of a structural model that allows for optimal liquidity management, we study the role that repos play in a bank׳s financing structure. In our model the bank׳s assets consist of illiquid loans and liquid reserves and are financed by a combination of repos, long-term debt, deposits and equity. Repos are a cheap source of funding, but they are subject to an exogenous rollover risk. We show that the use of repos inflicts two types of indirect (“shadow”) costs on the bank׳s shareholders: first, it induces the bank to maintain higher liquid reserves in order to alleviate the additional default risk; second, it adds to the cost of long-term debt financing. These shadow costs limit the bank׳s appetite for cheap but unstable repo funding. This effect is, however, weakened under poor returns on risky assets, access to deposit funding and the depositor preference rule. We also analyze the impact of a liquidity coverage ratio, payout restrictions and a leverage ratio on the bank׳s financing choices and show that all these tools are able to curb the bank׳s reliance on repos.
G35|Financialisation and crisis in an agent based macroeconomic model|We analyse the role of dividends distributed by firms and banks, highlighting the effects of their increase on financial instability and macroeconomic dynamics. During the last decades, the financialisation of nonfinancial corporations has been characterised by a shift from a “retain and reinvest” strategy to a “downsize and distribute” one. We will investigate this phenomenon by varying some of the model parameters, thus simulating agents' behaviours under alternative settings. On the one hand, more distributed dividends increase agents' wealth and thus consumption may rise due to a wealth-effect. On the other hand, this reduces firms' net worth that may result in a strong dependence of firms' production on bank credit; at the same time, if banks also distribute more dividends, then banks' capital decreases and credit rationing may follow. All in all, financialisation through payout policy impacts financial (in)stability and income distribution, with relevant consequences on macroeconomic dynamics.
G35|How to regulate bank dividends? Is capital regulation an answer?|This paper is a contribution to the debate on “how to regulate banks' dividend payout behaviour”, a question that has attracted special attention of academicians as well as policy makers since the onset of 2007–08 financial crisis. In this paper, we examine whether common equity based capital regulation and more stringent risk based capital requirements force banks to restrict dividend payments. Common equity based capital regulation is likely to restrict bank dividends by limiting the sources of new capital for banks. Similarly more stringent risk based capital requirements are likely to force banks to retain profits to meet regulatory capital requirements. We use an international sample of 8689 banks from 58 countries over the pre-crisis period 1998–2007 for empirical analysis. Results show that banks paid lower dividends, were less likely to pay dividends and were less likely to pay excessive dividends in countries where regulators imposed common equity based capital regulation and more stringent risk based capital requirements for the banking industry during the pre-crisis period. We also extend our sample period from 1998 to 2012 and observe that regulatory capital requirements are less effective in restricting bank dividend payments during crisis period. From a policy perspective, we suggest that regulators can limit banks' options to raise new capital from non-common equity based sources and can impose more stringent risk based capital requirements to restrict banks from dividend over-payments in good times. While regulators can use blanket restrictions on sector wise dividend payments in bad times.
G35|Can we predict dividend cuts?|I examine the predictability of dividend cuts based on the time interval between dividend announcement dates using a large dataset of US firms from 1971 to 2014. The longer the time interval between dividend announcements, the larger the probability of a cut in the dividend per share, consistent with the view that firms delay the release of bad news.
G35|Dynamic panels with threshold effect and endogeneity|This paper addresses an important issue of modeling nonlinear asymmetric dynamics and unobserved individual heterogeneity in the threshold panel data framework, simultaneously. As a general approach, we develop the first-differenced GMM estimator, which allows both threshold variable and regressors to be endogenous. When the threshold variable becomes strictly exogenous, we propose a more efficient two-step least squares estimator. We provide asymptotic theory and develop the testing procedure for threshold effects and the threshold variable exogeneity. Monte Carlo studies provide a support for theoretical predictions. We present an empirical application investigating an asymmetric sensitivity of investment to cash flows.
G35|Investor protection and dividend policy: The case of Islamic and conventional banks|This study examines the dividend policy behavior of Islamic and conventional banks operating in Arab markets. These banks operate in an environment of Sharia law and low levels of investor protection. Our results support the substitution agency model of dividends for Islamic banks, and Islamic banks use the dividend policy as a substitute mechanism for alleviating relatively more significant agency problems and higher risks of expropriation by insiders. In these markets, conventional banks operate in a more competitive environment and experience relatively less significant agency problems. In contrast to Islamic banks, conventional banks follow the outcome agency model of dividends.
G35|Corporate payout smoothing: A variance decomposition approach|In this paper, we apply a variance decomposition methodology to quantify the smoothness of corporate payouts. We find that firms use debt and investment to smooth a large fraction of shocks to net income to keep payouts less variable. Specifically, our empirical results show that firms keep the growth of payouts relatively small and stable over time. Furthermore, our findings support theoretical work that demonstrates that the dynamics of investment and debt policy should be jointly modeled with payout policy.
G35|Political affiliation and dividend tax avoidance: Evidence from the 2013 fiscal cliff|This paper uses the 2013 fiscal cliff as a natural experiment to examine how the political affiliation of the CEO affects a firm's response to an expected increase in personal taxes on dividends. Firms could avoid such additional taxes by paying extra dividends and accelerating dividends in the last 2months of 2012. These tax avoiders are compared with a sample of firms that did not accelerate the payment of their first quarterly dividend from the first 3months of 2013 to November or December 2012 (the deliberate taxpayers). Ceteris paribus, Republican CEOs are more likely to help their investors to save money on personal income taxes. However, the political affiliation has explanatory power in addition to previously documented effects (Hanlon and Hoopes, 2014), such as the consequences for the CEO's personal wealth as well as the percentage of insider holdings. Reputational concerns about “avoiding taxes for the rich” as well as corporate governance quality are also significant determinants of corporate behavior.
G35|Does institutional ownership increase stock return volatility? Evidence from Vietnam|The literature on institutional ownership and stock return volatility often ignores small emerging countries. However, this issue is more profound, due to the large size of institutional investors and small stock market size, in emerging equity markets. This paper examines the effects of the institutional ownership on the firm-level volatility of stock returns in Vietnam. Our data cover most of non-financial firms listed on the Ho Chi Minh City stock exchange for the period 2006–2012. Employing different analysis techniques for panel data and controlling for possible endogeneity problems, our empirical results suggest that institutional investors stabilize the stock return volatility. Moreover, we document that: i) the stabilizing effect of institutional investor ownership is higher in dividend paying firms, and ii) if firms are paying out more dividends, this stabilizing effect is greater. Our results outline the important role of institutional investors in maintaining the stability in emerging stock markets.
G35|A macro-analysis of financial decisions: An examination of special dividend announcements|This paper investigates macro-level explanations for why firms pay special dividends. We find both the business cycle and market condition affect the propensity and abnormal returns of special dividends. Firms are more likely to announce special dividends in market or economic downturns than upturns. They tend to use additional cash for business growth in expansions and distribute it to reduce agency costs in contractions. The signaling effect of special dividends is stronger and companies with these announcements are better performers in recessions than in expansions. This research sheds light on and enhances the understanding of why firms disburse extra cash dividends at the aggregate level.
G35|New findings on repurchase anomaly — The first-month effect|Prior studies find positive abnormal returns following share repurchase announcements. We examine the association between announcement month and the excess returns. We find that the average excess return is consistently higher for repurchases announced in the first month of a fiscal quarter than for those announced in the other two months. Interestingly, 1st-month and non-1st-month announcers are highly comparable in firm characteristics, pre-announcement returns, and disclosed motives. The magnitude of the first-month effect barely changes after we switch to multivariate regressions, and it remains large under firm-fixed effects. Investment strategies based on BTM, firm size, and pre-announcement return are all improved by a first-month strategy. The first-month effect extends well beyond the first year, but the market does not seem to realize it. We propose an explanation for the first-month effect based on the conjecture that managers receive firm information in an uneven manner throughout a fiscal period. This explanation is supported by our empirical tests. Additional empirical analyses provide results that fail to support several plausible alternative explanations.
G35|Dividend payout policies: Evidence from Latin America|This paper examines dividend payout policies for firms in six Latin American countries from 1995 to 2013. As predicted by the pecking order and trade-off models, the dividend payout is positively linked to profitability and negatively related to past indebtedness and investment opportunities. We also find that the target dividend payout ratio is positively related to governance indicators at the country level. In addition, the speed to which firms adjust their dividends to changes in earnings is lower in high governance countries in the region. Thus, firms smooth dividends more in countries with higher governance scores. We do not find evidence supporting the lifecycle theory nor illiquidity effects on dividends levels.
G35|Foreign investors and corporate risk taking behavior in an emerging market|This paper investigates the impact of foreign ownership on the corporate risk taking activity at the firm level in Vietnam. Employing different techniques of panel data estimation, we find that foreign investors help to reduce the corporate risk taking activities. The result supports the notion that foreign investors in Vietnam stock market focus on long run perspectives rather than short term gain. This finding has implications in recognizing the importance of foreign investors in emerging markets.
G35|Idiosyncratic risk and share repurchases|The ‘open market share repurchase anomaly’ occurs when stocks of repurchasing firms subsequently outperform non-repurchasing firms matched on several firm characteristics. We document that the post-repurchase outperformance reflects higher idiosyncratic risk exposure for repurchasing firms than matching firms. A possible explanation is that, as firms’ leverage increases due to share repurchases, their exposure to idiosyncratic risk rises, thus increasing their stocks’ expected returns relative to matched firms.
G35|Finance methodology of Free Cash Flow|Free Cash Flow (FCF) was adopted in the late 1980s as a financial tool to evaluate the firm and its individual projects. We question the procedure of calculating the FCF where a significant portion of Current Liabilities is offset against Current Assets, thereby creating the hybrid asset Net Working Capital (NWC). Borrowed from accounting methodology, that procedure distorts the FCF size, composition, volatility, and estimated value. Our empirical analysis shows that the nature and extent of those distortions can misinform the firm's stockholders, lenders and borrowers, and investors at large. We propose a revised FCF that would avoid those distortions.
G35|Institutional stock ownership and firms’ cash dividend policies: Evidence from China|Agency theory suggests that outside shareholders prefer higher dividend payouts in order to reduce the free cash flows of firms that are under the insiders’ control. Our study investigates the effects of mutual funds, typically the most important and influential type of outside shareholder, on firms’ dividend payouts in China during the period from 2003 to 2011. We find that mutual funds influence firms to pay higher cash dividends. The results are consistent with the predictions from exit theory. The effects are more pronounced in firms controlled by state and regional governments and in firms with relatively higher free cash flows. We also find evidence that the mutual funds’ effects are stronger when their investment horizon is longer and the ownership interest is larger. Other institutional investors, such as banks, insurance companies, and securities companies have a lower exit threat and do not have an influence on firms’ cash dividend payments or financial performances.
G35|Do corporate policies follow a life-cycle?|We examine whether corporate investment, financing, and cash policies are interdependent and follow a predictable pattern in line with the firm life-cycle. We find that investments and equity issuance decrease with firm life-cycle, while debt issuance and cash holdings increase in the introduction and growth stages and decrease in the mature and shake-out/decline stages of the firm’s life-cycle. These results are robust after using various proxies for life-cycle and controlling for firm, CEO and board level characteristics. Collectively, our results show that corporate policies follow a firm life-cycle.
G35|Sensitivity to investor sentiment and stock performance of open market share repurchases|This paper finds that stocks of repurchasers with high sensitivity to investor sentiment are more likely to be mispriced. Thus, such repurchases are followed by superior post-buyback stock performance. This abnormal return associated with sensitivity to sentiment cannot be explained by other undervaluation factors: book-to-market or prior return effects. My results are robust with factor model analysis and controls for contamination effects. I conclude that this sentiment-driven undervaluation may result from the difficulty to value and/or limits to arbitrage rather than investor overreaction.
G35|Effect of institutional ownership on dividends: An agency-theory-based analysis|This study examines the effect of institutional ownership on dividend payouts through the lens of agency theory. We hypothesize that only institutions with certain traits are likely to monitor. Monitoring institutions will use dividend payouts as a tool to mitigate firms' agency problems, conditional on those firms' financial performance. We find that (1) there is a positive relation between lagged long-term institutional ownership with a large stake and the dividend payout ratio, (2) the positive relation is more salient in firms with high agency costs, and (3) the positive relation is more salient when external monitoring is weak. These findings support that (1) concentrated and long-term institutional investors play a monitoring role and (2) monitoring institutions use dividend payouts as a monitoring device. Our findings are robust to endogeneity tests, level and change models, alternative income-based dividend payout measures, alternative measures of long-term institutions, and sub-period analyses.
G35|The real effects of share repurchases|We employ a regression discontinuity design to identify the real effects of share repurchases on other firm outcomes. The probability of share repurchases that increase earnings per share (EPS) is sharply higher for firms that would have just missed the EPS forecast in the absence of the repurchase, when compared with firms that “just beat” the EPS forecast. We use this discontinuity to show that EPS-motivated repurchases are associated with reductions in employment and investment, and a decrease in cash holdings. Our evidence suggests that managers are willing to trade off investments and employment for stock repurchases that allow them to meet analyst EPS forecasts.
G35|Stock repurchases and liquidity|We analyze the impact of share repurchases on liquidity based on a new comprehensive data set of realized share repurchases in the US, which covers 50,204 repurchase months between 2004 and 2010. Using instrumental variable analysis, we show that repurchases unequivocally improve liquidity and suggest that endogenous controls have confounded results in earlier studies. Liquidity also influences how firms execute repurchase programs. Repurchases provide liquidity when other investors sell the firm's stock or in times of crisis. No evidence exists that firms reduce liquidity when they trade on private information.
G35|Passive investors, not passive owners|Passive institutional investors are an increasingly important component of U.S. stock ownership. To examine whether and by which mechanisms passive investors influence firms' governance, we exploit variation in ownership by passive mutual funds associated with stock assignments to the Russell 1000 and 2000 indexes. Our findings suggest that passive mutual funds influence firms' governance choices, resulting in more independent directors, removal of takeover defenses, and more equal voting rights. Passive investors appear to exert influence through their large voting blocs, and consistent with the observed governance differences increasing firm value, passive ownership is associated with improvements in firms’ longer-term performance.
G35|Are Friday announcements special? Overcoming selection bias|We report reduced market response to Friday announcements of dividend changes, seasoned equity offerings, share repurchases, earnings, and mergers, which is seemingly consistent with the notion of investor inattention on Fridays. However, we show that these findings are an outcome of selection bias. Firms that make announcements on Fridays experience reduced market response on any weekday and have common unobserved characteristics across announcement types. After correcting for selection bias, there is no evidence that investors pay less attention to announcements made on Fridays. The method introduced here is applicable to other studies in which an exogenous factor influencing firm performance can actually be associated with firm characteristics.
G35|Socially responsible firms|In the corporate finance tradition, starting with Berle and Means (1932), corporations should generally be run to maximize shareholder value. The agency view of corporate social responsibility (CSR) considers CSR an agency problem and a waste of corporate resources. Given our identification strategy by means of an instrumental variable approach, we find that well-governed firms that suffer less from agency concerns (less cash abundance, positive pay-for-performance, small control wedge, strong minority protection) engage more in CSR. We also find that a positive relation exists between CSR and value and that CSR attenuates the negative relation between managerial entrenchment and value.
G35|The dark side of liquidity creation: Leverage and systemic risk|We consider a model in which the threat of bank liquidations by creditors as well as equity-based compensation incentives both discipline bankers, but with different consequences. Greater use of equity leads to lower ex-ante bank liquidity, whereas greater use of debt leads to a higher probability of inefficient bank liquidation. The bank's privately-optimal capital structure trades off these two costs. With uncertainty about aggregate risk, bank creditors learn from other banks’ liquidation decisions. Such inference can lead to contagious liquidations, some of which are inefficient; this is a negative externality that is ignored in privately-optimal bank capital structures. Thus, under plausible conditions, banks choose excessive leverage relative to the socially optimal level, providing a rationale for bank capital regulation. While a blanket regulatory forbearance policy can eliminate contagion, it also eliminates all market discipline. However, a regulator generating its own information about aggregate risk, rather than relying on market signals, can restore efficiency and market discipline by intervening selectively.
G35|Stock repurchases in Japan: A solution to excessive corporate saving?|Since the 1990s profitable Japanese companies have faced lower domestic growth opportunities; they have invested less, yet most have not increased their payout. This has resulted in a substantial deleveraging of their balance sheets. The popular term for this phenomenon is “corporate saving.” Corporate saving by Japanese companies is now at the highest level in history. Dividends and stock repurchases are two potential ways to resolve excessive corporate saving. Stock repurchases in particular offer a fast, flexible and very public method to solve the problem of excessive corporate savings. This research is an investigation of stock repurchases by Japanese companies from 2000 to 2009. Companies repurchase their stock to return excess cash to investors, resolve governance issues, adjust capital structure and send signals. This paper uses accounting and stock market information to explain this behavior. Contrary to recent research on American firms, we find that replacement of dividends does not appear to explain stock repurchase behavior in Japan. We find evidence that repurchase behavior in Japan is linked to excessive corporate savings. However, repurchases are also closely linked to the ownership structure of the firm. Firms whose dominant owners are other members of the firm's industrial group are less likely to repurchase. Bank ownership has mixed implications for repurchases. Firms having foreign and individual ownership are more likely to repurchase stock. Foreign and individual ownership appears to improve governance and thus may be a partial solution to excessive corporate savings.
G35|Signaling, corporate governance, and the equilibrium dividend policy|The well-documented information content of dividends is contingent on the firm's corporate governance. Using cross-listing events, we find that firms reach a new equilibrium dividend policy after a shift in the level of shareholder protection and the direction of the dividend adjustment depends on the pre-cross-listing locus of control. Exchange-traded cross-listings can afford to decrease dividend payouts as they substitute dividends with better corporate governance. However, dividend distributions and the likelihood to pay dividends increase when cross-listings are controlled by insiders, supporting the signaling hypothesis. The cross-listing level and ownership structure convey useful information regarding future shifts in dividend payouts.
G35|Ex day effects of the 2003 dividend tax cut|We analyze ex day dynamics around the May 2003 dividend tax cut in a framework with arbitrageurs as liquidity providers. Raw returns and ratios for all groups don't change significantly around the event but the volatilities decline significantly. The volume declines more (less) strongly for high (low) yields. This is consistent with the reduction in the differential tax rates leading to a reduced demand for capital losses around the ex day, and a reduction in informed trading. The price dynamics for the one week before and after periods also support a market microstructure explanation. Evidence on market quality is mixed.
G35|On Persistence of Uncertainty Shocks|I study real e ects of uncertainty shocks. Using time-varying volatility of the forecast error, I construct a two-part uncertainty metric that consists of persistent and volatile, burstlike components. These indices are used to study empirically several predictions of uncertainty models: that uncertainty shocks have real e ects, that these e ects realize in a downturn/overshoot pattern and that persistence of uncertainty shocks decreases this pattern's frequency and increases its amplitude. Using the constructed metric in a simple VAR framework I show that real e ects are there, that shock to the volatile uncertainty causes signi cant downturn/overshoot pattern, and that shock to the persistent component causes severe and prolonged damage.
G35|Why Share Repurchases Are Not A Panacea For Increasing Share Prices|This research examines factors deteriorating share price performance before and after repurchase announcements. We find share price performance before announcements can be attributed to operating performance and agency problems. But, operating performance is the primary factor determining undervaluation. We also find that, regardless of whether firms are undervalued before repurchase announcements, those that experience negative abnormal returns after repurchase announcements have inferior operating performance and lower buyback premiums. Our regression analysis shows that an improvement in future operating profits determines prosperous share price performance after repurchase announcements. Lack of investment, or those made with agency problems, better explain poor share-price performance
G35|Numerical approximation of a cash-constrained firm value with investment opportunities|We consider a singular control problem with regime switching that arises in problems of optimal investment decisions of cash-constrained firms. The value function is proved to be the unique viscosity solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Moreover, we give regularity properties of the value function as well as a description of the shape of the control regions. Based on these theoretical results, a numerical deterministic approximation of the related HJB variational inequality is provided. We finally show that this numerical approximation converges to the value function. This allows us to describe the investment and dividend optimal policies.
G35|A comparison of alternative models for estimating firm’s growth rate|Abstract The growth rate plays an important role in determining a firm’s asset and equity values, nevertheless the basic assumptions of the growth rate estimation model are less well understood. In this paper, we demonstrate that the model makes strong assumptions regarding the financing mix of the firm. In addition, we discuss various methods to estimate firms’ growth rate, including arithmetic average method, geometric average method, compound-sum method, continuous regression method, discrete regression method, and inferred method. We demonstrate that the arithmetic average method is very sensitive to extreme observations, and the regression methods yield similar but somewhat smaller estimates of the growth rate compared to the compound-sum method. Interestingly, the ex-post forecast shows that arithmetic average method (compound-sum method) yields the best (worst) performance with respect to estimating firm’s future dividend growth rate. Firm characteristics, like size, book-to-market ratio, and systematic risk, have significant influence on the forecast errors of dividend and sales growth rate estimation.
G35|Corporate patents, R&D success, and tax avoidance|Abstract It is well known that research and development (R&D) tax policies are written to encourage firm innovation, a crucial driver of business growth. However, evidence on the effectiveness of tax benefits for innovation is largely anecdotal and empirical examination of the influence of innovation on firm-level taxation is still underexplored. In this study we use an archival research design to assess the implications of corporate innovation on tax avoidance. Based on a large sample of patent data from 1987 to 2010, we find that, on average, both a firm’s innovation productivity (using patent counts) and innovation quality (using patent citations) are positively associated with its tax avoidance level. Nevertheless, we find that the success of R&D investment, in terms of patent output per R&D dollar, is not associated with tax avoidance. Our study is informative for the debate about tax credit reform, such as establishing a ‘patent box’ regime for the purpose of spurring both the conduct of research and commercialization of R&D program.
G35|The performance of Taiwanese firms after a share repurchase announcement|Abstract This study uses stochastic dominance analysis to examine the financial performance of Taiwanese firms from 2000 to 2013 after their announcement of a share repurchase program. Our results show that the firms in the repurchase portfolio perform poorly prior to the announcement, but improve dramatically to outperform different benchmarks after the repurchase announcement. For firms in the repurchase portfolio, we find that (1) the firms with a high book-to-market ratio outperform firms with a low book-to-market ratio, (2) smaller firms outperform larger firms, and (3) there is no significant difference in performance between firms with different percentages of completing the repurchase programs.
G35|Business owners and income-shifting: evidence from Finland|This study examines income-shifting between tax bases among the owners of privately held businesses. The dual income tax system in Finland offers noticeable incentives for income-shifting between wages and dividends for business owners. The dividend tax reform of 2005 enables us to study how this particular form of tax avoidance reacts to an exogenous change in tax rates. Our results support highly active income-shifting behavior. We find that the income-shifting effect is homogeneous across different owners and firms. However, we find that the size of the tax incentive affects the size of the response, suggesting that costs related to income-shifting are important.

G35|Measuring Uncertainty|This paper exploits a data rich environment to provide direct econometric estimates of time-varying macroeconomic uncertainty. Our estimates display significant independent variations from popular uncertainty proxies, suggesting that much of the variation in the proxies is not driven by uncertainty. Quantitatively important uncertainty episodes appear far more infrequently than indicated by popular uncertainty proxies, but when they do occur, they are larger, more persistent, and are more correlated with real activity. Our estimates provide a benchmark to evaluate theories for which uncertainty shocks play a role in business cycles. (JEL C53, D81, E32, G12, G35, L25)
G35|Financial Entanglement: A Theory of Incomplete Integration, Leverage, Crashes, and Contagion|We propose a unified model of limited market integration, asset-price determination, leveraging, and contagion. Investors and firms are located on a circle, and access to markets involves participation costs that increase with distance. Due to a complementarity between participation and leverage decisions, the equilibrium may exhibit diverse leverage and participation choices across investors, although investors are ex ante identical. Small changes in market-access costs can cause a change in the type of equilibrium, leading to discontinuous price changes, deleveraging, and portfolio-flow reversals. Moreover, the market is subject to contagion—an adverse shock to investors in some locations affects prices everywhere. (JEL D83, G11, G12, G32, G35)
G35|Analysis Of Factors Influencing The Risk Of Poverty For People Aged Over 65|This article addresses a very topical issue that is the phenomena and factors influencing the risk of poverty for people aged over 65 years. Thus, for a time horizon of fifteen years that we consider representative, we determined the correlation of seven variables that influence the risk of poverty for a number of twenty-eight Member States of the European Union. We believe that in this way we can assess the impact of aging of the population on the pension systems and we will identify the necessary measures to support the sustainability and capability of the pension systems to provide future adequate replacement income.
G35|Measuring The Firm Value By Discounted Cash Flows: Principles And Issues Of Various Models|This paper comprises an examination of the principles of company evaluation using in the discounted cash flow models. In this context, we take into account both the evaluation of the entire business and the alternative of equity valuation by discounted dividends and free cash flows. Although the discounted cash flows to equity can be seen as a better alternative to determine the firm's market value when the dividends are established according to the available cash, the disadvantage of using that approach is that the cash flows related to debt have to be considered explicitly in the model. Also, if we consider the indirect equity valuation, the convergence of the result with the value obtained by applying direct evaluation technique will depend on the correctness of evaluating the firm and the suppositions used about firm’s leverage and expected net income.
G35|Finance, Theoretical and Applied|Like Caesar's Gaul, corporate finance is divided into three parts: theoretical, empirical, and normative. Important advances in any one of these three typically generate good ideas for the other two. I have been fortunate not to specialize in one part only. This review covers the history of capital structure theories, including the trade-off and pecking-order theories, and takes a skeptical view of how those theories have been tested so far. I give roughly equal space to normative, practical applications, including adjusted present value (APV), the valuation of real options, and the application of modern finance to regulation, insurance, the valuation of R&D, and the role of risk capital in financial institutions. Looking back, I realize that the supply of intriguing financial questions is inexhaustible.
G35|Investment, Financing and Minsky’s Debt Paradox. A Microeconomic Analysis for Latin America|Based on the theory of Hyman Minsky’s representative firm, this article adopts a micro-econometric approach to analyze the relationship between the lender's and borrower's risk, the level of investment, and the share of own and external funds in financing. The analysis uses a sample of 4.596 companies from 13 countries in Latin America for the years 2005 and 2009, which correspond to two opposing economic contexts (economic boom and contraction, respectively). Results show that in the most basic estimations a higher lender's risk and borrower's risk reduce the volume of investment. But, at the same time, the results show evidence in favor of the 'paradox of debt', namely, that a higher borrower's risk increases the likelihood of greater indebtedness and of an increase in the share of external financing of investment. This result is explained on the basis of the macroeconomic relationship between investment and profits, postulated by Minsky at the aggregate level. The contraction in the level of aggregate investment recorded in recession years, like 2009, generates a fall in profits at the macro and microeconomic levels. At the firm level, this reduces the possibility of financing investment with internal funds, increasing the likelihood of relative indebtedness.
G35|The Global Preference for Dividends in Declining Markets| Investors globally prefer dividend-paying stocks over nondividend-paying stocks more in declining than in advancing markets, even accounting for firm-level growth opportunities, size and risk effects. Dividend-paying stocks outperform nondividend-paying stocks, from 0.63% (China) to 3.79% (Canada) more per month in declining than in advancing markets. In declining markets, dividend-paying firms outperform by more than any underperformance in advancing markets. The results are robust across dividend taxation regimes, legal environments, emerging and developed markets, periods prior to and after the 2008 global financial crisis, the exclusion of the dividend declaration month and in respect to segmented or integrated international capital markets.
G35|Testing for Distortions in Performance Measures: An Application to Residual Income-Based Measures like Economic Value Added|" type=""main""> Distorted performance measures in compensation contracts elicit suboptimal behavioral responses that may even prove to be dysfunctional (gaming). This paper applies the empirical test developed by Courty and Marschke (Review of Economics and Statistics, 90, 428–441) to detect whether the widely used class of residual income-based performance measures—such as economic value added (EVA)—is distorted, leading to unintended agent behavior. The paper uses a difference-in-differences approach to account for changes in economic circumstances and the self-selection of firms using EVA. Our findings indicate that EVA is a distorted performance measure that elicits the gaming response."
G35|The Shadow Cost of Repos and Bank Liability Structure|Making use of a structural model that allows for optimal liquidity management, we study the role that repos play in a bank’s financing structure. In our model the bank’s assets consist of illiquid loans and liquid reserves and are financed by a combination of repos, long–term debt, deposits and equity. Repos are a cheap source of funding, but they are subject to an exogenous rollover risk. We show that their use adds to the cost of long–term debt financing, which limits the bank’s appetite for unstable repo funding. This effect is, however, weakened under poor returns on assets, abundant deposit funding and the depositor preference rule. We also analyze the impact of a liquidity coverage ratio, payout restrictions and a leverage ratio on the bank’s financing choices and show that all these tools are able to curb the bank’s reliance on repos.
G35|Liquidity, Innovation, And Endogenous Growth|We study optimal liquidity management, innovation, and production decisions for a continuum of firms facing financing frictions and the threat of creative destruction. We show that liquidity constraints unambiguously lead firms to decrease their production rate but, surprisingly, may spur investment in innovation (R&D). Using the model, we characterize which firms substitute production for innovation when constrained and thus display a non-monotonic relation between cash reserves and R&D. We embed our single-firm dynamics in a Schumpeterian model of endogenous growth and demonstrate that financing frictions have an ambiguous effect on economic growth.
G35|Microeconomic and macroeconomic determinants of the dividend policy in companies quoted at Warsaw Stock Exchange — research results|The article presents results of research devoted to determinants of the dividend policy of companies quoted at Warsaw Stock Exchange in Warsaw. The presentation of the authors’ analyses is preceded by a review of studies described in the literature, carried out in scientific centres in Poland and abroad, in the breakdown into studies referring to two groups of factors: the microeconomic and the macroeconomic ones. The studies presented covered an analysis of correlation between the value of the paid-out dividend and selected parameters which describe the financial and property-related standing of companies, as well as macroeconomic factors. The research based on data from the years 2002–2013. It was summed up in a comparative analysis of microeconomic and macroeconomic determinants of dividend-related decisions of companies.
G35|Corporate policies with permanent and temporary shocks|We develop a dynamic model of investment, cash holdings, financing, and risk management policies in which firms face financing frictions and are subject to permanent and temporary cash flow shocks. In this model, target cash holdings depend on the long-term prospects of the firm, implying that the payout policy of the firm, its financing policy, and its cash-flow sensitivity of cash display a more realistic behavior than in prior models with financing frictions. In addition, risk management policies are richer and depend on the nature of cash flow shocks and potential collateral constraints. Lastly, the timing of investment and the firm’s initial asset mix both reflect financing frictions and the joint effects of permanent and temporary shocks.
G35|Liquidity, Innovation, and Endogenous Growth|We study optimal liquidity management, innovation, and production decisions for a continuum of firms facing financing frictions and the threat of creative destruction. We show that liquidity constraints unambiguously lead firms to decrease their production rate but, surprisingly, may spur investment in innovation (R&D). Using the model, we characterize which firms substitute production for innovation when constrained and thus display a non-monotonic relation between cash reserves and R&D. We embed our single-firm dynamics in a Schumpeterian model of endogenous growth and demonstrate that financing frictions have an ambiguous effect on economic growth.
G35|Determinants of Target Dividend Payout Ratio: A Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag Analysis|The aim of this study is to find out the determinants of target dividend payout ratio (TDPR) of BIST - listed firms operating in the non-metallic products (cement) manufacturing industry in the period of 2002-2012. Through this aim, the short and long-run effects of factors related to profitability, liquidity, growth, risk, market expectations and taxation on TDPR is analyzed via panel autoregressive distributed lag analysis methodology. Empirical findings indicate that in the long-run, factors related to profitability, growth and corporate taxation significantly affect TDPR negatively; while factors related to risk and market expectations have statistically significant and positive effects on TDPR. Additionally, in the short-run only profitability seems to have statistically significant and positive effect on the dependent variable.
G35|Majority support of shareholders, monitoring incentive, and dividend policy|As an alternative version of the side-payment model, this paper presents a demonstration of how the necessity of winning majority support of shareholders influences the relation between a blockholder's monitoring incentive and a firm's dividend policy. When dividend-averse individuals collectively hold a majority stake in a dispersed ownership structure, a dividend-seeking blockholder might be compelled to propose lower dividends than the tax-optimum to dominate the zero-dividend proposal. Under such circumstances, the blockholder has an incentive to provide unprofitable monitoring activity as long as the private benefits of tax-saving are greater than the pecuniary loss from the monitoring activity.
G35|Do corporate managers skimp on shareholders' dividends to protect their own retirement funds?|What is the impact of long-term executive compensation, particularly large pension payouts, on the firm's current dividend policy? We argue that managers with high pension holdings are less likely to adopt a high dividend policy that can risk their future pension payouts. Using a hand-collected actuarial pension dataset we show that (i) dividend payments are significantly lower when manager compensation relies more heavily on pension payouts; (ii) higher compensation leverage and inside debt have a significant negative effect on dividend payments net of stock repurchases; and (iii) the negative effect of pension on dividend is significantly weaker when pensions are protected in a pre-funding rabbi trust. We show further that this agency behavior reduces firm performance.
G35|Equity-incentive compensation and payout policy in Europe|We examine the effects of executive compensation and investor protection on payout policy in Europe. We find a negative (positive) relationship between both option and restricted stock compensation and dividends (repurchases). However, when the incentive compensation is dividend protected, dividend payouts increase. Firms in weak investor protection countries pay higher dividends consistent with maintaining a reputation for distributing excess free cash flows. However, growth firms in weak investor protection countries reduce dividends (increase repurchases) in relation to increases in equity-incentive compensation. Our results are consistent with growth firms in weak investor protection countries using equity incentives as a substitute for dividends to reduce agency costs.
G35|Institutional shareholding and information content of dividend surprises: Re-examining the dynamics in dividend-reappearance era|We examine the role of institutional investors' investment horizon on the information content associated with dividend announcement surprises in the “dividend-reappearance era”. We find that the presence of institutional investors negatively affects the announcement period cumulative abnormal return (CAR), which suggests that institutional investors reduce information content of dividend announcements. This result is primarily driven by the fact that institutional investors, especially the not-short-horizon investors, do not prefer dividend surprises – which leads to lower announcement period CAR. We do not find support for institutional investors' informed trading argument. Our study reveals that in order to understand the dynamics between institutional ownership and information content of dividend announcements, it is important to differentiate the institutional investors' investment horizons.
G35|Governance and Payout Precommitment|We examine how firms structure payout and debt commitments to address governance weaknesses. Firms with severe agency conflicts precommit through a combination of dividends and debt or through dividends rather than debt alone. Such firms also shift their shareholder payouts towards regular quarterly dividends—a stronger commitment than special dividends or repurchases. Although dividend commitments are implicit, event study evidence supports their credibility and value relevance for firms with weak governance. Despite harsher penalties, debt alone cannot replace shareholder payouts as a means of addressing managerial agency conflicts.
G35|Pay-out policies in founding family firms|This article analyses founding family influence on pay-out policies for Swiss listed firms over the period 2003–2010. We hypothesise that family firms have different incentives and characteristics that affect pay-out decisions and propose three possible explanations: agency theory, reputation building and family income needs. Our results show that founding family firms display significantly higher dividend pay-outs relative to companies with other ownership structures. We also examine specific family characteristics and document that a family's stake, active involvement and generation play an important role in determining pay-out policies. Our findings appear to be consistent with the family income hypothesis and to some extent with reputational concerns.
G35|Dividend changes and stock price informativeness|We investigate how private information in stock prices impacts quarterly dividend changes. We find that the positive relationship between past returns and current dividend changes strengthens when returns convey more private information. This finding is robust to the use of several price informativeness measures and the inclusion of managerial private information and stock overvaluation measures. Managers seem to learn new information from stock prices that they use when deciding on their dividend policy. This study highlights private information in stock prices as an important determinant of dividend policy and contributes to the literature on the real effects of financial markets.
G35|Quantile cointegration in the autoregressive distributed-lag modeling framework|Xiao (2009) develops a novel estimation technique for quantile cointegrated time series by extending Phillips and Hansen’s (1990) semiparametric approach and Saikkonen’s (1991) parametrically augmented approach. This paper extends Pesaran and Shin’s (1998) autoregressive distributed-lag approach into quantile regression by jointly analyzing short-run dynamics and long-run cointegrating relationships across a range of quantiles. We derive the asymptotic theory and provide a general package in which the model can be estimated and tested within and across quantiles. We further affirm our theoretical results by Monte Carlo simulations. The main utilities of this analysis are demonstrated through the empirical application to the dividend policy in the US.
G35|Bond and stock market response to unexpected dividend changes|We use comprehensive transaction data from Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine to study the response in corporate bond market to dividend announcements and compare that with the response in stock market. We find that the information content/free cash flow effect dominates the wealth transfer effect in bond market. The relationship between the magnitude of dividend changes and future profitability is weak. However, the reaction in stock and bond markets on announcement dates can be informative about the earnings one year after announcements. Additionally, the reaction of speculative-grade bonds on announcement dates is more informative about future profitability than that of investment-grade bonds.
G35|Price adjustment method and ex-dividend day returns in a different institutional setting|This study investigates the determinants of the ex-dividend day price behavior in the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE), a unique institutional setting, and examines how a major regulatory change in the price adjustment method affects the extent of the ex-day stock price drop. We find that allowing the market to freely adjust prices, after 2001, the ex-dividend day price improves the pricing efficiency of the market in the sense that the raw price ratio tends to one and abnormal returns tend to zero. We also find that in the absence of taxes on dividends and capital gains and certain microstructure impediments discussed in the literature – i.e., bid-ask spread, market makers, price discreteness, tick size and limit order adjustment mechanism – stock illiquidity is the best candidate for explaining the magnitude of the ex-dividend day price adjustment.
G35|Geographic location, excess control rights, and cash holdings|We assess the extent to which remotely-located firms are likely to discretionarily accumulate cash rather than distribute it to shareholders. We consider that these firms are less subject to shareholder scrutiny and, thus, will have high agency conflicts as the distance will facilitate the extraction of private benefits. Consistent with our predictions, we find a positive relation between the distance to the main metropolitan area and cash holdings, and this impact is more pronounced when the controlling shareholder has high levels of excess control rights (i.e., separation of cash-flow rights and control rights). Our results hold even after accounting for all control variables, including financial constraints, and suggest that geographic remoteness can be conducive to severe agency problems, particularly when there is a large separation of cash-flow rights and control rights.
G35|Aggregate dividends and consumption smoothing|We show that net equity payouts from the corporate sector play a crucial role in helping individuals manage their consumption path across the business cycle. In particular, we show that, as investors' desire to smooth consumption increases, optimal aggregate dividends become both more volatile and more counter-cyclical to help counterbalance pro-cyclical labor income. These findings are robust to whether or not agency conflicts exist in the economy.
G35|Net payout return: An alternative to the traditional returns approach based on dividends and share repurchases|We examine two alternative measures of equity returns incorporating stock repurchases as well as dividends, the other incorporating new equity issuance. We compute stock returns for 30 S&P 500 firms using all three approaches and find that stock repurchases have on average increased average annual returns by almost 2% and geometric returns by +1.6% per annum, whilst new share issuance reduces average returns by 1.1% a year. We also find similar results at the aggregate portfolio level. We argue that investors should be concerned about total shareholder flows and not the amount of cash distributed through any particular channel.
G35|Global dividend payout patterns: The US and the rest of the world and the effect of financial crisis|This paper compares the dividend payout behavior of US firms with those of firms in 32 other countries for the period of 1985–2011. It also investigates the possible impact of the 2007 financial crisis on the payout policies in these 33 countries. Results show that the proportion of firms that pay dividends (payers) is lower in the US than that it is in the rest of the world. In both the US and the rest of the world the proportion of payers decreases (and significantly so) in each of the years leading to the year 2000 and then reverses direction and increases during the post-2000 years.
G35|Taxes, earnings payout, and payout channel choice|We study the tax regulations in relation to dividends and capital gains over the last two decades for the UK in order to determine whether changes in tax regimes affect corporate payout policy (dividends, share repurchases, or a combination). While we can identify investors’ tax-driven preferences for a specific payout channel, we find no evidence of tax-induced clienteles. Firms do indeed not cater to the tax preferences of their shareholders (including individuals, pension funds, corporations). Other factors, such as equity-based compensation received by the CEO and investor sentiment in the form of optimism reduce the dividend payout and increase the use of share repurchases.
