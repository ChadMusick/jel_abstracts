G30|Economic Policy Uncertainty and Long-Run Stock Market Volatility and Correlation|We use Baker, Bloom, and Davis’s (2016) economic policy uncertainty indices in combination with the mixed data sampling (MIDAS) approach to investigate long-run stock market volatility and correlation, primarily for the US and UK. Long-run US–UK stock market correlation depends positively on US economic policy uncertainty shocks. The dependence is asymmetric, with only positive shocks - increasing uncertainty - being of importance. The US long-run stock market volatility depends significantly on US economic policy uncertainty shocks but not on UK shocks, while the UK long-run stock market volatility depends significantly on both. Allowing for US economic policy uncertainty shocks improves the out-of-sample forecasting of US–UK stock market correlation and enhances portfolio performance. Similar results apply to the long-run correlation between the US and Canada, China, and Germany.
G30|R&D Subsidies and Firms’ Debt Financing|This study investigates the impact of public subsidies for research and development (R&D) on the debt financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It examines a public program implemented in the Marche region of Italy during the period 2005–2012. The study combines matching methods with a difference-in-difference estimator to examine whether receiving public subsidies affects total indebtedness, the structure and cost of debt of awarded firms. The results indicate that R&D subsidies modify firms’ (especially young firms’) debt structure in favor of long-term financing, and help firms to limit the average cost of debt. Subsidies also foster the use of bank financing, but do not affect the overall level of debt. Taken together, these findings suggest that public funding of SMEs’ innovation projects plays a certification role in access to external financial resources for firms receiving subsidies.
G30|Can survey-based information help assess investment gaps in the eu?|This study illustrates how information from micro-level and survey-based databases can be used, along with macroeconomic indicators, to provide a better understanding of corporate investment obstacles across the EU. To show this, we use a novel dataset merging firm-level data from the European Investment Bank Investment Survey (EIBIS) and hard data from corporations’ balance sheet and P&L information. We show that the indicators of impediments to investment at the country level, which can be derived from aggregating qualitative answers, correlate relatively well with macro-based hard data, which are commonly considered as determinants of investments in macro-based models. After controlling for firm-specific characteristics, the perceived investment gap (the difference between desired and actual investment) remains correlated with the reported impediments. While access to finance is not the most reported obstacle, reporting it has the highest information content. Moreover, the signal intensifies when it is given by “weaker” firms, defined as those that are smaller, and/or more indebted, and/or less profitable and/or with lower liquidity positions. From a policy standpoint, our findings suggest that survey-based information can be a useful input to complement both macro and micro hard data and better inform the design of targeted policies to support investment.
G30|Does trust among banks matter for bilateral trade? Evidence from shocks in the interbank market|Do financial crises have an impact on trade flows via a shock to corporate risk or to bank risk? Focusing on Italy’s exports during a period characterized by both the global financial crisis and by the sovereign debt crisis, we exploit the prediction of standard trade models according to which financial shocks should be magnified by the time needed to ship a good to the importer’s country and by sector-level financial vulnerability. We also use bank-pair data on Italian banks’ assets and liabilities vis-à-vis their foreign bank counterparts in a specific country to construct proxies for the availability of trade finance in a given market. We find evidence of a negative impact of financial shocks on exports, especially to more distant countries and in more financially vulnerable sectors. The main channels seem to be mainly related to an increase in corporate risk (reflecting shocks to bank finance and to buyer-supplier trade credit), while the ‘contagion effect’ of shocks stemming from bank risk seems to be much less significant.
G30|Estimating Cross-Industry Cross-Country Interaction Models Using Benchmark Industry Characteristics|"Cross-industry cross-country models are applied widely in economics. For example, to investigate the effect of financial development on economic growth or the effect of institutional quality on international trade. The literature estimates the effect of interest by examining the interaction between country characteristics|for example, financial development or institutional quality -and theoretically relevant technological industry characteristics- for example, dependence on external finance or relationship-specific inputs. As the relevant industry characteristics are unobservable for most countries, they are proxied by industry characteristics of a benchmark country. We analyze this approach when there is cross-country heterogeneity in technological industry characteristics. First, we show that the estimation approach in the literature is biased and that the bias cannot be signed if technologically similar countries are similar in terms of other characteristics. Second, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for identification of the effect of interest. Third, we use the new identification approach to reestimate the impact of institutional quality on comparative advantage in industries that rely on relationship-specific inputs."
G30|The impact of financial development on income inequality: A quantile regression approach|In a panel of 121 countries, the impact of financial development on income inequality appears to change with a country’s level of income. It promotes equality across inequality quantiles in upper-middle income countries, and it promotes inequality across inequality quantiles in low- and high-income countries.
G30|Shareholder risk-taking incentives in the presence of contingent capital|This paper presents a model of shareholders’ willingness to exert effort to reduce the likelihood of bank distress, and the implications of the presence of contingent convertible (CoCo) bonds in the liabilities structure of a bank. Consistent with the existing literature, we show that the direction of the wealth transfer at the conversion of CoCo bonds determines their impact on shareholder risk-taking incentives. We also find that ‘anytime’ CoCos (CoCo bonds trigger-able anytime at the discretion of managers) have a minor advantage over regulator CoCo bonds, and that quality of capital requirements can reduce the risk-taking incentives of shareholders. We argue that shareholders can also use manager-specific CoCo bonds to reduce the riskiness of the bank activities. The issuance of such bonds can increase the resilience of individual banks and the whole banking system. Regulators can use restrictions on conversion rates and/or requirements on the quality of capital to address the impact of CoCo bonds issuance on risk-taking incentives.
G30|Possibilities of identifying distortion of the calculation basis for the payment of dividend on the basis of accounting|Financial earning from dividends and profit shares are important income for the owners. From the business corporation perspective is the setting of dividend policy important for keeping the financial stability and solvency of the corporation. The most important indicator of the financial performance of the corporation is the profit reached. Czech accounting rules allow to account some revenue and expenses of on the basis of estimates so that all expenses and revenue are accounted in the period which is related in matter and time. These items are often a means for creative distortion of the economic result with the aim to reach the required level of covenants that lead to payment of benefits, directors rewards and annuals rewards for the management and also for the overvaluating of the economic result as one of the variables for the calculation base for the payment of dividends. Current legislation for setting the calculation base for the payment of dividends is not satisfactory and does not protect against disproportional outflow of financial means in the form of dividends for the owners. The paper concentrates on the possibility of identifying the distortion of the calculation base for the payment of dividends and on the proposal of a modification of the calculation base for the payment of dividends which would respect the legal right of the owners but also protect the financial stability of the business corporation and ensure its growth during its existence and to limit the outflow of money abroad. Key words: calculation base for the payment of dividends, net profit, payment ratio, modified reporting, NTEDP (net total earning for dividend payments), tests of profitability and own capital, accounting.
G30|Takeover, Distress, and Equity Issuance: Evidence from Korea|We study the motive and the economic effects of takeover in Korea, which has not been actively studied due to difficulties in collecting data. Using the data of largest shareholder change disclosed in the Korea Exchange's public disclosure system in 2004-2017, we estimate logit regressions of the likelihood that the firms to be a target. We also estimate panel regressions to examine the effect of takeovers on financial performances. The results show that takeovers in Korea occur in relation to financial distress, and that some companies tend to be targeted repeatedly. However, after the takeover, the financial distress is not resolved, indicating poor performance of takeovers motivated by financial distress.
G30|Estimating Cross-Industry Cross-Country Interaction Models Using Benchmark Industry Characteristics|Cross-industry cross-country models are applied widely in economics. For example, to investigate the effect of financial development on economic growth or the effect of institutional quality on international trade. The literature estimates the effect of interest by examining the interaction between country characteristicsâ€”for example, financial development or institutional qualityâ€”and theoretically relevant technological industry characteristicsâ€”for example, dependence on external finance or relationship-specific inputs. As the relevant industry characteristics are unobservable for most countries, they are proxied by industry characteristics of a benchmark country. We analyze this approach when there is cross-country heterogeneity in technological industry characteristics. First, we show that the estimation approach in the literature is biased and that the bias cannot be signed if technologically similar countries are similar in terms of other characteristics. Second, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for identification of the effect of interest. Third, we use the new identification approach to reestimate the impact of institutional quality on comparative advantage in industries that rely on relationship-specific inputs.
G30|A theory of outside equity: Financing multiple projects|It is well known that a debt contract provides strong incentives to a borrower who is holding residual claims to exert high levels of effort. This result carries over to the case when the borrower seeks funds for multiple projects where now the lender can use cross-pledging to further enhance incentives. More specifically, the lender can now condition the borrower’s reward on the joint performance of all projects. In this Nottingham School of Economics working paper Spiros Bougheas and Tianxi Wang consider the case of multiple project finance when the borrower also has better information than the lender about the contribution of her effort on each project’s success. The main result of the paper is that when the borrower cannot improve the likelihood of success of some projects by exerting effort cross-pledging can destroy incentives to exert effort even on those projects that can benefit from such effort. Then when at the time when the contract is signed there is a high likelihood that the portfolio of projects might be a mix of both types then the optimal finance response is outside equity which offers incentives to the borrower to exert effort whenever a project can benefit from it. The paper also shows that providing maximal incentives is not always optimal.
G30|Distressed banks, distorted decisions?|"Exploiting differences in pre-crisis business banking relationships, we present evidence to suggest that restricted credit availability following the 2008 financial crisis increased the rate of business failure in the United Kingdom. But rather than ""cleansing the economy by accelerating the exit of the least productive businesses, we find that tighter credit conditions resulted in some businesses failing despite being more productive than their surviving competitors. We also find evidence that distressed banks protected highly leveraged, low productivity businesses from failure."
G30|Sticking around Too Long? Dynamics of the Benefits of Dual-Class Voting|Using a new dataset of corporate voting-rights from 1971 to 2015, we find that young dual-class firms trade at a premium and operate at least as efficiently as young single-class firms. As dual-class firms mature, their valuation declines, and they become less efficient in their margins, innovation, and labor productivity compared to their single-class counterparts. Voting premiums increase with firm age, suggesting that private benefits increase over maturity. Most sunset provisions that dual-class firms adopt are ineffective. Our findings suggest that effective, time-consistent sunset provisions would be based on age or on inferior shareholders’ periodic right to eliminate dual-class voting.
G30|What Do Insiders Know? Evidence from Insider Trading Around Share Repurchases and SEOs|We examine the nature of information contained in insider trades prior to corporate events. Insiders’ net buying increases before open market share repurchase announcements and decreases before SEOs. Higher insider net buying is associated with better post-event operating performance, a reduction in undervaluation, and, for repurchases, lower post-event cost of capital. Insider trading predicts announcement returns and, for repurchases, the long-term drift following events. Overall, our results suggest that insider trades before corporate events contain information about changes both in fundamentals and in investor sentiment. Information about fundamentals is incorporated slowly into prices, while information about mispricing is incorporated faster.
G30|Strategic Trading As a Response to Short Sellers|We study empirically informed traders’ reaction to the presence of short sellers in the market. We find that investors with positive views on a stock strategically slow down their trades when short sellers are present in the same stock. Moreover, they purchase larger amounts to take advantage of the price decline induced by short sellers. Furthermore, they break up their buy trades across multiple brokers, suggesting that they wish to hide from the short sellers. This behavior may impact price discovery, as we find a sizeable reduction of positive information impounding for stocks more exposed to short selling during information sensitive periods. The evidence is confirmed exploiting exogenous variation in short interest provided by the Reg SHO Pilot Program. The findings have relevance for the regulatory debate on the market impact of short selling.
G30|Are U.S. Industries Becoming More Concentrated?|In the last two decades, over 75% of U.S. industries have experienced an increase in concentration levels. We find that firms in industries with the largest increases in product market concentration have enjoyed higher profit margins and more profitable M&A deals. At the same time, we do not find evidence of a significant increase in operational efficiency, which suggests that market power is becoming an important source of value. These findings are robust to the inclusion of private firms, factors that account for foreign competition, as well as to the use of alternative measures of concentration. We also show that the higher profit margins associated with an increase in concentration are reflected in higher returns to shareholders. Overall, our results suggest that the nature of U.S. product markets has undergone a shift that has potentially weakened competition across the majority of industries.
G30|Information Revelation Through Regulatory Process: Interactions Between the SEC and Companies Ahead of the IPO|The regulator plays an active role in the IPO process via its pre-IPO communications with firms, writing 3.8 comment letters per company. To evaluate the regulator’s input, we analyze these communications between the SEC and firms using LDA-analysis and KL-divergence. Main topics of SEC concerns map closely into the regulator’s stated mandate: companies increase prospectus disclosures within precise topics of SEC concern. Questions related to revenue recognition are most informative about company valuation. These concerns are not independently uncovered by investors. This dynamic process of information disclosure results in increased transparency, but at a cost of delays in going public.
G30|Corporate Capture of Blockchain Governance| We develop a theory of blockchain governance. In our model, the proof-of-work system, which is the most common set of rules for validating transactions in blockchains, creates an industrial ecosystem with specialized suppliers of goods and services. We analyze the two-way interactions between blockchain governance and the market structure of the industries in the blockchain ecosystem. Our main result is that the proof-of-work system leads to a situation where the governance of the blockchain is captured by a large firm.
G30|Equity Finance: Matching Liability to Power|There is widespread concern that the bonus culture for senior managers in limited liability companies is having adverse effects, e.g. on risk-taking, leverage and lower longer-term investment. The moral hazard of limited liability was appreciated in the 19th century, when unlimited or multiple liability, especially for bankers, was widely adopted. Whereas outside, notably retail, investors still need the protection of limited liability, we advocate moving towards a two-tier equity system, primarily for banks, with insiders, senior managers and others with influence over corporate decisions, becoming subject to multiple liability. But the transition costs of doing so suddenly would be great, so our proposal is to start by applying this initially just to Systemically Important Financial Intermediaries.
G30|Disruption and Credit Markets|In the past thirty years, defaults on corporate bonds have been substantially higher than the historical average. We show that this increase in credit risk can be largely attributed to an increase in the rate at which new and fast-growing firms displace incumbents (a phenomenon sometimes referred to as 'disruptive innovation'). Industries with a lager presence of firms newly listed on the stock market, as well as industries that receive funding from venture capital, have a higher loss of revenue market share for established firms and subsequently see a rise in corporate bond defaults. Patent filings by individuals as opposed to corporations also predict defaults. These results are not affected by inclusion of controls for industry exposure to offshore manufacturing.
G30|Investor Ideology|"We estimate institutional investor preferences based on their proxy voting records in publicly listed Russell 3000 firms. We employ a spatial model of proxy voting, the W-NOMINATE method for scaling legislatures, and map institutional investors onto a left-right dimension based on their votes for fiscal year 2012. The far-left are socially responsible and the far-right are ""money conscious"" investors. Significant ideological differences reflect an absence of shareholder unanimity. The proxy adviser ISS, similar to a political leader, makes voting recommendations that place it in the center; to the left of most mutual funds. Public pension funds and other investors on the left support a more social and environment-friendly orientation of the firm and fewer executive compensation proposals. A second dimension reflects a more traditional governance view, with management disciplinarian investors, the proxy adviser Glass-Lewis among them, pitted against more management friendly ones."
G30|The transmission channels of unconventional monetary policy: Evidence from a change in collateral requirements in France|Using a bank-firm level credit registry combined with firm-level balance sheet data we establish the presence of heterogeneity in the effects of unconventional monetary policy transmission. We examine the consequences of a loosening in the collateral eligibility requirement for credit refinancing in France. The policy was designed to affect bank lending positively. We expect a linear increase in lending and an additional increase in loans to firms with newly acceptable rating. We find a large heterogeneity of the monetary policy transmission including the unexpected reduction of lending by the banks benefiting the most from the policy. These are small, risk-averse banks whose foremost concern after the recession was to strengthen their balance sheets. Banks least affected by the policy respond with a reduction in credit to low risk borrowers in reaction to the change in the market structure. Last we document heterogenous effects of the policy on firms depending on their size.
G30|Corporate Control around the World|We provide an anatomy of corporate control around the world after tracing controlling shareholders for thousands listed firms from 127 countries between 2004 and 2012. The analysis reveals considerable and persistent differences across and within regions, as well as across legal families. Government and family control is pervasive in civil-law countries. Equity blocks in widely-held corporations are commonplace, but less so in common-law countries. These patterns apply to large, medium, and small listed firms. In contrast, the association between income and corporate control is highly heterogeneous; the correlation is strong among big and especially very large firms, but absent for medium and small listed firms. We then examine the association between corporate control and various institutional features. Shareholder rights against insiders' self-dealing activities correlate strongly with corporate control, though legal formalism and creditor rights less so. Corporate control is strongly related to labor market regulations, concerning, among others, the stringency of employment contracts, the power and extent of unions. The large sample correlations, thus, offer support to both legal origin and political-development theories of financial development.

G30|Dividend Policy Decisions and Ownership Concentration: Evidence from Thai Public Companies|In this paper we examine the relationship between ownership concentration and dividend policy for Thai publicly listed companies. High family ownership firms have higher dividend payouts than low family ownership firms, which we interpret to mean high family ownership firms follow a more rational dividend policy. This finding is consistent with the prediction that agency conflicts between the managers and shareholders are lower at firms with a controlling shareholder. The evidence is robust through different econometric specifications, robust when the level used to determine the extent of family ownership (family control) is lowered to 10 percent of the outstanding shares, and robust to the inclusion of the ownership wedge as a proxy for the severity of agency conflicts.
G30|Credit rating dynamics: evidence from a natural experiment|This paper investigates the behaviour of credit rating agencies (CRAs) using a natural experiment in monetary policy. Speciﬁcally, we exploit the corporate QE of the Eurosystem and its rating-based speciﬁc design which generates exogenous variation in the probability for a bond of becoming eligible for outright purchases. We show that after the launch of the policy, rating upgrades were mostly noticeable for bonds initially located below, but close to, the eligibility frontier. In line with the theory, rating activity is concentrated precisely on the territory where the incentives of market participants are expected to be more sensitive to the policy design. Complementing the evidence on the effectiveness of non-standard measures, our ﬁndings contribute to better assessing the consequences of the explicit (but not exclusive) reliance on CRAs ratings by central banks when designing monetary policy.

G30|Why Do Firms Use Equity-Based Pay? Managerial Compensation and Stock Price Informativeness|We study the motive of using equity-based pay in executive compensation: the risk-sharing motive versus the performance-measuring motive. The empirical design goes through the relationship between equity-based pay and stock price informativeness (SPI). We find equity-based pay decreases in SPI, which is consistent with the risk-sharing motive but inconsistent with the performance-measuring motive. The SPI effect on compensation is stronger in financially-constrained firms, more diversified firms, and firms with less product market competition. SPI increases pay efficiency through a larger proportion of option pay, fewer perquisites, and greater pay-for-skill. We address potential endogeneity concerns by investigating the changes in compensation of managers switching between firms with different SPI.
G30|The Role of Stock Price Informativeness in Compensation Complexity|We study the effect of stock price informativeness (SPI) on executive compensation complexity. Using textual analysis of SEC proxy statements to construct compensation complexity measures for US public firms, we find strong evidence that higher SPI reduces pay complexity. We then use mutual fund redemption as an exogenous decrease in SPI to address endogeneity concerns. When fund flow pressure is high, pay includes more performance metrics, a greater number of vesting periods, and options with longer vesting periods. When stock prices convey information more effectively, executive pay is simpler.
G30|Peer Group Choice and Chief Executive Officer Compensation|We examine the selection of peer groups that boards of directors use when setting the level of CEO compensation. This choice is controversial because it is difficult to ascertain whether peer groups are selected to (i) attract and retain top executive talent or (ii) enable rent extraction by inappropriately increasing CEO compensation. In contrast to prior research, our analysis utilizes the degree to which the observed compensation level of peers in the portfolio is unusual relative to all potential portfolios of peers the board of directors could have reasonably selected. Using a sample of 10,235 firm-year observations from 2008 to 2014, we estimate roughly 33% of board of directorsâ€™ choices appear to be associated with rent extraction, whereas the remaining 67% are associated with attracting and retaining high-quality CEO talent. Relative to firms that appear to select peers for aspirational labor market reasons, we find rent extraction firms have more structural governance concerns and realized negative governance outcomes. Over our sample period, we estimate the aggregate excess pay for rent extraction firms is approximately $5.4 billion, or 38% of their total pay.

G30|Dependence Structure of Volatility and Illiquidity on Vienna and Warsaw Stock Exchanges|In this paper, the results of an investigation into the relationship between the illiquidity and realized volatility of the time series of stocks listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) and Vienna Stock Exchange (VSE) are presented. The first measure of illiquidity is the well-known Amihud ratio (Amihud, 2002) called AMI, and the second is a transformation of the Liquidity Index (Danyliv et al., 2014) called ILLIX. In the study, the results of the detection of the structural breaks (and their removal), the calculation of long memory, and finally the dependence structure of the illiquidity and realized volatility by the copulas are also demonstrated. Both types of series exhibit structural breaks and long-memory properties. Despite the similarities in the illiquidity measures, their associations with the realized volatility is different. The dependence structures described by the copulas for the AMI-realized volatility pairs show a dependence in the upper tails; i.e., the high values of illiquidity are related to the high volatility. However, in the case of the ILLIX-realized volatility pairs, the dependence was detected in the lower tail; i.e., the low ILLIX is accompanied by the low realized volatility.
G30|The Human-Centred Business Model and Hybrid Business Forms: A Primer and a Roadmap|The paper was written as part of the preliminary research for the Human Centred Business Model Project, a project developed within the Global Forum on Law, Justice and Development and now supported by the OECD Development Centre. In a preliminary fashion, the paper skims the surface of â€˜socialâ€™ businesses, in the broadest sense, around the world, identifying some general trends and commonalities and some differences. The paper covers jurisdictions from North and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia and describes the organisations that can be used to carry out social business.
G30|Corporate Governance disclosure and implication in the financial audit of banks in Romania|Thispaperaims topresents the relevant aspects regarding the implementation of principles and rulesof corporate governance in the Romanian banking system.The purpose of the articleis to investigate the theoretical and legislative basis whichcontrolsthis area, but also research practical cases on this subject. Based on the review of nationaland international literature, the case study was based on a sample of 17 commercial banks from Romania.Usingcollected data from the official banks' websites, it was analyzed the details of chosen corporate governance elements: the management system, the shareholder and organizational structure, the financial control and audit, as well as if the banks offer disclosure for theapplicable governance codes. The main conclusion which resultsfrom thisstudy case is that,the information available to public provides details about the management structure and the audit department, but this information is not very detailed, the information about the professional experience of the members or the benefits that these credit institutions obtained from the application of corporate governance codes are not described, in some cases even missing.
G30|The differences of corporate governance influence on state-owned enterprise and non-state-owned entrerprise’s performance: the case of Indonesia|This research aims to analyze the influence of audit committee, institutional ownership, and managerial ownership towards company’svalue. Moreover, it also analyzes the differencesof influenceon state-owned enterprise (SEO)and non SEO companieswhich are registered in Indonesian Stock Exchange. The sample consists of 48 SEO companies and 36 non SEO companiesin Indonesian Stock Exchange. Purposing sampling method is used in this research. The used technique data analysis is linear regression. The result of this research shows that audit committeehassignificant influence on SEO value, while in non SEO it does not influenceperformance. In SEOcompanies, institutional ownership does not influence company value while in non SEOcompany it does. Managerial ownership does not show any influenceson both SEOand non SEOcompanies. This research is the first research which compares the impact of corporate governance implementation on Indonesia SEOand non-SEOcompanies’value. This research implies that strengtheningcorporate governance aspects between SEOand non SEOcompaniesin order to increase the company’svalueis needed.
G30|Age of Firms and the Value of Analyst Recommendation|Objective - This paper assesses the value of information disclosure in Malaysian analyst reports by examining three categories of firms, according to their age (young, medium and old). Methodology/Technique - The study uses a market-adjusted method to calculate the cumulative abnormal return and panel regression to test the research objective. The results from the unbalanced panel data reveals that not all information contained in the analyst reports is able to detect the movement in stock returns. Finding - Younger firms recorded two significant results (ROE and SPR) whereas among medium aged firms, TP, CFP, SPR, and MC all had an impact on CAR. The older firms showed that TP, EF, ROE and SPKLCI had an impact on CAR. Novelty – This qualitative inquiry reveals that Malaysian analyst reports tend to disclose information based on simple statistical analyses to formulate recommendations whilst ignoring other significant qualitative information.
G30|The Effect of Related Party Transactions through Opportunistic Behaviour Management to Increase Firm Value|Objective - This research aims to determine and analyze related party transactions to increase firm value through opportunistic behaviour management by conducting earnings management on manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange between 2015 and 2018. Methodology/Technique – There are 34 companies that fulfill the requirements to become the sample of this study. The method applied in analyzing the data is verification using path analysis. Findings – The results of the research show that related party transactions do not have any significant effect on firm value however it indicates a positive impact. Moreover, related party transactions do not have any significant impact on earning management yet it gives a negative impact on earning management. Novelty – The influence of earnings management shows a positive impact on firm value while it shows no signs of positive impact on firm value. The analysis shows that the value of the indirect impact of related party transactions through earnings management towards firm value is negative being 0.022 smaller than the direct impact of related party transaction toward firm value which is 0.053. This indicates that related party transactions through earnings management have no significant impact on firm value.
G30|Real Estate Prices and Corporate Investment: Theory and Evidence of Heterogeneous Effects across Firms|In this paper, we investigate the effect of real estate prices on productive investment. We build a theoretical framework of firms' investment with credit rationing and real estate collateral. We show that real estate prices affect firms' borrowing capacities through two channels. An increase in real estate prices raises the value of the firms' pledgeable assets and mitigates the agency problem characterizing the creditor–entrepreneur relationship. It simultaneously cuts the expected profit due to the increase in the cost of inputs. We test our theoretical predictions using a large French database. We do find heterogeneous effects of real estate prices on productive investment depending on the position of the firms in the sectoral distributions of real estate holdings.
G30|Should We Worry about the Decline of the Public Corporation? A Brief Survey of the Economics and External Effects of the Stock Market|In recent years, the number of listed companies has been declining in many countries across the world. This paper provides a selective survey of the literature on the real economic effects of the stock market to assess the potential effects of this decline and determine whether it is likely to continue. The leading economic role of the stock market’s primary market, in which firms raise capital by issuing new shares, is to help growing firms secure financing. We discuss providing and certifying information, coordinating investors, and easing the redeployment of capital as the means through which capital allocation can be achieved efficiently. The main economic role of the stock market’s secondary market, the trade in existing shares, is to provide liquidity to shareholders, to aid in price discovery, and to provide diversification opportunities. Positive external effects from an active stock market may arise on consumers, labour and private firm due to increased corporate investment, more social responsible business strategies and a more positive business climate. Negative external effects on capital allocation and productivity can arise from short-termism, market mispricing, and increased cross-ownership. Local stock markets can spur innovation and foreign direct investment (FDI) and reduce the risk of early cross-border acquisitions. Given the myriad of useful economic functions the stock market performs, a future entirely absent of public companies is difficult to imagine and the decline is therefore likely at some point to come to an end. Whether we need to worry about the decline depends on the relative importance of the positive and negative external effects, a topic we feel warrants more research.
G30|Is Positive Sentiment in Corporate Annual Reports Informative? Evidence from Deep Learning|We use a novel text classification approach from deep learning to more accurately measure sentiment in a large sample of 10-Ks. In contrast to most prior literature, we find that positive, and negative, sentiment predicts abnormal return and abnormal trading volume around 10-K filing date and future firm fundamentals and policies. Our results suggest that the qualitative information contained in corporate annual reports is richer than previously found. Both positive and negative sentiments are informative when measured accurately, but they do not have symmetric implications, suggesting that a net sentiment measure advocated by prior studies would be less informative.
G30|Does board gender diversity influence firm profitability? A control function approach|We investigate the relation between board gender diversity and firm profitability using the control function (CF) approach recently suggested by Wooldridge (2015). The CF method takes account of the problem of endogenous explanatory variables that have potential to bias the results. Using a sample of firms that made up the S&P 500 over the period 2004-2015, we find that the presence of women on corporate boards (measured either by the percentage of female directors on corporate boards or the Blau index of heterogeneity) has a positive and significant (at the 1% level) effect on firm profitability (measured by the return on assets). We compare our results to more traditional approaches (such as pooled OLS or the fixed-effects model). Through this study, we shed light on the effect of women on corporate boards on firm performance, as it is still a controversial issue (Post and Byron, 2015).
G30|Loss of a lending relationship: shock or relief?|We use loan-level data and a novel identification setting – closures of banks – to study how forced break-ups of lending relationships affect firms’ borrowing costs. We find that after a financially distressed bank closed and its best borrowers were exogenously forced to switch, their borrowing costs dropped steeply and converged to the market’s average. We document no such effect when a healthy bank closed. This suggests that distressed banks can use informational monopoly power to hold up and exploit their best borrowers. Apparently, closures of such banks can release the best-quality firms from the hold-up and allow borrowing cheaper elsewhere.
G30|Real Option Exercise: Empirical Evidence|We study when and why firms exercise real options. Using detailed project-level investment data, we find that the likelihood that a firm exercises a real option is strongly related to peer exercise behavior. Peer exercise decisions are as important in explaining exercise behavior as variables commonly associated with standard real option theories, such as volatility. We identify peer effects using localized exogenous variation in peer project exercise decisions and find evidence consistent with information externalities being important for exercise behavior.
G30|Investor Ideology|We estimate institutional investor preferences based on their proxy voting records in publicly listed Russell 3000 firms. We employ a spatial model of proxy voting, the W-NOMINATE method for scaling legislatures, and map institutional investors onto a left-right dimension based on their votes for fiscal year 2012. The far-left are socially responsible and the far-right are “money conscious” investors. Significant ideological differences reflect an absence of shareholder unanimity. The proxy adviser ISS, similar to a political leader, makes voting recommendations that place it in the center; to the left of most mutual funds. Public pension funds and other investors on the left support a more social and environment-friendly orientation of the firm and fewer executive compensation proposals. A second dimension reflects a more traditional governance view, with management disciplinarian investors, the proxy adviser Glass-Lewis among them, pitted against more management friendly ones.
G30|Communication within Banking Organizations and Small Business Lending|We investigate how communication within banks affects small business lending. Using travel time between a bank’s headquarters and its branches to proxy for the costs of communicating soft information, we exploit shocks to these travel times to evaluate the impact of within bank communication costs on small business loans. Consistent with Stein’s (2002) model of the transmission of soft information across a bank’s hierarchies, we find that reducing headquarters-branch travel time boosts small business lending in the branch’s county. Several extensions suggest that new airline routes facilitate the transmission of soft information, boosting small firm lending.
G30|Acquisition Prices and the Measurement of Intangible Capital|We use 1,521 acquisition purchase price allocations to estimate intangible capital stocks. The estimated depreciation of knowledge capital (R&D) is 32%, some 28% of SG&A represents investment in organizational capital and parameter estimates exhibit significant industry variation. Aggregating these accounts, 75% of intangibles come from organizational capital, and total stocks are 10% smaller versus stocks using prior parameters. Adjusting for intangibles, average market-to-book falls from 1.74 to an average of one. Relative to existing approaches, our stocks improve the explanatory power of enterprise value, human capital and brand rankings, while exhibiting the expected correlations with patent valuations and investment rates.
G30|Adoption of CSR and Sustainability Reporting Standards: Economic Analysis and Review|This study provides an economic analysis of the determinants and consequences of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability reporting. To frame our analysis, we consider a widespread mandatory adoption of CSR reporting standards in the United States. The study focuses on the economic effects of standards for disclosure and reporting, not on the effects of CSR activities and policies themselves. It draws on an extensive review of the relevant academic (CSR and non-CSR) literatures in accounting, economics, finance, and management. Based on a discussion of the fundamental economic forces at play and the key features and determinants of (voluntary) CSR reporting, we derive and evaluate possible economic consequences, including capital-market effects for select stakeholders as well as potential firm responses and real effects in firm behavior. We also highlight issues related to the implementation and enforcement of CSR reporting standards. Our analysis yields a number of insights that are relevant to the current debate on CSR and sustainability reporting and provides scholars with avenues for future research.
G30|Employee Disputes and Innovation Performance: Evidence from Pharmaceutical Industry|In this study, we use a hand-collected dataset of employee lawsuits to understand the effect of employee allegations on firms’ innovation in a human capital-intensive industry. We gather more than 2,293 employee disputes between 2000 and 2015 and test the relationship between employee lawsuits and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) product approvals in the pharmaceutical industry. We find that employee disputes lower the total number of FDA-approved products. We document that firms with frequent employee allegations maintain low innovation outcomes. Additional results show that case characteristics are an important determinant of FDA approvals; labor unions and case duration delay time-to-approval of submitted products, which may explain the deteriorated innovation outcomes. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of employee treatment in the workplace environment, which is ultimately related to firms’ innovation performance.
G30|Institutional Monitoring and Litigation Risk: Evidence from Employee Disputes|In this study, we investigate how institutional investors help mitigate business-related risks in a corporate environment. Using a large sample of employment disputes, litigations, and court cases, we find that institutional investors play a significant role in reducing employment litigation. We observe that firms with larger shares of institutional ownership have a lower incidence of employment lawsuits and that long-term institutional investors are more effective at decreasing employee mistreatment. Our results suggest that institutional investors can improve the employee work environment and help mitigate future employee litigation. The improvement of employee work conditions has been shown to increase a firm’s value through increased employee output, reduced litigation, and direct and indirect costs. Our results shed light on the effectiveness of institutional monitoring on a firm’s litigation risk.
G30|A Theory of Outside Equity: Financing Multiple Projects|In the financial economics literature debt contracts provide efficient solutions for addressing managerial moral hazard problems. We analyze a model with multiple projects where the manager obtains private information about their quality after the contract with investors is agreed. The likelihood of success of each project depends on both its quality and the level of effort exerted on it by the manager. We find that, depending on the distribution of the quality shock, the optimal financial contract can be either debt or equity.
G30|The Potential for Blockchain Technology in Corporate Governance|Beyond bitcoin, blockchain technology has acquired attention and importance in its own right. Today, it is conceptually accepted that blockchain stands out as a disruptive technology that will change a number of processes in financial services and could in turn impact corporate governance. This paper explores the recent applications of blockchain technology in financial services and outlines regulatory responses, to set the scene for future work in this area on corporate governance. This paper provided background for the Corporate Governance Committee’s roundtable discussion on blockchain technology and the implementation of the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance on 10 April 2018. A subsequent presentation of the paper was given at the OECD Workshop on Digital Financial Assets on the 16 May 2018, and at the OECD-Asian Roundtable on Corporate Governance in Malaysia on 7-8 November 2018. This work also provides a contribution to the work of the OECD Blockchain Policy Centre.
G30|Corporate Social Responsibility and Profit Shifting|In this work we investigate the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and profit shifting. First, we employ worldwide data for parent firms and their foreign subsidiaries to derive a profit shifting measure. Then, drawing on legitimacy theory and risk-management strategy, we find corporate social responsibility to be positively correlated with profit shifting. In addition, we find this relationship to be stronger in parent firms in countries under the territorial tax system. We perform a battery of sensitivity tests and robustness checks to corroborate our findings. By and large, our results suggest that multinational firms with higher CSR scores shift larger amounts of profits to their low-tax foreign subsidiaries, potentially indicating strategic planning in the choice of CSR investments by multinational enterprises.
G30|Using Value-at-Risk for effective energy portfolio risk management|It is evident that the prediction of future variance through advanced GARCH type models is essential for an effective energy portfolio risk management. Still it fails to provide a clear view on the specific amount of capital that is at risk on behalf of the investor or any party directly affected by the price fluctuations of specific or multiple energy commodities. Thus, it is necessary for risk managers to make one further step, determining the most robust and effective approach that will enable them to precisely monitor and accurately estimate the portfolio’s Value-at-Risk, which by definition provides a good measure of the total actual amount at stake. Nevertheless, despite the variety of the variance models that have been developed and the relative VaR methodologies, the vast majority of the researchers conclude that there is no model or specific methodology that outperforms all the others. On the contrary, the best approach to minimize risk and accurately forecast the future potential losses is to adopt that specific methodology that will be able to take into consideration the particular characteristic features regarding the trade of energy products.
G30|CAPM: A Tale of Two Versions|Categorization is the mental operation by which brain classifies objects and events. We do not experience the world as a series of unique events. Rather, we make sense of our experiences within a framework of categories that represent prior knowledge. Given that categorization is the core of cognition, we argue that the traditional view that each firm is viewed in isolation needs to be altered. Instead, like every other object they ever come across, investors view each firm within a framework of categories that represent prior knowledge. This involves sorting a firm into a category based on a subset of firm-attributes. Such categorization-relevant attributes are refined whereas other firm-attributes are confounded with the category-exemplar. Two versions of CAPM arise as a result. In the first version, the relationship between average excess return and stock beta is flat (possibly negative). Value effect and size premium (controlling for quality) arise in this version. In the second version, the relationship is strongly positive. The two-version CAPM accounts for several recent empirical findings including fundamentally different intraday vs overnight behavior, as well as behavior on macroeconomic announcement days. The tug-of-war dynamics of the two versions also suggest that momentum is expected to be an overnight phenomenon, which is consistent with empirical findings. We argue that, perhaps, our best shot at observing classical CAPM in its full glory is a laboratory experiment with subjects who have difficulty categorizing (such as in autism spectrum disorders).
G30|Peluang dan Tantangan Financial Technologi Syariah di Indonesia|This article describes how the opportunities and challenges of FinTech Sharia in the face of the industrial revolution 4.0. By using a negation approach, this study concludes that FinTech Sharia which is the development of technological innovations that are in accordance with sharia provisions and becomes a solution to avoid interest transactions. The synergy between the Islamic financial sector and information technology innovation should also be a challenge as well as an opportunity for all actors in the Islamic finance industry to catch up with the conventional financial industry.
G30|Opportunities and Challenges of Sharia Technology Financials in Indonesia|This article describes how the opportunities and challenges of FinTech Sharia in the face of the industrial revolution 4.0. By using a negation approach, this study concludes that FinTech Sharia which is the development of technological innovations that are in accordance with sharia provisions and becomes a solution to avoid interest transactions. The synergy between the Islamic financial sector and information technology innovation should also be a challenge as well as an opportunity for all actors in the Islamic finance industry to catch up with the conventional financial industry.
G30|Companies characteristics and environmental quality disclosure in Indonesia|The size of the company (size) is a factor that affects quality disclosure of environmental impacts. This is related to the number of assets owned by the company where large companies need more funds in managing their operations compared to smaller companies. Companies with large sizes also tend to pay more attention to the quality of disclosure of the company's environmental impact to obtain a good impression from stakeholders. This study aims to obtain empirical evidence about the characteristics of companies that influence the quality of disclosure of the company's environmental impact.
G30|Determinants of capital structure decisions in Indonesia|The aims of this study are to examine the effect of return on equity (ROE), current ratios (CR), tangibility, non-debt tax shields (NDTS) and growth opportunities (GO) on the debt to equity ratio of the Indonesian Stock Exchange Manufacturing Sector. This study uses data analysis techniques with multiple linear regression models using a panel data analysis mechanism. The object of this research is manufacturing companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange with a span of observational studies is from 2008 - 2012. The sampling technique used was purposive sampling technique. In testing multiple regression models using panel data analysis used a statistical software tool namely E-views series 4. Panel data testing was carried out in 3 tests, namely Pooled Least Squared (PLS) Test, Fixed Effect Model (FEM) and Random Effect Model (REM) The results of the sample selection are based on 88 companies from the total of 125 companies. Every data from this research is collected from the sources of the Indonesian Capital Market Directory (ICMD). Multiple regression testing begins with testing the estimation of Pooled Least Square (PLS) and Fixed Effect Model (FEM) and the results of the Chow-Test test stated that FEM is better than PLS. Also, Random Effect Model (REM) testing and Hausman showed that REM is a better model in analyzing this research data, so that this study is no longer testing classical assumptions. Based on the results of the tests conducted, the results show that the research model formed from the independent variable return on equity (ROE), current ratio (CR), tangibility, non-debt tax shields (NDTS) and growth opportunities (GO) affected the debt to equity ratio (DER) in the manufacturing sector of companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in the period 2008 to 2012. Also, partially variable which has a significant effect and in accordance with the theory is only the ROE variable where the variable has a negative effect.
G30|The Evaluation of Model Risk for Probability of Default and Expected Loss|The quanti�cation of model risk is still in its infancy. This paper provides an operational quanti�cation of this risk for credit portfolio, when the objective is to approximate the average loss. The methodology is easy to implement and does not require the construction of any worst-case model. The required capital computed to cover for model risk depends on three components, that are an estimated impact of the incorrect model, an evaluated risk of inaccurate estimation of model risk and the prediction error hedge factor. The approach is illustrated by an application to a portfolio of corporate loans segmented by grades.
G30|Wage determination and fixed capital investment in an imperfect financial market: the case of China|The purpose of this paper is to examine how wage decisions and fixed asset investments are determined under China’s imperfect financial market. In addition, we also investigate what kind of interrelationship exists between wage determination and fixed asset investment. To test the hypothesis, we collect aggregate data on wages, the financial market, and fixed asset investment by province, sector, and ownership type from several statistical yearbooks. The main results are (1) while the rise in financial market maturity has led to rising wage levels for state-owned enterprises, this phenomenon is not observed in the private sector, (2) retained earnings are positively correlated with capital investment, indicating that China’s financial market is incomplete. Furthermore, in the private sector, there is a strong reliance on internal reserves that is not observed in the state-owned sector, suggesting that the private sector is differentially treated in the financial market. (3) In the state-owned sector, wage growth has a positive correlation with fixed assets, while in the nonstate-owned sector this relationship is not observed. This implies that in the nonstate-owned sector the underpayment of wages may be used as a survival strategy to conduct business if under financial constraints.
G30|The impact of large lending on bank efficiency in U.S.A|This paper investigates a rather neglected issue in the banking literature regarding the impact of large lending (LL) on the three banks’ performance aspects (cost, profit and productive). Possible influences may arise in the context of banks’ credit risk as trade credit, which is provided by large, creditworthy firms, and it is a method of monitoring and enforcing loan contracts to relatively riskier firms. Indeed, trade credit providers view payments beyond the discount period as a sign of financial difficulty while the option to cut off shipments for nonpayment is a potentially powerful means for a trade creditor to force repayment, especially if a supplier provides its costumer with a product that has no close substitutes. A unique dataset was constructed concerning all USA banks collected from SDI (Statistics on Depository Institutions) report compiled by FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation). Our sample contains 7960 banks and tracked yearly for the period 2010 -2017, creating an unbalanced panel of year observations. An econometric framework based on nested non-neutral frontiers, was developed to estimate the influence and the decomposition of large lending on the three banks' performance aspects (cost, profit and productive). Moreover, different types of frontiers aiming at the cost, profit, and production side have been investigated. The empirical findings reveal that the large lending plays a crucial role on banks' technical efficiency. Significant variations among different frontier models, type of bank and size, banks’ ownership structure and macroeconomic conditions appear to be present. By considering all CAMEL (Capital Adequacy Asset Quality Management Earnings Liquidity) parameters we notice that banks’ financial strength affects banks’ efficiency. Some policy implications are derived based on the empirical evidence supporting a safer and sounder banking system can be emerged as banks finance large firms, increasing the willingness of people to save and bank’s attitude to finance profitable investments projects that rise firm’s value and promote economic growth.
G30|Insolvency Regimes and Firms' Default Risk Under Economic Uncertainty and Shocks|One of the arguments often advanced for implementing a stronger insolvency and bankruptcy framework is that it enhances credit discipline among firms. Using a large cross-country firm-level dataset, we empirically test whether a stronger insolvency regime reduces firms' likelihood of defaulting on their debt. In particular, we examine whether it reduces default risk during increased economic uncertainty and various external shocks. Our results confirm that a stronger insolvency regime moderates the adverse effects of economic shocks on firms' default risk. The effects are more pronounced for firms in the top half of the size distribution. We also explore channels through which improved creditor rights influence firms’ default risk, including dependence on external finance, corporate leverage, and managerial ethics. Our main results are robust to an alternative measure of default risk, inclusion of currency and sovereign debt crisis episodes, and alternative estimations.
G30|Corporate Capture of Blockchain Governance|We develop a theory of blockchain governance. In our model, the proof-of-work system, which is the most common set of rules for validating transactions in blockchains, creates an industrial ecosystem with specialized suppliers of goods and services. We analyze the two-way interactions between blockchain governance and the market structure of the industries in the blockchain ecosystem. Our main result is that the proof-of-work system leads to a situation where the governance of the blockchain is captured by a large firm.
G30|R&D Subsidies and Firms' Debt Financing|This study investigates the impact of public subsidies for research and development (R&D) on the debt financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It examines a public program implemented in the Marche region of Italy during the period 2005â€“2012. The study combines matching methods with a difference-in-difference estimator to examine whether receiving public subsidies affects total indebtedness, the structure and cost of debt of awarded firms. The results indicate that R&D subsidies modify firms' (especially young firms') debt structure in favor of long-term financing, and help firms to limit the average cost of debt. Subsidies also foster the use of bank financing, but do not affect the overall level of debt. Taken together, these findings suggest that public funding of SMEs' innovation projects plays a certification role in access to external financial resources for firms receiving subsidies.
G30|Debt Capital Markets As A Funding Source For Listed Property Funds In South Africa|Purpose of paperProperty finance in South Africa has traditionally been a market dominated by bank lend-ing. However in the context of the Basel III Accord creating cost and other regulatory impli-cations for bank lending, as well a maturing listed property market adopting international best practice in the form of REIT legislation, debt capital markets funding is becoming a significant component of REITs? capital structure. The study seeks to determine the merits and impact of this nascent funding source for REITs in South Africa. MethodologyFollowing a review of applicable literature, interviews with senior management of nine listed property funds and other debt capital markets stakeholders were undertaken. Cer-tain advantages and disadvantages of debt capital markets funding, in comparison to other lending sources, were presented as hypotheses to the interviewees. FindingsThe responses show support from a significant majority of the interviewees for four partic-ular advantages and two disadvantages. The study also found support for these ad-vantages and disadvantages to be transient. Value of paperIt is advised that REITs periodically reassess the respective advantages and disadvantages of this funding source for their business.
G30|Contradictions in Cost of Capital Approaches|An important business economics category is the cost of capital, which defines the core entrepreneurial purpose in the private ownership-based economy where property owners determine decision-making and investment. The cost of capital includes the estimated price of the capital used (risk-free interest rate) and the required risk premium. Determining the required rate of return depending on the capital structure (WACC) and using it in finance to measure a firm's cost of capital is becoming increasingly widespread. The present study examines how the cost of capital can be approached from business economics and finance perspectives. The paper analyses the comparable factual profitability indicators (return on investment, return on equity, etc.), and the contradictions between them, as well as determining if there are deductible economic meanings behind the comparisons. The study presents the results with a graphic analytical framework.
G30|Determinants of Capital Structure: An Empirical Analysis of Listed Companies in Thailand Stock Exchange SET 100 Index|The main purpose of this study is to investigate some financial indicators that affect the debt ratio in Thailand?s capital market. Two competing theories that explicate the capital structure are old-fashioned pecking order and static trade-off model. From existing literature reviews, we select seven traditional factors: profitability, asset structure, size, liquidity, non-debt tax shields, dividend policy and growth as explanatory variables. While long-term debt and total debt are used as proxies for dependent variables. This study uses secondary data collected from annual financial statements of companies in SET 100 index exclude financial business sector. All firms rank highest market capitalization and top trading liquidity in Thailand Stock Exchange for a period of 10 years during 2009-2018. After examine the data, only 760 samples are qualified under criteria. Two panel multiple regression models are implemented for statistic testing at the significant level 0.05.The results for model 1 (Long term debt) show positive and statistical significant effect of asset structure, size, liquidity and growth. While other three factors comprising profitability, non-debt tax shield and dividend policy indicate negative statistical relationships. The results for model 2 (Total debt) show positive and statistical significant effect of asset structure and growth. Whereas, two factors including profitability and liquidity display negative statistical correlation. The results of the two models are consistent with the Pecking Order theory for profitability and growth. High growth firms have higher need for funds then expect to borrow more. While asset structure is consistent with trade-off theory which hold that there should be a positive relationship between fixed assets and debt since fixed assets can serve as collateral. The explanatory variables which have the highest impact on capital structure choices for long term debt and total debt are non-debt tax shield and profitability respectively. Other independent variables such as product uniqueness, risk and macroeconomic indicators are subject to future research.
G30|Market Value of Patents: Evidence from the US, 1976-2017|Since the 1980s, the US has experienced a surge in patenting and R&D. To better understand the phenomena, we explore the evolution of the mar- ket value of knowledge capital with a novel firm-level dataset. While the importance of R&D has steadily declined, the market value of patents made a large and sustained gain in the new millennium. An additional patent per million dollars of R&D improves firm value by 11% in the latest decade compared to 3% three decades ago. The increased patent rents are driven largely by young firms, suggesting a positive role of the US patent system.
G30|Family control, pyramidal ownership and investment-cash flow sensitivity: evidence from an emerging economy|We investigate the effect of pyramidal ownership and family control in investment-cash flow sensitivity of Brazilian firms using financial constraint indexes to a priori classify firms. For constrained firms, we find that family control does not directly influence the investment-cash flow sensitivity, while for unconstrained firms, Family control shows a negative effect in investment decisions. However, the active involvement of the controlling family in the board increases investment-cash flow of unconstrained firms, possibly aggravating agency problems. Regarding the pyramidal ownership, we provide evidences consistent with the idea of internal transfer of funds among firms belonged to the arrangement structure.
G30|A New Index Score for the Assessment of Firm Financial Risks|There are several indicators and univariate ratios that measure the soundness of firms' balance sheets (Leverage, profitability, liquidity ratio, etc.). However, each indicator alone cannot measure the overall financial risk or the financial distress level of firms. In this study, we measure the financial strength of the real sector firms quoted in Borsa Istanbul (BIST) by producing a composite index score which is a combination of several different corporate finance ratios. In the first part, we will apply multiple discriminant analysis to the variables used in Altman Z-score (1968), which is the most prevalent composite index score measuring the firms’ financial risks in the literature. In the second part, a new index, named as MFA-score (Multivariate Firm Assessment Score) will be introduced by using the ratios that best explain the characteristics of the BIST companies. Both the tailored version of Altman Z-score and our new index score have a predictive power around 90 percent. Furthermore, MFA-score is capable of detecting the impact of macro-economic developments on firm balance sheets, which enables us to use MFA-score as an early warning indicator of financial distress for Turkish firms. Our analyses with MFA-score suggest that non-exporter firms and firms with FX open position have relatively weaker balance sheets.
G30|Can survey-based information help to assess investment gaps in the EU?|"This study illustrates how information from micro-level and survey-based databases can be used, along with macroeconomic indicators, to provide a better understanding of corporates' investment obstacles. We investigate impediments to corporate investment across the EU. We use a novel dataset merging firm level data from the European Investment Bank Investment Survey (EIBIS) and hard data from corporations' balance sheet and P&L information. We show that the indicators that can be derived from aggregating qualitative answers on impediments to investment at the country level correlate relatively well with macro-based hard data, commonly used as determinants of investments in macro-based models. Notwithstanding this, the perceptions reported by the corporations tend to be related to firms' specific characteristics: ""weaker"" firms defined as firms that are smaller, and/or more indebted, and/or less profitable and/or with lower liquidity positions, tend to report more impediments. After controlling for firm specific characteristics, the perceived investment gap remains correlated with the reported impediments. While access to finance is not the most reported obstacle, reporting it has the highest information content. Moreover, the signal intensifies when it is given by ""weaker"" firms. From a policy point of view, our findings suggest that survey-based information can be a useful input to complement hard data, both macro and micro, and better inform the design of targeted policies to support investment."
G30|Financialization made in Germany: A review|This article examines the spread of financialization in Germany before the financial crisis. It provides an up-to date overview on the literature on financialization and reviews which of the phenomena typically associated with financialization have emerged in Germany. In particular, the article aims to clarify how the prevailing institutional structure and its changes had contributed to or had countervailed the spread of financialization and how it had shaped the specific German variant of financialization. For this end, it combines the rich literature on Germany's institutional structure with the more macroeconomic oriented literature on financializaton. With the combination of those different perspectives the article sheds light on the reasons for the spread of financialization and the specific forms it has taken in Germany.
G30|Why female board representation matters: The role of female directors in reducing male CEO overconfidence in corporate decisions|We provide novel manifestations why female board representation matters. We find that male CEOs at firms with female directors are less likely to be overconfident as they hold fewer deep-in-the-money options. Female directors are associated with less aggressive investment policies, better acquisition decisions, and improved firm performance. This is the case for industries with high overconfidence prevalence, but not for those with low overconfidence prevalence. Finally, firms with female directors experience less of a drop in performance during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. These results are consistent with the view that female directors improve firm outcomes through reducing male CEO overconfidence in corporate decisions.
G30|Passing the dividend baton: The impact of dividend policy on new CEOs' initial compensation|We examine how firms’ dividend policy affects the initial compensation of their new CEOs. We focus on new CEOs to isolate the effect of dividends on compensation and to provide new insights into an aspect largely neglected in compensation research. We show that the dividend payout is positively related to new CEO compensation and that this positive relation remains after addressing potential endogeneity concerns. Further, the positive effect of dividends is stronger for firms with no dividend cuts over the past two, three and four years, firms with relatively high institutional ownership, and those with strong boards, consistent with new CEOs receiving higher pay as compensation for greater dividend pressure.
G30|The Hidden Information Content: Evidence from the Tone of Independent Director Reports|The paper investigates the link between the information content of independent directors’ re-ports (IDRs) and future firm performance. By conducting sentiment analysis of 23,984 IDRs of the Chinese listed companies from 2004-2012, we find that the tone of IDRs is positively related with future firm performance. We also posit that the tone of IDRs and its association with firm performance depends on director’s incentives to monitor. Our results suggest that independent directors with greater career concerns (i.e., young directors, an expert in ac-counting or finance) are more critical in evaluating firm fundamentals and express more neg-ative tone in their reports. The relationship between the negative tone of IDRs and future firm performance is stronger for firms with greater monitoring needs. Overall, our evidence is consistent with the conjecture that career concerns motivate independent directors to dissem-inate information to external stakeholders.
G30|A two-dimensional control problem arising from dynamic contracting theory|We study a corporate finance dynamic contracting model in which the firm's growth rate fluctuates and is impacted by the unobservable effort exercised by the manager. We show that the principal's problem takes the form of a two-dimensional Markovian control problem. We prove regularity properties of the value function that are instrumental in the construction of the optimal contract that implements full effort, which we derive explicitly. These regularity results appear in some recent economic studies but with heuristic proofs that do not clarify the importance of the regularity of the value function at the boundaries.
G30|Do institutional blockholders influence corporate investment? Evidence from emerging markets|This paper examines the relationship between firm investment ratios and institutional blockholders for a sample of 6300 publicly traded firms in 16 large emerging markets for the 2004–2016 period. Results show that independent, long-term, and local institutional investors boost investment ratios, and this is consistent with the monitoring role and blockholder voice intervention hypotheses. The presence of institutional blockholders, regardless of their monitoring involvement, reduces firm cash flow sensitivity ratios and thus, firms' financial constraints. Minority institutional investors complement the positive effect of blockholder investors. However, the effect on financial constraints decreases as the quality of the country's institutions increases.
G30|Finance, Intangibles and the privatization of knowledge|The paper examines different types of financial organization in a framework of incomplete law, under which the rights and the duties of the individuals are not completely specified. It focuses on the relationship between finance and specificity arguing that, while financial structure influences the degree of specificity of the assets, the degree of specificity of the assets influences the financial structure of firm. Because of these two-way relation, multiple possible equilibria exist and their selection is influenced by the nature the underlying assets. For this reason, the spectacular increase of intangibles is likely to have increased the role of equity finance relatively to traditional forms of banking, which are usually guaranteed by assets that, unlike most intangibles, have thick markets and fairly stable market values. The excessive financialization of the global economy mirrors the abnormal growth of intangibles and, in particular, of the assets related to the privatization of knowledge. International regulations should also tackle the negative effects of overenclosing the knowledge commons.
G30|Corporate tax planning and firms' information environment|This study examines whether internal information quality (IIQ) is associated with firms' external information quality (EIQ) and whether tax planning moderates this association. Based on the argument that higher internal information quality allows managers to convey higher quality information to market participants, I hypothesize and find a positive association between IIQ and EIQ. I then examine if tax planning, which prior literature shows affects external information quality due to proprietary costs of disclosure, attenuates this association. I find that the association between IIQ and EIQ is fully attenuated for firms with a high level of tax planning. A structural equation model that allows different elements of IIQ to covary and robustness tests corroborate my findings. Overall, my results imply that increased IIQ spills over to EIQ because managers convey higher quality internal information to market participants. However, proprietary costs resulting from a high level of tax planning appear to moderate this effect.
G30|Investment of financially distressed firms: The role of trade credit|We study the relationship between net trade credit and firms' investment levels, focusing on financially distressed firms. First, we introduce a theoretical model to predict the role played by net trade credit as a coordination device differentiating firms by their degree of financial distress. Then, we test these predictions by using a large panel of more than 10 million firms in 23 EU countries over the period 2004-2014. Our main result is that, whereby net trade credit has an overall negative impact on capital formation due to liquidity effects, the effect is less pronounced for firms that are in financial difficulties. The main explanation is that through capital expenditures distressed companies try to maintain vital business relations with their customers in order to participate in the final profits via trade credit repayments.
G30|CEO power and board structure of banks: a developing country’s perspective|This study examines the implications of CEO power on the board structure of banks in the Ghanaian banking industry. Using a unique hand-collected dataset in respect of 21 commercial banks in Ghana for the 2009 – 2017 periods, the results show that CEO power underscores the absence or lack of gender composition of bank boards and constrains independent directors, while incentivizing larger board size in banks. Meanwhile, ownership structure and listing status critically underpin the CEO power effect on bank board structure, such that the actual sign of the marginal effect of CEO power on bank board structure varies with ownership structure and listing status. Overall, the study contributes to the understanding of the global antecedent of bank corporate governance (i.e. board structure) by providing an understanding of the implications of social connection hypothesis on bank board structure in a developing country's context.

G30|The effect of women directors on innovation activity and performance of corporate firms: Evidence from China|This paper elaborates whether women bringing their diversity, cross-cultural awareness and transformational leadership skills to corporate boards offer strategic advantages for firms. In the analysis the effect of women in the board room on innovation activity and corporate firm performance as well as the joint consequences of female directors and innovation activity on the firm's success are examined. The latter may be particularly important in the context of gender diversity as more gender-diverse boards allow for higher levels of creativity and hence innovation. In order to account for endogeneity issues, different model specifications are employed (two-way fixed effects models and linear dynamic panel data models). Unconditional quantile regressions are used in order to go beyond the mean. The analysis is conducted using Chinese firm-level data from 2006-2015. The results suggest positive effects of gender diversity in corporate boards and patenting activities on firm performance. Women directors are found to have statistically significant effects on both input-(positive) and output-oriented (negative) innovation activity.
G30|The impact of stock options on risk-taking: Founder-CEOs and innovation|This paper investigates whether and how founder-CEOs' risk incentives (VEGA) are related to firm innovation. We exploit a change in the accounting treatment of stock-based compensation under FAS 123R in 2005 to show a relationship between founders' risk-taking incentive and innovation. Using a sample of 226 firm-year observations between 2002 and 2008, we first show that stock options are incentives that encourage founder-CEOs to engage in risk-taking behaviour and that these were significantly reduced as a result of FAS 123R. Secondly, we find that innovation activities of the observed firms are significantly declining due to the reduction of the option compensation and the associated reduction in VEGA of founder-CEOs. Finally, our difference-in-differences approach provides strong evidence that there is a relationship between CEOs risk-taking and innovation output. Our results imply that even in founder-led firms it is important to incentivise founders' risk-taking behaviour in order that firms continue to innovate and remain competitive.
G30|Managers' research education, the use of FX derivatives and corporate speculation|In contrast to the U.S., many executive managers of continental European firms have a PhD. In this paper we analyze if a research-oriented background in the form of a PhD is linked to the corporate decision-making of CFOs in the use of foreign exchange (FX) derivatives in Germany. After controlling for fundamental firm characteristics, compensation schemes and personal characteristics of managers, we find some evidence that CFOs with a PhD in a business-related area tend to use FX derivatives less, while CFOs with a general business education do so more. Analyzing their behavior with regard to speculation, we find strong evidence that CFOs with a PhD speculate less on the FX market compared to CFOs with another (business) education. A possible reason may be that a research-oriented education is more associated with critical awareness and long-term orientation in corporate decision-making.
G30|Bank credit supply and firm innovation|We analyze the causal effect of the credit supply shock to banks induced by interbank market disruptions in the recent financial crisis 2008/2009 on their business customers' innovation activity. Using a matched bank-firm data set for Germany, we find that having relations with a more severely affected bank seriously hampers firms' current innovation activities due to funding shortages. Furthermore, we find that firms with a relationship to a less severely affected bank are more likely to initiate new product and process innovations and to reallocate human resources to innovation during the financial crisis.
G30|Foreign Competition and Executive Compensation in the Manufacturing Industry: A Comparison between Germany and the U.S|In this study we use import penetration as a proxy for foreign competition in order to empirically analyze (1) the impact of foreign competition on managerial compensation, (2) differences in the impact between Germany and the U.S and (3) whether the impact of import penetration is driven by implied efficiency effects. We use data from the manufacturing industry covering the period from 1984-2010 for Germany respectively 1992-2011 for the U.S and apply system GMM in order to solve potential endogeneity problems. It turns out that foreign competition leads to an increase of average per capita executive compensation in both countries. The impact of foreign competition on pay-performance sensitivity differs between the US and Germany. A differentiation between imported intermediates (efficient sourcing strategy) and final inputs (competition) reveals that the impact of import penetration is not biased by efficiency effects.
G30|Bank loan supply during crises: the importance of geographic diversification|We classify a large sample of banks according to the geographic diversification of their international syndicated loan portfolio. Our results show that diversified banks maintain higher loan supply during banking crises in borrower countries. The positive loan supply effects lead to higher investment and employment growth for firms. Diversified banks are stabilizing due to their ability to raise additional funding during times of distress, which also shields connected markets from spillovers. Further distinguishing banks by nationality reveals a pecking order: diversified domestic banks are the most stable source of funding, while foreign banks with little diversification are the most fickle. Our findings suggest that the decline in financial integration since the recent crisis increases countries’ vulnerability to local shocks.
G30|Religion, Corporate Governance, and Executive Compensation|We investigate how regional variation in religiosity and the prevalent religious denomination in a U.S. state where a company is headquartered are associated with the level and structure of executive compensation. We document a substantial compensation premium in executives working at firms headquartered in U.S. states with a high proportion of Catholics and conversely a discount in states with a high proportion of Protestants. We provide evidence suggesting that these findings are not caused by heterogeneous demand for executives’ effort, managerial ability, or social skills. Our results are consistent with the “Catholic premium” and the “Protestant discount” being associated with the adherence to different social values that have implications for corporate governance quality and for managerial entrenchment. Our results highlight the importance of social values for economic activity and for contracting between economic agents.
G30|Tapping into Financial Synergies : Alleviating Financial Constraints Through Acquisitions|The paper examines whether financially constrained firms are able to use acquisitions to ease their constraints. The results show that acquisitions do ease financing constraints for constrained acquirers. Relative to unconstrained acquires, financially constrained firms are more likely to use undervalued equity to fund acquisitions and to target unconstrained and more liquid firms. Using a propensity score matched sample in a difference-in-difference framework, the results show that constrained acquirers become less constrained post-acquisition and relative to matched non-acquiring firms. This improvement is more pronounced for diversifying acquisitions and constrained firms that acquire rather than issue equity and retain the proceeds. Following acquisition, constrained acquirers raise more debt and increase investments, consistent with experiencing reductions in financing constraints relative to matched non-acquirers. These improvements are not seen for unconstrained acquirers. Finally, the familiar diversification discount is non- existent for financially constrained acquirers.
G30|Financial frictions, real estate collateral, and small firm activity in Europe|We observe significant heterogeneity in the correlation between changes in house prices and the growth of small firms across certain countries in Europe. We find that, overall, the correlation is far greater in Southern Europe than in Northern Europe. Using a simple model, we show that this heterogeneity may relate to financial frictions in a country. We confirm the model’s propositions in a number of empirical analyses for the following countries in Northern and Southern Europe: the United Kingdom, Norway, France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal. Small firms in countries with higher financial frictions (for example, places where bankruptcy resolution is more difficult and/or takes longer) see a greater dependence on “stable” real estate collateral. This is most pronounced for opaque (for example, very young) firms. Through an extension to our model and our choice of specification, we show that our findings are most consistent with a collateral-value-based credit supply channel and rule out a consumer-driven demand effect.
G30|Corporate Foreign Bond Issuance and Interfirm Loans in China|This paper uses firm-level data to document and analyze international bond issuance by Chinese non-financial corporations and the use of the proceeds of issuance. We find that dollar issuance is positively correlated with the differential between domestic and foreign interest rates. This interest rate differential increases the likelihood of dollar bond issuance by risky firms and decreases the likelihood of dollar bond issuance of exporters and profitable firms. Moreover, and most strikingly, we find that risky firms do more inter-firm lending than non-risky firms and that this lending rose significantly after the regulatory shock of 2008-09, when the authorities sought to restrict the financial activities of risky firms. Risky firms try to boost profitability by engaging in speculative activities that mimic the behavior of financial institutions while escaping prudential regulation that limits risk-taking by financial firms.
G30|The Impact of Institutional Ownership and a Firm's Size on Firm Value: Tax Avoidance as a Moderating Variable|"""Objective –The objective of this study is to investigate how institutional ownership and firm size affect firm value. The study also investigates the moderating effect of tax avoidance on the relationship between institutional ownership and the size of a firm on its value. Methodology/Technique –A model was developed and tested using a sample of 66 manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange between 2012 and 2014. Findings –The data was collected and analysed using a least square regression and moderated regression analysis. The analysis shows that institutional ownership and firm size affect firm value. The results also indicate that tax avoidance moderates the effect of institutional ownership and that of a firm's size on its value"""
G30|Determinants of the Success of Corporate Recovery in Financial Distressed Company|Objective - This study aims to examine and analyze the influence of severity, free assets, company size, asset retrenchment and CEO expertise on the success of recovery companies experiencing financial distress that are listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX). Methodology/Technique - The population used in this study are all companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange between 2011 and 2016. This study uses a simple logistic regression analysis to test the hypotheses. Findings - The results indicate that free assets and CEO expertise have a significant and positive effect on the success of a company's recovery. Meanwhile, variable severity, asset retrenchment and firm size do not affect the success of the company's recovery.
G30|Familles actionnaires|Family firms account for a large proportion of listed companies worldwide. The governance mechanisms of family firms deal with the specificities of their agency conflicts. For example, agency conflicts between shareholders and managers can be mitigated when the managers are themselves family members. The costs of agency conflicts between the family blockholding and minority shareholders, related to potential private benefits, can be offset by more effective monitoring, while a specific agency conflict related to relations between the family at large and family shareholders can emerge. The governance mechanisms put in place seem effective, since family firms appear to perform better than non-family firms. But they are also less diversified, less innovative and more sensitive to the social climate in the company. Their financial decisions reflect their shareholders? concern to preserve their control, which involves, in particular, long-term relationships with other stakeholders. This article provides a review of research findings on these topics. Classification JEL?: G30, G32, L21, L25, P12.
G30|La dynamique de changement des formes de gouvernance : le cas français (2000-2014)|(VF)Cet article se donne pour objectif d’examiner une dimension cruciale et pourtant méconnue de la gouvernance des entreprises. Nous étudions la dynamique de la gouvernance des sociétés cotées françaises (SBF 120) sur une longue période d’observation (2000-2014) qui englobe les principales réformes françaises. Plus précisément, nous analysons les variables susceptibles d’influencer la stabilité de la structure de gouvernance. Pour cela, nous mobilisons des modèles de durée multi-états de type semi-markovien afin d’analyser à la fois la durée et les transitions d’une forme de gouvernance à une autre des sociétés cotées françaises. Nos résultats montrent que la stabilité de la structure de gouvernance est essentiellement liée aux caractéristiques personnelles du dirigeant en poste, à la performance de l’entreprise et la structure actionnariale. Cependant, un examen approfondi par type de transition montre l’influence multiple et parfois contrastée de certaines variables. (VA) The aim of this article is to examine a crucial and yet unknown aspect of corporate governance. More precisely, we analyze the variables which are likely to influence the stability of the governance structure of French listed companies (SBF 120 index). We study the dynamics of corporate governance over a long period of observation (2000-2014), which encompasses the main French reforms. We use duration models based on Markovian-type processes to examine both the transitions from one form of governance to the other, but also the duration and therefore the stability of the forms of governance of listed French companies. Our results show that the stability of the corporate governance structure is linked to the personal characteristics of the CEO, the performance of the company and the shareholder structure essentially. However, a thorough examination by type of transition shows the multiple and sometimes contrasted influence of some variables. Our article brings a new light on the dynamics of the governance of French listed companies.
G30|The impact of ownership concentration and analyst coverage on market liquidity: Comparative evidence from an auction and a specialist market|This paper examines the relationships among market liquidity, ownership structure and public information production in Italy, where the share market setting might have a considerable effect. Our findings suggest that both the private information held by the largest blockholder and the public information provided by financial analysts have an impact on market liquidity. The percentage of shares owned by the controlling shareholder harms market liquidity, whereas analyst coverage improves it. The study demonstrates that the results differ with the stock market setting. We find that the effects of these two key variables are significantly lower in a specialist market than in a non-specialist market. These results emphasize the importance of distinguishing between auction and specialist market structures when studying the impact of corporate governance and analyst coverage on market liquidity. Notably, the study demonstrates that the sign and the intensity of the effect of analyst coverage on market liquidity changes according to the varying levels of ownership concentration, suggesting that private information and public information may act as complements.
G30|Financial Markets, Industry Dynamics and Growth|This article introduces corporate governance frictions into a growth model with endogenous market structure. Managers engage in corporate resource diversion and empire building. Shareholders discipline managers with incentive compensation contracts. A reform that mitigates corporate governance frictions boosts firms’ entry and, for a given market structure, has an ambiguous impact on incumbents’ return to product improvement. However, as the market structure adjusts, becoming more diffuse, incumbents invest less in product improvement. Calibrating the model to U.S. data, we find that a reform of the kind recently enacted in several advanced economies can lead to a welfare loss.
G30|Firm Ownership, Political Participation, and Access to Finance through Public Bond Offerings in China|This study examines how state versus private ownership and political participation by private entrepreneurs affect access to financing through the corporate bond market in China. We find that state ownership is positively related to the likelihood that a firm issues bonds and that firms controlled by ultimate owners who participate in politics are significantly more likely to issue bonds. We also show that state ownership as well as political participation by the ultimate owner is positively associated with the amount firms raise in bond offerings. Moreover, state firms characterized by over-investment tend to increase their excess investments after a bond offering. For under-investing private firms, existing suboptimal investment levels are alleviated by bond offerings. In addition, we find that private firms significantly increase their R&D investments after a public bond offering, especially those controlled by owners who participate in politics. Finally, bond offerings are associated with a significant decline in market value for SOEs. For firms controlled by an owner who participates in politics, the opposite holds true. These findings highlight the need to improve the existing credit allocation via the bond market and the important role political capital plays for private firms in China.
G30|Trade Credit and Pricing:An Empirical Evaluation|We empirically investigate the proposition that firms charge premia on cash prices in transactions involving trade credit. Using a comprehensive Swedish panel dataset on product-level transaction prices and firm-characteristics, we relate trade credit issuance to price setting. In a recession characterized by tightened credit conditions, we find that prices increase significantly more on products sold by firms issuing more trade credit, reflecting their larger exposures to increased funding costs and counterparty risks. Our results thus demonstrate the importance of trade credit for price setting and show that trade credit issuance induces a channel through which financial frictions affect prices.
G30|Diversication Advantages During the Global Financial Crisis|In this paper, I investigate whether being part of a business group mitigated the effects of the global financial crisis for Swedish firms. The crisis is used as an exogenous shock to firms' external financing. The investments made by business group firms are compared to those made by standalone firms. I find that being part of a business group had a mitigating effect on the impact of the crisis on firm investments. Firms that were part of a business group reduced their investments by significantly less than standalone rms. These differences are driven by a diversification effect among business group firms due to the use of internal capital markets and easier access to external financing. I present evidence of increased internal capital market activity during the crisis. Finally, my results suggest that business group firms profitability increased relative to the profitability of standalone firms after the crisis.
G30|Corporate Governance, Accounting Transparency and Stock Exchange Sizes in Germany, Japan and “Anglo-Saxon” Economies, 1870-1950|Modern discussions of corporate governance have focused on convergence of “varieties of capitalism,” particularly the recent “Americanisation” of laws and voluntary codes in Germany, Japan, and other civil law countries. However German and Japanese legal and business historians have suggested that corporate governance, accounting transparency or other favourable factors in their countries were historically a match for - or even superior to - those in the US. An alleged consequence was deeper penetration by the Berlin and Tokyo stock exchanges of their domestic economies than of the US by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), using measures such as market capitalization/GDP ratios. This paper reviews the classic Rajan and Zingales (2003) data on the sizes of stock exchanges. It concludes that the evidence for Japanese historical precocity relative to the US, after the necessary allowance is made for regional stock exchanges and corporate bond finance, stands up better to this closer examination than that for Germany. Many financial historians (e.g. Musacchio and Turner 2013) now agree that stock exchange development was not historically determined by legal origins (“Anglo-Saxon” common vs Euro-Japanese civil law), though today it appears to be driven by legal rules protecting shareholders and/or bondholders and limiting directorial autocracy and information asymmetry. However, both today and historically in some cultures private order rules (voluntary codes, bourse listing requirements, bankers as trusted intermediaries, block-holder monitoring, etc) offered substitute protections, or at least complemented protective laws. This paper reviews the plausibility of these determinants of historical stock exchange sizes - and others that have been neglected - in Japan, Germany, and elsewhere, before 1950.
G30|A two-dimensional control problem arising from dynamic contracting theory|We study a corporate finance dynamic contracting model in which the firm's growth rate fluctuates and is impacted by the unobservable effort exercised by the manager. We show that the principal's problem takes the form of a two-dimensional Markovian control problem. We prove regularity properties of the value function that are instrumental in the construction of the optimal contract that implements full effort, which we derive explicitly. These regularity results appear in some recent economic studies but with heuristic proofs that do not clarify the importance of the regularity of the value function at the boundaries.
G30|Foreign competition and executive compensation in the manufacturing industry: A comparison between Germany and the U.S|In this study we use import penetration as a proxy for foreign competition in order to empirically analyze (1) the impact of foreign competition on managerial compensation, (2) differences in the impact between Germany and the U.S. and (3) whether the impact of import penetration is driven by implied efficiency effects. We use data from the manufacturing industry covering the period from 1984-2010 for Germany respectively 1992-2011 for the U.S. and apply system GMM in order to solve potential endogeneity problems. It turns out that foreign competition leads to an increase of average per capita executive compensation in both countries. The impact of foreign competition on payperformance sensitivity differs between the U.S. and Germany. A differentiation between imported intermediates (efficient sourcing strategy) and final inputs (competition) reveals that the impact of import penetration is not biased by efficiency effects.
G30|Exporting corporate governance: Do foreign and local proxy advisors differ?|European regulators are concerned that US-based proxy advisors might export US corporate governance by not considering sufficiently the unique aspects of the local setting. In contrast, local proxy advisors are expected to have a deeper understanding of the local setting. Using the German setting, we examine the pattern and the impact of shareholder voting recommendations by foreign (ISS, Glass Lewis) and local (IVOX) proxy advisors. First, we find that the voting recommendations diverge more between foreign and local proxy advisors than among foreign proxy advisors. Second, we document that against-recommendations by the local proxy advisor have an incremental impact on voting outcomes even after controlling for the voting recommendations by foreign proxy advisors. Third, we observe that the impact of the voting recommendations on voting outcomes increases with a higher proportion of institutional investors. Dividing the proportion into foreign and local institutional investors reveals that against-recommendations by foreign proxy advisors influence the voting decisions of both groups similarly. Overall, our study provides novel evidence that the informational contents of voting recommendations by foreign and local proxy advisors differ, implying that foreign proxy advisors may not fully integrate unique aspects of the local setting in their voting recommendations.
G30|Do institutional investors drive corporate social responsibility? International evidence|This paper assesses whether shareholders drive the environmental and social (E&S) performance of firms worldwide. Across 41 countries, institutional ownership is positively associated with E&S performance with additional tests suggesting this relation is causal. Institutions are motivated by both financial and social returns. Investors increase firms’ E&S performance following shocks that reveal financial benefits to E&S improvements. In cross section, investors increase firms’ E&S performance when they come from countries with a strong community belief in the importance of E&S issues, but not otherwise. As such, these institutional investors transplant their social norms regarding E&S issues around the world.
G30|Credit constraints, firms investment and growth evidence from survey data|We assess the impact of credit constraints on investment, inventories and other working capital and firm growth with a large panel of small and medium-sized enterprises from 12 European countries for the period 2014-2016. The data come from the Survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE), a survey that is especially designed to analyse the problems in the access to external finance of European SMEs. The key identification challenge is a potential reverse-causality bias, as firms with poor investment and growth opportunities may have a higher probability of being credit constrained. We implement several strategies to overcome this obstacle: proxies for investment opportunities, lagged regressors, random effects and instrumental variables. Our findings suggest that credit constraints, both in bank financing and other financing (e.g. trade credit), have strong negative effects on investment in fixed assets, while the impact on firm growth and working capital is less robust.
G30|Corporate liquidity in Italy and its increase in the long recession|Abstract We analyse the evolution over time and the determinants of corporate liquidity in Italy for the period 2002–2015 using a very large sample of firms (about 460 thousands per year on average) and including many that are small and unlisted. We document a substantial increase in cash holdings since 2011. This rise is shown to be mainly related to macro factors common to all firms. Among these macro factors, a strong correlation emerges with the lower opportunity cost of holding cash, as measured by the interest rate decline. We also assess the role of cash determinants at the firm level, relating them to different motives for holding cash, such as precautionary reasons, transaction costs, and the effects of information asymmetries in financial markets. Among firm-specific factors, the liquidity rise was initially linked primarily to the fall in investment and then to improved cash flows and enhanced deleveraging.
G30|Internal capital markets in Italian business groups: evidence from the financial crisis|Using unique detailed data, we describe the role of internal capital markets in Italian business groups before and after the financial crisis, an exogenous event which provides an ideal setting to assess whether the working of internal capital markets helps group-affiliated firms to mitigate external financial constraints. Our findings support the hypothesis that internal capital markets are typically activated by firms standing at the top of the control chain given their easier access to external borrowing. Larger and more profitable firms serve as internal suppliers of capital and support financially constrained group members that struggle to stay viable. We also show that firms affiliated to larger and diversified groups benefit from the existence of internal mechanisms of resource reallocation that can substitute external finance when it becomes more expensive and hard to access. During the crisis, group-affiliated firms were more likely to survive than unaffiliated firms.
G30|The Drop in Non-Financial Firms' Cost of Credit: A Cross-Country Analysis|Following the sovereign debt crisis, bank interest rates charged to non-financial firms declined sharply in the euro area. This work explores the firms' balance-sheet channel hypothesis on the role played by firms' characteristics and risk profile in the transmission of monetary policy. Using a European firm-level survey, we find that in all countries changes in borrowers' characteristics play a non-negligible role. They account for 23 out of 289 basis points of the total interest rate drop in vulnerable economies, and 35 out of 160 basis points in core European countries. The improvement in financial situation is the key firm characteristic driving the decline in interest rates in vulnerable countries, whereas in core countries the decline is mainly due to a shift in bank credit towards relatively larger borrowers.
G30|Italian banks and market-based corporate financing|The recent financial crisis has induced firms to turn increasingly to financing sources other than bank credit, and banks to boost their income from non-lending services. This paper provides some evidence concerning possibility and convenience for Italian banks to expand the supply of financial services to firms by examining the placement market for Italian corporate securities and its relationship with the credit market in the period 2000-2016. The paper shows that when firms entered the stock and bond markets, bank credit was partially crowded-out and interest rates dropped for both first-time issuers and risky firms. However, when banks also played a major role both in placing corporate issues and in financing the issuers, lending relationships did not weaken.
G30|Firms' credit risk and the onshore transmission of the global financial cycle|We investigate the role of firms' credit risk in the onshore transmission of international bond market conditions. We show that reductions in the global price of risk, measured by the excess bond premium, encourage more international bond borrowing by smaller and younger firms. Due to informational asymmetries, these firms pay a higher credit spread. Thus their funding costs, and consequently their international borrowing, are more tightly linked to the global price of risk. The funds borrowed in response to favourable market conditions cause their balance sheets to deteriorate; over a three-year horizon, leverage increases, in support of capital expenditure, and cash holdings increase. Our results reveal a micro-level link between rising global risk appetite and the gradual build-up of domestic vulnerabilities.
G30|An Empirical Analysis of the Maturity of Debt Supply in Uruguay|The present work carries out an analysis of the credit operations from 2005 to 2017 of all the financial institutions that report to the Central Bank of Uruguay, except the Banco Hipotecario del Uruguay, in order to understand the characteristics of the financing offer focused on the maturity of the credits. The investigation allows to distinguish by credit term and cost the preferred operation to finance longer maturity investments. Depreciable loans and leasing in indexed units arise as the preferred instruments for longer loans. Models were controlled by fixed effects in order to explain the term of credit operations concluding that a marginal increase in the interest rate reduces the duration of the credit and in turn the size of the debt is positively correlated with the maturity term.
G30|Determinants of Leverage Maturity Structure of Uruguayan Non-financial Firms|The purpose of this paper is to study the decision of Uruguayan non-financial firms regarding the temporal dimension of the financing structure, this is, to characterize the temporal structure of Uruguayan nonfinancial firm’s leverage. The paper mainly, analyze the interaction of long-term financial leverage with the other type of external financing of the firm and with the use of own capital. I used a unique panel database that is a merge of the Annual Economic Activity Survey and the Credit Risk Center managed by the Central Bank of Uruguay. The sample covers the period 2011-2014, for this period there is complete balance sheet information. The different external financing options for the firms are complementary to the long-term leverage. In turn, the use of the firm’s own capital is a substitute for long-term leverage. On the side of the demand for long-term credit, firms with higher profitability prefer to finance themselves with their own capital and those with lower profitability turn to external financing to the firm.
G30|Does lender type matter for the pricing of loans?|Loan markets often contain lenders with contrasting business models and ownership structures. But does that matter for outcomes in these markets? We examine whether it does using a loan-level data set of mortgage transactions in the United Kingdom. We find the type of lender can matter for pricing behaviour. The levels of interest rates, as well as the sensitivity of rates to funding costs and borrower risk, vary between lender types. Some of these differences are consistent with theories of how agency problems might vary between types of lenders and past empirical studies. But other differences are not consistent. The results suggest further research is needed to understand how, to what extent, and why lender types affect pricing in loan markets.
G30|Does lending relationship help or alleviate the transmission of liquidity shocks? Evidence from a liquidity crunch in China|We examine China’s June 2013 liquidity crunch as a negative shock to banks and analyze the wealth effects on exchange-listed firms. Our findings suggest that liquidity shocks to financial institutions negatively impact borrower performance, particularly borrowers reporting outstanding loans at the end of 2012. Stock valuations of firms with long-term bank relationships, however, outperform the market and experience smaller subsequent declines in investment than peers lacking solid banking relationships. This effect is the strongest for firms that enjoy good relations with China’s large state-owned banks or foreign banks, and weakest for firms whose connections are solely with local banks. We document a positive correlation between the stock performances of firms and the stock performances of lender banks and the likelihood of lender banks operating as net lenders in the interbank market. These results suggest that banks transmit liquidity shocks to their borrowing firms and that a long-term bank-firm relationship may mitigate the negative effects of a liquidity shock.
G30|Democratic development and credit : “Democracy doesn`t come Cheap” But at least credit to its corporations will be|Does democratization reduce the cost of credit? Using global syndicated loan data from 1984 to 2014, we find that democratization has a sizeable negative effect on loan spreads: a one-point increase in the zero-to-ten Polity IV index of democracy shaves at least 19 basis points off spreads, but likely more. Reversals to autocracy hike spreads more strongly. Our findings are robust to the comprehensive inclusion of relevant controls, to the instrumentation with regional waves of democratization, and to a battery of other sensitivity tests. We thus highlight the lower cost of loans as one relevant mechanism through which democratization can affect economic development.
G30|The Employee Clientele of Corporate Leverage: Evidence from Personal Labor Income Diversification|Using employee job-level data, we empirically test the equilibrium matching between a firm’s debt usage and its employee job risk aversion (“clientele effect”), as predicted by the existing theories. We measure job risk aversion for a firm’s employees using their labor income concentration in the firm, calculated as the fraction of the employees’ total personal labor income or total household labor income that is accounted for by their income from this particular firm. Using a sample of about 1,400 U.S. public firms from 1990-2008, we find a robust negative relation between leverage and employee job risk aversion, which is consistent with the clientele effect. Specifically, when a firm’s existing employees have higher labor income concentration in it, the firm tends to have lower contemporaneous and future leverage. Moreover, in terms of new hires, firms with lower leverage are more likely to recruit employees with less alternative labor income. Our results continue to hold after we control for firm fixed effects, other employee characteristics such as wages, gender, age, race, and education, and managerial risk attitudes. Further, the matching between a firm’s leverage and its workers’ labor income concentration in it is more pronounced for firms with higher labor intensity and those in financial distress.
G30|Small and Large Firms Over the Business Cycle|Drawing on a new, con dential Census Bureau dataset of financial statements of a representative sample of 80000 manufacturing firms from 1977 to 2014, we provide new evidence on the link between size, cyclicality, and financial frictions. First, we only find evidence of lower cyclicality among the very largest firms (the top 1% by size). Second, due to high and rising concentration of sales and investment, the lower sensitivity of the top 1% firms dominates the behavior of aggregate fluctuations. Third, we show that this differential sensitivity does not appear to be driven by financial frictions. The higher sensitivity of the bottom 99% does not disappear after controlling for measures of financial strength, is not statistically significant after identified monetary policy shocks, and does not appear in debt financing flows. Evidence from 3-digit industries suggests a non-financial explanation: the largest 1% of firms are less sensitive due to a more diversified customer base.
G30|Disagreement and Optimal Security Design|We study optimal security design when the issuer and market participants agree to disagree about the characteristics of the asset to be securitized. We show that pooling assets can be optimal because it mitigates the effects of disagreement between issuer and investors, whereas tranching a cash-flow stream allows the issuer to exploit disagreement between investors. Interestingly, pooling and tranching can be complements. The optimality of debt with or without call provisions can be derived as a special case. In a model with multiple financing rounds, convertible securities naturally emerge to finance highly skewed ventures.
G30|Common Ownership Concentration and Corporate Conduct|The question of whether and how partial common-ownership links between strategically interacting firms affect firm behavior has been the subject of theoretical inquiry for decades. Since then, consolidation and increasing concentration in the asset-management industry has led to more pronounced common ownership concentration (CoOCo). Moreover, recent empirical research has provided evidence consistent with the literature's key predictions. The resulting antitrust concerns have received much attention from policy makers worldwide. However, the implications are more general: CoOCo affects the objective function of the firm, and therefore has implications for all subfields of economics studying corporate conduct -- including corporate governance, strategy, industrial organization, and all of financial economics. This article connects the papers establishing the theoretical foundations, reviews the empirical and legal literatures, and discusses challenges and opportunities for future research.
G30|Is Liquidity Risk Priced in Partially Segmented Markets?|We develop an asset pricing model to analyze the joint impact of liquidity costs and market segmentation. The freely traded securities command a premium for liquidity level and global market and liquidity risk premiums whereas securities that can only be held by a subset of investors additionally command a local market and liquidity risk premiums. Based on a new methodology, we find that the liquidity level premium dominates the liquidity risk premiums for our sample of 24 emerging markets. Whereas the local liquidity risk premium is empirically small, the global market liquidity risk premium dramatically increases during crises and market corrections.
G30|The Importance of Network Recommendations in the Director Labor Market|Directors are more likely to obtain additional directorships or be promoted if the CEO and peer directors of their current board are well-connected. The impact of CEO and peer director connections is stronger for additional appointments and promotions at firms in the CEO’s and peer directors’ networks. CEO connections are particularly important for directors with a weaker labor market. There is no evidence that the appointments of referred directors are less well-received by the market than other appointments. Overall, connections are important in the director labor market. Access to additional networks provides strong incentives for directors to join corporate boards.
G30|Information Intermediaries: How Commercial Bankers Facilitate Strategic Alliances|We investigate how bankers use private information to help borrowers combine resources in strategic alliances. Firms that have borrowed from the same banker are significantly more likely to enter an alliance. Even indirect connections through a banker network can facilitate alliances. Consistent with bankers overcoming informational frictions, their ability to facilitate alliances decreases with network distance, and is stronger for opaque borrowers. Alliances are associated with positive announcement returns and brokering banks are more likely to receive future underwriting mandates. We exploit quasi-exogenous variation in firms’ banker networks from interstate bank branching deregulation to show that this relationship is causal.
G30|Why are Firms with More Managerial Ownership Worth Less?|Using more than 50,000 firm-years from 1988 to 2015, we show that the empirical relation between a firmâ€™s Tobinâ€™s q and managerial ownership is systematically negative. When we restrict our sample to larger firms as in the prior literature, our findings are consistent with the literature, showing that there is an increasing and concave relation between q and managerial ownership. We show that these seemingly contradictory results are explained by cumulative past performance and liquidity. Better performing firms have more liquid equity, which enables insiders to more easily sell shares after the IPO, and they also have a higher Tobinâ€™s q.
G30|A Sufficient Statistics Approach for Aggregating Firm-Level Experiments|"We consider a dynamic economy populated by heterogeneous firms subject to generic capital frictions: adjustment costs, taxes and financing constraints. A random subset of firms in this economy receives an empirical ""treatment"", which modifies the parameters governing these frictions. An econometrician observes the firm-level response to this treatment, and wishes to calculate how macroeconomic outcomes would change if all firms in the economy were treated. Our paper proposes a simple methodology to estimate this aggregate counterfactual using firm-level evidence only. Our approach takes general equilibrium effects into account, requires neither a structural estimation nor a precise knowledge on the exact nature of the experiment and can be implemented using simple moments of the distribution of revenue-to-capital ratios. We provide a set of sufficient conditions under which these formulas are valid and investigate the robustness of our approach to multiple variations in the aggregation framework."
G30|Disagreement and Security Design|We study optimal security design when the issuer and market participants agree to disagree about the characteristics of the asset to be securitized. We show that pooling assets can be optimal because it mitigates the effects of disagreement between issuer and investors, whereas tranching a cash-flow stream allows the issuer to exploit disagreement between investors. Interestingly, pooling and tranching can be complements. The optimality of debt with or without call provisions can be derived as a special case. In a model with multiple financing rounds, convertible securities naturally emerge to finance highly skewed ventures.
G30|Common-Ownership Concentration and Corporate Conduct|The question of whether and how partial common-ownership links between strategically interacting firms affect firm objectives and behavior has been the subject of theoretical inquiry for decades. Since then, the growth of intermediated asset management and consolidation in the asset-management sector has led to more pronounced common ownership links at the beneficial-owner level. Recent empirical research has provided evidence consistent with the literature’s prediction that common ownership concentration (CoOCo) can affect product market outcomes. The resulting antitrust concerns have received worldwide attention. However, because CoOCo can change the objective function of the firm, the potential implications span all fields of economics that involve corporate conduct, including corporate governance, strategy, industrial organization, and financial economics. This article connects the papers establishing the theoretical foundations, reviews the empirical and legal literatures, and discusses challenges and opportunities for future research.
G30|Common Ownership, Competition, and Top Management Incentives|We show theoretically and empirically that managers have steeper financial incentives to expend effort and reduce costs when an industry’s firms tend to be controlled by shareholders with concentrated stakes in the firm, and relatively few holdings in competitors. A side effect of steep incentives is more aggressive competition. These findings inform a debate about the objective function of the firm.
G30|Understanding Informal Financing|This paper offers a framework to understand informal financing based on mechanisms to deal with asymmetric information and enforcement. We find that constructive informal financing such as trade credits and family borrowing that relies on information advantages or an altruistic relationship is associated with good firm performance. Underground financing such as money lenders who use violence for enforcement is not. Constructive informal financing is prevalent in regions where access to bank loans is extensive, while its role in supporting firm growth decreases with bank loan availability. International comparisons show that China is not an outlier but rather average in using informal financing.
G30|"Discrimination, Managers, and Firm Performance: Evidence from ""Aryanizations"" in Nazi Germany"|We study whether antisemitic discrimination in Nazi Germany had economic effects. Specifically, we investigate how the forced removal of Jewish managers affected large German firms. We collect new data from historical sources on the characteristics of senior managers, stock prices, dividends, and returns on assets for firms listed on the Berlin Stock Exchange. After the removal of the Jewish managers, the senior managers at affected firms had fewer university degrees, less experience, and fewer connections to other firms. The loss of Jewish managers significantly and persistently reduced the stock prices of affected firms for at least 10 years after the Nazis came to power. We find particularly strong reductions for firms where the removal of the Jewish managers led to large decreases in managerial connections to other firms and in the number of university-educated managers. Dividend payments and returns on assets also declined. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the aggregate market valuation of firms listed in Berlin fell by 1.78 percent of German GNP. These findings imply that discrimination can lead to significant economic losses and that individual managers can be key to the success of firms.
G30|The Impact of Institutions on Bank Governance and Stability: Evidence from African Countries|This paper sheds new light on how African countries’ legal systems and institutions influence the governance and stability of their banks. We find that institutional factors, in particular the legal family of origin, political stability, contract enforcement and strength of investor protection promote central corporate governance reforms. Using a difference-in-difference approach, we also reveal that those reforms mediate the impact of institutions on banks. If countries have a corporate governance reform in place their banks show better internal governance and higher stability.
G30|Credit constraints, firm investment and growth: evidence from survey data|We assess the impact of credit constraints on investment, inventories and other working capital and firm growth with a large panel of small and medium-sized enterprises from 12 European countries for the period 2014-2016. The data come from the Survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE), a survey that is especially designed to analyse the problems in the access to external finance of European SMEs. The key identification challenge is a potential reverse-causality bias, as firms with poor investment and growth opportunities may have a higher probability of being credit constrained. We implement several strategies to overcome this obstacle: proxies for investment opportunities, lagged regressors, random effects and instrumental variables. Our findings suggest that credit constraints, both in bank financing and other financing (e.g. trade credit), have strong negative effects on investment in fixed assets, while the impact on firm growth and working capital is less robust.

G30|Who benefits from the corporate QE? A regression discontinuity design approach|On March 10, 2016, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced the Corporate Sector Purchase Programme (CSPP) – commonly known as corporate quantitative easing (QE) – to improve the financing conditions of the Eurozone’s real economy and strengthen the pass-through of unconventional monetary interventions. Using a regression discontinuity design framework that exploits the rating wedge between the ECB and market participants, we show that: (i) bond yield spreads decline by around 15 basis points at the announcement of the programme, (ii) the impact is mostly noticeable in the sample of CSPP-eligible bonds that are perceived as high yield from the viewpoint of market participants and, (iii) the CSPP seems to have stimulated new issuance of corporate bonds. Overall, our results are consistent with the explanation that highlights the portfolio rebalancing mechanism and the liquidity channel. JEL Classification: E50, E52, G11, G30, G32
G30|Accounting-Based Compensation and Debt Contracts|Adding accounting-based performance plans to management compensation packages influences borrowing costs and structure of corporate debt contracts. After granting long-term accounting-based incentive plans (LTAPs) to CEOs, firms pay lower spreads and have fewer restrictive covenants in new loans. Lenders impose fewer earnings-based covenants after firms adopt earnings-based LTAPs. Results are stronger for firms with high leverage or bankruptcy risk, and that are difficult for lenders to monitor. Results are robust to alternative borrowing cost measures, including new public bond spreads, credit ratings, and CDS spreads. Overall, evidence suggests that adding LTAPs to compensation packages helps align debtholder and shareholder interests.
G30|Do Short Sellers Cause CEOs to Be Fired? Evidence from a Randomized Experiment|We study the short-selling effect on forced CEO turnover. Using difference-in-differences analyses based on the SEC Regulation SHO Pilot Program, we find short selling increases the likelihood of forced turnover. Theories suggest two potential mechanisms: informed short sellers reveal negative information (Revelation), while uninformed short sellers manipulate prices (Manipulation). Consistent with Revelation, we find stronger effects when firms have more earnings management, less informative stock prices, and less competitive product markets. Consistent with Manipulation, we find stronger effects when firms have more growth opportunities, fewer blockholders, and less volatile stock. Manipulative short selling decreases the efficiency of forced turnover.
G30|Nonbank Lending|We provide novel systematic evidence on the terms of direct lending by nonbank financial institutions. Analyzing hand-collected data for a random sample of publicly-traded middle-market firms during the 2010-2015 period, we find that nonbank lending is widespread, with 32% of all loans being extended by nonbanks. Nonbank borrowers are smaller, more R&D intensive, and significantly more likely to have negative EBITDA. Firms are also more likely to borrow from a nonbank lender if local banks are poorly capitalized and less concentrated. Nonbank lenders are less likely to monitor by including financial covenants in their loans, but appear to engage in more ex-ante screening. Controlling for firm and loan characteristics, nonbank loans carry about 200 basis points higher interest rates. Using fuzzy regression discontinuity design and matching techniques generates similar results. Overall, our results provide evidence of market segmentation in the commercial loan market, where bank and nonbank lenders utilize different lending techniques and cater to different types of borrowers.
G30|Corporate Investment Under the Cloud of Litigation|We study the effect of legal risk on firmsâ€™ investment. Using legal risk measures based on the number of litigious words in SEC 10-K filings, we find legal risk reduces investment. Underlying mechanisms include both i) a financing channel, whereby legal risk reduces credit ratings, increases bank loan costs, and decreases borrowing, and ii) an attention channel, whereby legal risk consumes top-managementâ€™s attention. Accordingly, we find legal risk has negative effects on firmsâ€™ investment efficiency and stock performance. We address endogeneity concerns through a DiD analysis utilizing staggered adoptions of universal demand laws across states.
G30|Why Are Firms With More Managerial Ownership Worth Less?|Using more than 50,000 firm-years from 1988 to 2015, we show that the empirical relation between a firm’s Tobin’s q and managerial ownership is systematically negative. When we restrict our sample to larger firms as in the prior literature, our findings are consistent with the literature, showing that there is an increasing and concave relation between q and managerial ownership. We show that these seemingly contradictory results are explained by cumulative past performance and liquidity. Better performing firms have more liquid equity, which enables insiders to more easily sell shares after the IPO, and they also have a higher Tobin’s q.
G30|Private Equity and Financial Fragility during the Crisis|Does private equity (PE) contribute to financial fragility during economic crises? Academics and regulators have worried that the proliferation of poorly structured transactions during booms may increase the vulnerability of the economy to downturns. During the 2008 financial crisis, we find PE-backed companies decreased investments less than their peers, while experiencing greater equity and debt inflows. The effects are stronger among financially constrained companies and those whose PE investors had more resources at the onset of the crisis. PE-backed companies consequentially experienced higher asset growth and increased market share during the crisis. In a large-scale survey, we find that private equity firms were active investors during the crisis, spending more time with their portfolio companies to address operational and financial considerations.
G30|Derivatives, financial fragility and systemic risk: lessons from Barings Bank, Long-Term Capital Management, Lehman Brothers and AIG|This paper aims at analysing the relationship among derivatives, financial fragility and systemic risk by discussing the role played by these financial instruments in the collapse or near-collapse of Barings Bank, Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), Lehman Brothers and AIG. We investigate in which ways derivatives contributed to the build-up of systemic risks in these experiences according to a Post-Keynesian perspective, which is focused on the Minskyian concept of financial fragility and Cardim de Carvalho’s analysis of contagion and systemic risk. Our analysis points out that derivatives’ embedded leverage played a pivotal role in fragilizing the financial positions of Barings, LTCM and AIG, and a supporting role in Lehman’s failure, accelerating its financial debacle. While Barings’ failure did not cause contagion nor systemic consequences via derivative markets, in the case of Lehman derivatives worked as a major mechanism of contagion and contributed to the materialization of a systemic crisis. Yet, concerns on potential contagion effects via derivatives in the cases of LTCM (indirect) and AIG (direct) provided reasons for setting up the bailouts that avoided the collapse of these institutions. Finally, we highlight that, if speculative and Ponzi financing positions are widespread, instead of cushioning financial shocks, derivatives might fragilize even more financial institutions and disseminate difficulties among the financial system, therefore contributing to a systemic crisis to take place.
G30|Convenience yield on government bonds and unconventional monetary policy in Japanese corporate bond spreads|This paper examines the factors that contribute to credit spreads in the primary market for Japanese corporate bonds, especially when the Bank of Japan implemented unconventional monetary policy measures. The models of credit spreads based on the Treasury convenience yield hypothesis are estimated using an issue-level dataset. The results indicate that the factors to explain credit spreads changed under the unconventional monetary policy regime. Investors became less sensitive to the risk of default for issuers with different credit quality due to the unprecedented degree of monetary easing. The Japanese government’s debt-to-GDP ratio, which is a measure of the convenience yield on government bonds, is an important driver of credit spreads throughout the sample period.
G30|Analysis of Corporate Social Responsibility, Default Risk and Conservatism Effect to Earning Management with Good Corporate Governance as Moderating Variable in Manufacturing Company Whose Shares Incorporated in Indonesia Sharia Stock Index|The purpose of this research is to examine and analyze Good Corporate Governance in moderating the relationship between Corporate Social Responsibility (as measured by economic, environmental and social), Default Risk (as measured by debt to equity ratio and debt to assets ratio) and Conservatism (as measured by earning / stock return relation, accruals and net assets) Earnings Management. The sample used is a manufacturing company during the period 2011-2015. The total sample used is 170 samples. Sampling technique used is saturated sample method. The analytical model used in this research with Structural Equation Modeling. The results showed that Corporate Social Responsibility, as measured by the economy and environment, has a positive and significant effect on earning management, while Corporate Social Responsibility measured by social have negative and significant effect to earning management. Default risk, as measured by debt to equity ratio and debt to asset ratio, has positive and significant effect on Earnings Management. Also, conservatism measured by earning / stock return relation and accrual has adverse and insignificant effect on earning management. Good Corporate Governance moderates weakening the effect of Corporate Social Responsibility as measured by economic, environmental to Earnings Management. Meanwhile, the interaction of Corporate Social Responsibility proxy by social with good corporate governance has a positive and significant effect. Good Corporate Governance moderates weakening the effect of default risk measured by debt to equity ratio on Earnings Management, while the interaction between default risk measured by debt to asset ratio with good corporate governance has positive and insignificant effect, so GCG does not moderate the effect of default risk as measured by debt to asset ratio to Earnings Management. Another result was that good Corporate governance does not moderate Conservatism effect measured by Earning Stock Return and accrual to Earnings Management on manufacturing companies registered in ISSI on the Indonesia Stock Exchange
G30|An Indicator of Credit Crunch using Italian Business Surveys|This paper presents a two-step procedure to derive a credit crunch indicator for the Italian manufacturing sector. Using qualitative firm-level data over the years 2008-2018, nonlinear discrete panel data techniques are first applied in order to identify the loan supply curve controlling for firm-specific observable characteristics. In the subsequent step, the variation of the estimated supply curve that cannot be explained by proxies for loan demand is interpreted as the degree of credit squeeze prevailing in the economy at a given point in time. The empirical evidence shows that credit crunch episodes are less likely to occur during periods of sustained economic growth, or when credit availability for the manufacturing sector is relatively abundant. In contrast, a tight monetary policy stance or a worsening of the quality of banking balance sheets tend to increase the likelihood of experiencing a credit squeeze
G30|Relevance of governance quality on the effect of foreign direct investment on economic growth: new evidence from African countries|Despite the large volume of studies on the direct impact of foreign direct investment on economic growth, the results remain inconclusive. This has led researchers to examine the channels through which FDI affects economic growth. Evidence suggests that institution quality can improve economic growth by increasing foreign direct investment in the host countries. As governance quality is improving in African countries during the last decade, the aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between foreign direct investment, governance quality and economic growth in 51 African countries over the period 1998-2015. The empirical evidence is based on Generalized Method of Moments. The following findings are established. First, there is an unconditional positive effect of foreign direct investment on economic growth in African countries. We also find a positive and significant relationship between governance quality and economic growth. Second, these findings are still robust when we use the composite governance quality indicators. Three, when regards at interaction terms between governance quality and foreign direct investment, we find a convincing evidence that governance quality moderate favorably the effect of FDI on economic growth. Four, the moderate effect of governance quality on foreign direct investment and growth nexus still robust with composite governance quality indicators. Overall this study has established net direct positive and significant effect of foreign direct investment on economic growth and that this effect is enhanced by good governance. The major implication from our study is that African countries should improve their governance quality to benefit more from FDI in terms of achieving better growth outcomes.
G30|Learning about Competitors: Evidence from SME Lending|This paper provides evidence of strategic complementarities in lenders’ contract terms in SME financing. To isolate this strategic effect from lenders’ joint reaction to unobserved common shocks to fundamentals, we exploit the staggered entry of lenders into an information sharing platform. Upon joining, lenders adjust their terms toward what others are offering. This effect is mediated by market power and seems to be driven by incentives to match rivals in order to preserve market share as opposed to learning about fundamentals. We also find evidence that this strategic behavior increased delinquencies during the recent crisis.
G30|Does credit reporting lead to a decline in relationship lending? Evidence from information sharing technology|I examine how credit reporting affects where firms access credit and how lenders contract with them. I use within firm-time and lender-time tests that exploit lenders joining a credit bureau and sharing information in a staggered pattern. I find information sharing reduces relationship-switching costs, particularly for firms that are young, small, or have had no defaults. After sharing, lenders transition away from relationship contracting, in two ways: contract maturities in new relationships are shorter, and lenders are less willing to provide financing to their delinquent borrowers. My results highlight the mixed effects of transparency-improving financial technologies on credit availability.
G30|Sample separation and the sensitivity of investment to cash flow: Is the monotonicity condition empirically satisfied?| This paper studies whether the monotonicity condition of the investment-cash flow sensitivity is satisfied empirically. We show that if this condition holds, then the point of sample separation does not affect the monotonic relationship between the sensitivities of any two complementary classes of observations. Our test, based upon observable averages of the investment-cash flow sensitivity, rejects the monotonicity condition for any common metric of financing constraints we use. The testing procedure we propose reconciles the conflicting findings of the literature about the shape of the investment-cash flow sensitivity.
G30|Fostering Green Finance for Sustainable Development in Asia|Placing the Asian economies onto a sustainable development pathway requires an unprecedented shift in investment away from greenhouse gas, fossil fuel, and natural resource intensive industries towards more resource efficient technologies and business models. The financial sector will have to play a central role in this ‘green transformation’. This study discusses the need for greening the financial system and the role of financial governance. It reviews the state of green lending and investment in Asia and provides an overview of green financial governance initiatives across Asia. It also identifies market innovations to increase green finance in Asia, barriers to green investments, and financial policy and highlights priority areas for policy makers.
G30|Young Enterprises and Bank Credit Denials|By employing a sample of 20,956 observations of nonfinancial small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) headquartered in the euro area, between 2009 and 2015, we test whether young businesses are more likely to face credit rejections from lenders than their older peers. Our findings appear to confirm our suspicions that new enterprises consistently experience higher denials from banks compared with more established businesses. Such a result is stable to different model specifications and is also confirmed once we handle the issue of sample selection bias potentially affecting our data. Additional tests also reveal that credit constraints are particularly difficult for young SMEs located in Southern and Central Europe, as well as for those operating in the “trade” industry. Overall, our evidence suggests that actions from the policy maker could be desirable to support the viability of credit and, thus, ensure the growth of young businesses in the euro area.
G30|The Governance of Risk Management: The Importance of Directors’ Independence and Financial Knowledge|This paper tests the effects of the independence and ﬁnancial knowledge of directors on risk management and ﬁrm value in the gold mining industry. Our original hand-collected database on directors’ ﬁnancial education, accounting background, and ﬁnancial experience allows us to test the effect of each dimension of ﬁnancial knowledge on risk management activities. We show that directors’ ﬁnancial knowledge increases ﬁrm value through the risk management channel. This effect is strengthened by the independence of the directors on the board and on the audit committee. Extending the dimension of education, we show that, following unexpected shocks to gold prices, educated hedgers are more effective than average hedgers in the industry. As a policy implication, our results suggest adding the experience and education dimensions to the 2002 Sarbanes–Oxley Act and New York Stock Exchange requirements for ﬁnancial literacy.
G30|Divers and Hindrances of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Implementation: Evidence from India|After global financial crisis, risk management failures of business firms were highlighted and a need of integrated risk management system was felt globally. Indian firms were no more exception to these developments and it became mandatory for all listed Indian firms to introduce a formal risk management system after introduction of clause 49 in the year 2000. Since then all public and private sector firms in India started developing a formal risk management system. Even after one and half decade the level of implementation of enterprise risk management and its understanding by people working in these firms is immature and questionable. The purpose of this paper is to identify drivers and hindrances of enterprise risk management implementation in listed Indian companies. The study used a primary survey of top and middle level executives working in listed companies of India. An online questionnaire is circulated for data collection from 500 public and private companies listed on National stock exchange of India. Total findings of 15 drivers and 30 hindrances, collected from literature review were found critical and respondents were asked to priorities on a five point scale. The findings of the study identified significant drivers and hindrances of ERM implementation for listed Indian firms. Findings of this study can be used by top level management of companies of emerging economies likes India for efficient implementation of ERM.
G30|Impact of working capital (WC) strategies on small business profitability during recession|Small business is most numerous type of business in the United States with about 90 percent failure rate within the first 2 years of its establishment. This study investigated the impact of finance and investing strategies on small businesses before and after the great recession that started in late 2007. Data for this study was from the best profitable 100 small businesses as published by Forbes in 2011. The multivariate panel regression models were estimated using published financial statements of the surveyed 72 companies from year 2002 to 2011. The study outcomes show that when WC strategies (finance and investing policies) are prudently and efficiently applied to business operations it will increase profitability. It further indicated that less working capital (aggressive financing strategy) would increase return on assets before and after economic recession. The aggressive strategy will positively reflect on Tobin?s Q during normal time; but during recession, only less current liability capital will be effective. The study further revealed that return on equity (ROE) will be effective only when current liability is regressed on total assets during normal times, and no change is observed during economic recession.
G30|Corporate Governance Score and Earnings Quality of Companies Listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand|The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between corporate governance score and earnings quality of companies listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand. This study used secondary data of companies in the Stock Exchange of Thailand in all industrial groups excluding companies in the market for alternative investment, business financial group, as well as the rehabilitation companies. The sample included companies with corporate governance score which corresponding to ?Excellent? and ?Very Good? recognition level in the year 2014 and 2015. The data was analyzed using regression analysis.In this study, the earnings quality is measured in terms of discretionary accruals and standard deviation of net income. The results suggested that corporate governance score was negatively related to discretionary accruals indicating positive relationship between corporate governance score and earnings quality. Corporate governance score was also found positively related to cash flows return to total assets. However, corporate governance score was not found to be significantly related to standard deviation of net income.The results of this study implied that corporate governance scores, based on the recognition level of the National Committee on Corporate Governance, are likely to represent earnings quality of listed companies in the Stock Exchange of Thailand in the context of discretionary accruals and cash flows return to total assets.
G30|Corporate Governance, Institutional Reforms And Business Environment (A Short Comparative Analyses For Some Wb Countries)|Through providing tools and mechanisms for balanced representation of stakeholders' interests (first of all, to owners, management and employees) corporate governance according to OECD principles should ensure the increase of the value of the assets of companies, their competitiveness capacities and attractiveness to investors. As in general in transition economies building these mechanisms and implementing these principles at the companies proved to be problematic more in their implementation than in developing legal framework. Institutional environment, maturity of democratic institution, and especially business environment seems to be very relevant the quality of corporate governance in transition economies. This paper after presenting some of theoretical discussions on specific corporate governance issues in transition economies presents also short comparative overview regarding achievements in key areas of corporate governance in Kosovo, Albania, Croatia and Bulgaria. This comparative analyses demonstrate that corporate governance and its implementation very much depend on the level of institutional maturity, especially perceptions on the level of corruption and also to business environment which provides conditions for free and fair competition.
G30|Framework Building of Financial Performance Index for Airports- A case of Taiwan|This paper has constructed the representative financial performance evaluation indicators framework for different level airports (type A and B). This paper, by using airport?s two main financial reports: ?balance sheet? and ?Income Statement? and accommodating with characteristics of revenue and expenditure of airports, divides financial evaluation into five elements of ?solvency?, ?profitability?, ?return of investment?, ?assets turnover ratio? and ?debts turnover ratio?, 19 initial financial results evaluation indicators are achieved for proceeding the airports financial results evaluation. For the selection of indicators, this paper uses Grey Relation Analysis to examine the relationship between indicators. Those with high correlation are grouped and then a representative indicator is selected from among them. This method not only simplifies the complex work of evaluation, but can also manage such limitations as a dearth of information or unknown distribution types. In application of the actual sample of A type airports? financial results evaluation, the numbers of evaluation indicator had been decreased from 19 to 6 and make the decreasing ratio 68.42%. In application of the samples B type airports? financial results evaluation, initial financial evaluation indicators had decreased from 19 to 5 representative ones. The evaluation indicators decreasing ratio is 73.68%.
G30|Trade Credit and Product Market Power during a Financial Crisis|This paper investigates whether product market power affects trade credit decisions. We exploit the 2007-08 credit crisis in the U.S. as a source of variation in the importance of product market power for trade credit. We find that a one standard deviation increase in market power is associated to a decrease in payables of approximately four days during the crisis, showing that high market power firms alleviate financial constraints from their suppliers to avoid the loss of monopoly rents. Our inferences are robust to structural and non-structural measures of market power, both at the firm and at the industry levels, and the inclusion of controls to address potential confounding effects deriving from other firm features, including financial constraints, industry specific shocks and macroeconomic effects.
G30|The effect of house prices on bank risk: empirical evidence from Hungary|Housing market is important from a macroprudential perspective because it has a strong effect on the banking sector. Changes in real estate prices may affect the level of bank risk through household mortgage lending, however, the literature has no clear conclusion on this impact mechanism. Using a bank-level database containing quarterly data from 1998 to 2016 we estimated dynamic fixed-effects panel models to examine how bank risk is influenced by housing prices via mortgage lending in the Hungarian banking system. According to the results (1) higher house prices lead to higher bank risk, (2) the higher the share of mortgage loans at a bank, the stronger the positive effect of house prices on bank risk. In the period following the onset of the crisis a much stronger positive relationship could be observed between house prices and bank risk than before the crisis. Using the house price gap which measures the deviation of house prices from their fundamental value we provide empirical evidence that the deviation hypothesis was stronger for Hungary. This suggests that both banks and households tend to undertake excessive risks during a housing market boom, which can be mitigated by macroprudential policy instruments.
G30|A Sufficient Statistics Approach for Aggregating Firm-Level Experiments|"We consider a dynamic economy populated by heterogeneous firms subject to generic capital frictions: adjustment costs, taxes and financing constraints. A random subset of firms in this economy receives an empirical ""treatment"", which modifies the parameters governing these frictions. An econometrician observes the firm-level response to this treatment, and wishes to calculate how macroeconomic outcomes would change if all firms in the economy were treated. Our paper proposes a simple methodology to estimate this aggregate counterfactual using firm-level evidence only. Our approach takes general equilibrium effects into account, requires neither a structural estimation nor a precise knowledge on the exact nature of the experiment and can be implemented using simple moments of the distribution of revenue-to-capital ratios. We provide a set of sufficient conditions under which these formulas are valid and investigate the robustness of our approach to multiple variations in the aggregation framework."
G30|Corporate foreign bond issuance and interfirm loans in China|This paper uses firm-level data to document and analyse international bond issuance by Chinese non-financial corporations and the use of the proceeds of issuance. We find that dollar issuance is positively correlated with the differential between domestic and foreign interest rates. This interest rate differential increases the likelihood of dollar bond issuance by risky firms and decreases the likelihood of dollar bond issuance of exporters and profitable firms. Moreover, and most strikingly, we find that risky firms do more inter-firm lending than non-risky firms and that this lending rose significantly after the regulatory shock of 2008-09, when the authorities sought to restrict the financial activities of risky firms. Risky firms try to boost profitability by engaging in speculative activities that mimic the behaviour of financial institutions while escaping prudential regulation that limits risk-taking by financial firms.
G30|The Elasticity of Taxable Income in the Presence of Intertemporal Income Shifting|Knowing the elasticity of taxable income (ETI) is crucial for understanding the effects of taxation on taxpayer behavior and consequently on tax revenues. Previous research finds that high-income individuals are the most sensitive to tax policy changes. However, these individuals have more opportunities to defer income to future tax bases by altering the composition of their compensation than lower-income individuals. This paper considers the taxable income elasticity when individuals can shift income across tax bases and thereby defer taxation. We decompose the elasticity of taxable income into a real response as well as an income shifting response. We measure the tax rate on deferred income by the expected tax gain from deferring income using stock options as developed by Hall and Liebman (2000). Our results demonstrate that income shifting is an important component of previous estimates of the ETI. Because shifted income is taxed at future dates, income shifting decreases the welfare loss from personal income taxation associated with previous estimates.
G30|Buying the Verdict|We document evidence that firms systematically increase specialized, locally targeted advertising following the firm being taken to trial in that given location - precisely following initiation of the suit. In particular, we use legal actions brought against publicly traded firms over the 20 year sample period that progress to trial from 1995-2014. In terms of magnitude, the increase is sizable: targeted local advertising increases by 23% (t=4.39) following the suit. Moreover, firms concentrate these strategic increases in locations where the return on their advertising dollars are largest: in smaller, more concentrated advertising markets where fewer competitor firms are advertising. They focus their advertisement spikes specifically toward jury trials, and in fact specifically toward the most likely jury pool. Lastly, we document that these advertising spikes are associated with verdicts, increasing the probability of a favorable outcome.
G30|Selection versus Talent Effects on Firm Value|Measuring the value of labor-market hires for stock prices, be it underwriters when firms go public (IPOs) or chief executive officers (CEOs), is difficult due to selection. Opaque firms with higher costs of capital benefit more from prestigious underwriters, while productive firms benefit more from talented CEOs. Using assignment models, we show that the importance of talent (or agent heterogeneity) relative to selection (or firm heterogeneity) is measured by wage increases across agents of different compensation ranks divided by changes in output across their firms. The median of this ratio is 0.5% for underwriters and 2% for CEOs.
G30|In the Shadows of the Government: Relationship Building During Political Turnovers|"We document that following a turnover of the Party Secretary or mayor of a city in China, firms (especially private firms) headquartered in that city significantly increase their ""perk spending."" Both the instrumental-variable-based results and heterogeneity analysis are consistent with the interpretation that the perk spending is used to build relations with local governments. Moreover, local political turnover in a city tends to be followed by changes of Chairmen or CEOs of state-owned firms that are controlled by the local government. However, the Chairmen or CEOs who have connections with local government officials are less likely to be replaced."
G30|How does finance influence labour market outcomes?: A review of empirical studies|This paper reviews empirical research on finance and labour markets. Preliminary themes in the literature follow. Finance may interact with labour market institutions to jointly determine labour outcomes. Highly leveraged firms show greater employment volatility during cyclical fluctuations, and leverage strengthens firm bargaining power in labour negotiations. Bank deregulation may have mixed impacts on labour depending upon the state of bank regulations and labour markets. Leveraged buyouts tend to dampen acquired firm job growth as they pursue labour productivity gains. The shareholder value movement may contribute to short-termism among corporate managers, which can divert funds away from firm capital accumulation toward financial markets, crowd out productive investment and fuel unemployment. Declining wage shares in OECD countries may be driven in part by financial globalisation. The financial sector contributes to rising concentration near the top of the income distribution. Finance is linked to increased reallocation of labour, which may either enhance or impede productivity growth. Finally, there is limited evidence that rising interest rate environments and homeowners with mortgage balances that exceed their home’s value may reduce labour mobility rates.
G30|Options, equity risks, and the value of capital structure adjustments|We use exchange-traded options to identify risks relevant to capital structure adjustments in firms. These forward-looking market-based risk measures provide significant explanatory power in predicting net leverage changes in excess of accounting data. They matter most during contractionary periods and for growth firms. We form market-based indices that capture firms' magnitudes of, and propensity for, net leverage increases. Firms with larger predicted leverage increases outperform firms with lower predicted increases by 3.1% to 3.9% per year in buy-and-hold abnormal returns. Finally, consistent with the quality, leverage, and distress risk puzzles, firms with lower predicted leverage increases are riskier but earn lower abnormal returns.
G30|Do tax havens create firm value?|On October 11, 2011, a non-governmental organization called ActionAid published a report condemning the FTSE 100 firms for holding an unusually large number of subsidiaries in tax havens. Urging the government to implement appropriate actions, the report raised the firms' costs of holding tax haven subsidiaries. After this event, the stock prices of the nonfinancial firms experienced a 0.9% abnormal drop (corresponding to about £9billion in market capitalization). Those better-governed firms and those with larger shares of subsidiaries in tax havens experienced larger drops. We find some evidence that government scrutiny, reputation, and investor sentiment were plausible channels of such a negative impact.
G30|Efficient non-cooperative bargaining despite keeping strategic information private|The preferred method for negotiating joint value-added activities, such as e.g. licensing, co-venturing or supply chain expansion, is cooperative bargaining, where agents act rationally and have perfect information, i.e., information sharing occurs. In such settings, however, stronger partner often insist on keeping their valuable information private and thus cooperative bargaining cannot occur due to the lack of information sharing. Though, non-cooperative bargaining is usually assumed to be inefficient. Based on a game-theoretic real options model, we develop a contractual solution that allows the proposer to keep its valuable information private while at the same time motivates the other partner to act in a timely and efficient manner, that is, to be Pareto-efficient.
G30|Stock liquidity and dividend payouts|This study investigates the informational effect of stock liquidity on dividend payouts. Using a sample of Chinese listed firms during 2000–2014, we find a positive relation between stock liquidity and dividend payouts. This result is robust to the use of alternative measures of liquidity, and holds after we control for endogeneity concerns. In accord with our hypothesis that stock liquidity provides information and increases insiders' incentive to pay out dividends, we find that the positive relation between stock liquidity and dividend payouts is more pronounced when the information environment is opaque, and when conflict between controlling shareholders and minority investors is severe. Further, market reactions to regulatory stipulations requiring dividend payouts are more favorable for firms with low stock liquidity, suggesting that legal provisions and regulations are substitutes for stock liquidity. Finally, we rule out several alternative explanations concerning the governance of non-controlling blockholders and the alleviation of manager-shareholder agency conflict.
G30|Option incentives, leverage, and risk-taking|While there is extensive research on how option incentives in executive compensation relate to risk-taking by managers, the impact of capital structure on this relationship has received little empirical attention. Extant work suggests that heightened managerial career concerns arising from financial risk and monitoring by debt holders will result in leverage dampening the relationship between managerial risk-taking and equity-linked incentives. We empirically evaluate this contention and find that firm leverage is associated with a significant weakening of the positive relationship between option incentives in flow compensation and managerial risk-taking. This result holds after accounting for the endogeneity of the firm leverage and incentive compensation decisions, and is robust across alternative measures of managerial risk-taking and to using the firm's credit ratings instead of leverage. The attenuating effect of firm leverage arises from both the long-term and short-term components of debt and is significantly stronger during the financial crisis of 2007–2009. Overall, the evidence highlights the influence of capital structure on the relationship between option incentives and managerial risk-taking.
G30|Internal governance and performance: Evidence from when external discipline is weak|The effect of internal governance on performance is potentially economically significant but may be difficult to identify because of confounding external disciplinary mechanisms and the endogenous choice of internal governance. This study addresses those difficulties by using nonprofit hospitals as an economic environment with muted external disciplinary mechanisms and instrumenting for internal governance using governance spillovers of geographically local public firms. Using patient heart attack survival as a measure of performance, a one standard deviation increase in strength of internal governance reduces the probability of death by 0.89 percentage points after controlling for patient characteristics.
G30|Corporate social responsibility and capital allocation efficiency|We investigate the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and firm-level capital allocation efficiency. Using seminal investment-Q framework, we provide evidence that CSR distorts investment sensitivity to Q. We further determine that this effect of CSR is moderated by the assumed level of agency conflict, stakeholder engagement, as well as financial slack. We also document that CSR negatively affects the sensitivity of external finance to Q and aggravates investment sensitivity to cash flow. In addition, we find that the distortion in the firm-level capital allocation efficiency is reflected in firm performance. Our findings are robust to alternative variable measurement as well as tests for endogeneity.
G30|Financial distress and customer-supplier relationships|Using a customer-supplier matched sample from 1980 to 2014, I study the role of customer-supplier relationships on suppliers' financial distress. If a significant amount of a supplier's sales is tied to a major customer, the supplier's financial health is influenced by the major customer's financial conditions. I find that a supplier's probability of financial distress is positively related to its major customer's financial distress status. This relation persists up to two years after a major customer is in financial distress. Further, I show that the relationship is more pronounced when customer-supplier relationships are stronger, when a major customer is more likely to fail in the future, and when the supplier makes unique products. The results highlight the importance of understanding customer-supplier relationships when analyzing a firm's probability of financial distress.
G30|Do fraudulent firms produce abnormal disclosure?|Using text-based analysis of 10-K MD&A disclosures, we find that fraudulent firms produce verbal disclosure that is abnormal relative to strong counterfactuals. This abnormal text predicts fraud out of sample, has a verbal factor structure, and can be interpreted to reveal likely mechanisms that surround fraudulent behavior. Using a conservative difference-based approach, we find evidence that fraudulent managers discuss fewer details explaining the sources of the firm's performance, while disclosing more information about positive aspects of firm performance. They also provide less content relating the disclosure to the managerial team itself. We also find new interpretable verbal support for the well-known hypothesis that managers commit fraud in order to artificially lower their cost of capital.
G30|The impact of board gender composition on dividend payouts|This paper investigates whether female independent directors are more likely to impose high dividend payouts. We find evidence that firms with a larger fraction of female directors on their board have greater dividend payouts. This finding is robust to alternative econometric specifications, and alternative measures of dividend payouts and female board representation. The positive effect of board gender composition on dividends remains when we employ propensity score matching, the instrumental variable approach, and difference-in-differences approach to address potential endogeneity concerns. Furthermore, we find that board gender composition significantly increases the dividend payout only for firms with weak governance, suggesting that female directors use dividend payouts as a governance device.
G30|How do neighboring peer companies influence SMEs’ financial behavior?|Recent research into corporate finances has found that the financial decisions of peer companies are related. Companies tend to “kept an eye” on the decisions of other peer companies, among other things, trying to overcome the limitations caused by the lack of information. This paper further examines these interactions including geographical proximity among companies. With this aim, we use a heterogeneous Partial Adjustment Model on a sample of 12,444 small and medium Spanish manufacturing industrial companies. We find strong nonlinearities in the adjustment processes of liquidity, indebtedness and profitability ratios associated with basic characteristics of the companies such as size, technology, age or financial imbalances. Our results indicate that the influence of the environment on the financial behavior of each company, and its responsiveness, vary in function of neighbor firms’ characteristics.
G30|Managerial incentives and R&D investments: The moderating effect of the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance|Literature regarding the impact of managerial incentives on firm’s research and development (R&D) investments suggests that due to the riskiness of R&D activities, firms need to provide managerial incentives to encourage managerial discretion on corporate long-term investments of R&D. In spite that managerial incentives influence corporate R&D spending, some also argue corporate R&D spending a function of managerial incentive schemes. This paper applies the simultaneous equation to investigate the association between managerial discretion on R&D investments and the incentive scheme of CEO compensations by using the sample firms listed in Taiwan Security Exchange and Taipei Exchange. The results indicate that the listed firms in Taiwan simultaneously determine corporate R&D investments and CEO compensations. They reward their CEOs in compliance with their efforts on R&D investments and CEO compensation motivates CEOs to align their interests with firms’ long-term investments on R&D. A further analysis of the protection effect from the directors’ and officers’ (D&O) liability insurance suggests that D&O protection intensifies the relationship between R&D investments and CEO compensation. It encourages CEOs to allocate resources on R&D activities and make CEO incentive contracts efficacious on corporate long-term investments. The result is robust in the electronic industry of Taiwan.
G30|Doing good or choosing well? Corporate reputation, CEO reputation, and corporate financial performance|Using data from Taiwan’s top 150 listed companies over the period 2003 to 2014, our study explores the influence of CEO reputation and corporate reputation on the financial performance of companies. The analysis focuses especially on the interaction between CEO reputation and corporate reputation to identify which dimension of reputation is more relevant to firm performance. We show that, though both corporate reputation and CEO reputation have an individual impact that benefits the financial performance of the company, the impact of CEO reputation is more persistent across different time periods and more comprehensive across different industries. Furthermore, we find that CEO reputation still has a positive impact on firm performance when corporate reputation is poor, indicating that CEO reputation is more important to firm performance. To pursue better financial performance, should a company make greater effort to build a good corporate reputation, or merely recruit a CEO with a good reputation? Our suggestion here is simple: “choosing well” is better than “doing good.”
G30|The peer-firm effect on firm’s investment decisions|This study investigates the effect of peer firms on firm investment strategies. We test the peer group effect hypothesis along differing levels of financially constrained firms as well as differing degrees of industry competition. Using idiosyncratic equity returns as the instrument variable, we use 2-stage least squares regression to identify the influence of peer firms’ investment decisions on a firm’s own investment policies. Our analyses empirically confirm that there is a peer group effect in making firm investment decisions. More financially constrained firms show greater dependency on peers’ investment decisions. Tests of peer sensitivity to the increase in industrial competition, however, displayed a U-shaped quadratic curve, which shows that firms have the lowest peer group effect in medium-competition markets. We claim that imitative behavior in investment is presumably weak in the mid-competition market because firms are yet to be distinguished in this market.
G30|A note on using ratio variables in regression analysis|This paper revisits the problem of choosing ratio variables in regression analysis in Musumeci and Peterson (2011). In the application we examined, linear regressions with the ratio variable, its reciprocal or logarithm have been rejected. To avoid model misspecifications, we suggest to use nonlinear regressions on ratio variables. Our empirical evidence shows that a semiparametric partially linear model could be a robust solution. In particular, the logarithm of the ratio variable performs slightly better than the ratio variable and its reciprocal.
G30|The effect of corporate governance on firm value and profitability: Time-series evidence from Turkey|We study the corporate governance practices of Turkish public firms from 2006 to 2012, relying on hand-collected data covering the vast majority of listed firms. We build a Turkey Corporate Governance Index, TCGI, composed of subindices for board structure, board procedure, disclosure, ownership, and shareholder rights. TCGI predicts higher market value (with firm fixed effects) and higher firm-level profitability with firm random effects. The principal subindex which predicts higher market value and profitability, and drives the results for TCGI as a whole, is disclosure subindex. We also study the determinants of firms' governance and find that most firm-specific factors have little effect on firms' governance choices.
G30|Customer-base concentration and the transmission of idiosyncratic volatility along the vertical chain|This paper investigates the link between a firm's customer-base concentration and stock return volatility. We find that firms with more concentrated customer bases have higher idiosyncratic volatility. Further, we show significant variation in customer-base concentration effects across customer and supplier firm dimensions, including customer type, customer default probability, customer idiosyncratic volatility, customer customer-base concentration, extended trade credit, and industry product market competition. Our results are robust to potential endogeneity concerns, different estimation methodologies and volatility measures, among numerous other robustness checks. Overall, our results contribute to the understanding of idiosyncratic volatility sources in firm stock returns and provide new evidence on the transmission of firm-specific shocks in a supply-chain network environment.
G30|Family ownership, country governance, and foreign portfolio investment|We study how different dimensions of family ownership combine to make family firms around the world appealing to foreign investors. Family firms provide the benefits of political connections, but at the same time they are more prone to expropriate minority shareholders themselves. This cost-benefit trade-off depends on the quality of country governance: families are attractive investment opportunities in countries in which the value of political connections is high, but the majority shareholders have limited ability to expropriate, i.e., “useful” countries. Foreign investors – more sensitive both to the risk of expropriation by the government and to the risk of expropriation by majority shareholders – are particularly responsive to this trade-off. While on average foreign institutional investors are less likely to invest in family firms and such firms have lower value, these effects disappear when family ownership in a country is useful.
G30|Controlling shareholders and market timing: Evidence from cross-listing events|We find partial support for a permanent increase in firm value following U.S. cross-listings. Cross-listed firms with capital-raising intentions on U.S. exchanges and firms cross-listing after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act exhibit an increase in firm value. Yet, investors are worse off in the long run when owning insider-controlled cross-listings. Compared to non-insider-owned cross-listings, insider-owned firms have a greater rise in value around the cross-listing year but also a larger decline in the post-cross-listing years. In fact, insider-owned firms lose value by the fifth year, compared with their value before cross-listing. Lastly, we show that liquidity and visibility enhance the value of cross-listings.
G30|Board diversity and financial fragility: Evidence from European banks|In the wake of the recent debt crisis in Europe, we investigate the influence of board diversity on financial fragility and performance of European banks. Corporate governance codes in Europe recommend unitary and dual-board systems; therefore, we believe that the influence of board diversity may vary across governance mechanisms and that no other studies have addressed these variations and their influence on financial fragility across European countries. The results show that a critical mass of female representation on both the supervisory board and the board of directors may reduce banks’ vulnerability to financial crisis. However, interestingly, we find evidence that female directors on the management board are not risk averse. We argue that the degree of risk taking for female directors may vary based on their roles (non-executive or executive) and that female and male executive directors may have the same risk taking behaviour. Our empirical results provide guidelines to the regulators in Europe with respect to the recently approved proposal by the European Parliament on female representation.
G30|Gender-diverse board and the relevance of voluntary CSR reporting|In this paper, we focus on voluntary corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure, and we test the extent to which the value relevance of CSR reporting is affected by the appointment of female directors. Using a sample of French listed companies belonging to the SBF 120 index from 2001 to 2011, we control for differences in firm characteristics between firms with and without female board membership by using propensity score matching. Our results show that high CSR reporting is more relevant in terms of market value for firms with gender-diverse boards than for firms with completely male directors. This finding holds when we use the accounting-based performance measures, namely, return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). We also highlight that engaging an external assurance provider for CSR reporting is value relevant for firms without female directors but not value relevant for firms with female directors, suggesting a substitute relationship between gender-diverse boards and CSR assurance. Our results are stable when we consider the presence of at least two and three female directors.
G30|The role of corruption in shaping the value of holding cash|This paper analyses the relationship between cash holdings and performance, considering the moderating effect of corruption that exists in the institutional context in which firms operate. The results show the importance of corruption in shaping the sign and the intensity of the value of cash holdings. The sign of the effect of corporate liquidity on firm performance changes according to varying levels of corruption. Holding cash is shown to have a noteworthy and no marginal role in supporting business activities and points to an avenue of investigation for future research.
G30|Corporate governance practices, ownership structure, and corporate performance in the GCC countries|This study is motivated by highly concentrated ownership, the relatively large government stake in listed firms in the GCC (Gulf Cooperative Council) region, and the rapid stock market development and developing investor protection environment. The results point to heterogeneity in governance quality across exchanges. For the first time, we find that the positive relationship between governance quality and firm performance is maintained and is stronger at low levels of concentrated ownership. More interestingly, we find that the relationship between governance and firm performance is an increasing function of dispersed ownership and that the value addition of good governance is not necessarily maintained at high levels of ownership concentration. Furthermore, such a relationship reaches its highest level when the government or local corporations are the firm’s major shareholders.
G30|Do Delaware CEOs get fired?|Critics have charged that state competition in corporate law, which Delaware dominates, leads to a “race to the bottom” making management unaccountable. We argue that Delaware corporate law attracts firms with particular financial and governance characteristics. We find that Delaware attracts growth firms in industries with more takeover activity. Delaware firms have smaller boards, and their directors are paid more and serve on more boards. In addition, Delaware firms attract greater institutional ownership. We also provide a bottom-line test of the race-to-the-bottom hypothesis by examining forced CEO turnover. After controlling for differences in firm characteristics, we find that firms incorporated in Delaware are more likely to terminate CEOs. We also find that that termination decision is less sensitive to poor performance. Overall, we see no clear pattern supporting the “race to the bottom” hypothesis.
G30|The role of governance on bank liquidity creation|This paper examines the impact of internal bank governance on bank liquidity creation in the U.S. before, during and after the 2007–2009 financial crisis. Using bank holding company level data, we analyze whether better-governed banks create higher levels of liquidity. We find that this effect is positive and significant but only for large bank holding companies. Further analysis reveals that specific internal governance categories: CEO education, compensation structure, progressive practices, and ownership have a significant effect on bank liquidity. However, this positive effect occurs mostly during the crisis period, and for large banks that are also high liquidity creators. Finally, we find that the effect of governance on liquidity creation increases during the crisis period. These findings are robust even while controlling for liquidity measures, bank size, and endogeneity problems between governance and liquidity creation.
G30|Life-cycle effects in small business finance|This paper studies the life-cycle profiles of small firms’ cost and use of credit using a panel of Finnish firms. The choice of method matters for the conclusions drawn about the relationship between firm age and financing costs; the cross-sectional age profiles of financing costs are hump-shaped and consistent with hold-up theories, whereas methods that control for cohort fixed effects demonstrate that the financing costs decrease monotonically as the firms mature. The life-cycle profiles of the use of credit also indicate that firms are more dependent on financial intermediaries in the early periods of their lives. Furthermore, the cohorts born during recessions pay higher financing costs and use smaller amounts of bank loans, even after their creditworthiness is controlled for. The recession cohort effect appears to be more related to the experience of starting-up the firm in the recession than to the CEOs growing up in a recession during their early adulthood.
G30|That is what friends do: employee friendliness and innovation|Recent literature suggests that labor related issues can impact corporate innovation. In this study we hypothesize and find that firms with congenial work environments innovate more and have greater innovative efficiency. Our results also suggest that cash profit sharing and employee involvement have a positive bearing whereas union relationships have a negative impact on innovation output of a firm. In addition, subsample analysis reveals that employee-friendly policies are more important in industries having higher employee power. Our results are consistent with the logic that happy and satisfied employees tend to be more productive than the unhappy and dissatisfied ones. Our work suggests a channel through which satisfied employees contribute towards increasing firm value − by increasing the innovation productivity and efficiency of the firm. So, firms must make continued efforts towards creating and maintaining a friendly work environment.
G30|Customer concentration and loan contract terms|We study pricing and non-pricing features of loan contracts to gauge how the credit market evaluates a firm’s customer-base profile and supply-chain relations. Higher customer concentration increases interest rate spreads and the number of restrictive covenants featured in newly initiated as well as renegotiated bank loans. Customer concentration also abbreviates the maturity of those loans as well as the relationship between firms and their banks. These effects are intensified by customers’ financial distress, the level of relationship-specific investments, and the use of trade credit in customer–supplier relations. Our evidence shows that a deeper exposure to a small set of large customers bears negative consequences for a firm’s relations with its creditors, revealing limits to integration along the supply chain.
G30|How collateral laws shape lending and sectoral activity|We demonstrate the central importance of creditors’ ability to use movable assets as collateral (as distinct from immovable real estate) when borrowing from banks. Using a unique cross-country micro-level loan data set containing loan-to-value ratios for different assets, we find that loan-to-values of loans collateralized with movable assets are lower in countries with weak collateral laws, relative to immovable assets, and that lending is biased toward the use of immovable assets. Using sector-level data, we find that weak movable collateral laws create distortions in the allocation of resources that favor immovable-based production and investment. An analysis of Slovakia's collateral law reform confirms our findings.
G30|The effect of director experience on acquisition performance|Prior research finds that firms hire directors for their acquisition experience, regardless of acquisition quality (whether their prior acquisitions earned positive or negative announcement returns). Using several short- and long-run measures, we examine the effects of directors’ acquisition experience on the acquisition performance of firms hiring them. We find that board acquisition experience is positively related to subsequent acquisition performance, demonstrating that firms appropriately value experience. Beyond experience itself, however, the quality of directors’ prior acquisitions is also important. Our results suggest that firms may be better served to select directors based upon both past acquisition experience and acquisition performance.
G30|Why do loans contain covenants? Evidence from lending relationships|Despite the importance of banks’ role as delegated monitors, little is known about how non-price terms of loan contracts are structured to optimize information production in a lending relationship. Using a large sample of corporate loans, this paper examines the effect of relationship lending on covenant choice. Consistent with information asymmetry theories, covenant tightness is relaxed over the duration of a relationship, especially for opaque borrowers. In contrast, the effect of lending relationship intensity on the number of covenants included in a loan follows an inverted U shape. I discuss potential explanations for this finding.
G30|Do corporate taxes hinder innovation?|We exploit staggered changes in state-level corporate tax rates to show that an increase in taxes reduces future innovation. A variety of tests, including those based on policy discontinuity at contiguous counties straddling borders of politically similar states, show that local economic conditions do not drive our results. The effect we document is consistent across the innovation spectrum: taxes affect not only patenting and R&D investment but also new product introductions, which we measure using textual analysis. Our empirical results are consistent with models that highlight the role of higher corporate taxes in reducing innovator incentives and discouraging risk-taking.
G30|Financial education, investor protection and international portfolio diversification|This paper investigates the effect of financial education on foreign portfolio investment. We show that higher investor financial education fosters international diversification, and that its role is particularly pronounced where information problems and monitoring costs are likely to be more severe, that is, in countries where protection of minority shareholders' rights is weaker.
G30|U.S. SPACs with a focus on China|This paper examines the value implications of remedial actions taken by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) during 2011 that culminated in delisting a number of Chinese companies from United States public exchanges. To achieve that we examine the institutional characteristics and performance of Specified Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) used as a financing tool and gateway to the U.S. capital markets by Chinese companies in period 2004–2011. Evidence shows that SPACs merging with companies from China are not inferior in corporate structure when compared with other SPACs. While their institutional characteristics are similar, the performance tests indicate that Chinese SPACs lose value around SEC decision dates, but in overall they outperform other SPACs listed in the U.S.
