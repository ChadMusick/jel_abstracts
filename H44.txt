H44|Costs of Submarine Maintenance at Public and Private Shipyards|Public shipyards, which are owned and operated by the Navy, conduct a large majority of all submarine maintenance. To reduce delays at public shipyards, the Navy sent 29 submarines to private shipyards for Docking Selected Restricted Availability (DSRA) overhauls between 1993 and 2017. During that period, 117 DSRA overhauls were done at public shipyards. The overhauls conducted at private shipyards have been 31 percent less expensive, on average, by CBOâ€™s estimate. That gap has narrowed in recent years, but CBOâ€™s data include only one overhaul at a private shipyard after 2010.
H44|Nuclear Decommissioning after the German Nuclear Phase-Out: An Integrated View on New Regulations and Nuclear Logistics|With Germany’s nuclear phase-out, 23 reactors need to be dismantled in the near future. Initiated by the dire financial situation of the affected utilities in 2014, a major discourse on ensuring financial liability led to a redistribution of liabilities and finances, with the utilities remaining in charge of dismantling, while liability for interim and final storage now transferred to the public. This paper assesses whether the new regulation will ultimately be to the benefit of the public. It introduces a two-stage stochastic optimization framework which encompasses the different dismantling phases and resulting waste flows and storage levels of low- and intermediate-level waste (LLW and ILW) as well as the associated costs. Results show that storage risk – proclaimed as a major barrier to efficient decommissioning – is not a major driver for the optimal decommissioning schedule. However, a delay of ten years might now increase interim storage costs borne by the public by over 20%. By contrast, lacking knowledge and limited machinery is a major unaccounted cost driver, which might quickly eat-up the buffer currently included in utility funds in order to deal with dismantling uncertainties. Our analysis reveals the storage gate as the new crucial interface between utilities and the public storage provider.
H44|Effects of school closures on displaced students and future cohorts in Sweden 2000-2016|The aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of school closures on student achievement among displaced students and future cohorts in Sweden. In contrast to previous studies that only analyze the effects of school closures on displaced students, this study also takes account of the effects on subsequent cohorts of students who never experience the disruption of the move. Furthermore, the study is one of the first quantitative studies to estimate the effects of school closures outside the US. The effects are analyzed using a quasi-experimental study on all public middle school closures in Sweden 2000–2012, a majority of them located in cities. The study utilizes a design that provides a better control for family background compared to previous studies on school closures and that makes it possible to study the effects on future cohorts. The performance of students who graduated from closed Swedish middle schools are compared with the performance of their ‘treated’ younger siblings who were expected to graduate from the same schools but as a result of the closures attended other schools. The results suggest that the school closures in Sweden overall had no effects on student achievement, even though displaced students and future cohorts attended slightly higher-performing schools than their siblings as a result of the closures. Contrary to theoretical expectations, the effects on displaced students are very similar to the effects on future cohorts, suggesting that the disruption effects were close to zero. Furthermore, the extensive school voucher system in Sweden does not seem to direct students to higher quality schools after school closures.
H44|Envy-free Pricing for Impure Public Good|In this paper, we study optimal public good provision with congestion and user fees to exclude some agents under lump-sum tax/transfer, constrained by the condition of reduction of envy. We adopt the λ envy-free constraint proposed by Diamantaras and Thomson (1990), and employ the exclusion technique used in Hellwig (2005), i.e., the policymaker decides the level of provision and user fee paid by people accessing a public good, as well as a uniform level of tax/transfer. We characterize the optimal public sector pricing rule that depends on utilitarian distributive concerns and envy reduction concerns, which are in conflict with each other. We show that if the social welfare function is strictly increasing and strictly concave and the government is not concerned with reducing envy, the user fee is greater than the marginal congestion cost. Additionally, we show that if the government reflects the notion of equality of opportunity under the reduction of envy, the user fee is lower than the marginal congestion cost. These results imply that the two fairness concerns are countervailing with regard to the surcharge fee.
H44|Inequalities in spatial accessibility of childcare: The role of non-profit providers|Equal access to childcare services is a key concern of childcare policy. This article analyses social inequalities in the availability of such services. We explore how observed disparities are related to the socio-economic status of neighbourhoods and investigate how different provider types contribute to such differences. To do so, we use data on all childcare centres in the city of Vienna, Austria, on the spatial distribution of children aged under six and on three measures of neighbourhood status, over a period of eight years. We find that spatial accessibility is highest in neighbourhoods with the highest socioeconomic status, that such inequality has increased over time and that both effects can be attributed to the role of non-profits. The results indicate that the policy change undertaken in Vienna towards increased communitarisation – that is, a shift towards non-profit provision – has undermined the universal character of the city’s childcare system.
H44|Retirement Policy and Annuity Market Equilibria: Evidence from Chile|Retirement policy has indirect effects on its beneficiaries, through the “crowd-out” or “crowd-in” of insurance markets. We study how retirement policy in Chile, which limits the drawdown of retirement assets but otherwise does not provide or require fixed income in retirement, results in more than 60% of eligible retirees purchasing private annuities at low prices. We estimate a demand model to show that replacing this voluntary policy with partial mandatory annuitization and removing limits on drawdowns causes the private annuity market to partially unravel. Under our model, this reform leads to a welfare increase equivalent to US$4,000 of additional pension savings on average, but welfare effects are heterogenous and many retirees would be harmed due to the higher prices of private annuities. Our results highlight the importance of considering the impact of policy reforms on the equilibria of related markets.
H44|The nature of Public Interest in Muslim and Non-Muslim writers|Leading a comfortable life on this planet with few problems and worries is one of the aims and objective of human since the dawn of history. Defining and then achieving a prosperous and comfortable life has been the subject of intense discussion among philosophers and religious scholars since the dawn of history. In order to investigate whether the contemporary economic system better serves the wellbeing of the general population (public interest), then it is very important to know that what the public interest itself actually means? To accomplish this task, we started this essay with an examination of the idea of public interest from both Muslims and non-Muslims writers. After the emergence of enlightenment self-interest got prominence due to which public interest among non-Muslims writers is considered as a rule or concept serving to present something as suitable for long term approval or acceptance according to changing circumstances. In contrast Muslim writers think that public interest refers to the fulfilment of the objective of the Sharia which lies in safeguarding their faith (Din/Religion), their human self (Nafs), their intellect (Aql), their posterity (Nasl) and their wealth (Maal). There will be violence and corruption without these five basics purposes of Sharia.
H44|Understanding Market Failure in the Developing Country Context|Market failure makes it difficult to achieve the condition of economic efficiency by distorting price mechanisms and normal distribution of goods and services thereby, leading to welfare loss. They are entrenched in the socio-economic fabrics of most developing countries, underpinned by the lack of well-functioning market structures and economic systems – which are supposed to make the market economy resilient to such economic shortcomings.
H44|Modern Democracy-Welfare State and Public Goods. A current consequence for Greece|People expect the state to create jobs and provide them with a social security net. Whatever its defects, whatever the virtues of the private sector, no structure other than the state can today provide citizens with the basic public goods. Under the present right-wing government of Nea Dimokratia in Greece, which is not particularly at odds with neoliberalism, a very active role of the state is not expected. Also is nor expected the introduction of a serious program of public investment and demand boosting to stimulate the national economy and enter into a virtuous circle of recovery. Greece, which has undergone the economic crisis with drastic cuts in its traditionally deficient social state, has to respond directly to the marked underinvestment in public goods (in key areas such as education, health, natural disasters, dealing with decent living conditions).The most important tool for inputting resources is the tax system.
H44|The Market Value of Public Education - A Comparison of Three Valuation Methods|Publicly provided education is both an important public expenditure and a relevant in-kind transfer, often to the poorest households. This paper compares three methods to value education services and their distributive impact. The methods are: (i) The first method is cost of provision, according to which education is worth what it costs the state to provide it; (ii) The second method is to value educational services using the labor market as the measure of their worth; (iii) The third is to match private educational expenditures, paid for by students or their parents, with equivalent public education services, and then value the latter according to the price of the former. The results from all three approaches do not fall far from each other. The imputed income from publicly provided education reduces inequality by between 3 and 4 Gini points and increases incomes by about 6%. My conclusion is that the value of public education in Brazil is close to 6% of household income and it is quite distributive, whatever the valuation method used.
H44|The quasi-market of employment services in Italy|This paper aims to study the shortcomings and merits of the first experiment of quasi-market in the provision of employment services: the Lombardy DUL (Dote Unica Lavoro). This system, which has inspired the 2015 national reform within the Jobs Act, has reactivated and revitalized the sector by providing important job opportunities to jobless workers. The system has the typical problems of quasi-markets in the provision of public services (lion's share of private organizations; cherry picking; gaming). However, different expedients are devised in the program to minimize these shortcomings. The empirical analysis suggest that such phenomena if existent are at a physiological level. Analysis of the determinants of completing successfully the program provides non-trivial results as to, among others, the role organizations of different ownership type and of services provided.
H44|The Depot-Level Maintenance of DoD's Combat Aircraft: Insights for the F-35|Depot-level maintenance of military aircraft consists of in-depth maintenance that is beyond the capability of maintenance staff at an aircraftâ€™s operating location. Depot-level maintenance is essential to ensuring an aircraftâ€™s capability to perform missions and can influence whether an aircraftâ€™s life can be extended cost-effectively. This report focuses on depot-level maintenance practices for the Air Forceâ€™s and Navyâ€™s combat aircraft as sources of insights for the new F-35 fighter aircraft.
H44|Moral Nimby-ism? Understanding Societal Support for Monetary Compensation to Plasma Donors in Canada|The growing demand for plasma, especially for the manufacture of therapeutic products, creates an urgent need for a careful discussion on the relative merits of different procurement and allocation systems in a way that addresses the increasing demand while abiding by the prevailing moral values in a society. We conducted a randomized survey experiment with a representative sample of 826 Canadian residents to assess attitudes toward legalizing the compensation to plasma donors, a practice that is illegal in several Canadian provinces. We found no evidence of widespread societal opposition to payments to plasma donors, because over 70% of respondents reported that they would support compensation. The support was higher for paying plasma donors in Australia and the United States than in Canada, but the differences were small, suggesting a weak role for “moral NIMBY-ism” or moral relativism in explaining the findings. Moral concerns were the highest-rated reason that respondents gave for being against payment, together with concerns for the safety of plasma supplied by compensated donors, although most of the plasma in Canada does come from compensated American donors. Among those in favor of legalizing compensation for donors (in Canada as well as in Australia), the highest-rated motive was to guarantee a higher domestic supply. Finally, roughly half of those who declared to be against payments reported that they would reconsider their position if the domestic supply and imports were insufficient to meet domestic demand. Most Canadians, therefore, seem to espouse a consequentialist view to issues related to the procurement of plasma.

El gobierno puede permitir el funcionamiento de una empresa privada y obtener recursos fiscales a través de impuestos o puede estatizar la empresa y obtener recursos fiscales de los beneficios de la empresa estatal. Un gobierno maximizador de recursos decidirá estatizar una empresa privada cuando los beneficios que le genera la empresa bajo control del Estado menos los costos de estatizarla superen a la recaudación impositiva que le brinda la empresa privada.

H44|Supporting the Dance Sector. Does Efficiency Clash with Success When Programming?|Dance has received scant attention in economic literature perhaps because it is an activity that appears under a number of legal forms and diverse formats and due to the fact that â€“in many instances- it is affected by a high degree of instability time-wise, thus making it difficult to have the necessary data available required for economic analysis. Nevertheless, this sectorâ€™s dependence on public funding provides grounds for it to be the subject of performance related studies. This work aims to offer an evaluation process for a public project designed to spread dance in Spain. The project involves a number of stakeholders: public authorities, performance venues and dance companies. Each participant plays a role in the project: public authorities provide the funding while the theatres and dance companies offer the artistic idea that is taken to the audience. By applying Data Envelopment Analysis techniques (DEA), the present work seeks to evaluate the efficiency of the stakeholders involved in the project, as well as the efficiency of the programme itself by relating resources and objectives. We find that efficiency in resource performance often runs counter to other cultural aims such as increasing audiences or extending repertoire diversity.
H44|Housing policy and the changing tenure mix|The paper discusses the many reasons why housing policy can appear to be both incoherent and ineffective - with too many Departments involved each with different objectives and a plethora of policies pulling in different directions. Drawing on earlier research findings the paper discusses three examples which have impacted on tenure mix – the growth in the private rented sector where policy initiatives – except for unintended side effects – have been limited and market and macroeconomic pressures have dominated; a range of tax anomalies which provide inconsistent incentives and generate considerable costs to the economy; and the impact of specific policies which concentrate on supporting owner-occupation through new build initiatives. The paper concludes by asking whether housing policy is inherently unable to withstand the pressures placed on it by both politics and macroeconomic realities.
H44|Effectiveness of Private and Public High Schools: Evidence from Finland| A number of papers have compared the effectiveness of private and public schools in different institutional settings. However, most of these studies are observational and do not utilize experimental or quasi-experimental design to evaluate the value-added or the effectiveness of private schools in comparison to public schools. This study focuses on private and public high schools in Helsinki, the capital city of Finland. We use two different methods to compare private and public schools, value-added estimation and regression discontinuity design (RDD). Although based on somewhat different assumptions, both methods allow us to evaluate the causal effect of private schools on the exit exam results in high school. We find that private schools perform marginally better than public schools, but the difference in performance is small and statistically insignificant according to both methods. Various robustness and validity checks strengthen our RDD results and the validity of the discontinuity design.
H44|Location choices of Swedish independent schools – How does allowing for private provision affect the geography of the education market?|This paper studies the location decisions of Swedish start-up independent schools. It makes use of the great expansion of independent schools following a reform implemented in 1992 to test what local market characteristics are correlated with independent school entry. The results suggest that independent schools are more likely to choose locations with a higher share of students with high-educated parents; a higher student population density; and a lower share of students with Swedish-born parents. There is also some evidence that independent schools are less likely to locate in municipalities with a left-wing political majority. These results are robust to various alternative and flexible definitions of local school markets, which were employed in order to alleviate the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem. For some of the included variables, the definition of the local market however had a large impact on the results, suggesting that the issue of how to define regions in spatial analyses can be important.
H44|Exploring Digital Time Measurement in the Public Sector: Labor Productivity and Service Quality in Home Care|We measure labor productivity in home care using new data from the recent introduction of digital time measurement in Swedish municipalities. By measuring worker utilization (delivered hours as a share of worked hours) we avoid several problems that have plagued previous studies of public sector productivity. The time use measure exposes substantial variation in productivity between home care units, suggesting room for improvement. More productive units deliver a larger share of the hours approved by care managers and have equally satisfied users.
H44|Trust based evaluation in a market oriented school system|In Sweden, a trust-based system of school performance evaluation meets a market oriented school system with liberal entry conditions to voucher-funded private providers, several of which are for- profit corporations. National tests are administered but these are graded at the local school level and what ultimately matters to students are teacher-set grades. In relation to the achievement on national tests, privately run free schools systematically set higher grades than public schools. The differences between municipal and free schools are larger when more reliable tests are used to control for achievement. To some extent, the differences in grading standards can be accounted for by location and student demographics, but the differences between public and private providers remain substantial even after taking such factors into consideration. In particular, the grade-setting among schools that belong to two large corporate providers appear generous. The results indicate that different providers do not necessarily respond symmetrically when faced with similar market conditions and act under the same regulatory regime.
H44|“Post-Truth” Schooling and Marketized Education: Explaining the Decline in Sweden’s School Quality|The Swedish school system suffers from profound problems with teacher recruitment and retention, knowledge decline, and grade inflation. Absenteeism is high, and psychiatric disorders have risen sharply among Swedish pupils in the last ten years. In this pioneering analysis of the consequences of combining institutionalized social constructivism with extensive marketization of education, we suggest that these problems regarding school quality are to no small extent a result of the Swedish school system’s unlikely combination of a postmodern view of truth and knowledge, the ensuing pedagogy of child-centered discovery, and market principles. Our study adds to the findings from previous attempts to study the effects of social-constructivist pedagogy in nonmarket contexts and yields the implication that caution is necessary for countries, notably the U.S., that have a tradition of social-constructivist practices in their education systems and are considering implementing or expanding market-based school reforms.

National standardized tests are graded at the local school and what ultimately matters to students are teacher-set grades. This paper finds that privately run free schools systematically set higher grades than public schools when controlling for their achievement on national tests. The differences between municipal and free schools are larger when more reliable tests are used to account for achievement. Differences in grading standards between providers are substantial and most of the performance advantage in teacher-set grades that free schools enjoy can be attributed to more generous grading. The results also indicate that different private providers do not necessarily respond symmetrically when faced with similar market conditions and act under the same regulatory regime.
H44|What Drives the Private Provision of Security: Evidence from Russian Regions|This paper studies the influence of institutional quality and income inequality on the private provision of security. It is argued that the effects of both factors are far from straightforward and should be thoroughly examined when variation in institutional quality and income inequality is high. To conduct empirical analysis, data on the regions of Russia between 2009 and 2016 are used. It is hypothesized and empirically supported that institutional quality affects the relationship between the private and public provision of security. Weak institutions make the private provision of security a substitute for the public provision of security, whereas strong institutions promote complementarity between the two. It is also shown that income inequality increases the private provision of security when inequality is low and decreases it when inequality is high. This result can be attributed to economies of scale.
H44|L'opus di Mauro Fasiani|Scopo di questo lavoro non è quello di discutere il pensiero scientifico di Fasiani, ma solo di attirare l'attenzione degli studiosi facendo conoscere il contenuto dei suoi apporti scientifici, perché Mauro Fasiani non sembra occupare ancora il posto che merita nell'ambito scientifico. In questo lavoro viene quindi presentato un profilo biografico di Mauro Fasiani, seguito da una breve analisi dei suoi scritti scientifici disposta secondo i principali filoni delle sue ricerche. Segue una bibliografia delle sue opere e la bibliografia degli scritti riguardanti il suo apporto scientifico. Il lavoro si conclude con la presentazione di trentotto schede, ciascuna corrispondente ad un suo saggio; rispetto agli scritti elencati nella bibliografia, mancano le schede corrispondenti a otto scritti, considerati del tutto trascurabili.
H44|Women legislators and economic performance|There has been a phenomenal global increase in the proportion of women in politics in the last 20 years. While there is evidence that raising the share of women politicians has substantive impacts on the composition of government spending, there is scarcely any evidence of how it influences economic performance.We investigate this using comprehensive data on competitive elections to Indiaâ€™s state legislative assemblies, exploiting close elections between men and women to isolate the causal effect of legislator gender in a regression discontinuity design. We identify significantly higher growth in economic activity in constituencies that elect women. Probing mechanisms, we find evidence that women legislators are less likely to be criminal and corrupt, more efficacious, and less vulnerable to political opportunism.We find no evidence of negative spillovers to neighbouring (male-led) constituencies, consistent with net growth.
H44|How Small are Small Markets? Location Choice and Geographical Market Size for Child Care Services|In this article we propose an innovative way of delineating geographical markets based on easily accessible data. We apply this concept for the day care industry and investigate providers’ location choices relative to local market characteristics to evaluate the widespread presumption that local markets for child care services are geographically very small. Using a panel of all day care centers for the metropolitan region of Vienna, Austria, for nearly a decade, as well as geographically extremely disaggregated data on the spatial distribution of children under the age of six at the 250m × 250m grid cell level, we find that the location of children and day care centers are strongly related, but this relationship diminishes as soon as the distance between a child’s place of residence and the day care center’s location increases. We conclude that geographical markets for day care services in metropolitan regions are indeed very small (about 500m or 550 yards).
H44|Health and Pollution in a Vertically Differentiated Duopoly|In this paper, we analyze a vertically differentiated mixed duopoly in medical care services. Pollution is the source of illness. The government has a dual role. It decides how much to invest to reduce the pollution level and it may participate in the health market running a public hospital. We find that the presence of the public provider increases the average quality of the service in the market and it reduces the rate of mortality. Furthermore, when the public hospital offers services with the highest quality, then this has positive spillovers on thequality offered by the private provider. Despite these positive welfare improving features, the mixed duopoly in medical care goes along with a highest level of pollution. In the presence of an increasing concern about the relationship between pollution and health, understanding the role of public intervention appears crucial.
H44|Is Your Lawyer a Lemon? Incentives and Selection in the Public Provision of Criminal Defense|Governments in the U.S. must offer free legal services to low-income people accused of crimes. These services are frequently provided by assigned counsel, who handle cases for indigent defendants on a contract basis. Court-assigned attorneys generally garner worse case outcomes than privately retained attorneys. Using detailed court records from one large jurisdiction in Texas, we find that the disparities in outcomes are primarily attributable to case characteristics and within-attorney differences across cases in which they are assigned versus retained. The selection of low-quality lawyers into assigned counsel and endogenous matching in the private market contribute less to the disparities.
H44|Improving the Performance of Sub-national Governments through Benchmarking and Performance Reporting|Performance systems are one tool available to central governments to improve the performance of sub-national service delivery. This paper provides a preliminary review of suitable metrics and mechanisms to reliably measure and monitor the efficiency and quality of public services that are provided by sub-national governments. This review aims to conceptualise the challenges associated with measuring public sector inputs, outputs and outcomes and implementing effective performance systems. Robust performance systems aim to measure both the efficiency and effectiveness of public services, as well measure cost efficiency, to better understand and remedy cost discrepancies across regions. Implementing qualitative mechanisms such as external inspections and user surveys are also useful in providing insights into consumer experience and well-being.
H44|Patient and impatient capital: time horizons as market boundaries|Since the 1980s privatisation and outsourcing have been promoted on grounds of efficiency and fiscal convenience. The argument here is that the appropriate choice between business and public enterprise is determined by the interaction between two time horizons, a financial time horizon and a project time horizon. The prevailing interest rate defines a credit time horizon. Among project appraisal methods, the payback period defines a unique temporal outer bound for private sector break-even. Net present value break-evens (and other forms of business credit) are always shorter. Any project which has a break-even longer than the payback period cannot be funded by business alone. Long-term projects encounter uncertainty and attempt to control it by means of rigid contracts, which also lead to inferior outcomes. This analysis accounts for historical patterns of enterprise. It also provides normative guidance. Public-private partnerships for infrastructure development intended to overcome credit time boundaries. They have given rise to inefficiency and corruption and are currently in decline. It is possible to overcome the temporal boundary with a â€˜franchiseâ€™ i.e. protection from uncertainty provided by social and government agencies. This allows longer credit break-evens, but at a cost in competitive efficiency. It is also prone to corruption. The time-horizon model undermines the standard argument for market superiority. It turns Hayek on his head: it is financial markets that require certainty, whereas social and public agencies manage in its absence.
H44|Der Wohlfahrtstaat als Grundbestandteil des modernen demokratischen Staatsgefüges<BR>[The welfare state as a basic component of the modern democratic state structure]|Defining the welfare state is not a simpleminded task. Actually, there are numerous definitions which try to reflect at least some of the basic characteristics of the welfare state or its objectives and its functions. For some, there is primarily an institutional parameter, for others there are functional issues which have to be firstly indicated and for others, the ideological and political factors determine the definition and the attitude towards the welfare state. Apart from all these crucial ascertainments, there are some basic fundamental characteristics and values of the welfare state which render it as a precondition of the existence of the modern state. Unquestionably, it reflects a distinct part of the state but most importantly, it comprises a prerequisite for its existence. This is the exact aim of this paper; to surpass the theoretical diversifications and to find the fundamental common ground which forms the indispensability for the existence of the welfare state.
H44|Multiple Long-Run Equilibria in a Free-Entry Mixed Oligopoly|We investigate a free-entry mixed oligopoly with constant marginal costs. A privatization policy is implemented after private firms enter the market. We find that both full privatization and full nationalization are equilibrium policies, and the former is the worst privatization policy for welfare.
H44|Internal Organization in a Public Theory of the Firm: Toward a Coase-Oates Federalism Nexus|This paper anatomizes how the theory of internal organization of the firm relates to that of internal organization of government. This broad issue is approached by narrowing matters down to a specific type of internal organization of government: fiscal federalism. The paper introduces elements for a public theory of the firm by theoretically combining organizational and federalist insights – Ronald Coase with Wallace Oates. It shows how there are vertical and horizontal transaction cost problems in both the ex ante moment of decentralized public sector organizational design and the ex post moment of organizational adaptation. These problems embed normative and positive considerations that previous organizational theories of federalism fail to consider, and that earlier theories of federalism to some extent acknowledge but fail to develop organizationally. A subsidiary point that emerges is that more effort should be directed to exploring the ex ante moment in explicit organizational design terms. To try to jump start the explorative effort, the paper also alludes to one promising set of design principles: modularity.
H44|Endogenous Timing in a Price-Setting Mixed Oligopoly|We investigate the endogenous order of moves in a price-setting mixed oligopoly model, comprising two private firms and a public firm. We show that sequential moves emerge as the equilibrium in the observable delay game. Specifically, one of the private firms and the public firm set their prices in period 1, and the other private firm does so in period 2, in equilibrium, if their goods are not significantly differentiated. This is a clear contrast to a mixed duopoly where a simultaneous move game is a unique equilibrium. We also discuss a number of extensions and the robustness of our result.
H44|Implicit Protectionism via State Enterprises and Technology Transfer from Foreign Enterprises|We formulate a mixed triopoly in which one state enterprise competes with one domestic and one foreign private enterprise. The private enterprise can transfer its technology to the private rival, which reduces the rival's production cost. We show that if the privatization policy is endogenous, the foreign firm voluntary transfers its technology, even without fees. We also show that the domestic private firm does not transfer its technology to the foreign firm. Consequently, the domestic private enterprise extracts rents from the foreign enterprise and increases its market share. We also show that the foreign enterprise may strategically raise its local ownership share, which implies that the existence of a state enterprise and its potential future privatization serve as an industrial policy that improves the domestic firm's competitive advantage relative to the foreign enterprise or the implicit foreign ownership regulation.
H44|The Relationship between Privatization and Corporate Taxation Policies|This paper investigate how the corporate (profit) tax rate affects the optimal degree of privatization in a mixed duopoly, while introducing a minimum profit constraint for the private firm. Firstly, we show that the profit tax rate directly affects the behavior of the partially privatized firm and affects the behavior of the private firm through strategic interaction. In addition, we investigate the relationship between the optimal privatization policy and corporate tax policy, and find that the optimal degree of privatization increases with the corporate tax rate, regardless of whether the constraint is binding. The optimal degree of privatization decreases (increases) with the foreign ownership share in the private firm if the constraint is ineffective (effective). This result suggests that a minimum profit constraint can be crucial in the optimal privatization policy.
H44|Does Public Pre-K Have Unintended Consequences on the Child Care Market for Infants and Toddlers?|I estimate the impact of public pre-kindergarten for 4-year-olds on the provision of private child care for younger children by considering New York City's 2014 Universal Pre-K expansion. Private child care facilities often care for children from infancy or toddlerhood through pre-K. A public option for older children could therefore affect availability, prices, or quality of care for younger children. This effect could be positive or negative depending on the structure of the child care market, the design of the public pre-K program, and parent preferences. I use a panel dataset covering all licensed child care facilities in New York City and a difference-in-differences strategy that compares changes over time for neighborhoods with more versus fewer new public pre-K sites. I estimate that the public pre-K program reduced the capacity for children younger than 2 years old at private child care centers by 2,700 seats. The entire decrease in capacity occurs in areas with high poverty, and this decline was not o set by an increase in provision in the home day care market. In complementary analysis, I find a within- center increase in public complaints and inspection violations for day care centers that are closer to new public pre-K sites, suggesting a decrease in quality due to the increased competition from public pre-K. A back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that for every seven 4-year-olds who shifted from day care centers to public pre-K, there was a reduction of one day care center seat for children under the age of 2.
H44|Price–quality competition in a mixed duopoly|We examine competition between a private and a public provider in markets for merit goods, such as education, healthcare, housing, recreation, or culture. The private firm provides a high‐price/high‐quality variety of the good and serves richer individuals, whereas the public firm provides a low‐price/low‐quality variety and serves poorer individuals. We first characterize the private competitor’s best response to changes in the public firm’s price and quality. This enables us to examine the distributional effects of policies that affect the price or quality of the public firm’s product. We then numerically characterize the public firm’s optimal provision policy, taking the private response into consideration. Our results have implications for the financing of publicly provided goods, and for whether additional resources, if available, should be spent on reducing the price or enhancing the quality of these goods.
H44|Employment in China’s hi-tech zones|Abstract The purpose of this paper is to explore employment differences over time across China’s hi-tech zones. Using data from China’s Ministry of Science and Technology, we find that if a university science park is within a hi-tech zone, employment in that zone is higher, but that finding only holds for zones established in the pre-information communication technology period. After 2000, proximity to a university science park does not appear to be necessary for the exchange of tacit knowledge which we contend leverages the technology base of firms and organizations in the zone and thus their level of employment. We also find greater employment in hi-tech zones in which information technology is a dominant industry.
H44|Women Legislators and Economic Performance|There has been a phenomenal global increase in the proportion of women in politics in the last two decades, but there is no evidence of how this influences economic performance. We investigate this using data on competitive elections to India's state assemblies, leveraging close elections to isolate causal effects. We find significantly higher growth in economic activity in constituencies that elect women and no evidence of negative spillovers to neighbouring male-led constituencies, consistent with net growth. Probing mechanisms, we find that women legislators are less likely to be criminal and corrupt, more efficacious, and less vulnerable to political opportunism.
H44|Elite School Designation and House Prices - Quasi-experimental Evidence from Beijing, China|We explore three recent comprehensive reforms which aim to equalize access to elite elementary schools in Beijing, to identify the causal effect of access to quality education on house prices. Using property transaction records from Beijing in 2013 and 2016, we construct a balanced panel of residential complexes, each of which linked to its designated primary school. Whereas the multi-school dicing reform involves randomly assigning previously ineligible pupils to key elementary schools through lotteries, the reform of school federation led by elite schools consolidates ordinary primary schools through alliance with elite schools. Moreover, an ordinary primary school can be promoted to key elementary school without involving neighbouring schools in surrounding residential complexes through a “pure” re-designation effect. We allow for systemic differences between the treated and non-treated residential complexes using the Matching Difference-in-Differences (MDID) approach. Our estimates indicate that the causal effect on house prices of being eligible to enrol in a municipal-level key primary school is about 5-7%, while the premium for being eligible for a less prestigious district-level key primary school is only about 1-3%.
H44|Öffentliche Betriebe<BR>[Public Firms]|Öffentliche Betriebe weisen einige Besonderheiten gegenüber privaten Betrieben auf. Dazu werden nach dem Zweck öffentlicher Betriebe und ihren unterschiedlichen Rechtsformen in Deutschland die betrieblichen Teilfunktionen Beschaffung, Produktion, Absatz, Personal, Finanzierung und Rechnungswesen näher betrachtet. Außerdem werden die Besteuerung und Reformen von öffentlichen Betrieben sowie Hybridformen zwischen öffentlichen und privaten Betrieben untersucht.
H44|Competition in public service provision: The role of not-for-profit providers|With public services such as health and education, it is not straightforward for consumers to assess the quality of provision. Many such services are provided by monopoly not-for-profit providers and there is concern that for-profit providers may increase profit at the expense of quality. This paper explores the implications of entry by for-profit providers when there is unobserved quality. The model generates three key policy-relevant insights. First, by developing a novel approach to competition between different organizational forms, it frames the relevant trade-offs precisely. Second, it shows the value of keeping an incumbent not-for-profit as an active provider. Third, it characterizes the optimal payment (or voucher value) to an entrant for each consumer who switches in a way that can be applied empirically.
H44|The effect of hospital ownership on quality of care: Evidence from England|We investigate whether quality of care differs between public and private hospitals in England using data on 3.8 million publicly-funded patients receiving 133 planned (non-emergency) treatments in 393 public and 190 private hospital sites. Private hospitals treat patients with fewer comorbidities and past hospitalisations. Controlling for observed patient characteristics and treatment type, private hospitals have fewer emergency readmissions. But patients’ choice of hospital may influenced by their unobserved morbidity. After instrumenting the choice of hospital type by the difference in distances from the patient to the nearest public and the nearest private hospital, the effect of private ownership changes sign and is statistically insignificant. Similar results are obtained with coarsened exact matching. We also find no quality differences between hospitals specialising in planned treatments and other hospitals, nor between for-profit and not-for-profit private hospitals. Our results show the importance of controlling for unobserved patient heterogeneity when comparing quality of public and private hospitals.
H44|A Context-based Procedure for Assessing Participatory Schemes in Environmental Planning|The efficiency of participatory schemes in environmental planning is an emerging research area, and many issues are not solved yet regarding the assessment of such procedures. It is essential for decision makers to identify improvement opportunities of participatory schemes. We propose an original procedure to address such issue, through a bargaining model from the signaling game literature, which accounts for participation design as well as for agents' preferences, beliefs and bargaining power. The model is calibrated using qualitative data from surveys in French local communities involved in municipal solid waste management. Model simulations are used to test for assumptions on the stakeholder dialogue and explore sensitivity of game outcomes to structural parameters. We propose a set of performance indicators to identify the most effective participatory schemes in achieving convergence in stakeholder positions regarding environmental and land-use planning.
H44|A Note on the Economics of Philanthropy|This note starts with a short review of the economic literature on philanthropy. Next, it provides some estimates of philanthropic giving in advanced and middle-income economies and discusses how innovative financial instruments can leverage charitable giving. The note concludes with a discussion of the controversial aspects of philanthropic activities.
H44|Help not needed? Optimal host country regulation of expatriate NGO workers|Motivated by interventions in poor countries to increase the use of local labor in foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), we address the behavior of these organizations under host government regulation. We extend existing NGO models by distinguishing between local workers and expatriates. The model covers both NGO monopoly and competition in the market for donations. Assuming that NGOs maximize output, we show that regulations in the form of a quota on the number of expatriates or a work permit fee for foreigners reduces NGO output, but increases employment of locals. The optimal quota is more likely to bind in the market structure generating the highest total fundraising surplus. An optimal work permit fee is equivalent to an optimal quota in both the monopoly and duopoly cases. For both instruments, the optimal tightness of regulation is decreasing in the weight the government attaches to the public good relative to domestic incomes and in the importance of NGO output to the supply of the public good. Aggregate NGO output and the level of the public good produced could be higher with a monopoly NGO.
H44|Competitive Neutrality and the Cost and Quality of Welfare Services|Competition between private and public firms can increase service quality and reduce public costs in markets for tax-financed welfare services with non-contractible quality. Synergies arise from combining high-powered incentives for quality provision (emanating from private firms) with low rents (public firms). However, sometimes, the optimal regulation requires the government to provide public firms with better funding than private competitors, e.g. by paying them higher prices or covering their deficits. This additional compensation is not tied to any additional verifiable quality obligations and may therefore violate competitive neutrality rules incorporated to various areas of legislation.
H44|Direct and Indirect Effects of Private- and Government Sponsored Venture Capital|This paper studies the real effects of venture capital on targeted firms. Specifically, using a unique dataset with comprehensive information on private- and governmental venture capital investments, we examine the effects of such investments on firms' sales, employment and investments in physical capital. The results suggest that both private and public venture capital boost firm sales two to three years after the investment. The sales increase can, in turn, partially be traced to an investment effect, and partially to increased efficiency, whereas no employment effects are found. Finally, our findings suggest that government investors are more prone than private VC firms to make follow-up investments in stagnating non-growing firms.
H44|Oligopolistic competition for the provision of hospital care|Competition in the market for health care has followed different patterns, and some health care systems have opted for mixed markets where public organisations compete alongside private ones. Empirical evidences on these market structures are however mixed. In this article we argue that public hospitals which have different objectives than private ones and faces different constraints, are also perceived differently by patients. For this reason we model the market for hospital care as Salop circle with a centre where the public hospital is located; private providers are located on the circle. We show that, depending on the difference in the productivity advantage, mixed markets may outperform both the benchmark (one public hospital at the centre) and private competition (N private providers competing along the circle), but the welfare distribution of these improvements should be carefully analysed. In some cases monopoly franchise on the mixed market should be introduced to redistribute these benefits.
H44|Asymmetric Payoffs and Spatial Competition|Abstract We investigate the location choice of two firms whose objectives are the weighted average of their own profit and social welfare, in which they simultaneously decide their locations before setting their prices. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the asymmetric locations are influenced by the asymmetry of the firms’ objectives or by the asymmetry of firms’ marginal costs. We show that, when both firms have the same marginal cost, the equilibrium locations are always symmetric even in the case of the asymmetric objectives. On the other hand, the cost differences lead the asymmetric locations in equilibrium. That is, the asymmetric locations are a result of the cost asymmetry, but not the asymmetry of the firms’ objectives. We also demonstrate that the pursuit of profit by the cost-inefficient firm may increase consumer surplus.
H44|Public Enterprises – Objectives and Performance|Public ownership is a way to provide goods and services where market performance is not satisfactory, or when the economy would otherwise be stagnant, provided that its costs do not overshadow its benefits. We provide a brief review of the existing theoretical and empirical literature. While far from exhaustive, the review suggests that there is no unanimous body of research showing that public ownership is inefficient to such an extent that private ownership is always socially superior. More research is needed on the costs and benefits of different forms of ownership, and we emphasise the need of analysing potential intrinsic motivation, service quality and the impact of international competition. Moreover, the fact that privatisation has often been implemented through outsourcing suggests a need of analysing renationalisation through buyer power.
H44|What is the Business of Business?|This paper develops a simple framework for understanding the emergence of new organizational forms, such as socially responsible firms and social entrepreneurs, that embody the private sector's efforts to resolve problems that typically have been within the purview of government and traditional public charities. We consider organizations that can generate both financial and social returns. Differences in the technologies between the for-profit sector and the social sector give rise to comparative advantages and play a key part in the analysis. This allows us to analyze the conditions under which hybrid organizations emerge in place of traditional charities and profit-maximizers.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H44|Collusion in mixed oligopolies and the coordinated effects of privatization|Abstract We study the sustainability of collusion in mixed oligopolies where private and public firms only differ in their objective: private firms maximize profits, while public firms maximize total surplus. If marginal costs are increasing, public firms do not supply the entire market, leaving room for private firms to produce and possibly cooperate by restricting output. The presence of public firms makes collusion among private firms harder to sustain, and maybe even unprofitable. As the number of private firms increases, collusion may become easier or harder to sustain. Privatization makes collusion easier to sustain, and is socially detrimental whenever firms are able to collude after privatization (which is always the case if they are sufficiently patient). Coordinated effects thus reverse the traditional result according to which privatization is socially desirable if there are many firms in the industry.
H44|Optimal Privatization Policy with Asymmetry among Private Firms|We revisit the relationship between the optimal privatization policy and market competition indexes such as the Hirschman--Herfindahl index, which is affected by the number of firms and asymmetry of size among these firms: the larger the number of firms (the less asymmetry among firms), the lower the market concentration index. The literature on mixed oligopolies suggests that the optimal degree of privatization is increasing with the number of private firms (and, thus, decreasing with the market competition index), assuming that all private firms are homogeneous. We investigate how the asymmetry among private firms affects the optimal degree of privatization. We propose the simplest and natural model formulation for discussing asymmetry among private firms. We find that the optimal degree of privatization is either nonmonotone or monopolistically increasing (and, thus, never monopolistically decreasing) in the asymmetry among private firms.
H44|Comparing welfare and profit in quantity and price competition within Stackelberg mixed duopolies|Abstract We compare welfare and profits under price and quantity competition in Stackelberg mixed duopolies. Under public leadership, price competition always yields greater profits and welfare than quantity competition. By contrast, under private leadership, the result depends on the nationality of the private firm. When the private firm is domestic (foreign), welfare is greater under quantity (price) competition. However, private firms always earn more under price competition. Introducing the nonnegative profit constraint affects welfare ranking but not profit ranking. These results indicate that profit ranking is fairly robust to the time structure in Stackelberg mixed duopolies, but welfare ranking is not.
H44|Defining PPP Opportunities in the Road Sector of Ukraine|The road sector is one of strategic segments of Ukrainian economy and public roads are considerable part of Ukrainian infrastructure potential. Many governments have been using PPP concerning highways and other fixed assets. Despite the successful development of the PPP/concession on construction and operation of motorway roads, the failures still happen. The inefficient project is those being prepared for a long period and still being unimplemented. The main obstacles and prerequisites for the PPP in the road sector in Ukraine are explored in this publication
H44|Basic Education curriculum effectiveness analysis in East Africa: Using the ‘Surveys of Enacted Curriculum’ framework to describe primary mathematics and English content in Uganda|The most important basic education policy question in the developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa today relates to how to transform schooling into actual learning for the majority of children who are now enrolled in primary schools across the continent. Recent evidence from annual learning assessments conducted in the three East African countries of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda reveal extremely low learning gains as children progress through primary school grades. Whereas a number of factors have been studied, there is shockingly very little evidence on basic education curricula effectiveness in East Africa. Twaweza East Africa, has adapted the Surveys of Enacted Curriculum framework to analyze the content embedded in the primary school curricula in East Africa. In this study, we develop subject taxonomies for Mathematics and English – the two main learning areas at lower primary school level in Uganda – and analyze the distribution of relative emphasis on content that is embedded in the thematic curriculum. We find that the lack of nationally-agreed well thought subject-specific comprehensive taxonomies is manifested in form of content coverage inconsistencies which hinder achievement of planned progressive learning across grades. We also find evidence of curricula over-ambitiousness manifested through the lack of emphasis, by the thematic curriculum standards, on development of the low-order thinking skills and on covering critical foundational language competence topics. This suggests that a policy that slows down the pace of learning in lower grades and emphasizes foundational skills development might improve learning profiles for the majority of Ugandan children who enroll in primary school without attending pre-primary education.
H44|Public Firm in Mixed Oligopolistic Structure: A Theoretical Exposition|The logic for state monopoly of public utilities arises from increasing returns to scale and the concern that private business in these areas results in monopolistic exploitation of consumers. The state monopoly however is fraught with the danger of production inefficiency. In this backdrop, the market form of mixed oligopoly is contemplated in markets like health, education, electricity, gas, telecommunications etc, where public and private sector coexists. The private firms maximize profit but the public firm maximizes social welfare. Despite this theoretical exposition, it is often observed that public firms fail to make contributions according to their potentiality. The public firm in an industry with rapid change in technology can perform inefficiently due to decision making delay, adherence to social obligation. The policy makers must rise to these occasions then survival of public firms will be smooth. The option of public private partnership also derives affirmative results for the society and the particular industry per se.
H44|Firms' Costs, Profits, Entries, and Innovation under Optimal Privatization Policy|We investigate how cost conditions of private firms affect optimal privatization policy and private firms' profits. We find that the optimal degree of privatization is decreasing with the costs of private firms unless the public firm is fully privatized in equilibrium. A cost reduction in a private firm increases the degree of privatization and benefits for all private firms. Therefore, each private firm's profit is increasing with its rival private firms' costs, which is in contrast to the result when the degree of privatization is given exogenously. This interesting property yields two important results. The profit of each private firm can increase with the number of private firms, and the positive externality of innovation accelerates private firms' R&D.
H44|Does EU membership prevent crowding out of public health care? Evidence from 28 transition countries|This paper investigates changes in public health care use in 28 transition countries in the aftermath of the global financial crisis using data on more than 60 thousand households from “Life in Transition” surveys II and III conducted by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in 2010 and 2016. A difference-in-difference model with robust standard errors clustered at a country level is applied to two sets of transition countries defined by their membership status in the European Union. While there was no difference in public health care use between the two groups in 2010 the share of households using the public health care system dropped by a remarkable 22.2% points between 2010 and 2016 in non-EU transition countries compared to new EU members. There is also some evidence of crowding out of public health care with private out-of-pocket expenditures in non-EU members. These findings represent a serious policy concern in terms of falling access to health care in non-EU transition countries. If one believes in equity benefits from access to public health care for all compared to private out-of-pocket expenditures these results also demonstrates a clear benefit of EU membership.
H44|Competitive pressure from neighboring markets and optimal privatization policy|We formulate a mixed oligopoly model in which one state-owned public enterprise competes with n private firms in the same market and m private firms in the neighboring market. We investigate how n and m affect the optimal degree of privatization. The optimal degree of privatization is increasing with the number of private firms in the same market, and the relationship between the optimal degree of privatization and the number of private competitors in the neighboring market is an inverted U-shape. Our result suggests that more pressure from competitors supplying differentiated products can reduce the optimal degree of privatization. We also find that the optimal degree of privatization can increase with the foreign ownership share in private firms in the neighboring market.
H44|Trends and Features of Research on Foreign Aid: A Literature Review|This paper reviews the economics literature on foreign aid. Aid supporters tend to emphasize results, while its detractors tend to highlight the incentives it provides (although they may still acknowledge some of aid’s positive results, particularly on public health). Like the modes to deliver it, research on foreign aid has evolved over the years. From the traditional aid-growth regressions research has refocused towards micro issues, including institutional inefficiencies or sector-specific bottlenecks. This tendency is positive, in so far as it can lead to useful policy advice that improves the way aid is given. Great gaps in knowledge remain, though. Notably, the aid market is poorly understood in aspects such as donors’ interaction with the recipient government or donors’ coordination. In terms of political economy, recipient countries’ decision making with regards to aid fungibility or the incentives provided by new types of aid (notably China’s) have been largely unexplored. Moreover, the types of public goods that improve households’ living standards are little understood. The scarcity of research on these questions is greatly due to lack of data – or even data opacity; if aid is to be better understood and improved, far greater efforts must be made in terms of collecting and sharing data.
H44|Optimal Production Tax and Privatization Policies under an Endogenous Market Structure|We investigate the optimal tax and privatization policies in a mixed oligopoly in which a state-owned public firm competes against private firms in a free-entry market. First, we investigate the domestic private firm case. The optimal tax rate is strictly positive except for the full privatization and full nationalization cases, and the relationship between the optimal tax rate and degree of privatization is inverted U-shaped. Further, the optimal degree of privatization is decreasing in the tax rate. Next, we investigate the foreign private firm case and find that the two policies are mutually independent.
H44|Public Private Partnerships: The Swiss Specificity|While most countries have adopted public private partnerships, the prevalence of such arrangements differs widely across countries and the differences have been persistent. In particular, while around 700 PPP projects have been launched in the United Kingdom between 1994 and 2011, Switzerland has experienced only 2 of such arrangements over the same period of time, and exhibits one of the lowest number of PPPs within OECD countries. What could explain this Swiss specificity? Is this specificity a good or a bad thing? What is the right number of PPPs? The goal of this chapter is to answer these questions. To this aim, we first define precisely what PPPs are, and what they are not (Section 1). We then develop the theoretical framework that points out the conditions under which PPP arrangements are optimal, or relatively more optimal than the other possible modes of provision (Section 2). This normative analysis highlights that the choice to resort to PPPs should be driven by the characteristics of the public service considered. As we expect public services to be quite similar across countries of similar level of economic development, we can infer that it is only cultural and institutional differences that could help to explain the differences in actually implemented PPPs. We then consider the Swiss cultural and institutional specificities that might lead the number of PPPs to be under optimal in Switzerland but also over optimal in other countries (Section 3). Finally, we conclude with some policy recommendations.
H44|Public Private Competition|"We examine competition between a private and a public provider in markets for ""merit goods"" such as education, healthcare, housing, recreation, or culture. The private firm provides a high-price/high-quality variety of the good and serves richer individuals, while the public firm provides a low-price/low-quality variety and serves poorer individuals. We derive the private competitor's best response to changes in the public firm's price and quality level. This enables us to examine the distributional effects of government policies aimed at making publicly provided goods more affordable or increase their quality, and of changes to the government budget constraint that make publicly provided goods more expensive or decrease their quality. Our results have implications for the financing of the public supply of such goods, and for whether additional resources, if available, should be spent on reducing the price or enhancing the quality of publicly provided goods."
H44|Decomposing Value Added Growth into Explanatory Factors|A method for decomposing nominal value added growth is presented, which identifies the contributions from efficiency change, growth of primary inputs, changes in output and input prices, technical progress and returns to scale. In order to implement the decomposition, an estimate of the relevant cost constrained value added function for the two periods under consideration is required. This is taken to be the free disposal hull of past observations. Aggregation over sectors is also considered. The methodology is illustrated using U.S. data for two sectors over the years 1960-2014.
H44|How Does Welfare from Load Shifting Electricity Policy Vary with Market Prices? Evidence from Bulk Storage and Electricity Generation|We model the electricity market to demonstrate that changes in the price of natural gas can cause the market and non-market impacts of bulk electricity storage to move in opposite directions. We provide evidence consistent with the model using a series of reduced form tests on data from 2005-2010. We then simulate installing bulk electricity storage on the US electric grid. We find that lower natural gas prices generally reduce the market gains and non-market costs of storage. However, direct non-market costs are still positive which means that there is no argument for subsidizing storage to mitigate pollution given the current mix of generating technologies; arguments in favor of bulk storage R&D subsidies ride on public good aspects of technology and dynamic investment incentives for intermittent renewables.
H44|In the Shadow of a Giant: Medicare’s Influence on Private Physician Payments|We analyze Medicare’s influence on private insurers’ payments for physicians’ services. Using a large administrative change in reimbursements for surgical versus medical care, we find that private prices follow Medicare’s lead. A $1.00 increase in Medicare’s fees increases corresponding private prices by $1.16. A second set of Medicare fee changes, which generates area-specific payment shocks, has a similar effect on private reimbursements. Medicare’s influence is strongest in areas with concentrated insurers and competitive physician markets, consistent with insurer-doctor bargaining. By echoing Medicare’s pricing changes, these payment spillovers amplify Medicare’s impact on specialty choice and other welfare-relevant aspects of physician practices.

H44|Power Politics: Electoral Cycles in German Electricity Prices|We provide evidence that German public energy providers, over which municipality-level politicians hold substantial sway, systematically adjust the pricing of electric energy in response to local electoral cycles. The documented pattern is in line with both, an artificial reduction in prices before an election that needs to be countermanded by future price increases, and an artificial postponement of market-driven price increases until after the election is over.
H44|Public and Private Hospitals, Congestion, and Redistribution|This paper studies how congestion in the public health sector can be used as a redistributive tool. In our model, agents differ in income and they can obtain a health service either from a congested public hospital or from a non congested private one at a higher price. With pure in-kind redistribution, agents fail to internalize their impact on congestion, and the demand for the public hospital is higher than optimal. We show that under full information, the optimal redistribution and sorting across hospitals can be obtained using a lump-sum tax and a subsidy on the private hospital. If income is not observable but the social planner can assign agents across hospitals, the optimal congestion is higher than in the first best in order to relax incentive constraints. Finally, if agents can freely choose across hospitals, the optimal subsidy on the private hospital price may be negative or positive depending on the relative importance of redistribution and efficiency concerns.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H44|Opt Out or Top Up? Voluntary Health Care Insurance and the Public vs. Private Substitution|We investigate whether people enrolled into voluntary health insurance (VHI) substitute public consumption with private (opt out) or just enlarge their private consumption, without reducing reliance upon public provisions (top up). We study the case of Italy, where a mixed insurance system is in place. To this purpose, we specify a joint model for public and private specialist visits counts, and allow for different degrees of endogenous supplementary insurance coverage, looking at the insurance coverage as driven by a trinomial choice process. We disentangle the effect of income and wealth by going through two channels: the direct impact on the demand for healthcare and that due to selection into VHI. We find evidence of opting out: richer and wealthier individuals consume more private services and concomitantly reduce those services publicly provided through selection into for-profit VHI. These results imply that the market for VHI eases the redistribution from high income (doubly insured) individuals to low income (not doubly insured) ones operated by the Italian National Health Service (NHS). Accounting for VHI endogeneity in the joint model of the two counts is crucial to this conclusion.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H44|Choice and Competition in Public Service Provision|In spite of a range of policy initiatives in sectors such as education, health care and legal services, whether choice and competition is valuable remains contested territory. This paper studies the impact of choice and competition on different dimensions of quality, examining the role of not-for-profit providers. We explore two main factors which determine whether an alternative provider enters the market: cost efficiency and the preferences of an incumbent not-for-profit provider (paternalism). The framework developed can incorporate standard concerns about the downside of choice and competition when consumer choice is defective (an internality) or choice imposes costs on those who do not switch (an externality). The paper considers optimal funding levels for incumbents and entrants showing when the 'voucher' provided for consumers to move to the incumbent should be more or less generous than the funding for consumers who remain with the incumbent. Finally, the model also offers an insight into why initiatives are frequently opposed by incumbent providers even if the latter have not-for-profit objectives.
H44|College curriculum, diverging selectivity, and enrollment expansion|Abstract We analyze the heterogeneous impact of expansion of higher education on student outcomes in the context of competition among colleges, which differentiate themselves horizontally by setting curricular standards. Our analysis is based on a novel model of human capital production where a student’s outcome of studies at a college depends on the match between the student’s aptitude and the standard of the college’s curriculum. We find that when public or economic pressures compel less selective colleges to lower their curricular standards, low-ability students benefit at the expense of medium-ability students. This reduces competitive pressure faced by more selective colleges, which therefore adopt more demanding curricula to better serve their most able students. This model of curricular product differentiation in higher education offers an explanation for the diverging selectivity trends of American colleges.
H44|Modelling effective legal aid system|Aim: This article presents a theoretical model that enables achievement of macroeconomic efficiency of the legal aid system by means of adjusting supply to the pre-determined demand. Results: Main deterministic components of aggregate demand for legal aid are defined using a shift-share type framework. The knowledge of its parameters makes it possible to estimate expected demand for legal aid in response to various formulae of possible reforms of the system. Motivation: Estimates of demand serve to compute legal aid supply that minimizes social costs of legal aid provision. This task is accomplished by means of the so called assignment problem originating the field of operational research. Providers are divided in line with their average productivities in solving appropriate legal cases and the aggregate personal costs of legal aid provision are subject to minimization.

H44|Reconstructing Renewable Energy: Making Wind and Solar Power Dispatchable, Reliable and Efficient|This paper is important because it explains how to create a grid-scale energy storage system (ESS) that makes, for the first time, wind and solar renewable energy—dispatchable, reliable and efficient. Existing and recent discoveries in battery technology are analyzed, with the most appropriate recommended for use in the new ESS. Additionally, an innovative time-shifting ESS design approach is presented that decouples electricity production from use, considerably improving total wind and solar power peak average capacity contribution values. This minimizes the need for expensive standby natural-gas combustion turbine peaker plants—thereby decreasing costs by 75%. Furthermore, this advanced ESS improves performance by making the interconnection grid more reliable and better able to handle changing customer demands, relieves transmission congestion, and decreases unscheduled power outages—and also provides ancillary services; thereby improving system-wide benefits by 30-to-40%, further reducing effective ESS costs, perhaps to zero.
H44|The effects of universal state pre-kindergarten on the child care sector: The case of Florida's voluntary pre-kindergarten programAuthor-Name: Bassok, Daphna|Over the past two decades states have drastically increased their investments in pre-kindergarten programs. One major question about state investments in early childhood education programs is to what extent these initiatives create new child care options rather than crowd-out existing private child care options. We investigate this issue using Florida's universal pre-kindergarten program (VPK), a national leader with respect to preschool access, as a case study. Leveraging a 9-year panel of data we find that the introduction of Florida's VPK program expanded the size of the state's licensed child care market by 13% relative to the predicted market size. Using a synthetic control difference-in-difference approach we also show that VPK led to an increase in the percentage of 4-year-olds enrolled in formal care but a drop in the percentage of 3-year-olds enrolled in these settings. Implications are discussed.
H44|Does community involvement affect teacher effort? Assessing learning impacts of Free Primary Education in Kenya|While the impressive school participation impacts of Universal Primary Education policies in Sub-Saharan Africa are widely recognized, attempts to measure learning gains from schooling remain minimal. Utilizing a unique international test score dataset, we measure and explain grade six reading and math learning outcomes in Kenya. By comparing competences between public and private schools before and after the introduction of free primary education, we find large achievement declines and inequalities based on gender and socioeconomic status. The declines are associated with low teacher efforts and community disengagement. Policy studies on community involvement in schools will likely lead to improved learning.
H44|Should I stay or should I go? Exit options within mixed systems of public and private health care finance|Mixed public–private finance is widespread in health care systems internationally. In one variant of mixed finance, some countries (e.g., Germany) allow eligible beneficiaries to fully exit from the public (social insurance) system and purchase private insurance. Using a controlled laboratory experiment, we empirically investigate the predictions of a political economy model of mixed systems of public and private finance with two types of exit: universal-exit, when all individuals can choose to exit the public system, and conditional-exit, when only individuals with an income at or above a threshold income level can choose to exit. We find that high-income individuals are less likely to exit under universal-exit than under conditional-exit, despite having the same incentive to exit in both treatments. Sensitivity treatments suggests that a number of factors may be at play in explaining this result, including learning effects, a priming effect and a framing effect, but that other-regarding preferences do not appear to be an important factor.
H44|School meals and pupil satisfaction. Evidence from Italian primary schools|This paper aims to analyse to what extent pupils value the characteristics of the state school foodservice and identify which variables affect the degree of pupils’ satisfaction with the quality of school meals. A representative sample of 33 state primary schools providing meals was extracted for the metropolitan city of Naples. Two questionnaires were distributed, one to the headteachers concerned and the other to 5th grade pupils (10–11years old). Information about the catering companies was mainly sourced from the AIDA database. Pupil satisfaction was measured by two key variables: pleasantness of eating at school and food tastiness. Controlling for pupil, family, school, foodservice and catering company characteristics, the paper shows that the catering company size negatively impacts upon pupil satisfaction with the foodservice, whereas the estimated meal average production cost is positively associated with pupil satisfaction. The study could assist city boroughs in devising meal quality indicators to be taken into account in designing competitive tendering.
H44|Risk selection and heterogeneous preferences in health insurance markets with a public option|Conventional wisdom suggests that if private health insurance plans compete alongside a public option, they may endanger the latter's financial stability by cream-skimming good risks. This paper argues that two factors may contribute to the extent of cream-skimming: (i) degree of horizontal differentiation between public and private options when preferences are heterogeneous; (ii) whether contract design encourages choice of private insurance before information about risk is revealed. I explore the role of these factors empirically within the unique institutional setting of the German health insurance system. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to disentangle adverse selection and moral hazard, I find no compelling support for extensive cream-skimming of public option by private insurers despite their ability to fully underwrite risk. A model of demand for private insurance supports the idea that heterogeneity in non-pecuniary preferences and long-term structure of private insurance contracts may be muting cream-skimming in this setting.
H44|Transaction and transition costs during the deregulation of the Swedish Railway market|The research on regulatory reform has identified and measured three types of costs associated with the shift from monopoly to competition: transaction costs, misalignment costs and transition costs. In this article we use a case study approach to measure and compare these costs during the deregulation of the Swedish railway system from 2000–2015. Our case studies confirm earlier research that vertical separation and the introduction of competition in the railway markets result in comparatively small direct transaction costs. Extraordinary transaction costs in the form of interrupted contracts are also a minor problem for the railway system as a whole but might create major problems for the affected region. Our research concurs with earlier research on the British railway system and a CER study that misalignment costs seem to be significantly bigger and more troublesome to handle than direct transaction costs. Railway maintenance costs in Sweden using competitive tenders are increasing four to five times faster than railway operations with no measurable improvement in performance. Transition costs have been and continue to be important in the deregulated Swedish railway system. First, procrastination in the form of delayed changes in the allocation of train paths results in misalignment costs that seem to be growing. Second, adjustment costs in the form of handouts to the former monopolist have been ten times higher than the costs for interrupted contracts.
H44|Strategic managerial delegation and industrial policy competition in vertically-related markets|In a successive duopoly in which all firms are private except the home upstream SOE, we show that if the SOE is less efficient than its foreign rival, the home managerial delegation policy will force the SOE to price below marginal cost; otherwise, it will resort to marginal cost pricing to force out its rival. Both upstream firms will not be pure profit maximizers and will compete in profit and sales. The home government will subsidize its downstream firm if the market is large or the foreign rival's output is small. The foreign government will always subsidize its downstream firm.
H44|The objective function of government-controlled banks in a financial crisis|We present evidence that government-controlled banks (GCBs) significantly increased their lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) whose main bank was a large bank in the 2008–09 financial crisis. Further analyses show that the weak relationship between large banks and SMEs is a major cause for this phenomenon. The mixed Cournot oligopoly model with relationship banking, where profit-maximizing private banks and a welfare-maximizing GCB coexist, shows that this finding is consistent with the welfare maximization by a GCB rather than its own profit maximization.
H44|The organisation of services of general interest in Finland|Like in most European countries, SGIs in Finland have in recent years been subject to competition and increased private provision or privatisation. This development is motivated by expected cost reductions, by EU-regulations, by ideology and fashion, and in some cases by expected sales revenues. The empirical evaluations of SGI-reforms are few and somewhat contradictory, but the relative success of Finland’s manufacturing SOEs suggests that the public sector is hardly unable to organise efficient SGIs. A number of potential market failures suggest that public ownership should be taken seriously as an alternative to regulation. An increased emphasis on public ownership would be fairly easy to implement in Finland, because the state is still a significant owner, but EU’s policy on liberalisation and unbundling needs an overhaul.
H44|Financial performance of major public enterprises in Croatia from 2006 to 2014|The aim of this paper is to present basic characteristics of state-owned enterprises in Croatia, assess their financial operations and identify major trends in their operations and long-term development prospects. The analysis is carried out for the period from 2009 to 2014. The paper gradually examines financial operations, management system and the systems of accountability and transparency in state owned enterprises. The particular emphasis is on the comparative overview of major state-owned enterprises’ missions and the extent to which they serve public purposes. Moreover, the paper evaluates capital investment plans and provides proposals for the reform of state-owned enterprises in Croatia. In all state-owned enterprises, a serious organizational restructuring - adjustment of the organizational structure and number of employees is still expected.
H44|Comparative analysis of private and public provision of the water and waste services by the Italian municipalities|This paper investigates the behavior of private and publicly-owned corporations providing services in local industries that have undergone restructuring interventions since the Nineties in order to promote market contestability. Based on the approaches arising from the transaction costs theory, the paper proposes a comparative analysis of the economic and financial efficiency of a sample of local utilities supplying services in the water and waste industries, observed from 2008 to 2010. The efficiency analysis is achieved by measuring the distance from the stochastic frontier of the production costs of each firm, and the financial efficiency analysis through statement ratios. The findings of the study generally confirm the implications of the transaction costs approach and they show a wide convergence trend between privately and publicly owned organizations for the degree of utilization of input as well as for the financial efficiency analysis. There are sometimes slight differentials on the part of public companies, especially for the larger ones, which can be largely explained by the existence of more stringent welfare-oriented objectives.
H44|Quasi-markets Targets and the Evaluation of Nursing-home Funding in the Valencian Region|Spanish long term care is in danger, therefore we propose a change in the nursing home funding sys¬tem. We use as an example the extremely complex nursing home financing system of Valencian Region. In this region, there are many funding mechanisms: two types of public subsidies, two different acces¬sibility plans, a voucher scheme and a cash benefit approach related to residential service. We evaluate these methods through the quasi-market theory. We find that these approaches have negative impact on equity, efficiency and freedom of choice and we propose a new, homogeneous financing method for all nursing homes through voucher.
H44|Public or private job placement services—Are private ones more effective?|Expenditures on job placement and related services make up a substantial share of many countries’ GDP. Contracting out to private providers is often proposed as a more efficient alternative to the state provision of placement services. However, the responsible state agency has to design and monitor sufficiently complete contracts to ensure that the private contractors deliver the desired quality of services. None of the recent empirical evidence indicates that contracting out is necessarily more effective or more efficient than public employment services.
H44|What is a service of general economic interest?|The definition of the concept a “service of general economic interest” (SGEI) known from Article 106(2) treaty of the functioning of the European Union is clarified. When a service is determined to be an SGEI, Member States may enact measures and undertakings entrusted with the provision of the SGEI may engage in behaviour which would otherwise be contrary to the rules of the Treaties, notably the competition rules. Member States retain a wide discretion to define, provide and finance SGEIs; i.e. to use the entrustment of an SGEI as a tool to intervene in the market. This discretion is subject only to a test for manifest error of assessment by the Commission. To increase legal certainty, ensure effective intervention in markets and prevent their use in industrial policy, it is highly relevant to clarify what SGEIs are. The various definitions published by the Commission and in the literature are examined, and a new definition of an SGEI based on economic theory (networks and network effects) is formed. This definition is consistent with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the General Court. On the basis of the definition, implications for efficiency in dealing with SGEIs are made. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016
H44|Inefficiency in Childcare Production.Evidence from Italian Microdata|The purpose of the paper is to study inefficiency in the production technology of the childcare service and to carry out a comparative analysis of public and private day-care centres. An empirical analysis on cross-section micro-data from a region of northern Italy has been conducted by using an input-distance function with a translog specification. Estimates of the multi-output production technology and input-oriented technical inefficiency are obtained in a stochastic frontier model with a half-normally distributed one-sided error. Heteroscedasticity has been modelled to investigate the determinants of inefficiency and estimate their marginal effects. We find that production exhibits increasing returns with an estimated elasticity of scale of 1.21. Separability between inputs and outputs is rejected at a 5% level of significance. The average estimate of technical inefficiency is 10% and public centres are more inefficient than private centres by 4.1 percentage points. The proportion of part-time children and the presence of mixed-age classrooms are significant determinants of inefficiency which equally affect both public and private centres.

H44|Renewal Investment in Water Infrastructure and Sustainability of Municipal Water Service Utility|This paper estimates renewal investment in aging water infrastructure to investigate the fiscal sustainability of water service utilities operated by municipalities in Japan. Specifically, we focus on the water infrastructure in Nishiwaki City, Hyogo Prefecture and estimate the past infrastructure investment and the future renewal costs, and further forecast the future balance of payment in the water utility account. The past infrastructure investment is estimated on the basis of the actual record of water supply facilities such as water pipes developed and the actual construction costs at present, and the amount of future renewal investment is estimated on the assumption that investment would be made after the end of each facility fs service life. The estimated annual amount of renewal investment during the 50 years from FY2017 to FY2065 comes to 0.9 to 1 billion yen per year. It is about three times as large as the annual average of recent infrastructure investment by Nishiwaki City from FY2009 to FY2013, which stands at 334 million yen. The result suggests that the future renewal investment will be a huge fiscal burden on this city. Assuming that earnings from water supply services will decline in the future and the present revenues structure and water service charge will not be changed, the city will run out of its accumulated funds (internal reserve funds) in the water utility account by around FY2020 and will face revenue shortfalls. In order to renew infrastructure as needed while maintaining the present water services, the city must consider countermeasures such as the integration or abolition of facilities, revision of water charges, reform of the management approach, and the possibility of covering a part of expenses by general public expenditure, as soon as possible. It is also necessary to understand that this situation is not a particular problem faced by one local city but it is common to all municipalities throughout the country.
H44|The impact of advertising length caps on TV: Evidence from the French broadcast TV industry| The quantities of advertising on TV are regulated in France, as in many other developed countries. This paper aims at understanding the welfare implication of such regulation. It is the first paper which investigates this issue with a structural econometric model in two-sided market framework. I construct an unique database of per hour data on 12 main broadcast TV stations in France during one year (2014) to estimate structurally the demand and supply in the French broadcast television industry. I identify the shadow prices of regulation caps on advertising quantities, using the difference in estimated marginal costs between the binding and non-binding regulation constraints. A counterfactual experiment is carried out to quantify the exact impact of regulation. The results suggest that the TV channels advertise more without regulation but the overall impact of the current regulatory regime is small. The welfare analysis suggests that the current regulation framework is unnecessary, since it constrained the profit of TV channels without improving significantly the welfare of TV viewers.
H44|Does Public Competition Crowd Out Private Investment? Evidence from Municipal Provision of Internet Access| Government investment in infrastructure may crowd out private investment that would have otherwise occurred. But, the threat of government intervention may also induce private firms to invest preemptively in infrastructure, in order to maintain their market position. This leaves the net effect of public competition on private investment unclear. This paper investigates the tension between these competing effects by providing evidence from the setting of internet service provision. Using household survey data and a novel data set of internet plan characteristics, I provide nationwide estimates of demand for internet technologies. I then use these results to estimate a dynamic oligopoly model of private and public internet service providers’ entry and technology adoption decisions, where private firms are driven by profits and municipalities by some (as yet) unknown combination of profits and consumer welfare. Finally, I simulate firms’ actions under a ban on public provision and find evidence that public competition partially, but not completely, crowds out private investment. Ultimately, I find that a ban on municipal provision in 30 states would result in a loss in consumer welfare of $1.11 billion over 20 years.
H44|Public-Private Partnership: Current Status and Prospects for Development|"In this article the Public private partnership (PPP), due its special meaning to the national economy, is under investigation. A theoretical framework has been established, with all different types of PPP to be realized according to it. The study outlines the current state of PPP contracts, explaining the regulatory barriers hindering PPPs pursuant to the Public-Private Partnership Act (PPPA). The authors of this study hope that it will become grounds for the discussion of the issues raised in, whereby the result from the ""part-time dispute"" would be assessed along with the prospects for the formation of PPPs on a national level. And there are prospects for the development of PPPsboth in terms of their ""natural substance"" of activities, which are already realizes, as well as on terms of transforming the funding mechanisms of different projects of public importance."
H44|Choice Overload Paradox And Public Policy Design. The Case Of Swedish Pension System|In this paper we focus on an adverse effect of extensive choice widely known as ‘choice overload’. We draw on the case of Swedish funded pensions for illustration and analyze the consequences of the design that allowed for maximizing the choice set. The analysis shows limitations of employing the rational choice approach to the real choice decisions biased with common psychological factors and demonstrates that government’s responsibility for the privatized pension system does not end with the design. We also emphasize the need for a decent default option, which would mitigate socially harmful results of adverse behavior effects like procrastination, status quo bias or abstaining from choice. After all, privatized pension systems still belong to the sphere of public policy.
H44|Alexis Tsipras und der rhetorische Diskurs als Politik<BR>[Alexis Tsipras and the rhetorical discourse as Policy]|"Es existiert wohl keinerlei «Präzedenzfall», der in irgendeiner Weise vergleichbar wäre mit der vollkommenen Verwandlung des derzeitigen griechischen Ministerpräsidenten Alexis Tsipras und dessen Anpassung an die Anforderungen der griechischen Realität. Wahrhaft, all zu rasch übersetzte sich sein radikaler, unkonventioneller und extremer Diskurs gegen die in Griechenland seit 2010 implementierte harte Sparpolitik, in einen taktischen Rückzug. Die SYRIZA Partei, eine heterogene Mischung linker Strömungen, nutzte den Unmut der Bevölkerung gegenüber den schmerzhaft anmutenden Sparmaβnahmen des sogenannten griechischen Memorandums, um den eigenen machtpolitischen Senkrechtsstart voranzutreiben und sich ziemlich rasch von einer kleinen Protestpartei zu einer Machtpartei zu verwandeln. Dementsprechend transferierte diese Partei, ohne die geringste moralische Umschweife, die Verzweiflung der Bürger in einen extremen rhetorischen Diskurs der scheinbaren „Verteidigung sozialer Rechte“ hinein, jedoch mit dem Ziel des eigenen Wahlsieges und anschließend die Übernahme der Macht. Abstract English There is probably no ""precedent"", which would be comparable in any way with the perfect transformation of the current Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras and its adaptation to the requirements of the Greek reality. Truly, all too quickly his radical, unconventional and extreme discourse against the implemented in Greece since 2010 tough austerity policy, is transformed into a tactical retreat.. The SYRIZA party, a heterogeneous mixture of left Groups , used the displeasure of the population to the painful-looking Austerity measures of the so-called Greek memorandum to advance their own political take off to power and rather rapidly to transform from a small protest party to a ruling party. Accordingly, this party transferred, without the slightest moral ado, the despair of the citizens in an extreme rhetorical discourse of apparent ""defense of social rights"" into it, however, with the aim of the own electoral victory and then the acquisition of power."
H44|The 'Common Goood' in Pope Francis's Social Welfare Hypothesis|In conventional welfare economics Pareto optimality requires competitive markets in which rational sellers use pure private resources to produce pure private goods and services for rational consumers. Although such theory acknowledges that market failures prevent Pareto optimality, it continues to advocate efficiency alone as the first best policy for society. Pope Francis has argued recently that the current economics of indifference to the common good is responsible for the enormous environmental damage to Earth (‘our common home’). He calls for an integral approach to consumption and production, one that takes the common good as the source and object of well-being. In that way consumption and production depend on the common good, and so too do associated time-discounted social satisfaction and surplus. This means that a socially desirable program is one that optimizes integral satisfaction and surplus, so that consumption and production functions are a system of endogenous (dynamical) simultaneous equations in which the utility of the integral person is a function of the social utility. I use insights from the economic models of resources (both exhaustible and renewable) to describe what the Pope means. The description is rather loose, but the implications of the exercise are wide and far-reaching. For example, I find that the socially efficient price is not Pareto efficient; it is one that allows for the marginal social utility, marginal social surplus, and marginal social royalty to the common good. In other words, under conventional welfare economics the marginal cost of generating the present value of the social surplus that eats up the present value of the rent to the common good guarantees the disutility of the integral person even as it meets the utility of the rational person. One policy implication of such a result recommends consideration of the common good as a key variable in both production and consumption. Precisely how that can be done is the direction in which future research must go. The question this result raises is about how to quantify the common good. For Pope Francis the level of analysis is integral subsidiarity, where the environment would be a good proxy for the common input to production and the common outputs are reduce poverty, inclusion (reduced inequality), and the protection of the common input.
H44|Consignment Auctions of Free Emissions Allowances under EPA’s Clean Power Plan|The initial distribution of emissions allowances is usually thought to be independent of the emissions outcome, but free allocation can affect the efficiency and fairness of allowance trading. Inefficiency may result from thin allowance markets, poor price discovery, and regulatory or organizational complexities that hinder recognition of opportunity costs and innovation. Concerns about fairness may result from lack of access to allowances for some entities and lack of transparency with respect to transfers of substantial value in the program. We explore the role of consignment auctions in mitigating these concerns. These revenue-neutral auctions return revenue to the original allowance holders, whose compliance obligations can be met by reacquiring allowances through purchase. Consignment auctions have minimal administrative costs and do not necessarily involve government. Experience indicates that they can play an important role in a new market. EPA and states could consider consignment auctions in planning for the Clean Power Plan.
H44|Parental choice, neighbourhood segregation or cream skimming? An analysis of school segregation after a generalized choice reform|Abstract This paper studies the evolution of school segregation in Sweden in the aftermath of the 1992 universal voucher reform, which spurred the establishment of new independent schools and introduced parental choice. We assess the relative importance of neighbourhood segregation, parental choice and the location of independent schools for school segregation. In particular, we exploit variation in school choice opportunities across municipalities and provide descriptive evidence that in regions where school choice has become more prevalent, school segregation between immigrants and natives, and between children of high/low educated parents, has increased more than in regions where choice is limited. This result also holds when we account for residential segregation and focus on excess segregation over and above the segregation that would occur if all pupils attended their assigned schools. We find that the increase in school segregation 15 years after the reform that can be attributed to choice is relatively small.
H44|Decomposing Value Added Growth over Sectors into Explanatory Factors|A decomposition of nominal value added growth over multiple sectors of an economy into explanatory factors is presented. The explanatory factors over a single sector are changes in the efficiency of the sector, growth of primary inputs, changes in sectoral output and input prices, technical progress and returns to scale. In order to implement the decomposition for a sector, an estimate of the sectorâ€™s cost constrained value added function for the two periods under consideration is required, which is taken to be the free disposal hull of past observations. The problems associated with aggregating over sectors are also considered. The methodology is illustrated using U.S. data for two sectors over the years 1960-2014.
H44|Universal Pre‐school Education: The Case of Public Funding with Private Provision|This paper studies the effect of free pre-school education on child outcomes in primary school. We exploit the staggered implementation of free part-time pre-school for three-year-olds across Local Education Authorities in England in the early 2000s. The policy led to small improvements in attainment at age five, with no apparent benefits by age 11. We argue that this is because the expansion of free places largely crowded out privately paid care, with small changes in total participation, and was achieved through an increase in private provision, where quality is lower on average than in the public sector.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H44|Soziale Wohnraumförderung auf dem Prüfstand|Die Bundesregierung plant zur Entspannung des Wohnungsmarktes in Deutschland, die Mittel für die soziale Wohnraumförderung deutlich auszuweiten. Tatsächlich geht die Ausweitung von Fördermitteln jedoch am Kern der Wohnungsmarktprobleme vorbei, die vor allem durch fehlendes Bauland begründet sind. Darüber hinaus ist die soziale Treffsicherheit sehr gering, wie eine Auswertung auf Basis des SOEP zeigt. Nur rund 46 Prozent der Haushalte, die in Sozialwohnungen leben, verfügen über weniger als 60 Prozent des Median-Einkommens und gelten damit als armutsgefährdet.
H44|Time scarcity and the market for news|We develop a theory of news coverage in environments of information abundance. Time-constrained consumers browse through news items across competing outlets. They choose which outlets to access and which stories to read or skip, thus indirectly deciding how much time to spend on a given outlet. Firms decide on rankings of news items that maximize their profits. We show that even when readers (or television viewers) and firms are rational and unbiased, they spend more time on the news than they would like and not necessarily on the topics they prefer. In particular, relevant news items may be crowded out. We then study how reader-efficient standards can be restored and derive implications on diverse aspects of current media, including advertising and reader preference for like-minded news.
H44|Immigration, Occupational Choice and Public Employment|This paper investigates the theoretical effects of immigration in an occupational choice model with three sectors: a low-skilled, a high-skilled and a public sector. The originality of our approach is to consider (i) inter-sectoral mobility of labor and (ii) public employment. The combination of these two features yields a new mechanism by which immigration can have positive effects. The model demonstrates that immigration increases wages in the high-skilled and the public sectors, provided that the immigrant workforce is not too large and the access to public jobs is not too easy. The average wage of natives may also increase accordingly. Moreover, immigration may improve workers' welfare in each sector. Finally, the mechanism underlying these results does not require complementarity between natives and immigrants.
H44|College Expansion and Curriculum Choice|This paper analyzes the impact of college enrollment expansion on student academic achievements and labor market outcomes. When public policies promote “access” to college education, colleges adjust their curricula: Non-elite public colleges adopt a less demanding curriculum to accommodate the influx of low-ability students, benefiting them at the expense of middle-ability students. In response to the reduced competitive pressure for middle-ability students, private colleges adopt a more demanding curriculum to better serve their high-ability students, again at the expense of middle-ability students. The model offers an explanation to the observed U-shaped earnings growth profile among college-educated workers in the U.S.
H44|Contracting Out Mandatory Counselling and Training for Long-Term Unemployed: Private For-Profit or Non-Profit, or Keep It Public?|This study evaluates the effectiveness of contracting out mandatory publicly provided counselling and training for long-term unemployed in Flanders (Belgium) to private for-profit and non-profit organisations (FPOs and NPOs). A multivariate transition model exploits timing-of-events and novel exclusion restrictions to account for selection on unobservables. Overall, the intervention was highly effective in reducing unemployment duration, but also spurred employment instability and withdrawals from the labour force. FPOs slightly, but significantly enhanced exits to employment without reinforcing recidivism relative to the public provider but not significantly relative to NPOs. FPOs also charged lower prices and hence were the best performing providers.

H44|The Organisation of Services of General Interest in Finland|Like in most other European countries, services of general interest in Finland have in recent years been subject to competition, increased private provision, and in some cases privatisation. This development is motivated by expected cost reductions, by EUregulations, by ideology and fashion, and in some cases also by a desire to generate sales revenues. Empirical evaluations have provided mixed results, but the relatively successful history of Finland’s state enterprises makes it hard to believe that the public sector would be unable to organise SGI-services efficiently. A number of potential market failures suggest that renationalisation should be taken seriously as an alternative to regulation. This would not necessarily be a very radical policy, because public ownership is still fairly prominent among SGIs in Finland

H44|Pre-negotiation commitment and internalization in public good provision through bilateral negotiations|A profit-maximizing public good supplier endogenously determines the level of the public good and simultaneously negotiates with beneficiaries of the good one by one. A pre-negotiation commitment on the production level of the public good by the supplier enhances the internalization of beneficiaries' preferences. With the commitment, the supplier produces the public good at an efficient level in equilibrium if and only if its bargaining power is sufficiently weak. In addition, the public good is produced excessively as a result of the commitment when the supplier's bargaining power is sufficiently strong.
H44|The Distributional Consequences of Public School Choice|School choice systems aspire to delink residential location and school assignments by allowing children to apply to schools outside of their neighborhood. However, the introduction of choice programs affect incentives to live in certain neighborhoods, which may undermine the goals of choice programs. We investigate this possibility by developing a model of public school and residential choice. We consider two variants, one with an exogenous outside option and one endogenizing the outside option by considering interactions between two adjacent towns. In both cases, school choice rules narrow the range between the highest and lowest quality schools compared to neighborhood assignment rules, and these changes in school quality are capitalized into equilibrium housing prices. This compressed distribution generates incentives for both the highest and lowest types to move out of cities with school choice, typically producing worse outcomes for low types than neighborhood assignment rules. Paradoxically, even when choice results in improvement in the worst performing schools, the lowest type residents may not benefit.
H44|Evidence on U.S. Electricity Prices: Regulated Utility vs. Restructured States|Economic theory states that “free market” competition naturally achieves lower prices—thereby increasing efficiency and benefiting society. This is the first paper in the literature to use means testing to statistically analyze electricity prices, from 1970-2011, for states that restructure their electric utilities—pre-and-post restructuring—relative to U.S. electricity prices; thus determining whether restructured electricity utility states are more or less efficient, after restructuring, than before. This fundamental empirical evidence is sought to explain whether expected operating synergies are being realized and stockholders are gaining or losing relative value—once states restructure—and electric companies are merged or acquired. This paper’s empirical results are timely and important to future energy policy—in this crucial to the economy electric power industry—and establish whether “free market” economic theory is being appropriately applied in states that restructure their verticallyintegrated government-regulated natural monopoly electric utilities. Future research is suggested.
H44|Modeling of the Dynamics Relationship between World Crude Oil Prices and the Stock Market in Indonesia|This study aims to examine the dynamics of the relationship between world crude oil prices and Indonesian stock market within the period of January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2013. The world crude oil prices referred to the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil, whereas the composite indexes at the Indonesian Stock Exchange were used as indicators of the stock market in Indonesia. Daily data were analyzed by employing the LVAR causal model. The test results showed that there was a significant dynamical relationship between world crude oil prices and Indonesian composite index, both in the long-term and in the short-term. The dynamics of this relationship is positive, meaning that if the world crude oil price rises (falls), then the composite index also rises (falls). This finding is in the need for Indonesian government to be considered in their economic policy, as well as for investors to manage their investment portfolio.
H44|Texas Interconnection Grid: Economic Optimal Capacity Utilization Rate Evidence|For the fi rst time in the literature, the supply and demand model, with 2011-2014 data, is used to analyze the Texas Interconnection grid electricity market. The electric utility industry’s production function, fi xed, variable and total cost (TC) curve represents the supply curve. The demand curve is the electricity price in the assumed perfectly competitive electricity market. The effi cient scale of production is established—located where the U-shaped average TC curve reaches a minimum—and using marginal analysis, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, to determine the economic optimal capacity utilization rate that maximizes electric utility industry profi ts. This paper’s aggregate results on the economics of the electric utility market are meaningful, insightful and well-timed—having important electric utility policy implications
H44|Bank ownership and credit over the business cycle: Is lending by state banks less procyclical?|This paper finds that lending by state banks is less procyclical than lending by private banks, especially in countries with good governance. Lending by state banks in high income countries is even countercyclical. On the liability side, state banks expand their total liabilities and, in particular, their non-deposit liabilities relatively little during booms. Public banks also report loan non-performance more evenly over the business cycle. Overall our results suggest that state banks can play a useful role in stabilizing credit over the business cycle as well as during periods of financial instability. However, the track record of state banks in credit allocation remains quite poor, questioning the wisdom of using state banks as a short term countercyclical tool.
H44|Election cycles and electricity provision: Evidence from a quasi-experiment with Indian special elections|We present evidence from India showing that state governments induce electoral cycles in electricity service provision. Our data and research strategy allow us to build on models of political business cycles and targeted distribution in two important ways. First, we demonstrate that by manipulating the flow of critical inputs into economic activity like electricity, elected leaders can influence economic outcomes even in contexts where they have constrained fiscal capacity. Second, we identify the effect of elections on electricity provision by focusing on special elections held for exogenous reasons. Our results show that state governments induce substantive increases in electricity service to constituencies that hold special elections. Manipulation of the power supply is stronger in contested constituencies and during special elections held in states where the government commands only a small majority. Overall, we find no evidence of positive welfare effects from the electoral manipulation of electricity supply.
H44|A slice or the whole cake? Network ownership, governance and public–private partnerships in Finland|This paper discusses and analyses public–private partnership (PPP) options within the framework of different ownership and governance (O&G) models of technical infrastructures. The O&G models in Finland are described and the market layers of ownership, operation, and services are studied. All infrastructure sectors have somewhat different O&G structures and they each have a different market context, not least because of ownership and the market structures that are “on” the infrastructure. Private companies, public companies, state and municipality owned enterprises and purely public-authority-type models can be found. Interestingly, the models seem not to affect too much the cash-based returns to the owners. However, the market structures will probably provide varying prospects for PPPs to be carried out, whether the PPPs are means of procuring projects or outsourcing of formerly public functions. The financial return capacity of the infrastructure is playing a key role. Some infrastructures have already a tradition of “good business” while others are considered as public goods on more or less sustainable grounds. The results imply that for some infrastructures there could be more natural markets for PPPs. The paper gives a topology for different market layers which can be identified for infrastructures and related services and businesses.
H44|Cumplimiento en pago de contribuciones: autoridades fiscales versus religiosas en México|This paper studies fiscal correspondence and fiscal trust. Through an experimental design carried out in Oaxaca, Mexico it explores which authority, the religious or the civil one, is better at collecting contributions to finance common goods. Results suggest that fiscal correspondence is the main factor to explain better collection. That is, when the good is observable, people are more willing to pay the contribution.
H44|Do Publicly Owned Banks Lend Against the Wind?|This paper investigates the lending pattern of state-owned banks over the business cycle. I take the endogeneity of public banking into account by including records on both privatizations and nationalizations during banking crises. I find that public bank lending is (i) significantly less cyclical except for low-income countries, (ii) asymmetric along the business cycle, (iii) heterogeneous across stages of economic development, and (iv) related to banks’ vulnerability on their funding side. Public banks reduce their lending less during economic downturns, but their ability to absorb negative shocks is marginally decreasing as the size of the shock increases.

H44|If You Get What You Want, Do You Get What You Need? Course Choice and Achievement Effects of a Vocational Education and Training Voucher Scheme|Centrally planned funding models of vocational education and training (VET) are often blamed for low quality training in areas unrelated to skill needs. In this study, we exploit a natural experiment and population data to estimate the effects from introducing a broad-based voucher in VET in Australia. We show the voucher is associated with large increases in private college enrolments, improved match between course choice and employer demand, and higher student achievement, including in incumbent public colleges. Unlike studies in the school voucher literature, we find widespread benefits with no adverse impact on equity.

H44|Are Public or Private Providers of Employment Services More Effective? Evidence from a Randomized Experiment|This paper compares the effectiveness of public and private providers of employment services. Reporting from a randomized field experiment conducted in Denmark we assess empirically the case for contracting out employment services for a well-defined group of highly educated job-seekers (unemployed holding a university degree). Our findings suggest, first, that private providers deliver more intense, employment-oriented, and earlier services. Second, public and private provision of employment services are equally effective regarding subsequent labour market outcomes. And third, the two competing service delivery systems appear to be equally costly from a public spending perspective.
H44|Evaluating the efficiency of public services|Efficiency is an important consideration for those who manage public services. Costs vary with output and with a variety of other factors. In the case of higher education, for example, factors include quality, student demographics, the scale and scope of the higher education provider, and the size and character of the real estate. But even when taking all these factors into account, costs vary across providers because of differences in efficiency. Such differences offer clues about good practice that can lead to improvements in the system as a whole. The role of efficiency is illustrated by reference to higher education institutions in England.
H44|International cross-ownership of firms and strategic privatization policy|We consider how the international cross-ownership of firms affects the privatization of a public firm competing with foreign firms. We show that when firms compete á la Cournot in a third market under a linear demand function, the domestic ownership of foreign firms can impede privatization, whereas the foreign ownership of the domestic firm can promote privatization. Moreover, the domestic ownership of foreign firms can render neither complete privatization nor complete nationalization optimal under moderate conditions. Conversely, when firms compete á la Bertrand, we demonstrate that it is always optimal to pursue complete nationalization. Copyright Springer-Verlag Wien 2015
H44|Competition and privatization policies revisited: the payoff interdependence approach|We investigate the relationship between competition and privatization policies. Existing studies measure the strength of competition based on the number of firms, and show that the optimal degree of privatization is higher in more competitive markets. We introduce an interdependent payoff structure into a mixed oligopoly and revisit this problem. Here, we assume that firms consider their own and other firms’ profits. In the model, competition increases when firms are negatively affected by rivals’ profits. We find that under the assumption of quadratic production costs, which is popular in mixed oligopolies, the optimal degree of privatization is higher when there is less market competition. This finding contrasts with those of prior studies. However, this result may be reversed when we adopt alternative model formulation. Furthermore, in the constant marginal cost case, the optimal degree of privatization is always lower when there is less market competition, which is opposite to the result in the quadratic cost case. Our results suggest that the relationship between an optimal privatization policy and the strength of competition crucially depends on the market structure, including the cost conditions.

H44|Vote with their donations : An explanation about crowding-in of government provision of public goods|This paper considers a mechanism where providers of public goods reflect donors f preferences for public goods. When asking individuals and private companies to contribute for a certain public good, it is widely known that the total contributions result in under-provision. Among the many countermeasures for this problem, some fundraisers adopt a measure to reflect large donors f preferences for the characteristics of public goods. In such a case, private contribution is enhanced because there is additional incentive to donate. We formalized such a measure theoretically and proved that this measure surely enhances private contributions. Moreover, we find that government direct subsidy may not only crowd-out but also even crowd-in private contribution under this framework. If fundraisers reflect the major donors f preference, the influence of one fs donation is leveraged by government direct provision. This element enhances private contributions. If this effect dominates the innate crowding-out effect, government direct subsidy may enhance private contribution. This mechanism is a novel explanation for both crowding-out and crowding-in under an identical framework.
H44|Some Like It (Less) Hot: Extracting Trade-Off Measures for Physically Coupled Amenities|The urban heat island (UHI) provides direct evidence of human activities contributing to a feedback loop that changes ecosystem services by creating localized warming and differences in vegetated landscapes in areas around the urban core. This paper develops a new spatial-temporal panel estimator to recover consistent estimates of households' valuation of coupled landscape and temperature ecosystem services. Using data from Phoenix, AZ, we estimate a hedonic price function using an extension of the Hausman-Taylor model to overcome challenges associated with the varying spatial scales of capitalization of landscape and temperature variables and omitted variables. We find a positive and economically significant marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for measures of green landscaping at multiple spatial scales and a separate MWTP for a one degree (F) reduction in outdoor temperatures of $72 monthly.
H44|Compassion or Cash: Evaluating Survey Response Incentives and Valuing Public Goods|This paper reports the results of an experiment evaluating the effects of incentives on individuals' willingness to participate in a survey. By pairing the assessment with a natural field experiment, the analysis considers private versus public goods as incentives, and estimates respondents' willingness to support the oldest food bank in the U.S.

Paradoxically, even when choice results in improvement in the worst performing schools, the lowest type residents may not benefit.
H44|The Anatomy of Physician Payments: Contracting Subject to Complexity|Why do private insurers closely link their physician payment rates to the Medicare fee schedule despite its well-known limitations? We ask to what extent this relationship reflects the use of Medicare's relative price menu as a benchmark, in order to reduce transaction costs in a complex pricing environment. We analyze 91 million claims from a large private insurer, which represent $7.8 billion in spending over four years. We estimate that 75 percent of services, accounting for 55 percent of spending, are benchmarked to Medicare's relative prices. The Medicare-benchmarked share is higher for services provided by small physician groups. It is lower for capital-intensive treatment categories, for which Medicare's average-cost reimbursements deviate most from marginal cost. When the insurer deviates from Medicare's relative prices, it adjusts towards the marginal costs of treatment. Our results suggest that providers and private insurers coordinate around Medicare's menu of relative payments for simplicity, but innovate when the value of doing so is likely highest.
H44|Editor's Choice The Aggregate Effect of School Choice: Evidence from a Two-Stage Experiment in India|We present experimental evidence on the impact of a school choice program in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh that provided students with a voucher to finance attending a private school of their choice. The study design featured a unique two-stage lottery-based allocation of vouchers that created both student-level and market-level experiments, which allows us to study the individual and the aggregate effects of school choice (including spillovers). After two and four years of the program, we find no difference between test scores of lottery winners and losers on Telugu (native language), math, English, and science/social studies, suggesting that the large cross-sectional differences in test scores across public and private schools mostly reflect omitted variables. However, private schools also teach Hindi, which is not taught by the public schools, and lottery winners have much higher test scores in Hindi. Furthermore, the mean cost per student in the private schools in our sample was less than a third of the cost in public schools. Thus, private schools in this setting deliver slightly better test score gains than their public counterparts (better on Hindi and same in other subjects), and do so at a substantially lower cost per student. Finally, we find no evidence of spillovers on public school students who do not apply for the voucher, or on private school students, suggesting that the positive effects on voucher winners did not come at the expense of other students.

H44|The Effects of Government-Sponsored Venture Capital: International Evidence|This article examines enterprises funded by government-sponsored venture capitalists (GVCs). We find that enterprises funded by both GVCs and private venture capitalists (PVCs) obtain more investment than enterprises funded purely by PVCs, and much more than those funded purely by GVCs. Also, markets with more GVC funding have more VC funding per enterprise and more VC-funded enterprises, suggesting that GVC finance largely augments rather than displaces PVC finance. There is also a positive association between mixed GVC/PVC funding and successful exits, as measured by initial public offerings (IPOs) and acquisitions, attributable largely to the additional investment.
H44|Choice overload paradox and public policy design. The case of Swedish pension system|In this paper we focus on an adverse effect of extensive choice widely known as ‘choice overload’. We draw on the case of Swedish funded pensions for illustration and analyze consequences of the design that allowed for maximizing the choice set. The analysis shows limitations of employing the rational choice approach to the real choice decisions biased with common psychological factors and demonstrates that government’s responsibility for the privatized pension system does not end with the design. We also emphasize the need for a decent default option, which would mitigate socially harmful results of adverse behavior effects like procrastination, status quo bias or abstaining from choice. After all, privatized pension systems still belong to a sphere of public policy.
H44|Das ökonomische und politische Dilemma Europas<BR>[The economic and political dilemma of Europe]|Abstract Englisch Apparently the European economic model being subjected to a double competition problem. On the one hand, there are enormous differences in the level of competitiveness of the various member countries of the euro area and the EU among themselves. In the long term this Problem stylized to a dramatic debt crisis for one Part of the EU member States like Greece, Portugal, Ireland , Spain and Italy The advanced state debt are nothing more than a symptom of a lack of competitiveness. On the other hand, the European economic model seems to be not able not in the long term to follow the aggressive development orientation of the Far East. The dominant Forces into the EU tries to handle with this external competition problem mainly with wage policy measures such as wage cuts, a reduction in government expenditure or even with real depreciation. However, the limitation of political measures on the consolidation of public finances , is an attempt to deal only with the symptoms of the problem. The Result is, that a political problem of legitimacy is called into the world that has mainly two aspects. On the one hand, a problem of sovereignty in the sense that the transmitted decision-making powers of the states at the EU instances, is not transferred to the benefit of democratically elected bodies like the European Parliament, but to artificially created bodies of financial supervision like the Troika that directly or indirectly is under the influence of the most powerful member states. In this Way we have on the other side the production of a huge democratic deficit. This finds his expression in the demand on democratically elected governments to prevail unpopular austerity measures, even if they have to bypass their parliaments, institutions and constitutions.
H44|Bargaining agenda in public and private monopoly|This paper analyses the choice of the bargaining agenda in a public/private unionised monopoly. Both the public and private monopolist always prefers the Right-To-Manage (RTM) to the Efficient Bargaining (EB) agenda. Private monopoly is socially preferred to the public one and conflict of interests on the preferred agenda arises between Government on one side and workers and consumers on the other side. In case of threat of market entry, the public (private) monopolist may strategically commit to RTM (EB) to deter entrance. If RTM is the ex-ante industry practice, a public incumbent company cannot use the EB agenda as a strategic tool to deter entry, while an incumbent private company can use it. An opposite result holds when EB is the established practice in the industry: the incumbent public company can use RTM to deter entry, while the incumbent private company cannot. The social welfare implications are analysed.
H44|Infrastructural investments in the Euro 2012 host cities in Poland|The most significant value added by Euro 2012 is undoubtedly the infrastructural changes. The event became a catalyst for the execution of more than two hundred projects for an amount of ca. PLN 100 billion. This paper focuses on the key projects, including above all the road construction projects, as well as those connected to road and rail infrastructure. Considering such significant outlays, the funding the preparation, particularly in a division into private and public sources, becomes an especially important issue. It is the predominant commitment of public funds that creates the need to justify their allocation, chiefly in the case of the sports venues, usually utilised by private sports clubs after the end of the event. Euro 2012 has been compared in this respect with other events of this rank, staged in Europe since the beginning of the 21st century.
H44|Technology and Governance: Enabling Participatory Democracy|Several factors and dimensions are taken into consideration which influences the definition and scope of e-governance. Here ‘e’ implies technology driven governance. By application of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for the delivery of government services, exchange of information and services becomes efficient. Here exchange and flow of information takes place at three levels- 1) Government to consumer (G2C) 2) Government to business (G2B), and 3) Government to government (G2G) The perspective of e-governance is the “use of technologies that both help governing and have to be governed”. In order to understand debate and analyze the concept of e-governance and how its contours have changed, we first need to recognize e-democracy. It is a process and structures that encompass all forms of electronic interaction between the elected government and the citizenry. E-democracy as a concept and practice precedes participatory democracy which has been defined (Kramer, 1972) as that process that emphasizes broader participation in governance operation. Thus e-governance is conditioned on the fact that there exists a democratic political system and it involves a participatory framework of governance. This paper will look at the changing paradigm of e-governance through three broad questions- 1) Has ICT enabled civic engagement and initiated public opinion in this developing economy 2) Has it succeeded in reversing apparent defects in the electoral system 3) Has ICT lead to the spread of information from the state to the society
H44|If You Get What You Want, Do You Get What You Need? Course Choice and Achievement Effects of a Vocational Education and Training Voucher Scheme|Outside of apprenticeships, allocations of public funds across vocational education and training (VET) courses are often made on the basis of government forecasts, with limited competition between (mostly public) colleges. This centralised model is often blamed for stifling responsiveness to skill demands and training quality. However, little is known about whether moving to alternative funding models improves outcomes. In this study, we exploit a natural experiment and population data to estimate the effects from the introduction of a broad-based voucher in VET in Australia. We show the voucher is associated with large increases in private college enrolments, improved match between course choice and employer demand, and higher student achievement, including in incumbent public colleges. Unlike studies in the school voucher literature, we find widespread benefits with no adverse impact on equity.
H44|Investment Finance and Financial Sector Development|Investment in infrastructure for increasing trade and connectivity in South Asia and Southeast Asia has been impacted by a reduction in commercial bank participation in project financing, which has significantly increased the role of multilateral financial institutions and export credit agencies. The financing model needs to change to more sustainable local market and local currency financing by harnessing domestic savings, and this will be crucial if the region is to procure investments of an estimated $3.6 trillion by 2020 for financing of its infrastructure and connectivity projects. Increased connectivity between South and Southeast Asia can play an important role in improving efficiency and productivity by having more efficient industries based on comparative advantage, enlarging the overall market size, and increasing market access. However, such economic integration faces a multitude of challenges relating to cross-border infrastructure links, weak trade facilitation, shortages of infrastructure financing, non-tariff barriers, restrictions on foreign direct investment, and weak institutional coordination. Improvement in these issues would require large-scale public and private sector investment, supplemented by commercially viable credit. This study analyzes the means and constraints in funding cross-border connectivity projects. Using the most recent data from sources including the World Bank, ADB, and other financing and research institutions, barriers in financing cross-border projects are explored and analyzed with the help of case studies. This research brings to the fore the potential benefits of regional funding platforms and the role of multilaterals in resolving such barriers.
H44|School Meals and Children Satisfaction. Evidence from Italian Primary Schools|This paper aims to identify which variables affect the degree of primary pupils' satisfaction concerning the quality of school meals. A representative sample of 33 public primary schools offering meals was extracted for the metropolitan city of Naples. Two questionnaires were distributed, one to the headteachers concerned and the other to the pupils enrolled in the 5th grade. Information about the catering companies is mainly sourced from the AIDA database. Pupil satisfaction is measured by two key variables: pleasantness of eating at school and food tastiness. Controlling for pupil, family, school, foodservice and catering company characteristics, the paper shows that catering company size is negatively associated with pupil satisfaction with the foodservice, whereas meal average production cost is positively associated with satisfaction. The study could assist city boroughs in devising meal quality indicators to be taken into account in designing competitive tendering.
H44|Comunit� e cooperazione: l�evoluzione delle cooperative verso nuovi modelli di partecipazione democratica dei cittadini alla gestione dei servizi pubblici|Le cooperative di comunit� che si stanno diffondendo in molte parti del mondo sono il punto di arrivo di un processo evolutivo che ha visto il progressivo spostamento del baricentro delle cooperative da particolari gruppi sociali e professionali alla societ� nel complesso. Questa evoluzione � contrassegnata da due principali eventi. Il primo si � verificato all�inizio del XIX secolo, allorch� sono apparse le prime cooperative di comunit� che servivano intere comunit�. Un ulteriore cambiamento � avvenuto verso la fine del secolo scorso, con l�allargamento degli obiettivi delle cooperative fino ad abbracciare il benessere collettivo. Da questo processo evolutivo emergono quattro tipologie di cooperative che, considerate nel loro insieme, costituiscono una classificazione esaustiva dell�universo cooperativo, entro cui vanno collocate le cooperative di comunit�. Il termine � relativamente nuovo e organizzazioni simili o identiche sono state denominate in modo diverso in tempi diversi. Inoltre, bench� le nuove cooperative di comunit� abbiano in comune alcune caratteristiche fondamentali, presentano marcate differenze al loro interno e rispetto alle forme anteriori. Per fare chiarezza, elaboriamo un nuovo concetto di cooperativa di comunit�, coerente con l�evoluzione di questa forma organizzativa e con la classificazione generale delle cooperative. Gli elementi fondamentali del concetto sono i beni di comunit�, il territorio e la cittadinanza, che vengono discussi dettagliatamente e con riferimenti a casi concreti. Quindi esaminiamo in cosa le nuove cooperative di comunit� si differenziano da quelle storiche. Il lavoro si conclude con una breve discussione delle loro prospettive future.
H44|Does income inequality increase charitable giving?|Do households react to changes in the distribution of income in their localities by changing their charitable giving? The theoretical prediction of the effects of income inequality on giving is unclear. We study how changes in income inequality measured at the neighbourhood and municipality levels affect charitable giving by households in Canada between 1991 and 2006. We find that increases in inequality increase giving. Results are sensitive to the geographic dispersion of low- and high-income households in neighbourhoods within a municipality. The effect on donations is smaller in areas with high levels of inequality at both neighbourhood and municipality levels.
H44|Labour Market Matters - January 2015|Income inequality has risen significantly since the 1980s, with the share of income among the top 1% increasing by 27% between 1980 and 2005. While the widening gap between the rich and poor is concerning, CLSRN affiliates Abigail Payne (McMaster University) and Justin Smith (Wilfrid Laurier University) examine whether the rate of charitable giving may increase as income inequality rises in a new study entitled â€œDoes Income Inequality Increase Charitable Giving?â€ (CLSRN Working Paper no. 150). The study finds that rising income inequality results in overall increases in charitable giving. During the 1990s, an increase in the number of immigrants and their rising poverty rates (low-income rates) accounted for much of the increase in the overall Canadian poverty rate. However, this pattern changed in the 2000s, when little of the change in the Canadian poverty rates or income inequality was associated with immigration. A study entitled â€œImmigration, Low Income and Income Inequality in Canada: Whatâ€™s New in the 2000sâ€ (CLSRN Working Paper no. 148) by CLSRN affiliates Garnett Picot (Queenâ€™s University, Citizenship and Immigration Canada) and Feng Hou (Statistics Canada), examines the direct effect of immigration on low income and family-income inequality. The study finds that overall, the rising immigrant population over the 2000s had little impact on Canadian economic indicators such as the low-income rate, high income rate, income inequality and earnings inequality. These results differ from those observed during the 1990s.

H44|What Determines Efficiency? An Analysis of the Italian Water Sector|The Italian water sector has encompassed major changes since mid?90s when law 96/94 has entered into force. Next to private participation, integration of services and growth in production scales, the reform was intended to revolutionize the traditional financial model almost fully based on public funds. Although citizens, politicians and experts on water services have been debating for a long time on the impact of the reform on the industry, as well as on the fairness of a tariff system inspired by the concept of full cost recovery, we are still on a state of uncertainty. The final purpose of this paper is to provide regulators with guidelines that could be used to revise water tariffs in a way that may be cost?efficient, sustainable and fair to the most. According to the analyses, which rely on firm?specific Xinefficiency scores, despite a satisfactory mean level of performance, in the period under investigation, efficiency improvements have been limited. Moreover, the results demonstrate that both the ownership structure and politics do have an impact on the efficiency of the firms: in particular, public shareholding and centreright local governments negatively affects firms’ performances. To this respect, we think that a more effective regulation would also have the side effect of loosening the ties between politicians and managers.
H44|Real Options Methodology In Public-Private Partnership Projects Valuation|PPP offers numerous benefits to both public and private partners in delivery of infrastructure projects. However this partnership also involves great risks which have to be adequately managed and mitigated. Private partners are especially sensitive to revenue risk, since they are mostly interested in the financial viability of the project. Thus they often expect public partners to provide some kind of risk-sharing mechanism in the form of Minimum Revenue Guarantees or abandonment options. The objective of this paper is to investigate whether the real option of abandoning the project increases its value. Therefore the binominal option pricing model and risk-neutral probability approach have been implemented to price the European and American abandonment options for the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) toll road investment. The obtained results suggest that the project value with the American abandonment option is greater than with the European abandonment option, hence implying that American options offer greater flexibility and are more valuable for private partners.
H44|Cobertura y calidad del internet en Chocó|Chocó, una de las economías con mayor retraso económico y social de Colombia, es uno de los departamentos de focalización de políticas públicas vinculadas a mejorar las condiciones de vida de sus habitantes. Dentro de los proyectos destinados al desarrollo se encuentra incrementar la educación de su población y para esto se hace necesario la implementación del internet entre los ciudadanos con la hipótesis de generar menores costos de comunicación entre los individuos y mayores conocimientos a través de la búsqueda global que ofrece el internet. Para incrementar los beneficios de este servicio se requiere de una cobertura total y una calidad eficiente y a la vanguardia de las telecomunicaciones, por lo cual la inversión en el departamento y la defensa de políticas que incentiven el uso y la aplicación del servicio, son prioridad.
H44|The Kreps-Scheinkman Game in Mixed Duopolies|We extend the results of Kreps and Scheinkman (1983) to mixed duopolies. We show that quantity precommitment and Bertrand competition yield Cournot outcomes not only in the case of private firms but also when a public firm is involved. We also investigate the case of public Stackelberg leadership and that of private Stackelberg leadership.
H44|U.S. Electrical System Reliability: Deregulated Retail Choice States’ Evidence and Market Modeling|The goal of this paper is to test if the promised U.S. electrical system high reliability standards are being maintained, once states deregulate their electric utilities. This research is the first in the literature to combine states that offer retail choice, by deregulating their electric utilities, with North American Electric Reliability Corporation reserve margin forecasts, from 2014-2023, to analyze whether deregulated retail-choise states are adding adequate generating capacity to meet demand, and thus provide high electrical system reliability, when compared to the U.S. as a whole. This paper's results on electricity energy policy. Additionally, this is the first paper in the literature to propose a new space- time bussiness model that adequately addresses the complex, multidiscipline, mutlidimensional, U.S. electrical system deregulated market. Future research will specify the new business model's mathematical formulation.
H44|Decompositions of profitability change using cost functions|The paper presents a decomposition of a production unit’s cost ratio over two periods into explanatory factors. The explanatory factors are growth in the unit’s cost efficiency, output growth, changes in input prices and technical progress. In order to implement the decomposition, an estimate of the industry’s best practice cost function for the two periods under consideration is required. Profitability at a period of time is defined as the value of outputs produced by a production unit divided by the corresponding cost. Using the earlier work by Balk and O’Donnell, the paper provides a decomposition of profitability growth over two periods into various explanatory factors that are similar to the cost ratio decomposition except that change in outputs explanatory factor is replaced by two separate factors: an index of output price growth and a measure of returns to scale.
H44|Risk-bearing by the state: When is it good public policy?|The global financial crisis brought government guarantees to the forefront of the debate. Based on a review of frictions that hinder financial contracting, this paper concludes that the common justifications for government guarantees—i.e., principal-agent frictions or un-internalized externalities in an environment of risk neutrality—are flawed. Even where risk is purely idiosyncratic—and thus diversifiable in principle—government guarantees (typically granted via development banks/agencies) can be justified if private lenders are risk averse and because of the state's comparative advantage over markets in resolving the collective action frictions that hinder risk spreading. To exploit this advantage while keeping moral hazard in check, however, development banks/agencies have to price their guarantees fairly, crowd in the private sector, and reduce their excessive risk aversion. The latter requires overcoming agency frictions between managers and owner (the state), which would likely entail a significant reshaping of development banks’ mandates, governance, and risk management systems.
H44|Crowding-in of complementary contributions to public goods: Firm investment into open source software|We present a fairly general model in which firms are competitors in a commercial market segment and can invest into a complementary public good like open source software. We show that, contrary to standard predictions, additional contribution to the public good by the government or a new market entrant can lead to higher investments of all incumbent firms, that is, a crowding-in effect. This result occurs if the investment cost function is superadditive. We find that government contribution leads to larger crowding-in effects than subsidizing market entry if the price elasticity of demand with respect to the private good is large relative to the one with respect to the public good. Our results are robust to extensions in the timing and the mode of competition.
H44|Providing revenue-generating projects under a fair mechanism: An experimental analysis|This paper considers a procedurally fair provision mechanism that allows members of a small group to determine, through their bids, which project to implement. Previous experiments with (only) costly projects have demonstrated that the mechanism is efficiency enhancing. Our experiment tests whether the mechanism remains conducive to efficiency when revenue-generating, but less efficient, projects are made available. We find that this is not the case. Additionally, we detect no significant difference in bid levels depending on whether mixed valuations are present or absent, and on whether the others’ valuations are known or unknown. We interpret these results as evidence that the availability of revenue-generating projects engenders a biased perception of the efficient costly project.
H44|Does state preschool crowd-out private provision? The impact of universal preschool on the childcare sector in Oklahoma and Georgia|Universal preschool policies introduced in Georgia and Oklahoma offer an opportunity to investigate the impact of government intervention on provision of childcare. Since Georgia used a voucher-like program and Oklahoma utilized its existing public schools, the two states offer a case study of how government provision compares to government subsidization alone. Using a synthetic control group difference-in-difference estimation framework, we examine the effects of universal preschool on childcare providers. In both states there is an increase in the number of formal childcare centers. With the voucher-like program in Georgia, the overall increase in care is partly driven by an increase in the supply of formal childcare in the private sector and partly driven by new publicly-provided preschools. However, there is substantial crowd-out of private consumption of preschool. In Oklahoma, where universal preschool is publicly provided, the increase in the number of childcare providers occurred only in the public sector. The expansion of publicly-provided care seems to be driven largely by movement of employees from private centers to public settings. As such, this case-study comparison suggests that government subsidization through funding was more effective at expanding preschool than government provision.
H44|Do grants to charities crowd out other income? Evidence from the UK|We use a novel identification strategy to shed light on the effect of grant funding. We focus on charities that applied to a UK lottery grant programme. Where charities score the same on formal criteria, it is likely that informal criteria orthogonal to quality are used to break the ties, allowing us plausibly to treat a grant as a random event. We find evidence that grants have a positive impact for smaller charities, increasing their longevity and even crowding in other income.
H44|On the political economy of educational vouchers|Two significant challenges hamper the analyses of the collective choice of educational vouchers. One is the multi-dimensional choice set arising from the interdependence of the voucher, public education spending, and taxation. Second, even absent a voucher, preferences over public spending are not single-peaked; a middling level of public school spending may be less attractive to a household than either high public school spending or private education coupled with low public spending. We show that Besley and Coate's (1997) representative democracy model provides a viable approach to overcome these hurdles. We provide a complete characterization of equilibria with an endogenous voucher. A voucher is adopted in political equilibrium provided the coefficient of variation of income is sufficiently small. We undertake a parallel quantitative analysis and we find that no voucher arises in equilibrium for the U.S. income distribution, which exhibits too much heterogeneity. For a tighter income distribution, including those in Douglas County, Colorado where a voucher was recently adopted, our model predicts a positive voucher. Public support for a not-too-large voucher arises because the cross subsidy to public school expenditure from those switching to private schools outweighs the subsidy to those who attend private school in the absence of a voucher.
H44|Race and neighborhoods in the 21st century: What does segregation mean today?|Noting the decline in segregation between blacks and whites over the past several decades, some recent work argues that racial segregation is no longer a concern in the 21st century. In response, this paper revisits some of the concerns that John Quigley raised about racial segregation and neighborhoods to assess their relevance today. We note that while segregation levels between blacks and whites have certainly declined, they remain quite high; Hispanic and Asian segregation have meanwhile remained unchanged. Further, our analysis shows that the neighborhood environments of minorities continue to be highly unequal to those enjoyed by whites. Blacks and Hispanics continue to live among more disadvantaged neighbors, to have access to lower performing schools, and to be exposed to more violent crime. Further, these differences are amplified in more segregated metropolitan areas.
H44|The feasibility of modernizing the Interstate highway system via toll finance|This paper addresses two related problems: how to pay for reconstruction and modernization of the aging Interstate highway system and how to deal with political opposition to increased use of direct charging for highway use. It proposes introducing tolling only on individual corridors as they are reconstructed and (if needed) widened. First, the cost of reconstructing all existing Interstate lane-miles is estimated, using FHWA HERS unit cost data. The cost of adding lanes, where indicated by projected growth in light and heavy vehicle travel, is estimated using HERS unit costs. The revenue that could be generated by an inflation-adjusted per-mile tolling system (to be implemented via all-electronic tolling) on this rebuilt and modernized system is estimated. Finally, the net present value of toll revenues is compared with the net present value of modernization cost as an initial estimate of financial feasibility. The analysis is carried out for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
H44|Can cost asymmetry be a rationale for privatisation?|Cost asymmetries between the public and the private firms create a rationale for privatising the public firms. We show that this argument is restrictive, since it does not allow for other ways of reducing production inefficiency, which creates the motivation for privatisation. If the profit maximising private firm is technologically superior to that of the welfare maximising public firm, the society and the private firm benefit from technology licensing. Under technology licensing, both the equilibrium output of the private firm and the equilibrium degree of privatisation are zero. However, if cost asymmetry cannot be bridged by technology licensing due to costly and/or imperfect technology transfer, the argument in favour of privatisation remains.
H44|Designing fees for music copyright holders in radio services|This paper investigates which is the most desirable payment schedule, from a social welfare standpoint, for compensating IPR holders for music broadcast by radio stations. A model of a radio station that acts as a monopoly with respect to listeners and sells ads in a competitive market is presented. Two types of fees, ad valorem and per unit, are examined. Exploiting the similarity between taxes and fees, we extend results from taxation theory in two-sided markets to show that the case where only one side (i.e. advertisers) pays, while the other (the listeners) receives the service for free, differs somewhat from the case thus far considered by the literature, in which both sides pay. The results mildly support the prevailing regulatory approach, based on ad valorem fees.
H44|Compravendita o Donazione di Parti del Corpo Umano? Il Contributo di Alvin Roth e Dintorni|This article discusses Alvin Roth’s research about moneyless markets, and in particular about the manner in which kidneys are allocated to patients needing transplants. As Titmuss pointed out for blood transfusions, providing monetary incentives to blood donors may crowd out supply, since external rewards may crowd out intrinsic motivation. On the contrary, Roth argues than non-monetary but extrinsic incentives may have a positive effect on pro-social behavior without needing altruism. Developing Roth’s approach, this article analyzes what money cannot, and what should not, buy.
H44|Private and Public Provision of Counseling to Job Seekers: Evidence from a Large Controlled Experiment|This paper reports the results of a large-scaled randomized controlled experiment comparing the public and private provision of counseling to job seekers. The intention-to-treat estimates of both programs are not statistically different, but more workers were enrolled in the private program, implying an effect per beneficiary that is twice as large under the public as under the private program. We find suggestive evidence that the private firms may have insufficiently mastered the counseling technology, and exercised less effort on those who had the best chance to find a job. This highlights the incentive problems in designing contracts for these services.
H44|Market Design for Trading Commoditized Renewable Energy|Information and communication technology plays an important role in achieving a higher level of energy efficiency. In particular, energy efficiency can be achieved by integrating information technology into electricity networks to enable the interaction between suppliers and customers (smart grids). Power generation by renewable energy sources can also benefit from this integration of technologies. Distributed power generation, which will be the basis of renewable energy production, encourages the production of renewable energy resources and, accordingly, decreases transmission loss, increases energy saving, and enhances energy efficiency. Therefore, integrating distributed, renewable energy sources and smart grids within local marketplaces for trading renewable energy in small units can be a promising combination. In this paper, we propose a structure of a marketplace for renewable energy sources, design a market mechanism for trading in this market, and outline the requirements for such a market to function efficiently. Finally, we conclude and present recommendations to policymakers to provide incentives to generators to increase deployment of renewable energy sources and to end users to save electricity and to consume clean energy.
H44|Transparency of human resource policy|The scope of public human resource policy is outlined. Motivation for the need of transparency in this policy is provided in terms of informational asymmetries, human capital externalities, and long planning horizons. Transparency is defined both along a time dimension – ex ante and ex post – and by a taxonomy due to Geraats (2014), referring to different facets of decision-making, implementation, and outcomes: political, economic, procedural, policy, and operational transparency. Five aspects on human resource policy relevant for transparency are considered: efficiency and equity, input utilization, learning outcomes, the dimensioning of education, and benefits and costs. Finally, suggestions for improved transparency are considered. These involve devoting resources to research on the measurement of human capital externalities, facilitation of ex ante benefit-cost analyses preceding human resource policy decisions, and strengthening of political accountability through intermediate follow-ups during policy implementation, combined with commitment of funds to finance independent evaluations of the policy’s effects.
H44|Policies to avoid cost overruns: Critical evaluation and recommendations|Many infrastructural projects have cost overruns and there has been a lot of research both on why these cost overruns occur and what can be done to reduce cost overruns. Bent Flyvbjerg is the leading researcher in the area and in this article his proposals are also the starting point. Beside a literature review a questionnaire was also sent out to experienced Swedish project managers to find out what they thought could reduce cost overruns. This has been the foundation for the proposals formulated in this article. Proposals concerns three areas 1. Organizational macro-structure, e.g. using more PPPprojects but also decentralization of budgets where cost-overruns in one project in a region leads to less other projects in the specific region. 2. Organizational quality: It should be easy to see when and where cost overruns occur and who was responsible. There should be an well-developed knowledge management system in the organization and an organization culture of openness and a focus on improvements. 3. Organizational processes, e.g. a systematic use of external reviewers in different stages of a project.
H44|Framework for Structuring Procurement Contracts|The aim of this paper is to propose a new structure for classifying contract types and payment methods. Concerning the procurement contract types the first important feature is the stepwise structure with three main steps in the contract design: (1) should the contract only include construction or both construction and operation/maintenance? (2) Who should do the detailed design of the premise? (3) How many contractors should the client use? An important new feature of the structure is that in both step 2 and step 3 there is a continuum of alternatives. Concerning the payment methods the structure is primarily based on how the project specific risks are shared.
H44|Deregulation & Privatization: Texas Electric Power Market Evidence|The electric power industry is moving away from a regulated utility model, toward a deregulated marketbased modelâ€”thereby intending to improve system efficiency by reducing generation costs and customer prices, while at the same time improving capital expenditures and service reliability. This paper is the first in the literature to statistically test Texasâ€™ electricity prices, relative to U.S. electricity pricesâ€”and use energy emergency alerts and reserve margin forecasts to determine Texasâ€™ power system reliabilityâ€”since deregulation in 2002. Implementation of suggested reforms will help ensure the market-based design succeeds. Recommendations are offered for future research.
H44|Economic Outlook For Sustainable Growth In Public Water Utilities Perspectiva Economica Para El Crecimiento Sustentable En Los Organismos Publicos Operadores De Agua Potable|The economic problem for many public companies, responsible for providing the water service to human concentrations is high risk. The weaknesses and strengths of the organization and the threats and opportunities that the environment offers require detailed analysis for decision making. The establishment of the level of growth of the Utility of Water and Wastewater shall be supported to reduce their risks. The process of decentralization and divestiture of public bodies such conditions has led to completely new water companies. This process involves gradually reaching autonomy of public agencies. This paper shows a financial analysis of a body of water operator as a basis for achieving sustainable growth. One important result obtained in the analysis is that growth is being financed by the utilities is 56.92%. Thus, a very important part is financed with external resources.
H44|In 'Trusts' We Trust: Socially Motivated Private Schools in Nepal|We study school choice and school efficiency in terms of secondary school completion test scores by utilizing a unique database from Nepal. There are two novel features of our analysis: firstly we allow for heterogeneity among private schools, by distinguishing socially motivated trust-run schools from profit-motivated company-run schools, and secondly, we include school's expenditure as a determinant of its efficiency per unit of cost. We find that when expenditure is not included, the trust-run school comes on top, slightly but distinctly, ahead of the profit-motivated school. But if expenditure is included, the trust-run school's position becomes sensitive to the level of expenditure, as it is the only school to exhibit sensitivity between expenditure and test score. In the urban area, the public school is always at the bottom, and between the two types of the private school the trust-run school ranks first (second) at high (low) levels of expenditure. However, in the rural area it is a three way race, with the trust school coming on top again at high expenditure, but falling to bottom at low levels of expenditure. This picture is fairly robust to considerations of subject fixed effects and to inclusion or exclusion of private aided schools or private tuition. We show both theoretically and empirically that socially motivated schools can be efficient and outperform profit-motivated schools.

H44|Sobre la relación entre liberalización y eficiencia productiva en el sector ferroviario en Europa/On the Relation between Deregulation and Productive Efficiency in European Railway Sector|El objetivo de este artículo es contrastar si las políticas de liberalización del sector ferroviario, promovidas desde la Comisión Europea para incrementar el peso relativo del transporte ferroviario respecto a otros modos de transporte, han tenido efecto en la eficiencia productiva de los sistemas ferroviarios europeos que las han adoptado. Para ello se aporta como novedad la utilización de una medida del grado de liberalización de los sistemas ferroviarios europeos y su puesta en relación con los índices de eficiencia de dichos sistemas calculados según la metodología DEA por programas. Los resultados obtenidos, cuando se analizan los datos agregados, aportan evidencia empírica de una asociación positiva entre la eficiencia y la liberalización de los sistemas ferroviarios. Cuando se realizan análisis individualizados por países esta relación se difumina, de manera que no es posible destacar un grado de liberalización óptimo o un modelo de gestión que pueda servir de referencia. Among the European policies focused on increasing the railways market share versus other transportation modals, deregulation policies are the most relevant. The aim of this article is to contrast if these deregulation policies developed in European railways systems are working from the efficiency perspective. The main contribution of the paper is the use of a liberalization index that is related with efficiency indexes estimated by Programmatic Efficiency methodology. Results using aggregated data show empirical evidence of a positive association between deregulation and efficiency. However results analyzing each individual railway system do not show an evident relationship, so it is not possible to set an optimal deregulation level or even a management model that can be used as a reference in efficiency terms.
H44|Should I Stay or Should I Go? Public Provision of a Private Good with an Exit Option|In this paper, we adapt the standard political economy models of mixed financing of private goods to allow for an exit option in which individuals can choose to neither consume nor finance the publicly provided private good. Using a controlled laboratory experiment, we empirically investigate the predictions of this model when all individuals are allow to exit (universal-exit) and when only individuals with an income at or above a threshold income level are allowed to exit (conditional-exit). Even though the incentives for high-income individuals to exit are identical under both exit schemes, high-income individuals are less likely to exit when the exit option is universal. Sensitivity treatments suggests that a number of factors may be at play in explaining this result, including learning effects and a type of endowment effect, but that other-regarding preferences do not appear to be an important factor.
H44|The return of public enterprise|Public enterprises never disappeared in spite of several privatization waves in the last three decades. This paper offers some trends and possible rationales for their resilience. In a sample of the Forbes 2000 top corporations, as reviewed by OECD economists (Kowalski et al. 2013), we show that the around ten per cent of state-owned enterprises perform better in financial terms than their private counterparts. The Great Recession has also shown that governments had to take over failing major private enterprises, including particularly banks. In several countries, particularly in Western Europe, there is municipalization of electricity and water distribution. In the EU/15, there is also evidence that in electricity and gas, government owned incumbents offer fairer prices to households than private competitors. Recent research on mergers and acquisitions confirms that in the last ten years there has been an increase of publicization relative to privatization, including through trans-border deals.
H44|Forecasting the Public's Acceptability of Municipal Water Regulation and Price Rationing for Communities on the Ogallala Aquifer|Among many, increasing the price of municipal water is considered to be the most effective mechanism for enhancing municipal water conservation, whether during times of drought or not. However, increasing the price of something that is considered to be, literally, a life-giving resource is politically taboo. This study follows two others that evaluate survey data with Likert scale responses, in determining whether or not constituents would outright reject the idea of using price to ration municipal water. But it goes several steps further–it controls for both community and respondent level variables, calculates and evaluates in-sample response probabilities, and most importantly, attempts to forecast the attitudes of constituents in communities that are not in our survey sample. In the end, our model produces both in-sample and out-of-sample response probabilities that are reasonable, and relatively stable across communities; it therefore provides communities and researchers with a means to gauge public support for pricing initiatives.
H44|Paying on the Margin for Medical Care: Evidence from Breast Cancer Treatments|"We present a simple graphical framework to illustrate the potential welfare gains from a ""top-up"" health insurance policy requiring patients to pay the incremental price for more expensive treatment options. We apply this framework to breast cancer treatments, where lumpectomy with radiation therapy is more expensive than mastectomy but generates similar average health benefits. We estimate the relative demand for lumpectomy using variation in distance to the nearest radiation facility, and estimate that the ""top-up"" policy increases social welfare by $700-2,500 per patient relative to two common alternatives. We briefly discuss additional tradeoffs that arise from an ex ante perspective. (JEL G22, I11, I13, I18)"
H44|Financing infrastructure – International trends|The infrastructure financing market has gone through a process of radical transformation starting from the mid-2000s. Different reasons – including a changed macroeconomic environment, more stringent regulations on financial intermediaries, and a modified appetite for long-term asset investments – have led to a reallocation of flows from the banking sector to the institutional investors sector. This article provides an overview of international trends in infrastructure finance. It proposes a map of the different investment channels that private investors can use to access the infrastructure investment on the equity and debt side, highlighting the historical evolution of these segments in the past few years. Recently designed financial structures, such as different forms of partnership between banks and institutional investors, securitisation models and debt/credit fund vehicles, are also taken into consideration. JEL classification: E2, G1, G11, G2, G3, H44, H54, H81 Keywords: infrastructure financing, long-term investment, institutional investors, public-private partnerships, bank institutional investors partnerships, syndicated loans, project bonds, securitisation, debt/credit fund vehicles, financial market regulation
H44|The Political Economy of Publicly Provided Private Goods|Abstract Traditional Political Economy models typically imply a strong relationship between income inequality and public intervention in redistributive policies. Empirical evidence suggests that this may hold true only for certain kinds of policies, for instance cash transfers or education, but in the case of other policies with redistributive effects such as social security and some publicly provided private goods this may not hold true. Abstract In this paper I develop a method to derive the sign of the relationship between income inequality and degree of public intervention in education in a Probabilistic Voting model in which the consumers-voters are also allowed to choose other forms of redistribution. Abstract I show that the relationship between income inequality and governmental intervention implied in the traditional literature is mainly a result of the restrictive assumptions of those models. Abstract I also show that this method can deliver sharp predictions even in presence of those non-convexities in individual preferences that are usually described as a feature induced by public provision of education in the traditional literature in Public Economics. Abstract I argue that the relationship between income inequality and public intervention in schooling is a natural and promising field in which the tool proposed can be useful for empirical purposes and that can help to better explain some patterns described in the literature about public intervention in education.
H44|Antinomias del capitalismo: Una reseña sobre El malestar en la globalización de Joseph Stiglitz<BR>[Contradictions of capitalism: A review for Globalization and Its Discontents by Joseph Stiglitz]|The core issue raised in Globalization and its Discontents, what is the critical evaluation of the IMF's role in the financial crisis in Asian countries and modern Russian transition. The Asian crisis began in July 1997 when the Thai devaluation came to their impact throughout Southeast Asia, as the region plunged into a social setback never seen before. Stiglitz maintains that the main cause of the devaluation of financial liberalization was recommended by Washington in previous years.
H44|Eficiencia comparativa Empresa Pública vs. Empresa Privada: La evidencia empírica<BR>[Comparative efficiency of Public-owned vs. Private-owned companies: The empirical evidence]|¿ Las Empresas Públicas funcionan en general con una menor eficiencia que sus equivalentes Privadas, como reza el tópico al respecto? Se trata de un lugar común utilizado profusamente como un axioma indiscutible, principalmente desde posiciones políticas conservadoras. Aunque también frecuentemente asumido por publicaciones, comentaristas o políticos que no pretenden serlo. A este tópico contribuye, sin duda, que desde la teoría económica dominante, la específica ‘teoría de los derechos de propiedad’ sostiene en su tesis principal la predicción de que en el caso de una empresa pública la persona que la gestione (Director/a General, o el equipo directivo) será necesariamente menos eficaz que en caso de una empresa privada principalmente porque el sistema de control e incentivos sobre su gestión (por parte de la instancia pública propietaria) será a su vez o inexistente o muy poco eficaz. Independientemente de que las premisas en que se basa tal teoría pueda estimarse que no se dan en muchos casos, ¿Qué nos muestra la observación de la realidad? ¿Qué nos dice la evidencia empírica sobre tal lugar común respecto a si las empresas públicas son en general o ‘por naturaleza’ menos eficientes? El objetivo del presente trabajo es presentar y analizar la evidencia empírica acumulada durante décadas al respecto a escala internacional (apartados 2 y 3). Es decir, estudios empíricos que tratan de comparar, utilizando ciertos indicadores, la eficiencia de empresas públicas (EP) con la de empresas privadas (PR). Se trata en cualquier caso de investigaciones publicadas en revistas académicas reconocidas internacionalmente, o en publicaciones equivalentes de instituciones económicas como el Banco Mundial, el Banco de España, etc.. Puede anticiparse que entre las conclusiones generales aquí derivadas del análisis de ese conjunto de estudios empíricos (alrededor de 160) –y expuestas en el apartado 4- destaca la de que en una parte mayoritaria de esos estudios –entre 2/3 y un 58%- sus autores concluyeron que las empresas privadas de la muestra examinada presentaban un mayor nivel de eficiencia -según el indicador utilizado- que en el caso de las empresas públicas incluidas en la muestra. Y que en el resto de los estudios recopilados –entre 1/3 y un 42% de ellos- los autores concluyeron que no detectaron diferencias significativas, o bien que las empresas publicas de la muestra presentaban mejores niveles para los indicadores de eficiencia que los de las privadas con las que se comparaban. Esto permite afirmar pues que la referida predicción de la teoría de los derechos de propiedad -sobre que siempre o en general o por naturaleza las empresas públicas serán menos eficientes- no se cumple en la realidad en un número significativo de casos: entre 1/3 y un 42%; (por lo que cabe suponer que tal teoría debe estar desde hace tiempo en curso de ser reformulada en las agendas de los correspondientes teóricos). Por otra parte, un análisis más detallado de los 160 estudios referidos -considerando solo aquellos en que consta explícitamente que el indicador de eficiencia utilizado para basar las conclusiones no era tipo beneficios (dado sus limitaciones en cuanto a medir la eficiencia, discutidas aquí)- permite añadir que la proporción anterior (2/3 - 1/3) pasa al 50-50%: Es decir, igual número de estudios que concluyen que las empresas públicas estudiadas fueron menos eficientes como de estudios que concluyen que no. El presente informe finaliza con un resumen del ‘estado de la cuestión’ según lo anterior (punto 5.1), así como con un intento de contestar unas peguntas relevantes que tal estado de la cuestión sugieren (punto 5.2): ¿De qué depende que una determinada empresa que, como la EP, no es gestionada por sus propietarios (situación que de hecho es la dominante también en medianas y grandes empresas privadas) sea más o menos eficiente? ¿Cuáles son las condiciones que hacen que esa empresa –sea pública o privada- pueda mejorar su eficiencia? O, visto desde otra perspectiva ¿Cuáles son los ‘defectos’ que explicarían una menor eficiencia comparativa -y cuya eliminación permitirían que la empresa en cuestión mejorase su eficiencia? Disculpas anticipadas al/a lector/a si encuentra que la respuesta que encontrará al final para tales preguntas no es corta y perfectamente definida sino un tanto compleja. = = Abstract in English: Do the Public Owned Enterprises operate generally with a lower efficiency than their Private equivalents, as the topical on the matter goes? It is certainly a common place, profusely used as an unquestionable axiom, mainly from conservative political positions. Although frequently also assumed by publications, commentators or politicians that do not consider themselves to be so. Of course, It contributes to that topical statement the fact that from the dominant economic theory, the specific one “theory of the property rights” supports in its main thesis the prediction that in the case of a public owned company the person who manages it (President, CEO, or the top-managers team) will be necessarily less effective than in case of a private enterprise; mainly because the control-and-incentive system –which will be applied by the public-property representatives (Administration)- in order to assess and motivate the company’s management will be either nonexistent or very little effective. Independent of the fact that the premises on which is based such prediction can be considered that they do not hold in many cases, What in the end the observation of reality shows to us about? What says to us the empirical evidence on such a common place –regarding if the public owned enterprises (PE) are generally or “by nature” less efficient than the private ones (PR)? The objective of this work is to present and analyze the empirical evidence on the matter that has been accumulated at international scale along last decades (sections 2 and 3): I.e., those empirical studies that try to compare, using certain indicators, the efficiency level of PE with the one of PR. Which means comparative research published in academic internationally-recognized journals, or equivalent publications by economic institutions like the World Bank, the Bank of Spain, etc. It can be anticipated that, among the general conclusions derived here (set out in section 4) from the analysis of the set of available empirical studies (around 160), it highlights the following one: In most of those studies –between 2/3 and 58% of them- their authors concluded that PR enterprises of the samples under analysis presented an efficiency-indicator level better than in the case of the PE in the sample. And that in the remaining compiled studies –between 1/3 and 42%- the authors conclude that they either did not detect significant differences or that the PE in the respective sample presented better indicators of efficiency than the PR they were compared with. This therefore allows to say that the referred prediction of the ‘theory of the property rights’ regarding PE always or in generally or by nature will perform as less efficient, is not fulfilled in the reality for a significant number of cases; (hence, it can be assumed that such theory must be since time ago on the way of being reformulated –as a task in the agendas of the corresponding theoreticians). On the other hand, a more detailed analysis of the referred 160 studies –by considering just those in which it is sure that the efficiency indicator used for drawing the conclusions was not benefits-type (because its limitations for efficiency measures, here discussed), allows to add that the above proportion (2/3 - 1/3) happens to change to 50-50%: That is, the same number of studies concluding that PE companies were less efficient, that studies concluding they do not. The present report finalizes with a summary on the “state of the question” according to the evidence presented and discussed (point 5,1), as well with an attempt to answer some relevant questions aroused by such state of the art (point 5,2). Thus: What it makes that a certain company, like a PE, which is not managed by its proprietors (a situation which is in fact dominant also among middle and large private enterprises), be more or less efficient? Which are the conditions that make that company – be it public or private- may improve its efficiency? Or, from another perspective, which are the shortcomings that would explain a lower comparative efficiency (and whose elimination would allow the referred company to improve its efficiency)? Apologies in advance to the reader if s/he feels that the answers to such questions that s/he will find at the end are not short and clear-cut but somewhat complex.
H44|Hodnota statku kolektivní spotřeby<BR>[Value of Collective Consumption Goods]|"The goal of this paper is to develop the theoretical framework of the public goods provision. This theoretic contribution is based on the critical analysis of mainstream economics theories dealing with public goods as market failure (neoclassical economics and neoliberalism) and on the results of own economic experiment examining the ""free-riding"" behaviour in the voluntary provision of public goods. The ""free rider"" problem is one of the main reasons for government intervention in the market. However, there is an inefficiency of public decision making on public provision and financing of selected goods because of the estimating goods values (ex-post consumer utility) problem. Moreover, the results of economic experiments do not support the pure ""free rider"" theory. However, the economic experiment simulates the real public good consumption that is why this paper contains also the survey of consumers´ willingness to pay for specific public goods (public library services) in real terms based on the methodology of contingent valuation method."

H44|Community and cooperation: the evolution of cooperatives towards new models of citizens� democratic participation in public services provision|The community cooperatives that are spreading today in many parts of the world are the arrival point of an evolutionary process which has seen the progressive shift of cooperatives� focus from specific social and professional groups to society as a whole. This evolution is marked by two changes. The first was at the turn of the 19th century when there made their appearance the first community cooperatives which catered to the needs of a whole community. Among them were electric cooperatives, cooperative banks and some kinds of agricultural cooperatives. A further development relevant to the evolution of community cooperatives occurred towards the end of the last century with the enlargement of cooperatives� aims to embrace society�s benefit. From this process there emerge in total four categories of cooperatives which taken together constitute a complete classification of the cooperative universe. New community cooperatives are the off-springs of the old ones but the picture is rather confused. The term itself is relatively new and similar institutions are named differently at different times. Moreover, though having a few basic features in common, they differ much from one another and from the old ones. To take care of this we elaborate a concept of community cooperative consistent with its evolution and the classification of cooperatives we have identified. Basic elements of the concept are community goods, territory and citizenship, which are discussed extensively with reference to concrete cases. We then discuss in what new community cooperatives differ from old ones. The paper closes with a discussion of their future prospects.
H44|Imprese di Comunit� nelle Politiche di Rigenerazione Urbana: Definire ed Inquadrare il Contesto Italiano|Nel panorama europeo e italiano le imprese di comunit� si stanno affermando, sotto diverse forme istituzionali, come attore chiave in processi di rigenerazione urbana. Queste organizzazioni, di diversa natura, si distinguono per il ruolo che assumono in ambiti territoriali definiti e, tramite lo svolgimento di diverse attivit�, mirano allo sviluppo e alla rigenerazione di asset di comunit�. Il paper propone un primo inquadramento di come queste organizzazioni operano per il raggiungimento di tali obiettivi, come sviluppano i percorsi di interazione tra i diversi attori coinvolti e quali esiti in termini di politiche hanno indotto. Il contributo propone un�analisi del contesto italiano procedendo dalle organizzazioni istituzionalizzate a quelle meno formali: le cooperative di comunit�, le imprese sociali e i commons urbani legati a movimenti sociali.
H44|Klimaanpassung als wirtschaftspolitisches Handlungsfeld|Die wirtschaftspolitischen Implikationen der Klimaanpassung sind entscheidend für die Ausgestaltung einer eigenständigen Klimaanpassungspolitik und geben gleichzeitig wichtige Anreize zu politischem Handeln. Dieses Papier diskutiert daher eine mögliche wirtschaftspolitische Ausrichtung der Klimaanpassungspolitik. Hierzu werden die ökonomisch legitimierten Eingriffsbereiche des Staates in der Klimaanpassungspolitik definiert. Diese liegen vor allem in der Beseitigung von Ineffizienzen bei privater und staatlicher Anpassung aufgrund verschiedener Marktversagen und Barrieren, aber auch die Gewährleistung von Verteilungsgerechtigkeit und Versorgungssicherheit legitimieren staatliche Eingriffe. Basierend auf der Einordnung von Klimaanpassung in die Systematik der Wirtschaftspolitiktheorie, werden zudem die wirtschaftspolitischen Ziele und Instrumente der Klimaanpassungspolitik ausgearbeitet.
