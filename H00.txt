H00|On Event Study Designs and Distributed-Lag Models: Equivalence, Generalization and Practical Implications|We discuss important features and pitfalls of panel-data event study designs. We derive the following main results: First, event study designs and distributed-lag models are numerically identical leading to the same parameter estimates after correct reparametrization. Second, binning of effect window endpoints allows identification of dynamic treatment effects even when no never-treated units are present. Third, classic dummy variable event study designs can be naturally generalized to models that account for multiple events of different sign and intensity of the treatment, which are particularly interesting for research in labor economics and public finance.
H00|Compliance effects of sovereign debt cuts|The controversy about sovereign debt cuts loomed prominently throughout crisis in the European Union (EU), as the EU legal rules were viewed to impose strict limitations on debt restructuring involving public creditors due to moral hazard concerns enshrined in the legal ban on bailouts. This analysis explores the economic plausibility of the legal regime, with the applicable legal standard capturing the impact of debt restructuring on the debtor’s expected compliance with fiscal rules. Our theory shows that the effect of debt cuts on fiscal compliance depends on three effects, the direction of which determines the overall effect on expected fiscal compliance. We empirically review the plausibility of our theoretical results by exploiting survey data from members of state parliaments in Germany. Data limitations notwithstanding, our results offer some plausibility that haircuts can make fiscal compliance more attractive and likely.
H00|Identity, Beliefs, and Political Confl ict|We present a theory of identity politics that builds on two ideas. First, voters identify with the social group whose interests are closest to theirs and that features the strongest policy con ict with outgroups. Second, identification causes voters to slant their beliefs toward the group's distinctive opinion. The theory yields two main implications: i) voters' beliefs are polarized and distorted along group boundaries; ii) economic shocks that induce new cleavages to emerge also bring about large changes in beliefs and preferences across many policy issues. In particular, exposure to globalization or cultural changes may induce voters to switch identities, dampening their demand for redistribution and exacerbating con icts in other social dimensions. We show that survey evidence is consistent with these implications.
H00|Fiscal Performance of Minority Governments: New Empirical Evidence for OECD Countries|I use new data on central and general governments for 23 OECD countries over the period 1960-2015 (unbalanced panel) to examine fiscal performance under minority governments. The results do not suggest that minority governments had higher fiscal deficits and public expenditure than majority governments – corroborating many previous studies. An innovation of my study is to examine fiscal policies of minority governments that enjoy organized support of opposition parties. The results do not show that minority governments that enjoy organized support of opposition parties increased public expenditure to a larger extent than majority governments. If anything, fiscal deficits were somewhat higher under single-party minority governments with organized support of opposition parties than under majority governments especially. Minority and majority governments had quite similar fiscal performance in OECD countries.
H00|Projective Paternalism|We study experimentally when, why, and how people intervene in others’ choices. Choice Architects (CAs) construct opportunity sets containing bundles of time-indexed payments for Choosers. CAs frequently prevent impatient choices despite opportunities to provide advice, believing Choosers benefit. We consider several hypotheses concerning CAs’ motives. A conventional behavioral welfarist acts as a correctly informed social planner; a mistakes-projective paternalist removes options she wishes she could reject when choosing for herself; an ideals-projective paternalist seeks to align others’ choices with her own aspirations. Ideals-projective paternalism provides the best explanation for interventions in the laboratory and rationalizes support for actual paternalistic policies.
H00|Does Eviction Cause Poverty? Quasi-Experimental Evidence from Cook County, IL|Each year, more than two million U.S. households have an eviction case filed against them. Many cities have recently implemented policies aimed at reducing the number of evictions, motivated by research showing strong associations between being evicted and subsequent adverse economic outcomes. Yet it is difiicult to determine to what extent those associations represent causal relationships, because eviction itself is likely to be a consequence of adverse life events. This paper addresses that challenge and offers new causal evidence on how eviction affects financial distress, residential mobility, and neighborhood quality. We collect the near-universe of Cook County court records over a period of seventeen years, and link these records to credit bureau and payday loans data. Using this data, we characterize the trajectory of financial strain in the run-up and aftermath of eviction court for both evicted and non-evicted households, finding high levels and striking increases in financial strain in the years before an eviction case is filed. Guided by this descriptive evidence, we employ two approaches to draw causal inference on the effect of eviction. The first takes advantage of the panel data through a difference-in-differences design. The second is an instrumental variables strategy, relying on the fact that court cases are randomly assigned to judges of varying leniency. We find that eviction negatively impacts credit access and durable consumption for several years. However, the effects are small relative to the financial strain experienced by both evicted and non-evicted tenants in the run-up to an eviction flling.

H00|UDAY Power Debt in Retrospect and Prospects: Analyzing the Efficiency Parameters|"The Government of India launched the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY), in November 2015, with an objective of ""Power for All"". Under the UDAY scheme, selected States agreed to convert 75 per cent of the DISCOM's (State Power Distribution Companies) power debt into State government non-SLR bonds, priced at not more than 75 basis points above the prevailing cut-off yield rate of govern-ment security of 10-year maturity. At aggregate level, so far, around 86 per cent of UDAY bonds have been issued - Rs. 2.32 lakh crores out of Rs. 2.69 lakh crores - across all UDAY States/UTs. Our estimates reveal that the financial and operational efficiency parameters envisaged in UDAY tripartite MoUs - between DISCOMs, the State Governments and the Ministry of Power, Government of India - have not been met by many States. Using UDAY portal data, we find that the average AT C (Aggre-gate Technical and Commercial) losses that should have been implemented in states -due to political econmy reasons - and the operational parameters in our analysis indicate widening inefficiencies across States in power infrastructure."
H00|Impact of Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers on Gender Equality in India: An Empirical Analysis|Intergovernmental fiscal transfers (IGFT) are, in theory, neither good nor bad for tackling gender inequalities. Fiscal federalism with asymmetry in revenue and expenditure assignments inevitably leads to vertical and horizontal imbalances in public service provisioning. Intergovernmental transfers can play a role in equalization of fis-cal capacities because the states of India have different tax raising capacities and ca-pacities for funding public expenditure. Do higher per capita fiscal transfers help in reducing gender inequalities across states in India? Using data from the Finance Accounts of various states, we analyse the impact of fiscal transfers - both conditional and unconditional fiscal transfers - on the gender parity index in education, using panel data models. We find that unconditional transfers have a significant and positive impact on gender parity outcomes in the education sector at the primary and secondary levels, in contrast to tied transfers. The models also control for gender budgeting initiatives across states and find that gender budgeting has a beneficial effect on education equality. The policy implication of these results for the recently constituted Fifteenth Finance Commission in India is to strengthen the gender equality criteria in intergovernmental transfers in India.
H00|The Political Economy of Gender Budgeting: Empirical Evidence from India|Gender budgeting is a public policy innovation to transform the gender commit-ments into budgetary commitments. The political economy process of gender budget-ing in India has encompassed four distinct phases - innovative knowledge networking, building institutional structures, reinforcing state capacity and strengthening the ac-countability mechanisms. Against these policy processes, we have estimated the sec-tor-wise quantum of gender budgeting in India emphasising the statistical invisibility of care economy. The State-wise equally distributed equavalent (Xede) estimates of gen-der development showed that Kerala tops the scale 0-1 scoring 0.72. Though the link between gender budgeting and these Xede scores is beyond the scope of the paper, the fiscal marksmanship of gender budgeting showed a mixed scenario across sectors. The fiscal marksmanship of gender budgeting showed an upward bias in the errors in the projections relate to education, social justice empowerment and health, and down-ward bias in agriculture, petroleum and natural gas. These deviations between BE and RE in gender budgeting has significant policy implications for better state capacity and governance.
H00|Inequality of opportunity in education: Accounting for the contributions of Sibs, schools and sorting across East Africa|Inequalities in the opportunity to obtain a good education in low-income countries are widely understood to be related to household resources and schooling quality. Yet, to date, most researchers have investigated the contributions of these two factors separately. This paper considers them jointly, paying special attention to their covariation, which indicates whether schools exacerbate or compensate for existing household-based inequalities. The paper develops a new variance decomposition framework and applies it to data on more than one million children in three low-income East African countries. The empirical results show that although household factors account for a significant share of total test score variation, variation in school quality and positive sorting between households and schools are, together, no less important. The analysis also finds evidence of substantial geographical heterogeneity in schooling quality. The paper concludes that promoting equity in education in East Africa requires policies that go beyond raising average school quality and should attend to the distribution of school quality as well as assortative matching between households and schools.
H00|Tax system reform and the merits of the 1970 scheme|The present form of levy, as regards direct taxation, is quite imperfect. In fact. direct taxation is on distributed personal incomes; its personality implies defining a place of residence for the perceiver; residents of a country are hit on their worldwide basis. These are the general principles. The revenue of a nation is the sum of internal revenue (from the national basis) and of external revenue (from the foreign basis). Progressivity leads to their being strictly linked. Of course this is the rule for every nation. Since assessment can be conducted only internally, this leads to a general disorder, which compels nations to integrate their fiscal systems. This constriction soon leads to a single destination of revenue within an integrated administration. The functions of expenditure nevertheless are mainly national. This compels huge transfers from the point of collection of revenue, to single nations. The structure so depicted is in part avoided in Europe, because there are exceptions to the principles. Some of these exceptions are: incorporated firms pay not on the basis of distributed incomes, but on produced incomes (profits), at a proportional rate; many less developed countries apply the principle of produced incomes and proportionality also to other incomes beyond profits; taxation on distributed profits and on capital gains is decreasing as a rate (the one on capital gains is hardly effective); financial capital is subtracted in many countries to progressivity. This, if we add the circumstance that every nation normally subjects all internal incomes to withdrawal, and that international treaties pose remedies to such a situation which are necessarily partial, gives some idea of the total confusion with which direct taxation is now confronted. Such confusion is partially extended to indirect taxation, dominated by a tax, VAT, in which the imposable base is not directly revealed. The previous fiscal system, based as regards direct taxation on produced incomes (and therefore at proportional levy), and as regards indirect taxation on all produced goods and not only on consumption, was much more appropriate. The problem is how to try to take the best advantage of past experiences, by adding progressivity, the only “result” of recent times. It is shown that this is possible, taking advantage of the new economy: progressivity can operate within social contributions, which are national; national incomes may be effected by different rates; especially high rates may hit capital gains and the interest rate, on the side of production; a small rate may regard B to B transactions. A synthesis can then be achieved.
H00|Overstrained Citizens? The Number of Ballot Propositions and the Quality of the Decision Process in Direct Democracy|We study how the number of ballot propositions affects the quality of decision making in direct democracy, as reflected in citizens' knowledge, voting behavior, and attitudes toward democracy. Using three comprehensive data sets from Switzerland with over 3,500 propositions, we exploit variation in the number of federal and cantonal propositions. Voters know the most about the content of federal propositions when they are exclusively presented and less with a high number of concurrent cantonal propositions on the ballot. Across other outcomes we find no consistent indications that â€“ for the observed variation in the exposure to popular votes â€“ a high number of propositions impedes the quality of decision making in Swiss federal direct democracy. In the medium to longer term, more federal propositions on the ballot rather relate to higher perceived political influence and satisfaction with democracy.
H00|Macroeconomic Policy Effectiveness and Inequality: Efficacy of Gender Budgeting in Asia Pacific|Gender budgeting is a fiscal approach that seeks to use a country's national and/or local budget(s) to reduce inequality and promote economic growth and equitable development. While the literature has explored the connection between reducing gender inequality and achieving growth and equitable development, more empirical analysis is needed on whether gender budgeting reduces gender inequality. Our study follows the methodology of Stotsky and Zaman (2016) to investigate the impact of gender budgeting on promoting gender equality across Asia Pacific countries. The study classifies Asia Pacific countries as gender budgeting or non-gender budgeting according to whether they have formalized gender budgeting initiatives in laws and/or budget call circulars. To measure the effect of gender budgeting on reducing inequality, we measure the correlation between gender budgeting and the Gender Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Inequality Index (GII) scores in each country. The data for our gender inequality variables are mainly drawn from the IMF database on gender indicators and the World Development Indicators database over the 1990-2013 period. Our results show that gender budgeting has a significant effect on increasing the GDI and a small but significant potential to reduce the GII, strengthening the rationale for employing gender budgeting to promote inclusive development. However, our empirical results show no prioritization of gender budgeting in the fiscal space of health and education sectors in the region.

H00|Transition Finance Country Study Viet Nam: On the threshold of transition|Based on the “ABC” approach targeted to assess all available sources of financing (official development finance, private investment, domestic resources, and remittances), the Viet Nam country pilot study explores the challenges of transition finance in a middle-income country in the Asia-Pacific region. After launching a series of successful reforms beginning in the late 1980s, Viet Nam has undergone an impressive transformation, which turned the country from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy and from a low-income to a lower middle-income country. At the same time, Viet Nam is moving from a relatively high reliance on ODA and other external sources towards non-concessional sources and domestic sources. Through evolving partnerships, development partners can align their support with newly arising needs, actively supporting Viet Nam overcome the middle-income trap and move towards a trajectory for more sustainable development.
H00|Does the Left Spend More?|This study provides a quantitative review of the empirical literature on partisan politics. Given the voluminous work on this subject, we focus on the relationship between government ideology and public spending. By exploiting a dataset of 800 estimates from papers published between 1992 and 2018, we conduct a meta-analysis. Taking into account the differences in the various categories of spending, proxies of ideologies, estimations methods, as well as, data and publication characteristics, we conclude that more left-wing governments do spend more, although the effect tends to weaken over time.

H00|Solving the Grid-Connected Microgrid Operation by JAYA Algorithm|This paper aims to investigate the optimal operation of grid-connected microgrids (MG). In the grid-connected mode, the MG can connect to the main utility and also can exchange energy with the main grid. This potential can lead to higher reliability and less operation cost. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed model, it is tested on a modified IEEE 33 bus test system.
H00|Problematics in Development and Management of Money Affairs (Cash Affairs) in Indonesia|This article explains the problems in the development and management of cash waqf in Indonesia. Cash waqf by people, groups of people, and institutions or legal entities in the form of cash. Waqf cash is still debated among scholars whether it is legal or not, and managing cash waqf professionally is still a discourse and not many people or institutions can accept such waqf models. This article also discusses understanding, legal basis, problematics, management and solutions. Also discussed about cash waqf as the basis for community economic development by opening up Muslim rigidity to cash waqf, as well as the economic prospects of waqf property. The potential of waqf is one of the instruments of economic empowerment for Muslims even though management in Indonesia is still not good. But seen from the number, waqf property in Indonesia is quite large. Money waqf has played an important role as one of the new Islamic fiscal instruments in the economy. Money waqf has two functions as a means of worship and the achievement of social welfare. This article tries to explore how the problems in developing money waqf management such as the way it is distributed and its circulation and how the waqf is able to have a good impact on the surrounding community.
H00|Different approaches and measures of fiscal decentralisation|Once the phenomenon of fiscal decentralisation was appropriately operationalised and measured, it has become evident that not many countries had absolutely self-financing sub-national governments. The evidence shows that, in many developed countries, fiscal decentralisation has occurred almost exclusively through devolution of expenditure activities, while a large part of the regional and local government expenditures is funded primarily by intergovernmental grants, revenue-sharing programs, or other centrally controlled funds. Measurement-wise, this suggests that taxes should be refined in terms of the degree of autonomy they provide to sub-national governments. In the relevant empirical studies, it is a common practice to use accounting measures of either revenue or spending shares for sub-national relative to general government as a proxy for fiscal decentralisation. However, those two accounting measures may not capture accurately the phenomenon of fiscal decentralisation. The two standard sources of data for fiscal decentralisation have been the IMF?s Government Finance Statistics (GFS) where the intergovernmental fiscal structure of countries is not captured properly and OECD?s measure of revenue decentralisation where taxes are classified in terms of the degree of autonomy they provide to sub-national governments. As an improved measure of revenue decentralisation, Stegarescu (2005) constructs an appropriate measure of fiscal decentralisation; namely, ?purified? sub-national own-source revenues as a share of total government revenues. The main aim of this paper is to compare in details the above mentioned measures of fiscal decentralisation, and evaluate the bias in the accounting measures compared to a ?purified? measure that accounts for the real fiscal autonomy of sub-national governments by comparing the results gained through estimation of the government sector size model using the pooled mean group (PMG) estimation approach.
H00|Financing metropolitan government in Beijing City|Beijing is one of the most populous cities in the world, and its economy is still growing rapidly. It has the peculiar status of being both a province and a metropolitan city government, and it is home to the national capital. Both of these features challenge its expenditure demands and its finances. In this paper we explore the governance, service delivery and financing of the Beijing metropolitan area government. The basic question we ask is the extent to which Beijing City captures some of the advantages of being a metropolitan areawide government, and the extent to which it avoids some of the disadvantages. In particular, we are interested in whether metropolitan governance can lead to a higher rate of revenue mobilization at the local government level. Is there a next step that cities like Beijing might take to improve their fiscal position, and what can other countries learn from the Chinese experience with metropolitan government finance?
H00|Measuring the statistical capacity of nations|The international development community has used the World Bank’s Statistical Capacity Index since its inception in 2004. The Sustainable Development Goals create new challenges for national statistical systems to produce high-quality and internationally comparable data.

The paper illustrates the properties of the updated index with global data from 2016.
H00|Government ideology and economic policy-making in the United States—a survey|Abstract This paper describes the influence of government ideology on economic policy-making in the United States. I review studies using data for the national, state and local levels and elaborate on checks and balances, especially divided government, measurement of government ideology and empirical strategies to identify causal effects. Many studies conclude that parties do matter in the United States. Democratic presidents generate, for example, higher rates of economic growth than Republican presidents, but these studies using data for the national level do not identify causal effects. Ideology-induced policies are prevalent at the state level: Democratic governors implement somewhat more expansionary and liberal policies than Republican governors. At the local level, government ideology hardly influences economic policy-making at all. How growing political polarization and demographic change will influence the effects of government ideology on economic policy-making will be an important issue for future research.
H00|Electoral Systems and Inequalities in Government Interventions|This paper studies the political determinants of inequality in government interventions under the majoritarian and proportional representation systems. Using a model of electoral competition with targetable government intervention and heterogeneous localities, we uncover a novel relative electoral sensitivity effect in majoritarian systems. This effect, which depends on the geographic distribution of voters, can incentivize parties to allocate resources more equally under majoritarian systems than proportional representation systems. This contrasts with the conventional wisdom that government interventions are more unequal in majoritarian systems.

H00|Fiscal Policy Effectiveness and Inequality: Efficacy of Gender Budgeting in Asia Pacific|Gender budgeting is a fiscal approach that seeks to use a country's national and/or local budget(s) to reduce inequality and promote economic growth and equitable development. While literature has explored the connection between reducing gender inequality and achieving growth and equitable development, more empirical analysis is needed to determine whether gender budgeting really curbs gender inequality. Our study follows the methodology of Stotsky and Zaman (2016) to investigate across Asia Pacific countries the impact of gender budgeting on promoting gender equality, and also increasing fiscal spending on health and education. The study classifies Asia Pacific countries as `gender budgeting' or `non-gender budgeting' according to whether they have formalized gender budgeting initiatives in laws and/or budget call circulars. To measure the effect of gender budgeting on reducing inequality, we measure the correlation between gender budgeting and the Gender Development Index (GDI) and Gender Inequality Index (GII) scores in each country. The data for our gender inequality variables are mainly drawn from the IMF Database on gender indicators and the World Development Indicators (WDI) database, over 1990-2013. Our results show that gender budgeting has significant effect on increasing GDI and small but significant potential to reduce GII. These results strengthen the rationale for employing gender budgeting to promote inclusive development. However, our empirical results show no prioritization for gender budgeting in the fiscal space of health and education sectors in the region.
H00|Transition Finance Challenges for Commodity-based Least Developed Countries: The example of Zambia|The Zambia country pilot study was conducted by the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) to explore the challenges of transition finance for a commodity-based Least Developed Country (LDC). In particular, debt sustainability concerns are viewed within the context of the shifting financing for sustainable development landscape of Zambia following its re-classification to Lower Middle Income Category (LMIC).In line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA), the pilot study proposes a new “ABC” approach targeted to assess all available sources of financing (official development finance, private investment, domestic resources, and remittances), identify emerging SDG financing gaps and promote better alignment of resources with national financing for sustainable development strategies.
H00|Health status, mental health and air quality: evidence from pensioners in Europe|Environmental quality is an important determinant of individuals’ well-being and one of the main concerns of the governments is the improvement on air quality and the protection of public health. This is especially the case of sensitive demographic groups, such as the old aged people. However, the question this study attempts to answer is how do individuals value the effects on the environment. The study explores the effects of old and early public pension schemes, as well as the impact of air pollution on health status of retired citizens. The empirical analysis relies on detailed micro-level data derived from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). As proxies for health, we use the general health status and the Eurod mental health indicator.We examine two air pollutants: the sulphur dioxide (SO2) and ground-level ozone (O3). Next, we calculate the marginal willingness-to-pay (MWTP) which shows how much the people are willing to pay for improvement in air quality. We apply various quantitative techniques and approaches, including the fixed effects ordinary least squares (OLS) and the fixed effects instrumental variables (IV) approach. The last approach is applied to reduce the endogeneity problem coming from possible reverse causality between the air pollution, pensions and the health outcomes. For robustness check, we apply also a structural equation modelling (SEM) which is proper when the outcomes are latent variables. Based on our favoured IV estimates and the health status, we find that the MWTP values for one unit decrease in SO2 and O3 are respectively €221 and €88 per year. The respectiveMWTP values using the Eurod measure are €155 and €68. Overall, improvement of health status implies reduction in health expenditures, and in previous literature, ageing has been traditionally considered the most important determinant. However, this study shows that health lifestyle and socio-economic status, such as education and marital status, are more important, and furthermore, air pollution cannot be ignored in the agenda of policy makers.
H00|Digital Government: ICT and Public Sector Management in Africa|This study examines the effect of information and communication technologies (ICT) on public sector management in Africa for the period 1995–2015 using panel GMM model and Toda-Yamamoto causality tests. The empirical evidence shows that ICT has a positive and statistically significant effect on public sector management, meaning that an increase in ICT is associated with improved public sector management. There is also a bi-directional causality between ICT and public sector management, suggesting that ICT spurs public sector management which, in turn, spurs ICT even further. The public sector, civil society and international actors therefore have the responsibility to collaborate at developing policies and applications that will maximize the potentials of digital government to every level of public sector in Africa.
H00|Determinants of Public–Private Partnerships in Infrastructure in Asia: Implications for Capital Market Development|In this study, we attempt to understand the role of greater access to finance, i.e., stocks, bonds, and bank loans, in public–private partnership (PPP) investment in developing countries. Most developing countries still depend heavily on fiscal financing for infrastructure projects. Our empirical results reconfirm the fact that banks remain the major source of finance for infrastructure projects. The domestic bond market should be further developed to have depth and liquidity enough to provide longterm funding for private sector investors. Interestingly, we find a negative impact of bond market development on PPP investment. A possible interpretation is that financing through government bonds, which dominates bond markets in developing countries, discourages private sector participation by reducing financing access to the corporate bond market. Our evidence underlines the importance of a well-functioning corporate bond market in developing countries, which can offer long-term financing to private sector participation in infrastructure investments.
H00|Determinant of Income Inequality in Indonesia: Study Case 33 Provinces in 2011-2016|This study intends to determine whether factors of income inequality in Indonesia based on regional data. Economic growth, unemployment, and inflation represent macroeconomic factors, whereas regional expenditure is deemed as a factor of the fiscal side. In the term of the financial, the study used the share of tradable sector credit to the total credit of commercial bank. By applying, the fixed effect panel framework, the study concluded that the factors of the macroeconomic and credit impact on income inequality, while the regional expenditure is not significant. However, the study also found that the impact of economic growth on inequality is positive which is different from previous studies. This suggests that the impact of economic growth tend to serve more middle and upper-income groups than lower income. Furthermore, the regional expenditure is mainly dominated by the personnel expenditure that has limited impact on income inequality. In addition, the disbursement of capital budgets is relatively low for roads, irrigation, and networking.
H00|On the Quest for Value in the Public Sector Management and its Implications|This paper seeks to draw the attention to a peculiar, complex and interesting issue: the search for value in the public organizations? management. Thus, after a brief reference to the classical theme of creation and measurement of the general economic-financial value for (Business / Private) firms, it focuses on the more insidious and much less quantitative argument of the generation and management of Public value. Public value is the equivalent (though modified) of shareholder value (SHV) in public management with special features. A first model internationally diffused in public sector studies is representable by means of the Strategic Triangle; whose angles are: 1) Vision (value); 2) Legitimacy & support; 3) Operational capability of the public organization. A second model concerns more directly the first, highest, angle (that is now zoomed and founded upon resources and competencies): the value created for citizens through public services above all as mission. The building blocks and the outcomes & metrics developments are the elements that constitute a PSV (Public Service Value) scheme. A comparative analysis per stages is essential for our purpose: starting firstly from Public Administration (1: traditional model), secondly to New Public Management (2: NPM, denoting policies aimed to modernize and render more effective the public sector), we may arrive finally to the New Public Service stage (3: NPS, which is coherent with a networked public governance vision). Such an evolution implies a transition from a technical government to a wider and flexible governance philosophy in the ambit of a renewed value&performance-oriented public sector, which is willing to adopt qualitative principles and where individual employees are free and stimulated to pursue and propose new ideas about how to improve the working of the organization, in terms of efficiency or services. In sum, the quest for public value is the next and urgent challenge for public sector at its various levels: consequently, it will deserve more attention by both policy-makers (central and local public administrators) and researchers. For this purpose, it would be appropriate to come to a kind of public value scorecard aimed at the rational estimate of the expected, or realized, public value created time after time.At a more analytical-quantitative level, interesting would appear the inter-institutional search for a correlation between the public management value (ie, the value of public administrations) and the value of private institutions that ultimately benefit, with the individuals, from public goods and services.
H00|Constitutional rules as determinants of social infrastructure|A sizable literature has established the positive impact of social infrastructure on economic development, but the determinants of social infrastructure itself have yet to be fully explored. Competing theories suggest a variety of political institutions as driving forces of social infrastructure, but the empirical literature has been hampered by the small set of available proxies, many of which are broadly defined. We leverage a new, comprehensive dataset that codes political institutions directly from countries’ constitutions. By employing a statistical methodology that is designed to juxtapose candidate regressors associated with many competing theories, we test each individual political institution's effect on social infrastructure. Our results show that constitutional rules pertaining to executive constraints as well as to the structure of electoral systems are crucial for the development of high-quality social infrastructure. We also find that the determinants of social infrastructure are much more fundamental than previously thought: not only the general structure of electoral systems matter, but also highly detailed aspects such as limits on campaign contributions and the freedom to form parties. Moreover, the granularity of our data allows us to highlight the profound effect of basic human rights on social infrastructure, a dimension which has not been explored in the literature to date.
H00|Cross-category spillovers of economic policy uncertainty|This paper analyses the interdependence of policy uncertainty from 1985 to 2017 across six different categories of US economic policy: Monetary, fiscal, healthcare, national security, regulatory, and trade policy. To this end, we apply the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012, 2014) connectedness index methodology to the newspaper-based uncertainty indices developed by Baker et al. (2016). We find that, in total, the category-specific uncertainties are indeed closely interrelated. However, some policy categories are strong net transmitters of uncertainty spillovers (e.g. fiscal policy), while others show only a low degree of average connectedness and are predominantly net receivers (e.g. trade policy). A modified rolling-window approach further reveals that the intensity and direction of spillovers change significantly over time. The total connectedness index not only shows strong bursts related to certain events, but also exhibits a positive long-run trend. The latter is particularly driven by an increasing average connectedness of both healthcare and regulatory policy uncertainty. Finally, we highlight the different characteristics of the uncertainty network across presidential administrations, as well as before and after the most recent election.
H00|Democracy and Governance|The purpose of the paper is to show that the nature of the relationship between governance and democracy varies depending on how the two terms (of a political discourse) are defined, that when the definition of one term encompasses distinctive features of the other we find that governance and democracy are not just mutually reinforcing but even overlapping, that only when we distinguish on theoretical ground governance from democracy we create the basis for analyzing their relationship on empirical grounds exactly as Fukuyama had suggested.

H00|Overstrained Citizens?|We study how the number of ballot propositions affects the quality of decision making in direct democracy, as reflected in citizens’ knowledge, voting behavior, and attitudes toward democracy. Using three comprehensive data sets from Switzerland with over 3,500 propositions, we exploit variation in the number of federal propositions and plausibly exogenous variation in the number of cantonal propositions. Only with a relatively high number of propositions on the ballot do voters have less knowledge about federal propositions. Otherwise, we find no indication that the number of ballot propositions impedes the quality of decision making in direct democracy. For instance, a higher number of propositions does not lead more voters to support proposals endorsed by pole parties. If anything, having more federal propositions on the ballot relates to higher perceived political influence and satisfaction with democracy.
H00|Informe del gasto del gobierno de Colombia en lucha antidrogas 2013 - 2015. Informe final|El objetivo de este documento es responder a la siguiente pregunta: ¿Cuánto gasta el Estado colombiano en la lucha contra las drogas? La respuesta corta es que, excluyendo el gasto en seguridad y defensa, el Estado colombiano gastó en 2015 $970.480 millones de pesos en la lucha contra las drogas. En 2013 esa cifra fue de $1.174.651 millones y en 2014 de $1.140.019 millones. ¿Por qué es relevante responder a esta pregunta? Básicamente por dos razones: la primera es que se trata de un gasto importante, equivalente al 0,5% del gasto general de la Nación. La segunda es que la cifra hace parte del informe de seguimiento que periódicamente se remite al congreso de Estados Unidos y del cual depende en gran medida la aprobación de recursos de cooperación para Colombia.
H00|The Welfare State besides Globalization Forces|In this paper we review of literature and offer historical, empirical and analytical explanation for the interactions between the welfare state and globalization driving forces. Globalization – a widespread contemporaneous phenomenon – generates international tax competition. The consequent erosion in the tax base, especially on capital, is another blow to the finances of the welfare state. Financial globalization facilitates reallocation of capital across borders. The increased mobility of capital may likely to trigger a race-to-the-bottom tax competition. The consequent erosion in the tax base, especially on capital, is potentially a blow to the fiscal finance backing up the far-reaching redistribution of income by the typical welfare state. Another major aspect of globalization, low skill migration, attracted to the welfare state may put additional strain on it. An aging welfare-state – a common contemporary phenomenon in many industrial countries calls for young and high skill immigrants for its survival.
H00|Towards Transnational European Democracy? The New Battles Lines of the 2019 European Parliament Election|The EU’s political system has never caught up with the impact European integration has had on citizens’ daily lives. EU citizens still vote in the European Parliament elections on different dates, according to different electoral laws, and in support of candidates selected by national parties and on the basis of domestic agendas. Yet this is set to change. With less than a year to go before the European Parliament elections, the EU political landscape is about to undergo a deep and historical shake-up. While populists are poised to disrupt the Parliament, a new wave of little-noticed transnational parties is emerging from the bottom-up. They both threaten established, mainstream political parties that have historically hold a monopoly of the European ‘project’. This paper traces their genesis, evolution and raison d'être before identifying their major features and political prospect.
H00|How Much has Wealth Concentration Grown in the United States? A Re-Examination of Data from 2001-2013|Well known research based on capitalized income tax data shows robust growth in wealth concentration in the late 2000s. We show that these robust growth estimates rely on an assumption---homogeneous rates of return across the wealth distribution---that is not supported by data. When the capitalization model incorporates heterogeneous rates of return (on just interest-bearing assets), wealth concentration estimates in 2011 fall from 40.5% to 33.9%. These estimates are consistent in levels and trend with other micro wealth data and show that wealth concentration increases until the Great Recession, then declines before increasing again.
H00|Electoral Systems and Inequalities in Government Interventions|This paper studies the political determinants of inequality in government interventions under the majoritarian and proportional representation systems. Using a model of electoral competition with targetable government intervention and heterogeneous localities, we uncover a novel relative electoral sensitivity effect in majoritarian systems. This effect, which depends on the geographic distribution of voters, can incentivize parties to allocate resources more equally under majoritarian systems than proportional representation systems. This contrasts with the conventional wisdom that government interventions are more unequal in majoritarian systems.
H00|Identity, Beliefs, and Political Conflict|We present a theory of identity politics that builds on two ideas. First, voters identify with the social group whose interests are closest to theirs and that features the strongest policy conflict with outgroups. Second, identification causes voters to slant their beliefs toward the group's distinctive opinion. The theory yields two main implications: i) voters' beliefs are polarized and distorted along group boundaries; ii) economic shocks that induce new cleavages to emerge also bring about large changes in beliefs and preferences across many policy issues. In particular, exposure to globalization or cultural changes may induce voters to switch identities, dampening their demand for redistribution and exacerbating conflicts in other social dimensions. We show that survey evidence is consistent with these implications.
H00|Skating on thin evidence: Implications for public policy|Good public policy needs to be evidence based. However, the evidence base is thin for many policy issues. How can policy makers best respond to such thin areas of research that are also quite likely to change over time? Our survey investigates the evolution of the econometric evidence base for 101 economic issues, drawing upon 42,578 effect sizes (mainly elasticities and correlations) from 4300 econometric studies. We evaluate the performance of six approaches to early research assessment: the simple unweighted mean; the median; the Paldam, “divide by 2” rule of thumb; the unrestricted weighted least squares (WLS) weighted average; the PET-PEESE meta-regression correction for publication bias; the weighted average of the adequately powered (WAAP); and WAAP-WLS. Lowest prediction errors are found in the Paldam rule of thumb and WLS. WLS typically reduces the initial exaggeration of thin evidence by half.
H00|Measuring Party System Change: A Systems Perspective|The term â€˜party systemâ€™, explained Giovanni Sartori, refers to the pattern of interactions among major parties. That pattern can be represented as a type and treated as a proper unit of analysis. When â€˜party systemâ€™ is defined in this way, it becomes clear that the scholarship lacks a direct measure of â€˜party system changeâ€™. The Sartori approach to party system change is not the only legitimate way to understand this concept, but it does target an undoubtedly important feature of political systemsâ€”namely, the stability of major-party interactions. This article develops a new indicator, the index of fluidity, which measures the extent of such stability. Applying the index to Africa, we show there is significant cross-national variation in fluidity and weak correlation between fluidity and (Pedersen) volatility.
H00|Party System Change and the Quality of Democracy in East Africa|The purpose of this paper is to explore in greater detail the nexus between party system change and democratic qualities. In doing so, we do not simply assess whether, how and to what extent qualities of democracy in East Africa are affected by the instability of the patterns of inter-party competition (fluidity of the party system), but we also plan to show how the sub-components of party system fluidity (frequency of change, scope of change, variety of change) influence the democratic qualities. By disaggregating fluidity in its constitutive elements and by testing how each of them affects the qualities of democracy, we find that while the frequency of change has a beneficial impact on the qualities of democracy, the other sub-components of fluidityâ€”namely, the â€œscopeâ€ and â€œvarietyâ€ of system changeâ€”have a consistently negative effect on democratic quality.

H00|Tony Atkinson and his Legacy|Tony Atkinson is universally celebrated for his outstanding contributions to the measurement and analysis of inequality, but he never saw the study of inequality as a separate branch of economics. He was an economist in the classical sense, rejecting any sub-field labelling of his interests and expertise, and he made contributions right across economics. His death on 1 January 2017 deprived the world of both an intellectual giant and a deeply committed public servant in the broadest sense of the term. This collective tribute highlights the range, depth and importance of Tony's enormous legacy, the product of over fifty years' work.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H00|Potterian Economics|Recent studies in psychology and neuroscience find that fictional works exert strong influence on readers and shape their opinions and worldviews. We study the Potterian economy, which we compare to economic models, to assess how Harry Potter books affect economic literacy. We find that some principles of Potterian economics are consistent with economistsâ€™ models. Many others, however, are distorted and contain numerous inaccuracies, which contradict professional economistsâ€™ views and insights, and contribute to the general publicâ€™s biases, ignorance, and lack of understanding of economics.
H00|Government Ideology and Economic Policy-Making in the United States|This paper describes the role of government ideology on economic policy-making in the United States. I consider studies using data for the national, state and local level and elaborate on checks and balances, especially divided government, measurement of government ideology and empirical strategies to identify causal effects. Many studies conclude that parties do matter in the United States. Democratic presidents generate, for example, higher economic growth than Republican presidents, but these studies using data for the national level do not derive causal effects. Ideology-induced policies are prevalent at the state level: Democratic governors implement somewhat more expansionary and liberal policies than Republican governors. At the local level, government ideology hardly influences economic policymaking. How increasing political polarization and demographic change will influence the role of government ideology on economic policy-making will be an important issue for future research.
H00|Rent Seeking: The Social Cost of Contestable Benefits|A major contribution of the public-choice school is the recognition by Gordon Tullock that contestable rents give rise to social losses because of unproductive resource use. Contestable rents usually are politically assigned privileges. Contestable rents can also be found outside of government decisions. We describe the example of rents in academia in different cultures. The primary empirical question regarding rent seeking concerns the magnitude of the social loss from the contesting of rents. Direct measurement is impeded by lack of data and indeed denial that rent seeking took place. Contest models provide guidance regarding social losses. We provide a generalized contest model. Social losses from rent seeking are diminished in high-income democracies because rent seeking usually takes place by groups seeking ‘public good’ benefits. Rents are also less visible in democracies, because political accountability requires that rents be assigned in indirect non-transparent ways. These restraints are not present in autocracies, where rent seeking is also facilitated by corruption and by the need to influence a smaller number of decision makers. Ideology can influence whether rent seeking is recognized to exist.
H00|The Democratic-Republican Presidential Growth Gap and the Partisan Balance of the State Governments|Higher economic growth was generated during Democratic presidencies compared to Republican presidencies in the United States. The question is why. Blinder and Watson (2016) explain that the Democratic-Republican presidential growth gap (D-R growth gap) can hardly be attributed to the policies under Democratic presidents, but Democratic presidents – at least partly – just had good luck, although a substantial gap remains unexplained. A natural place to look for an explanation is the partisan balance at the state level. We show that pronounced national GDP growth was generated when a larger share of US states had Democratic governors and unified Democratic state governments. However, this fact does not explain the D-R growth gap. To the contrary, given the tendency of electoral support at the state level to swing away from the party of the incumbent president, this works against the D-R growth gap. In fact, the D-R presidential growth gap at the national level might have been even larger were it not for the mitigating dynamics of state politics (by about 0.3-0.6 percentage points). These results suggest that the D-R growth gap is an even bigger puzzle than Blinder and Watson’s findings would suggest.
H00|Public Policy Towards Offshore Oil Spills|On April 20, 2010, the Macondo well suffered a blowout, causing the mobile offshore drilling unit “Deepwater Horizon” to explode and eventually sink. Oil flowed from the well into the Gulf of Mexico for 87 days. In the aftermath of this event, the US Government proposed significant regulatory changes related to offshore oil and gas exploration and production. In this paper I consider the likely costs and potential benefits from these new regulations. While both costs and benefits are very large, plausibly running into billions of US Dollars, a strong case can be made in favor of the regulations.

H00|Israel's Immigration Story: Globalization Lessons|The exodus of Soviet Jews to Israel in the 1990s was a unique event. The extraordinary experience of Israel, which has received migrants from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) at the rate of 17 percent of its population, within a short time, is also relevant for the current debate about migration and globalization. The immigration wave was distinctive for its large high skilled cohort, and its quick integration into the domestic labor market. Among various ethnic groups the FSU immigrants ranked at the top of intergenerational upward mobility. Immigration also changed the entire economic landscape: it raised productivity, underpinning technological prowess, and had significant impact on income inequality and the level of redistribution in Israel’s welfare state.
H00|The Fall of Capital Punishment and the Rise of Prisons: How Punishment Severity Affects Jury Verdicts|This paper studies the effect of punishment severity on jury decision-making using a large archival data set from the Old Bailey Criminal Court in London from 1715 to 1900. We take advantage of three natural experiments in English history, which result in sharp decreases in punishment severity: The offense specific abolition of capital punishment in the 1800s, the temporary halt of penal transportation during the American Revolution, and the abolition of transportation in 1853. Using a difference-in-differences design to study the abolition of the death penalty and pre-post designs to study the temporary and permanent halts to transportation, we find that decreasing expected punishment (especially via the end of the death penalty), had a large and significant impact on jury behavior, generally leading to the jury being ‘harsher’. Moreover, we find that the size of the effect differs with defendants’ gender and criminal history. These results raise concerns about the impartiality of juries as well as the implicit assumption often made when designing and evaluating criminal justice policies today – that the chance of conviction is independent of the harshness of the penalty.
H00|Confidence in Beliefs and Rational Decision Making|The standard, Bayesian account of rational belief and decision is often argued to be unable to cope properly with severe uncertainty, of the sort ubiquitous in some areas of policy making. This paper tackles the question of what should replace it as a guide for rational decision making. It defends a recent proposal, which reserves a role for the decision maker’s confidence in beliefs. Beyond being able to cope with severe uncertainty, the account has strong normative credentials on the main fronts typically evoked as relevant for rational belief and decision. It fares particularly well, we argue, in comparison to other prominent non-Bayesian models in the literature.
H00|Would you choose to be happy? Tradeoffs between happiness and the other dimensions of life in a large population survey|A large literature documents the determinants of happiness. But is happiness all that people want from life; and if so, what type of happiness matters to them? Or are they willing to sacrifice happiness (however it is defined) for other attributes in their lives? We show direct evidence that individuals trade-off levels of happiness with levels of income, physical health, family, career success and education in a large sample of UK and US individuals. On average, all types of happiness are preferred to other attributes except health. People prefer affective happiness (feeling good) over evaluative (life satisfaction) and eudaimonic (worthwhileness) components. This result is robust to methodological innovations, such as the use of vignettes and judgements of the lives described.

H00|Federalism, fiscal space, and public investment spending: do fiscal rules impose hard-budget constraints?|The core emphasis of rules-based fiscal legislation at the subnational level in India is to achieve debt sustainability through a numerical ceiling on borrowing and the use of borrowed resources for public capital investment by phasing out revenue deficits. Using the Arellano Bond Panel estimation, this chapter examines whether the application of fiscal rules has resulted in an increase in the fiscal space for public capital investment spending in major Indian states. This analysis shows that by controlling other factors, there is a negative relationship between fiscal rules and public capital investment spending at the state level during the rules-based fiscal regime.
H00|Information, belief elicitation and threshold effects in the 5X1000 tax scheme: a framed field experiment|Abstract In this paper, we study by means of a framed field experiment on a representative sample of the population the effect on people’s charitable giving of three, substantial and procedural, elements: information provision, belief elicitation and threshold on distribution. We frame this investigation within the 5X1000 tax scheme, a mechanism through which Italian taxpayers may choose to give a small proportion (0.5%) of their income tax to a voluntary organization to fund its activities. We find two main results: (i) providing information or eliciting beliefs about previous donations increases the likelihood of a donation, while thresholds have no effect; (ii) information about previous funding increases donations to organizations that received fewer donations in the past, while belief elicitation also increases donations to organizations that received most donations in the past, since individuals are more likely to donate to the organizations they rank first.
H00|Updates to the Sampling of Wealthy Families in the Survey of Consumer Finances|Participation in household surveys has fallen over time, making it harder to produce a household survey-like the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)-in a timely manner. To address these challenges, the reference year of the sampling frame data for the 2016 SCF wealthy oversample was shifted back one year, allowing the oversample to be selected earlier than the past. In implementing this change, though, we risk identifying an outdated set of families and introducing variability in the sampling process. However, we show that the set of families selected in the new frame are observationally equivalent to those that would have been selected from a past frame, and that the increased variability of wealth estimates is compensated-for with the use of more comprehensive data than in the past. Other aspects of the SCF sampling process are revisited, too. We continue to find support for using permanent income in the sampling process, rather than annual income. We also estimate the geographic distribution of wealthy families and show that the current distribution is similar to the past. We propose adding one geographic area to the oversample, though, and supplementing by 100 the set of sampled families.
H00|Fiscal policy and aggregate demand in the USA before, during, and following the Great Recession|Abstract We examine the direct effect of federal and subnational fiscal policy on aggregate demand in the USA by introducing the Fiscal Effect (FE) measure. FE can be decomposed into three components. Discretionary FE quantifies the effect of discretionary or legislated policy changes on aggregate demand. Cyclical FE captures the effect of the automatic stabilizers—changes in government taxes and spending arising from the business cycle. Residual FE measures the effect of all changes in government revenues and outlays which cannot be categorized as either discretionary or cyclical; for example, it captures the effect of the secular increase in entitlement program spending due to the aging of the population. Unlike other approaches, FE is a bottom-up approach that allows for differential effects on aggregate demand depending on the type and length of the policy change. Thus, FE is arguably the most detailed and comprehensive measure available of the stance of US fiscal policy in relation to aggregate demand. We use our new metric to examine the contribution of fiscal policy to growth in real GDP over the course of the Great Recession and current expansion. We compare this contribution to the contributions to growth in aggregate demand made by fiscal policy over past business cycles. In doing so, we highlight that the relatively strong support of government policy to GDP growth during the Great Recession was followed by a historically weak contribution over the course of the current expansion.
H00|Waste collection in rural communities: challenges under EU regulations. A Case study of Neamt County, Romania|The paper aims to examine the changes in the rural waste management sector at regional scale since the Romania adhesion to the EU in 2007. Traditional waste management based on the mixed waste collection and waste disposal often on improper sites prevailed in municipal waste management options of transitional economies across the globe. The lack of formal waste collection services in rural areas has encouraged the open dumping or backyard burning. The paper analyses the improvements and challenges of local authorities in order to fulfill the new EU requirements in this sector supported by data analysis at local administrative unit levels and field observations. Geographical analysis is compulsory in order to reveal the local disparities. The paper performs an assessment of waste collection issues across 78 rural municipalities within Neamt County. This sector is emerging in rural areas of Eastern Europe, but is far from an efficient municipal waste management system based on the waste hierarchy concept.
H00|Social Interactions, Mechanisms, and Equilibrium: Evidence from a Model of Study Time and Academic Achievement|We develop and estimate a model of student study time on a social network. The model is designed to exploit unique data collected in the Berea Panel Study. Study time data allow us to quantify an intuitive mechanism for academic social interactions: own study time may depend on friend study time in a heterogeneous manner. Social network data allow us to embed study time and resulting academic achievement in an estimable equilibrium framework. We develop a specification test that exploits the equilibrium nature of social interactions and use it to show that novel study propensity measures mitigate econometric endogeneity concerns.
H00|Europa tra Stati Uniti e Confederazione. Occorre scegliere la Confederazione|Europe is attempting to concentrate in Brussels the actual fiscal revenue, claiming also a European Minister of Economics. If it succeeds, the risk is a negative outcome. In fact Italy, and other European countries as well, would not give up their nationality, in order to become a province of Europe. Nevertheless it is shown that the cause of the problems is the actual fiscal system, of anglo-saxon origin, which it is then necessary to substitute. It is possible to take deep insights from the fiscal system ruling in Italy up to the seventies of the last century, based on a real rather than a personal taxation. In this case it is not necessary a European Minister of Economics. It is sufficient a coordination in some rates of taxation among European countries. It is shown that this is not the only reason to substitute the actual fiscal system. T here are other reasons also, which reveal the actual knots of the ruling personal system.
H00|Partisan politics|This paper describes the empirical evidence on partisan politics in OECD panel studies. I elaborate on the research designs, the measurement of government ideology and why the empirical studies did not derive causal effects. Discussing about 100 panel data studies, the results indicate that leftwing and rightwing governments pursued different economic policies until the 1990s: the size and scope of government was larger when leftwing governments were in power. Partisan politics have not disappeared since the 1990s, but have certainly become less pronounced. In particular, government ideology still seems to influence policies such as privatization and market deregulation. I discuss the consequences of declining electoral cohesion and what future research needs to explore. (C) 2016 Association for Comparative Economic Studies.
H00|One, Two, Many—Insensitivity to Group Size in Games with Concentrated Benefits and Dispersed Costs|We experimentally analyse distributional preferences when a decider chooses the provision of a good that benefits herself or a receiver, and creates costs for a group of payers. The treatment variation is the number of payers. We observe that subjects provide the good even if there are many payers so that the costs of provision exceed the benefits by far. This result holds regardless of whether the provision increases the decider’s payoff or not. Intriguingly, it is not only selfish or maximin types who provide the good. Rather, we show that a substantial fraction of subjects are “insensitive to group size”: they reveal to care about the payoff of all parties, but attach the same weight to small and large groups so that they ignore large provision costs that are dispersed among many payers. Our results have important consequences for the approval of policies with concentrated benefits and large, dispersed cost, as well as the analysis of ethical behaviour, medical decision-making, and charity donations.
H00|Ten rules for public economic policy|This paper discusses ten simple rules for the formulation of public economic policies efficiently, using both old wisdom and recent results. In proposing the ten rules, the normative foundation used is that of social welfare maximization or welfarism. The scientific foundation is the first theorem in welfare economics supplemented by other analyses in economics and beyond. The ten rules are: Using the Invisible Hand; Provision of Essential Public Goods; Reducing Excessive Inequalities Efficiently; Adopt Free Trade and Eliminate Administrative and Collusive Monopolies; Provide Useful Information and Regulation; Raise Taxes Efficiently; Mitigate against Excessive Market Fluctuations; Undertake Public Projects Efficiently; Soft Paternalism; Happiness-Oriented Objectives. Justifications and qualifications are discussed.
H00|Paternalism and Pseudo-Rationality|Resource allocations are jointly determined by the actions of social planners and households. In this paper, we highlight the distinction between planner optimization and household optimization. We show that planner optimization is a partial substitute for household optimization and that this is still true when households have private in- formation about their preferences. We illustrate a novel identification problem: some aggregate equilibrium properties that are implied by household optimization are also implied by planner optimization. A rational utilitarian planner enacts policies that cause the Euler equation to hold on average in a population of non-optimizing households, which we refer to as pseudo-rationality. Hence, widely studied allocative optimality conditions also arise in an allocatively inefficient economy with a rational planner, who uses tools such as default savings and Social Security to influence the consumption choices of myopic and passive households. Accordingly, aggregate classical optimization tests implemented with data from economies with paternalistic governments cannot reveal whether households would make optimal decisions on their own.
H00|Valuing Government Obligations When Markets are Incomplete|Determining how to value net government obligations is a long-standing and fundamental question in public finance. Its answer is critical to cost-benefit analysis, the assessment of fiscal sustainability, generational accounting, and other economic issues. This paper posits and simulates a ten-period overlapping generations model with aggregate shocks to price safe and risky government net obligations, including options. Agents can't trade with future generations to hedge the model's productivity and depreciation shocks. Nor can they invest in anything other than one-period bonds and risky capital. Our results are surprising. We find that the pricing of short- as well as long-dated riskless obligations is anchored to the prevailing one-period risk-free return. More surprising, the prices of obligations whose values are proportional to the prevailing wage (e.g., Social Security benefits under a pay-go system with a fixed tax rate) are essentially identical to those of safe obligations, i.e., there is little risk adjustment. This is true notwithstanding our assumption of very large macro shocks. In contrast, government obligations provided in the form of options entail significant risk adjustment. We also show that the value of obligations to unborn generations depends on the nature of the compensating variation. Another finding is that the one-period bond market matters, but less than expected, to valuing obligations. Finally, our model lets us test the ability of arbitrage pricing to get prices right. Surprisingly, with the right specification, it comes close. Although highly stylized, our model suggests the potential of detailed, largescale CGE OLG models to price government obligations as well as non-marketed private securities in the presence of incomplete markets and macro shocks.

It include the observation of Elsoft Research Berhad business activities over the period between 2011 and 2015. The finding shows that the Elsoft company have their own characteristic to control the performance of company among the other competitor company.

H00|risk and performance of amtel holdings berhad|The purpose of this study is to examine the overall performance of Amtel Holding Berhad in the electronic sector. This study will investigate the relationship between company profitability and some specific risk factors and macroeconomic factor. The data was collected from the annual report of Amtel Holdings Berhad. Starting from 2011 until 2015. The measurement of liquidity ratio and operating ratio used to see the overall performance of Amtel Holdings Berhad. For the 5 years liquidity ratio still beyond the benchmark, however the operating ratio shows the higher percentage and across the benchmark, indicates that the company is not efficient in managing their operating expenses. The additional measurement is size of asset. This variable is not significant with the liquidity risk. To see the relationship of risks factors to the profitability, this paper is utilizing liquidity (current ratio), GDP and operating ratio. Data was analysed by utilizing regression and bivariate correlation. The regression analysis and bivariate correlation shows only one factor of profitability is significant to operating ratio which is ROA with the highest impact to the profitability. However, the liquidity and GDP is not significant to profitability with low impact to the profitability
H00|Waste collection in rural communities: challenges under EU regulations. A Case study of Neamt County, Romania|The paper aims to examine the changes in the rural waste management sector at regional scale since the Romania adhesion to the EU in 2007. Traditional waste management based on the mixed waste collection and waste disposal often on improper sites prevailed in municipal waste management options of transitional economies across the globe. The lack of formal waste collection services in rural areas has encouraged the open dumping or backyard burning. The paper analyses the improvements and challenges of local authorities in order to fulfill the new EU requirements in this sector supported by data analysis at local administrative unit levels and field observations. Geographical analysis is compulsory in order to reveal the local disparities. The paper performs an assessment of waste collection issues across 78 rural municipalities within Neamt County. This sector is emerging in rural areas of Eastern Europe, but is far from an efficient municipal waste management system based on the waste hierarchy concept.
H00|Public – Private Investment Nexus in Developing Economies: Does Financial Sector Development Matter for Nigeria?|Much of the social and economic infrastructural deficits in Africa have been attributed to inadequate investment levels in many countries of Africa. Although Nigeria is not lacking in foreign private investments, the present level of total investment is adjudged sub-optimal, and the public sector is perceived to be large, inefficient and also dominant. The question arising is whether the composition of investment matters for the overall investment behaviour in Nigeria. The main objectives of the paper are to investigate the complementarity or substitutability of public and private investment, as well as examine whether financial sector development drive private investment in Nigeria. The paper employed annual data covering the period of 1981 to 2015 and ARDL estimation. The bounds test results revealed that there exists a long-run relationship among the variables. The study found that public investment crowds out private investment in Nigeria. In other words, the complementarity effect between private investment and public investment is not justified in the study; rather, there exists a substitution effect between private and public investments in Nigeria. More so, the result suggested that the effect of financial development on private – public investment nexus is positive and significant (P

H00|Do teacher aides help or hurt student achievement? the role of teacher experience|Employment of teacher aides in U. S. public schools increased roughly six-fold since 1969. Yet randomized studies of aides find predominantly negative effects on student achievement. This study of public elementary schools in Oregon explores the role of teacher experience in the effectiveness of aides and finds a strong complementarity between aides and teacher experience. The complementarity explains two results of prior studies: negative effects for aides and positive effects primarily for early years of teacher experience. Without complementarity, the effect of aides is negative; with it, the effect is positive for schools with experienced teachers and negative only for schools with inexperienced teachers. Similarly, without complementarity, the effect of experience is negative; with it, the effect is positive for schools that use aides intensively and negative only for schools that do not. The study exploits the longitudinal, hierarchical structure of the Oregon data to estimate a hierarchical linear model with controls for both observed and unobserved influences on individual student achievement. A series of alternative specifications, including a nullification test of causality based on prior test scores suggest robustness for the estimates. Results of the study suggest that prior evidence for the effectiveness of aides is too pessimistic in the context of experienced teachers and that prior evidence for the effectiveness of teacher experience is too pessimistic in the context of schools that use aides intensively. The results also suggest that experienced teachers have expertise important to effective supervision of aides, particularly in schools where teachers are relatively inexperienced and aides are prevalent. Hence, attempts to address problems of large class sizes by adding aides are more likely to be effective in schools with experienced teachers.
H00|Neo-Liberalism and the Rise of Right-Wing Conservatism in India|This paper assesses the origins and the consequences of the decisive right wing shift in Indian politics ushered in by the 2014 elections. Tracing this to long-term but not linearly developing tendencies in Indian politics, the paper relates these with the distinctive nature and history of capitalist development in India, particularly the sharply polarizing growth and accumulation regime of the neo-liberal era and the crisis it now confronts. Asserting that the electoral success of the Narendra Modi-led BJP was based on it being the political agent of not change but of a reassertion by India’s economic elite, the paper explains the challenge of managing sharply contradictory interests that this places in the path of the consolidation of the new regime.
H00|Government Size and Economic Growth in Turkey: A Threshold Regression Analysis|We examine the relationship between the government size and economic growth by using threshold regression model and quarterly data over the period 1998:1-2015:1 for Turkey. Our results provide a strong evidence for the existence of a non-linear relationship. The estimated threshold levels, as a percentage of GDP, are 16.5 for the government total expenditures, 12.6 for consumption expenditures and 3.9 for investment expenditures. We find that an increase in the government size leads to a significant rise (decline) in economic growth rate when the government size is below (above) the threshold level, confirming the predictions of Armey curve. Our findings have a clear policy implication: since the realized government consumption and total expenditures are well above the estimated threshold levels, a reduction in the government size would boost the growth rate.
H00|Electoral systems and immigration|We study the effect of electoral systems on openness to immigration. According to the literature, in our model plurality systems induce a rent-seeking policymaker to get re-election through locally provided public goods rather than through transfers, whereas the opposite occurs under proportional representation. In both systems policymakers can use immigration to enlarge the tax base and retrieve increased rents after compensating the decisive majority. However, this mechanism is more effective when the increased tax base does not flow to non-voting immigrants through transfers. Therefore, plurality electoral systems generate more openness to immigration. We find support for this result on a cross-section of 34 OECD countries. In addition, we show that mass immigration \ might incentivize policymakers to get re-election throug public goods rather than transfers also in proportional electoral systems.
H00|An empirical study about a bystander's behaviour and psychological state in bullying|The objective of this research is to clarify empirically about the relationship of a bystander's behaviour of bullying and psychological state of bystanders. To decrease bystander of bullying is effective to resolve bullying. However, the number of bystanders indicate a tendency to increase in Japan. The percentage of bullies who were reported by their classmates was 10% until 2010. It decreased to around 3% recently. In this research, the hypothesis that low consciousness of others raise the number of bystanders was formed. As a methodology, the questionnaire to 300 ordinary citizens was carried out. As a result of the survey, especially multidimensional sympathies, consciousness of others, and Japanese version of the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire correlated to a bystander's behaviour of bullying. In conclusion, the effort towards to raise consciousness of others is useful to decrease a number of bystanders.
H00|Are Constitutional States Able to Drive the Global Technological Change?|The present paper aims at assessing the possible efficiency of the principle of national contributions, assumed in the 2015 Paris Framework Convention on Climate Change. Strong historical evidence indicates that any significant development of constitutional states used to take place, in the past, on the rising tide of demographic growth. Presently, we are facing global demographic slowdown, and contesters argue that constitutional states are not the right address to write to if we want breakthrough technological change. This paper assumes that the capacity of constitutional states to carry out the obligations declared in the Framework Convention, i.e. to carry out deep technological changes in the global economy, depends on their economic power, which can be estimated as their capacity to appropriate capital. Empirical data, examined in this article, indicates that since the 1980s, constitutional states have been losing their economic power, and that the overall technological progress is more and more disconnected from that economic power of governments. Moreover, constitutional states seem to be losing their capacity to experiment with their own institutions.
H00|How much does military spending affect growth? Causal estimates from the World's non-rich countries|While not always a concern for the general economic growth literature, the debate over the effects of military spending on growth continues to develop, with no consensus, but a deepening understanding of the limitations of previous work. One important issue that has not been adequately dealt with, is the endogeneity of military spending in the growth equation, mainly because of the difficulty of finding any variables that would make adequate instruments. This paper considers this issue, using an endogenous growth model estimated on a large sample of 109 non-high income countries for the period 1998-2012. The empirical analysis is framed within an instrumental variable setting that exploits the increase in military spending that occurs when unrest in a country escalates to turmoil. The estimation results show that endogeneity arising from reverse causality is a crucial issue, with the instrumental variable estimates providing a larger significant negative effect of military spending on growth than OLS would. This result is found to be robust to different sources of heterogeneity and different time periods.
H00|The growth in military expenditure in Germany 1951–2011|We examine whether government ideology was correlated with the growth in military expenditure in Germany over the period 1951-2011. Using various measures of government ideology, the results do not show any effect. The exception is an ideology measure based on the Comparative Manifesto Project (left-right scale): using this measure, the results show that the growth in military expenditure increased by about 2.4 percentage points, when the ideology variable (right-wing) increased by one standard deviation. This effect, however, is based on observations until the early 1960s and cannot be generalized. The major political parties agreed on how to evaluate international risks and threats. Government ideology retired to the background. We conjecture that the consensus among the major parties will persist - even if military spending needs to be increased in response to new international risks and threats.
H00|Tax Stories from South Anatolia|In this research, the data obtained from the oral history interviews with both sides â€“ tax payer peasants and tax collectors â€“ are used to interpret how tax relations work and how this process is perceived by the tax payer. Based on the idea that nicknames might offer a more realistic framework in this sense, the nicknames given to tax collectors, such as RÄ±za of the Cliff (UÃ§urumlu RÄ±za), Mustafa the Angel (Melek Mustafa), the Slender Tyrant (Ä°nce ZalÄ±m), and the Black/Yellow Hell (Kara/SarÄ± Cehennem), are believed to be a representative of the relationship between both parties. Never published before in another medium, the story of SÃ¼leyman, the Butcher (Kasap SÃ¼leyman) is also hereby introduced into field literature.
H00|The Concept of Governance and Public Governance Theories|At the end of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first century the concept of governance has taken on a central part in contemporary debates in the area of social sciences and particularly in the field of public administration. The concept has been used frequently, but often with quite different meanings and implications. It is considered that a major reason for the increasing popularity of the concept, in contrast to the narrower term of‘government’, is its capacity to cover the whole range of institutions and relationships involved in the process of governing. This paper discusses a variety of meanings and different approaches of governance, but its main focus is on the capacity of government to make and implement policy, or, in short, just to steer society. Thus, thinking about governance is thinking about how to steer the economy and society, and how to reach collective goals.
H00|Peoples of the Enemy? Ukrainians and Russians 1995–2011|Abstract This paper tests three hypotheses about the origins of the conflict which began in 2014 in Ukraine, using the 1995–2011 World Values Surveys. First, a hypothesis that the economic situation of young fighting-age men in Eastern Ukraine worsened relative to that of young men in Russia during 1995–2011 is examined. Second, a hypothesis that the political views of respondents in Eastern Ukraine became more like those of people in neighbouring Russian regions is investigated. Third, a hypothesis that people in Eastern Ukraine became relatively more disillusioned with the quality of their national institutions during this period is tested. None of these three hypotheses is much supported by the data.

H00|La gestion structurelle des déficits jumeaux au Maroc et la recherche d’une stratégie d’équilibre<BR>[Structural management of twin deficits in Morocco and Finding an equilibrium strategy]|During these last years, Morocco has almost always known at the same time a budget deficit and a current account deficit. So we can conclude prematurely the existence of a structural problem of twin deficits over a long period. The article introduces in addition to the two balances, the variable transfers of MREs - second source of foreign currency after the tourist returns - as a participatory variable to the equilibrium of the current transactions and verify the hypothesis of the twin deficits using econometric tools, notably the method of Co-integration - to test the long-term relationship - and the method of Granger causality - to know the direction of causality -. The results confirm the twin deficits hypothesis for Morocco for the period from 1980 to 2014 and show bidirectional causality between the variables and the lack of a balanced strategy.
H00|The development of hotel industry due to mega sport event. The case of Euro 2012 in Poland|The implications of mega sports events for the organiser’s economy remain virtually unexplored in Poland. The fact that our country was entrusted with organising the 2012 European Football Championship spurred interest in the issue. In the course of preparations to the event many doubts have arisen as to the actual cost-benefit balance affecting the hosting country. An attempt at arriving at the nagging question, i.e.: „Is organisation of such a large event profitable from the economic point of view?” is hindered by the specificity of events of the kind. This specificity is due not only to the huge scale of the projects pursued, but also to the long-term impact on the organiser’s economy, stretching long beyond the several-year period of preparations. The organization of Euro 2012 in Pomerania was an event without precedent. Never before has such a large event had no place in Poland. The consequence of this state of affairs is unprecedented scale of the changes in the infrastructure environment. These changes flow to the SME sector, which attempted to capture the benefits from the fact of the Euro organization, although the results of the research presented in the article indicate the exceptional restraint in this regard. As many as 87% of the surveyed companies had not taken any action before the final tournament, even though they treated the event as a chance to develop. Because of football meetings played in Pomerania the hotel business was an industry which expected the greatest benefits. It should be emphasized the importance of promoting the city and wider the whole region for the future operation and development of this sector.
H00|Tax administration resources and Income inequality|The paper contributes to the research field as the first quantitative study deploying OECD Tax administration database to provide empirical evidence with respect to the impact of Tax administration resources on income inequality. Methodologically speaking, we apply, for the unique data set of 46 countries extracted from OECD Tax administration 2015 database, the cross-sectional multiple regression employing the OLS estimator before justifying with other estimators i.e. truncated regression, quantile regression and weighted least squared (WLS). We finally obtain the robustly negative relationship between Tax administration resources (employees and non-salary expenditure) and income inequality as hypothesize. The paper ends with some policy recommendations following the limitations and directions for further research.
H00|Eficienţa Economică A Administraţiei Publice Din Uniunea Europeană Și România<BR>[Economic Efficiency Of Public Administration In European Union And Romania]|Romania are placed on the last place in the Top of Europe in terms of government efficiency. This position is given by the value of a many indicators, often used in World Bank assessments, that takes into account the capacity of central and local government, the characteristics of the regulatory system, level of corruption, its impartiality and the quality of public services provided. The article present, synthetically, the evolution of the main theories of public administration and, practically, to compared Romania with to other European countries, it is found that the value of many public administration indicator has not changed substantially in the last 7 years, Romania occupying constantly the last place. The analysis provides an alternative insight into the analysis of public administration capacity as one of the main dependent links to the quality of government indicator and formulates some elements for a possible development framework for the future reforms.
H00|The Effects of Institutional Structure on Economic Growth: An Application on G-20 Countries (1996-2014)|In parallel to the evolution of the economic growth theories regarding the main indicators of long term economic growth, this article econometrically analyses the long term effects of the institutional structure on the economic growth of G-20 countries with different development levels for the period of 1996-2014. In order to examine the impact of the institutional structure on economic growth more coherently and to compare the results, G-20 countries are included in the analysis under two sub-groups respectively as economically developed G-9 countries and developing G-10 countries. Thus the article aims to evaluate the impact of the institutional structure on the differentiation of the long term economic growth performances and economic development levels of the countries under the groups G-9 and G-10. The article concludes that, effects of the institutional structure indicators on the economic growth have been positive and significant in statistical terms in the sub-group G-9, while they have been usually negative and significant in sub-group G-10 during the period analysed. Nonetheless, the article indicates that, along with the physical and human capital accumulation, possession of different institutional structures are more effective in differentiation of the long term economic growth performances and development levels of the countries in the groups of G-9 and G-10 during the sample period.

If AED are continually not utilized?by bystanders in an effective manner, then a large amount of public expense which is supplied to an installation and training course of AED is wasteful. In this research, the hypothesis that rich social capital raises the consciousness to a use of AED was formed. As a methodology, the questionnaire to 1000 ordinary citizens was carried out. In conclusion, the effort towards rich social capital is useful to improvement in the ratio of lifesaving by using AED.

However a change in the level of government expenditures or government revenues will create different effects on the economy depending on the relationship between the aggregates in question. The aim of this study is to exhibit the relationship between government expenditures and government revenues for Turkey in order to serve to determine the favorable policy. For that purpose, the relationship is tested by using Central Government Budget Revenue Realization and Central Government Budget Expenditure series from the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Finance with 2006 January - 2015 April monthly data. In addition, by employing government revenues and expenditures in a disaggregated manner, the relationships about general government revenues, the revenues of regulatory and supervisory foundations, the revenues of private budgeted foundations, interest payments and non-interest payments are tried to be presented. Granger causality test is preferred as we have stationary series and also as this methodology is reliable, simple and widely used in literature.

H00|The Role Of The Government In Entrepreneurship Development: Evidence From Bosnia And Herzegovina|In recent decades, economic growth in countries around the world has become increasingly dependent on the dynamism of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). This is especially important in the transition economies. The creation of a new SME sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) as a transition country may play an important role in the process of economic regeneration and job creation. The paper sets out an approach to analyzing the development of SMEs in BiH. We have focused on (i) attitudes of entrepreneurs in the private sector towards the role of government in SME development through provision of assistance to SMEs in BiH, (ii) the business environment in which firms operate, and (iii) attitudes of the employmed in government sector towards the role of government in SME development through the provision of assistance to SMEs in BiH. The paper reviews the literature on these three approaches and available evidence on relevance to understanding the performance of SMEs as main agents of entrepreneurship in the BiH.
H00|Equality Under Threat by the Talented: Evidence from Worker‐Managed Firms|Are high-ability individuals more likely to quit egalitarian regimes? Does the threat of exit by talented individuals restrict the redistributive capacity of democratic organizations? This paper revisits that long-standing debate by analyzing the interplay between compensation structure and quit behavior in the distinct yet underexplored institutional setting of workermanaged firms. The study exploits two novel administrative data sources: a panel of Uruguayan workers employed in both worker-managed and conventional firms; and a linked employer–employee panel data set covering the population of Uruguayan workermanaged firms and their workers from January 1997 to April 2010. A key advantage of the data is that it enables one to exploit within-firm variation on wages to construct an ordinal measure of the worker ability type. The paper's four main findings are that (1) workermanaged firms redistribute in favor of low-wage workers; (2) in worker-managed firms, high-ability members are more likely than other members to exit; (3) the hazard ratio of high-ability members is lower for founding members and for those employed by workermanaged firms in which there is less pay compression; and (4) high-ability members are less likely to quit when labor market conditions in the capitalist sector are less attractive. This paper contributes to the study of the interplay between equality and incentives that permeates many debates in public finance, comparative economic systems, personnel and organizational economics<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H00|Productive Government Expenditure and Economic Performance in sub-Saharan Africa: An Empirical Investigation|This study examined the effect of government expenditure on its disaggregated level on economic growth in a sample of 20 sub-Saharan African Countries over the period of 19802010 in a dynamic panel data model. The result from Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) revealed an inverse relationship between productive government expenditure and economic growth in sub-Sahara Africa. Also, productive government expenditures were not actually productive most especially when ?nanced by non-distortionary government tax revenue in sub-Saharan African countries. The study concluded that the productive government expenditure and its corresponding source of the mode of ?nancing were counterproductive for economic performance in the African countries.

Although the identification of a causal effect may not be possible with the data at hand, the results suggest that, in the given framework, attending class and studying on one´s own may be substitutes.
H00|Bunching|Recent years have seen a surge of applied work using bunching approaches, a development that is closely linked to the increased availability of administrative data. These approaches exploit the incentives for bunching created by discontinuities in the slope of choice sets (kinks) or in the level of choice sets (notches) to study the behavior of individuals and firms. Although the bunching approach was originally developed in the context of taxation, it is beginning to find applications in many other areas, such as social security, social insurance, welfare programs, education, regulation, private sector prices, and reference-dependent preferences. This review provides a guide to bunching estimation, discusses its strengths and weaknesses, surveys a range of applications across fields, and considers reasons for the ubiquity of kinks and notches.

Academic Economics Research And Public Policy Measures|" type=""main"" xml:id=""coep12117-abs-0001""> This paper investigates whether academic research attention to certain policy-related measures (including gross domestic product, unemployment, and inflation) is correlated with empirical measurements of the measures themselves. In other words, when unemployment rises, does research attention to the matter increase? Or do economists pursue research (in the short run) relatively uninfluenced by policy shocks on the ground? Text analysis implies that economic attention to key policy terms does correlate with empirical movements of the terms in most instances; however, the stronger and more consistent correlation is between use of policy terms in the literature and discussion of them by the broader public.

H00|The Impact of Political Uncertainty: A Robust Control Approach|We examine how candidate uncertainty affects the policy platforms chosen in a unidimensional, two-candidate Downsian spatial model. The candidates, we assume, do not know the true distribution of voters. Following the robust control literature, candidates respond to this uncertainty by applying a max–min operator to their optimization problem. This approach, consistent with findings within the behavioral economics literature, protects the candidate by ensuring that her expected utility never falls too far, regardless of the true voter distribution. We show that this framework produces a continuum of equilibria upon which the candidates can converge and that the size of this continuum is weakly increasing in each candidate’s uncertainty. We argue that our model can explain movements in political platforms over time. That is, the mere presence of candidate uncertainty, in addition to shifts in attitudes or demographics, can cause political candidates to change their policy positions across elections.
H00|Inequality, Public Wealth, and the Federal Shareholder|Current trends in the distribution of wealth trigger a social divide and threaten democracy. I propose to counter this evolution by enhancing the role of public capital as a redistribution and empowerment device.

This paper offers an account of their design and sources of financing.
H00|Partisan politics: The empirical evidence from OECD panel studies|This paper describes the empirical evidence on partisan politics in OECD panel studies. I elaborate on the research designs, the measurement of government ideology and why the empirical studies did not derive causal effects. Discussing about 100 panel data studies, the results indicate that leftwing and rightwing governments pursued different economic policies until the 1990s: the size and scope of government was larger when leftwing governments were in power. Partisan politics have not disappeared since the 1990s, but have certainly become less pronounced. In particular, government ideology still seems to influence policies such as privatization and market deregulation. I discuss the consequences of declining electoral cohesion and what future research needs to explore.
H00|Aleatoric Democracy|Democracy usually is identified by the right to vote. However, in recent times voting procedures have been criticized, as they seemingly do not guarantee that all parts of the population have an adequate voice in the established political process. We suggest invigorating an old but nearly forgotten procedure to overcome this deficit: Aleatoric Democracy based on a combination of voting and random decisions. By using random mechanisms the interests of the whole population are considered. Persons and ideas, being so far disregarded, are taken into account. Democracy becomes vivid and creative, and does not run the danger of being entrenched.
H00|Public Goods, Signaling, and Norms of Conscientious Leadership|I study a sequential-move public goods game based on the notion that leadership comes with an obligation; conscientious leadership. Provision by the leader of an amount of the public good below a minimum imposes a psychological cost on the follower which increases his unit cost of contribution. The leader has private information about his type and his cost of contributing to the public good. The model combines a follower’s concern for fairness and informational signaling about conscientious leadership. I find that, under certain conditions, the follower’s equilibrium contribution is an increasing or non-monotonic function of the leader’s equilibrium contribution. The non-monotonicity result is consistent with evidence in a recent field experiment (Jack and Recalde, J. Public Econ, 2015) but cannot be obtained in previous theoretical models of voluntary public goods games that were based on only signaling information (i.e., about the quality of the public good or the return to contributions to the public good). Surprisingly, I find that, for this result to hold, the follower’s distaste for non-conscientious leadership must be sufficiently low. I also find that the leader may not act conscientiously if he does not have an informational advantage to exploit.
H00|¿Justicia territorial? Propuesta metodológica para abordar el desafío en materia de justicia, del gobierno nacional en el territorio colombiano|La coyuntura política colombiana; así como, algunos instrumentos tradicionales de política pública, han reivindicado el rol de la Justicia como eje fundamental para la construcción de un estado social de derecho y, han centrado la atención en la necesidad de conocer y reconocer las dinámicas de los territorios colombianos para la construcción de un país en Paz. A través de la revisión de diferentes aproximaciones conceptuales, teóricas y metodológicas, en este artículo se presenta una propuesta de método, cualitativo y cuantitativo, para empezar a abordar el desafío del gobierno nacional de acercar efectivamente la justicia a los territorios, no como una estrategia impuesta del nivel central, sino como un proceso constructivo entre la Nación y el territorio, comprendiendo este último no solo desde la mirada de sus administradores, sino desde las relaciones entre los diversos actores que lo habitan.
H00|Informal Labor and the Efficiency Cost of Social Programs: Evidence from the Brazilian Unemployment Insurance Program|It is widely believed that the presence of a large informal sector increases the efficiency cost of social programs – transfer and social insurance programs – in developing countries. We evaluate such claims for policies that have been heavily studied in countries with low informality – increases in unemployment insurance (UI) benefits. We introduce informal work opportunities into a canonical model of optimal UI that specifies the typical tradeoff between workers’ need for insurance and the efficiency cost from distorting their incentives to return to a formal job. We then combine the model with evidence drawn from comprehensive administrative data to quantify the efficiency cost of increases in potential UI duration in Brazil. We find evidence of behavioral responses to UI incentives, including informality responses. However, because reemployment rates in the formal sector are low to begin with, most beneficiaries would draw the UI benefits absent behavioral responses, and only a fraction of the cost of (longer) UI benefits is due to perverse incentive effects. As a result, the efficiency cost is relatively low, and in fact lower than comparable estimates for the US. We reinforce this finding by showing that the efficiency cost is also lower in labor markets with higher informality within Brazil. This is because formal reemployment rates are even lower in those labor markets, absent behavioral responses. In sum, the results go against the conventional wisdom, and indicate that efficiency concerns may even become more relevant as an economy formalizes.
H00|Dynamic Bargaining over Redistribution in Legislatures|This paper analyzes the standard Neoclassical growth model where agents are heterogeneous in their initial wealth. Wealth can be taxed in order to finance equal lump-sum transfers. We consider a representative democracy where elected officials select the current capital tax by playing a legislative bargaining game. Specifically, one member of the legislature makes a take-it-or-leave-it proposal and decisions pass by majority rule. In case of rejection of the proposal, the capital tax that was voted in the previous period (the status quo) is kept in place for one more period. A key feature of the bargaining game is that when looking at current payoffs both the agenda setter and the legislature have aligned preferences: their most preferred static policy is full taxation. However, the strength of these preferences differ. We show that the fear of ending in a high taxation equilibrium sustains levels of capital taxes and redistribution that are empirically reasonable. The endogeneity of the status quo is a crucial ingredient which disciplines legislators and reduces commitment problems. We also find that higher wealth inequality does not necessarily increase the size of government (the share of income redistributed).
H00|Does Good Governance Mediate Relationship between E-government and Public Trust in Lebanon?|The main objective of this research is to study the mediating effect of good governance on the relationship between e-government practices and public trust in Lebanon. Based on extensive literature review and conceptual background including the theories of institutional-based trust and the diffusion of innovation, the theoretical research framework was developed. Primary data was collected using survey involving 400 Lebanese employees from different small and medium enterprises in Beirut. The data have been analyzed using structural equation modeling. The research findings revealed that eight hypotheses were accepted while five hypotheses were rejected. This research contributes practically by offering policy makers in governments the guidelines to empower and build citizens’ trust by providing efficient, transparent and accountable government services. Future studies are suggested to extend the research empirically in terms of type of respondents, geographical location and analytical methods.
H00|“Giving” in to social pressure|We develop a theory of charitable giving in which donors feel social pressure from a direct solicitation. We show that equilibrium donations are concentrated around a social norm. Despite a higher level of the public good, relatively poor and/or low altruism givers fare worse under social pressure and would avoid the solicitor at a cost. Aggregate donor welfare improves to the extent that the added social motive alleviates the underprovision of the public good; however, overprovision may result. Our theory therefore predicts a light-handed regulation for charitable solicitations, which is consistent with their exemption from the popular Do Not Call list in the U.S. We further show that contrary to pure altruism, a more equal income distribution may produce more of the public good. In fundraising campaigns where a social norm is not apparent, one may emerge endogenously if donors are not too heterogeneous.
H00|Information, competition, and the quality of charities|Drawing upon the all-pay auction literature, we propose a model of charity competition in which informed giving alone can account for the significant quality heterogeneity across similar charities. Our analysis identifies a negative effect of competition and a positive effect of informed giving on the equilibrium quality of charity. In particular, we show that as the number of charities grows, so does the percentage of charity scams, approaching one in the limit. In light of this and other results, we discuss the need for regulating nonprofit entry and conduct as well as promoting informed giving.
H00|Why Doesn¡¯t the Hong Kong Government Sell More Public Land?|Why doesn¡¯t the Hong Kong government sell more of its enormous land holding to lower the city¡¯s high housing price and increase the residents¡¯ small living space? We answer the question in an overlapping generations framework. We show that while a rapid and complete privatization of government land is efficient in the absence of externalities; it is made politically difficult by a compensation gap, when the losses of current property owners are greater than the government revenue from land sales. We argue that the cross-country diversity of government land ownership owes to historical incidents in some countries (such as the U.S. in the 19th century) that allowed disposal of government land without filling the compensation gap and the absence of such incidents in others (such as Hong Kong).
H00|Happiness, habits and high rank: Comparisons in economic and social life|The role of money in producing sustained subjective well-being seems to be seriously compromised by social comparisons and habituation. But does that necessarily mean that we would be better off doing something else instead? This paper suggests that the phenomena of comparison and habituation are actually found in a variety of economic and social activities, rendering conclusions regarding well-being policy less straightforward.
H00|All the Single Ladies: Job Promotions and the Durability of Marriage|This paper addresses women's under-representation in top jobs in organizational hierarchies. We show that promotions to top jobs dramatically increase women's probability of divorce, but do not affect men's marriages. This effect is causally estimated for top jobs in the political sector, where close electoral results deliver exogenous variation in promotions across job candidates. Descriptive evidence from job promotions to the position of CEO shows that private sector promotions result in the same gender inequality in the risk of divorce. A description of male and female job candidates' household formations sheds some light on the mechanism behind this result. For most male candidates for top jobs, their promotion aligns with the gender-specialized division of paid and unpaid labor in their households. Many female candidates for top jobs live in dual-earner households and are married to older husbands who take a small share of parental leave. Divorce among women in top jobs occurs more often in couples with a larger age gap and a less equal division of leave, and in households in which her promotion shifts the division of earnings (further) away from the norm of male dominance. No divorce effect is found in couples that are more gender-equal in terms of having a smaller age gap and a more equal division of parental leave. We argue that norms and behavior in the marriage market hinder the closure of the gender gap in the labor market.
H00|God Helps Those Who Help Themselves! A Study of User-Innovation in Russia|This paper studies the specificities of Russian user-innovators on a sample of 1670 home interviews. The percentage of end users who innovate in their daily life in the Russian population and the willingness to share one’s ideas and developments is much higher in comparison to western countries and probably historically rooted in long-standing community activities which spread during soviet times. Our data suggests the existence of two different groups of user-innovators: one group of urban, male, well educated, and financially better-situated individuals who innovate for career reasons (or for fun) vs. a much more diverse group of small town folks who innovate out of necessity. While the first group confirms findings well described in the literature, the second group seems to be unique to developing markets and to Russia in particular. User-innovation happens also in remote areas, and among user groups outside of the working age. As these user-innovators are reluctant to share their innovations with others and would rather keep them for themselves, a great source of ideas and commercial opportunity remains untouched. Russia’s innovation system has so far concentrated on the classical innovation modes around major cities or big companies. Given Russia’s extensive presence of user-innovators, it might be a promising policy move to provide greater support to existing and emerging amateur communities. We believe that our study adds insights into the informal and totally neglected viewpoint on Russia’s innovation.
H00|Mafia, elections and violence against politicians|Organized crime uses political violence to influence politics in a wide set of countries. This paper exploits a novel dataset of attacks directed towards Italian local politicians to study how (and why) criminal organizations use violence against them. We test two complementary theories to predict the use of violence i) before elections, to affect the electoral outcome; and ii) after elections, to influence politicians from the beginning of their term. We provide causal evidence in favor of the latter hypothesis. The probability of being a target of violence increases in the weeks right after an election in areas with a high presence of organized crime, especially when elections result in a change of local government.
H00|Gordon Tullock and experimental public choice|Abstract In this paper, I discuss Gordon Tullock’s views on Experimentation in Economics, his own research experiment, and his influence on the field of experimental public choice. I argue that Tullock can credibly claim to have been an early supporter of the method and that his work is cited more often than that of other public choice scholars active in the same period. His work on rent seeking forms the basis of an extensive experimental literature and studies on trust, demand revelation and voter turnout have been strongly influenced by Tullock’s work.
H00|Back to Fundamentals: Equilibrium in Abstract Economies|"We propose a new abstract definition of equilibrium in the spirit of competitive equilibrium: a profile of alternatives and a public ordering (expressing prestige, price, or a social norm) such that each agent prefers his assigned alternative to all lower-ranked ones. The equilibrium operates in an abstract setting built upon a concept of convexity borrowed from convex geometry. We apply the concept to a variety of convex economies and relate it to Pareto optimality. The ""magic"" of linear equilibrium prices is put into perspective by establishing an analogy between linear functions in the standard convexity and ""primitive orderings"" in the abstract convexity.

H00|Effects of corruption on efficiency of the European airports|The effect of corruption on airport productive efficiency is analyzed using an unbalanced panel data of major European airports from 2003 to 2009. We first compute the residual (or net) variable factor productivity using the multilateral index number method and then apply robust cluster random effects model in order to evaluate the importance of corruption. We find strong evidence that corruption has negative impacts on airport operating efficiency; and the effects depend on the ownership form of the airport. The results suggest that airports under mixed public–private ownership with private majority achieve lower levels of efficiency when located in more corrupt countries. They even operate less efficiently than fully and/or majority government owned airports in high corruption environment. We control for economic regulation, competition level and other airports’ characteristics. Our empirical results survive several robustness checks including different control variables, three alternative corruption measures: International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) corruption index, Corruption Perception Index (CPI) and Control of Corruption Index (CCI). The empirical findings have important policy implications for management and ownership structuring of airports operating in countries that suffer from higher levels of corruption.
H00|Coordinates of the Absorption Capacity of Structural and Cohesion Funds at EU Level|The structural and cohesion funds are considered an attractive instrument for the funding of investments opportunities especially in times of crisis when the private investments are reduced. Nevertheless, they have not been factually highlighted in order to empirically document the role of European funds in supporting the short-term economic growth, at macroeconomic level. The target of absorbing as much European financial non-refundable aid requires constant efforts made by the member states and administration authorities, the involvement of regional and local public administrations in each stage of the process, as well as an appropriate capacity of institutional structures and management and control systems, they being basic premises of this objective achievement.
H00|Tendencies in the Financial Implementation of Structural and Cohesion Funds in the EU|The considerable differences between Member States of the European Union not only creates specific EU cultural diversity, they are also with an economical nature, with local specificities in each region of the Member States. In order to reduce the economic gaps between different EU Member States, each Member State being in turn divided into various regions, European Union grants financial assistance to Member States in the form of structural funds. In context of the efforts aimed at improving the overall competitiveness of the European Union, European cohesion policy is the most important financial instrument to support the Member States under the Convergence objective, namely to promote economic and social cohesion by reducing disparities starting from regional level.
H00|Itemised Deductions: A Device to Reduce Tax Evasion|" type=""main"" xml:id=""geer12059-abs-0001""> With direct incentives and sanctions being the most common instruments to fight tax evasion, the theoretical literature has tended to overlook indirect schemes, such as itemised deductions, in which one agent's behaviour affects the likelihood that others will declare their revenue. Itemised deductions provide an incentive for consumers to declare their purchases. This induces a partial shift in the demand from the black market to the legal one, for consumers need a transaction receipt to enjoy the tax deduction. I show that it is possible to increase tax proceeds by choosing a suitable level of itemised deduction, and this, for any level of taxation. Indeed, the cost for the tax authority on the consumers' side is more than compensated for by the extra proceeds generated on the sellers' side."
H00|The World Distribution of Income And Its Inequality, 1970–2009|" type=""main""> This paper provides a full decomposition of world inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, in the period 1970–2009. In particular, using the Analysis of Gini (ANOGI), the paper describes the evolution of between inequality, within inequality, and the impact of overlapping on both factors. While there is evidence that between inequality in the last decade significantly declined due to the rapid Chinese growth, within inequality and overlapping went in the opposite direction. Furthermore, with the exception of some Asian countries, the rest of the world has not moved significantly. As a result, world inequality remains high by any standard."
H00|Collective beliefs and horizontal interactions between groups: the case of political parties|Groups matter in our ordinary folk psychology because a part of our social interactions is done with collective entities. In our everyday life, we indeed sometimes ascribe mental states to social groups as a whole or to individuals as members of groups in order to understand and predict their behavior. The aim of this paper is to explore this aspect of social interactions by focusing on the concept of ‘collective belief’ in a non-summative sense and, more precisely, on collective belief of a specific kind of group: the political party. How can the concept of ‘collective belief’ help to understand the interactions which involve these kinds of collective entities? After providing an epistemic description of political parties, this paper focuses on the collective belief in a non-summative sense. As Gilbert says, a group believes that p, if its members are jointly committed to believe that p as a body. It is argued, with the help of an example from the political history of France, that this view can enable us to understand the interaction between political parties. More precisely, it can help clarify the way in which a political party use the rational constraints on the party as a whole and/or the social and epistemic constraints on the behavior of the group's members in order to destabilize or weaken other political parties.
H00|Forms of Democracies and Financial Development|The political economy of finance literature emphasizes the critical role of political institutions in promoting financial development. Related empirical findings highlight a robust positive effect of democratic regimes on financial development compared to dictatorships. However, no study focused so far on identifying the precise political institutions explaining the financial development enhancing effect of democracies. In this paper, we study the effects of disaggregated political institutions on financial development along three institutional dimensions, namely forms of government, electoral rules and state forms. Using a large panel of 140 countries over 1984-2007, we show that institutional details are of crucial importance, since the positive effect of democracies on financial development clearly depends on the precise institutional dimensions at work, namely: parliamentary governments and, to a lesser extent federal states. Thus, our study contributes to the institutional design debate, by showing that the simple promotion of democratic regimes might not be sufficient to foster financial development.
H00|Democracy and Growth: Evidence of a New Measurement|We present a novel approach for measuring democracy based on Support Vector Machines, a mathematical algorithm for pattern recognition. The Support Vector Machines Democracy Index (SVMDI) is continuously on the 0-1-interval and enables a very detailed measurement of democracy for 188 countries between 1981 and 2011. Application of the SVMDI highlights a robust positive relationship between democracy and economic growth. We argue that the ambiguity in recent studies mainly originates from the lack of sensitivity of traditional democracy indicators. Analyzing transmission channels we conclude that democratic countries have better educated populations, higher investment shares, and lower fertility rates, but not necessarily higher levels of redistribution.
H00|Koautorenschaft in der Volkswirtschaftslehre|Es ist ein bekanntes Phänomen, dass die Anzahl der Koautoren in der Volkswirtschaftslehre in den letzten drei Jahrzehnten zugenommen hat. Der Artikel zeigt auf der Basis des bisher größten Datensatzes, dass es einen fortbleibenden Trend zu mehr Koautoren pro Artikel gibt, der wahrscheinlich auch in Zukunft anhalten wird.
H00|Una mirada a las empresas de los estudiantes y egresados: el caso de la Universidad EAN|El objetivo principal del presente estudio de caso fue caracterizar a las empresas de los estudiantes y egresados de la Universidad EAN que transversaliza el tema de emprendimiento en su currículo. Se logró censar 346 empresas, de forma presencial y virtual, de los estudiantes y egresados que afirmaron tener empresa propia o de sus padres. Se les preguntó sobre los datos de la empresa, el uso de tecnología, el acceso al sistema financiero, el nivel de formación de sus recursos humanos, el acceso a mercados, el nivel de asociatividad de las empresas y la innovación empresarial. Los resultados señalan que el mayor porcentaje de las empresas censadas tienen menos de 10 empleados y se concentran principalmente en el sector de servicios, un bajo porcentaje exporta y tienen un limitado acceso al sistema financiero. En promedio las empresas contratan tanto a técnicos como a profesionales por igual, un bajo porcentaje forman parte de clústeres y un 28% cuentan con protocolo de familia.
H00|Factores asociados a las empresas con potencial de crecimiento en la universidad EAN|Resumen El presente artículo tiene como objetivo aportar en la discusión sobre los factores asociados a la creación de empresas dinámicas o con potencial de crecimiento productivo, al analizar los factores relacionados a la empresarialidad con potencial de crecimiento tomando como estudio de caso, las empresas registradas en el censo empresarial de la Universidad EAN en el año 2013. Se realizó un análisis cuantitativo mediante el uso de un modelo logístico binomial para medir el nivel de asociación entre ciertas variables de control sustentadas en la teoría y la empresarialidad con potencial de crecimiento productivo. Entre los principales hallazgos se encontró que la antigüedad de la empresa, la pertenencia a redes empresariales y el desarrollar su actividad productiva en el sector de manufactura aumentan considerablemente la probabilidad de que una empresa tenga potencial de crecimiento productivo.
H00|Una aplicación de la teoría fuzzy al análisis de la pobreza en Antioquia|Este documento tiene como objetivo realizar una aplicación de la metodología fuzzy para el análisis de la pobreza en Antioquia. Para ello se utilizan las mismas dimensiones del índice de pobreza multidimensional del Gobierno colombiano y se realiza un contraste entre los resultados obtenidos con ambas metodologías. En términos de política pública, los resultados de la aplicación metodológica indican que la pertenencia al conjunto de los pobres está determinada por las condiciones de trabajo informal, el analfabetismo, el rezago escolar y condiciones de la vivienda.
H00|A big-picture socioeconomic perspective of Israel: the story of two nations in one|One of the main challenges that economists have in relaying information to senior policy-makers without formal economic training is the conversion of advanced statistical analyses and technical language into clear, descriptive portrayals of core economic issues. In the vacuum that frequently exists, professional advocacy and lobbying providing one-sided perspectives often carries the day. Using Israel as an example, the purpose of this paper is to show how it might be possible to move the focus away from distracting short-term issues to strategically vital long-term ones, to shift analyses from cyclical behavior to long-run trajectories. Israel is a study in contrasts, and as such, much of the prevailing wisdom on the country is based on partial vantage points that often lead to misleading conclusions. It is a country facing existential issues that are primarily domestic and socioeconomic in nature rather than external national security threats as is more commonly perceived. It is also a country that still has time to adopt policies reflecting a turnaround in budgetary priorities – if it begins to comprehend the scope and magnitude of the long-run issues not currently on its national radar. The issues that Israel faces are not unique to the country. Many are present in one form or another in other countries that may soon have to deal with some of the major policy issues that Israel needs to address today.
H00|Electoral Competition with Rationally Inattentive Voters|This paper studies how voters optimally allocate costly attention in a model of probabilistic voting. The equilibrium solves a modified social planning problem that reflects voters' choice of attention. Voters are more attentive when their stakes are higher, when their cost of information is lower and prior uncertainty is higher. We explore the implications of this in avariety of applications. In equilibrium, extremist voters are more influential and public goods are under-provided. The analysis also yields predictions about the equilibrium pattern of information, and about policy divergence by two opportunistic candidates. Endogenous attention can lead to multiple equilibria, explaining how poor voters in developing countries can be politically empowered by welfare programs.
H00|Optimal Income Taxations with Information Asymmetry: The Lagrange Multiplier Approach|This paper considers a general class dynamic optimal problem with incen- tive compatible constraints. The first-order conditions are derived using the Lagrange multiplier method. Applied the methods developed here, the optimal taxation problems studied by Mirrlees (1971) and Golosov et al. (2003) for more general form utility function are reexamined in this paper. The explicit solutions for optimal income taxations are derived in this paper. Finally, we present numerical solutions for optimal income taxations.
H00|Economic Impact Of Flood Disaster Between 1980-2015 Years: The Sample Of Turkey|Disasters are generally events that affecting communities the normal life and human activities with stopping and interrupting ,causing physical, economical and social losses. After earthquakes,over flows and floods have great importance because most of life and property losses occured after water overflows. Due to the geographic location of our country,disasters like earthquakes,landslides,floods are often seen. In this study, flood disasters that occurred between the years of 1980-2015 in Turkey , which in that year and what happened in the city, and how the loss of life and property as a result it has been emphasized that occur. Among this years ,overflow floods and river floods were occured in our country ,affected 1775.520 person and cause a total of 2195.500 ('000 ABD $) damage.
H00|Sex and happiness|We examine the relationship between sexual activities and happiness using a sample of 3800 adults from China. We provide some results about the relationship between sexual activities and happiness for an important country other than the United States. We find that those who have more sex and better quality sex, proxied by emotional and physical satisfaction with one's primary sex partner, are happier. We find that the happiness maximizing number of sexual partners is one and that engaging in extramarital sex is negatively related to happiness. A third important finding is that having unwanted sex is associated with lower happiness for both men and women.
H00|The Tax Evasion Models Under Stimulation And Penalty Conditions|Purpose of article – classification of economic and institutional components of the tax capacity and determination of current and projected estimates of government efforts. Design/methodology – estimation of the total tax capacity based on active indicators, evaluation of efforts of institutions fiscal policy on the basis of a representative the tax system with the help of modeling tax evasion. Findings – determination of primary tax evasion sectors based on economic (cash transactions, tax revenues, tax credits and exemptions, hidden economy, and so on.) and institutional (legal, administrative, financial etc.) factors, as well as evaluation of their current and expected results. Research limitations – lack of information, potential lost due to illegal activities lawfully and unlawfully established subjects. Practical implications – analysis of the impact of the existing rules on the formation of the tax potential and its taxable portion in the form of tax revenues. Originality/value – estimation of the total tax capacity and proposal of a methodological approach to estimate the impact of change in GDP, as well as legislative and administrative efforts on tax capacity.
H00|Market failure vs. system failure as a rationale for economic policy? A critique from an evolutionary perspective|Abstract This paper reconsiders the explanation of economic policy from an evolutionary economics perspective. It contrasts the neoclassical equilibrium notions of market and government failure with the dominant evolutionary neo-Schumpeterian and Austrian-Hayekian perceptions. Based on this comparison, the paper criticizes the fact that neoclassical reasoning still prevails in non-equilibrium evolutionary economics when economic policy issues are examined. This is more than surprising, since proponents of evolutionary economics usually view their approach as incompatible with its neoclassical counterpart. In addition, it is shown that this “fallacy of failure thinking” even finds its continuation in the alternative concept of “system failure” with which some evolutionary economists try to explain and legitimate policy interventions in local, regional or national innovation systems. The paper argues that in order to prevent the otherwise fruitful and more realistic evolutionary approach from undermining its own criticism of neoclassical economics and to create a consistent as well as objective evolutionary policy framework, it is necessary to eliminate the equilibrium spirit. Finally, the paper delivers an alternative evolutionary explanation of economic policy which is able to overcome the theory-immanent contradiction of the hitherto evolutionary view on this subject.
H00|International Currency Exposures, Valuation Effects, and the Global Financial Crisis|"We examine the evolution of international currency exposures, with a particular focus on the 2002-12 period. During the run up to the global financial crisis, there was a widespread shift towards positive net foreign currency positions, such that relatively few countries exhibited the archetypal emerging-market short foreign currency"" position on the eve of the global financial crisis. During the crisis, the upheaval in currency markets generated substantial currency-generated valuation effects - much of which were not reversed. There is some evidence that the distribution of valuation effects was stabilizing in the sense of showing a negative covariation pattern with pre-crisis net foreign asset positions.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
H00|Is crowding out due entirely to fundraising? Evidence from a panel of charities|When the government gives a grant to a private charitable organization, do the donors to that organization give less? If they do, is it because the grants crowd out donors who feel they gave through taxes (classic crowd out), or is it because the grant crowds out the fundraising of the charities who, after getting the grant, reduce efforts of fundraising (fundraising crowd-out)? This is the first paper to separate these two effects. Using a panel of more than 8000 charities, we find that crowding out is significant, at about 75%. We find this crowding out is due primarily to reduced fundraising. Depending on which types of organizations are included in the analysis, crowding out attributable to classic crowd-out ranges from 30% to a slight crowd-in effect, while fundraising crowd-out ranges from 70% to over 100% of all crowd-out. Such a finding could have important consequences for how governments structure grants to non-profits. Our results indicate, for example, that requirements that charities match a fraction of government grants with increases in private donations might be a feasible policy that could reduce the detrimental effects of crowding out.

H00|La descentralización y las disparidades económicas regionales en Colombia en la década de 1990|La década de 1990 fue de profundos cambios para la economía colombiana y las instituciones que la rigen. Muchos de ellos son fruto de la Constitución de 1991, como por ejemplo la descentralización fiscal. En este trabajo estudiamos el proceso de descentralización colombiano durante la década de 1990 desde una óptica regional, y haciendo especial énfasis en las disparidades existentes tanto en el Producto Interno Bruto, PIB, como en las transferencias de recursos a las regiones. Además, se presenta la evidencia que muestra que durante la primera década de la descentralización introducida por la Constitución de 1991 aumentaron las disparidades económicas territoriales en Colombia. También se ilustra cómo las transferencias fiscales no contribuyeron a reducir esa inequidad. Para finalizar, se hace una propuesta para la creación de un Fondo de Compensación para combatir las profundas inequidades regionales en Colombia.
