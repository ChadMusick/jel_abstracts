J43|Corporate social responsibility and the role of rural women in sustainable agricultural development in sub‐Saharan Africa: Evidence from the Niger Delta in Nigeria|Low productivity among female farmers when compared with their male counterparts is considered an outcome of limited access to agricultural land and inputs. The objective of this investigation was to assess the impact of multinational oil companies' (MOCs') corporate social responsibility (CSR) on rural women's access to modern agricultural inputs in the Niger Delta, Nigeria. A total of 700 rural female farmers were sampled across the region. Results from the use of a logit model indicated that CSR recorded significant success in agricultural development generally, but has undermined equality. This implies that if a woman's agricultural productivity is continuously hindered by unequal access to agricultural resources (or opportunities) and widespread inequality will limit poverty reduction efforts in Nigeria. The results also showed that women depended on CSR of MOCs for policy dialogue and advocacy for women's access to agricultural land and inputs. Supporting agricultural initiatives that focus on empowering women would boost food security in sub‐Saharan Africa.
J43|Multinational Oil Companies in Nigeria and Corporate Social Responsibility in the HIV/AIDS Response in Host Communities|We assess the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) of multinational oil companies (MOCs) on HIV/AIDS prevalence in Nigeria’s oil producing communities. One thousand, two hundred households were sampled across the rural communities of Niger Delta. Using logit model, the main result indicates that General Memorandum of Understandings (GMoUs) have not significantly impacted on factors behind the spread of HIV/AIDS in rural communities. This implies that the impact of the disease on MOCs business, employees and their families, contractors, business partners and the oil communities has not inclined downward. The findings suggest that CSR offers an opportunity for MOCs to help address HIV/AIDS prevalence through a business case for stakeholders’ health in the region. It calls for MOCs to improve GMoUs health intervention on sensitization campaigns, funding testing and counselling centers, subsidizing anti-retroviral drugs, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, rehabilitation of orphaned and vulnerable children and other cares for people living with AIDS.

J43|Corporate Social Responsibility in Nigeria and Rural Youths in Sustainable Traditional Industries Livelihood in Oil Producing Communities|Since the first oil well was drilled in Nigeria, traditional economies have suffered neglect, and rural youths do not see a future for themselves in traditional industries livelihood (TIL). We examine the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) of multinational oil companies (MOCs) on youths’ participation in TIL. A total of 1200 youths were sampled across the rural Niger Delta. Results from the use of a logit model indicate a significant relationship between CSR and TIL. The findings suggest increased general memorandum of understanding (GMoU) interventions in canoe-carving, pottery-making, cloth-weaving, mat-making, and basket-weaving to revive the traditional economic activities in Nigeria.
J43|Corporate social responsibility in Nigeria and multinational corporations in the fight against human trafficking in oil-producing communities|In Nigeria, human trafficking is a hidden crime, driven by the current economic situation of the country. The Nigerian government has demonstrated significant efforts to combating human trafficking in the country by creating the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP). The incidents of human trafficking in the Nigeriaâ€™s oil-producing communities have remained among the highest in the country and higher than the national average. The objective of this investigation was to determine the impact of a new corporate social responsibility (CSR) model of multinational oil companies (MOCs) on the fight against human trafficking in the host communities. A total of one thousand, two hundred households were sampled across the rural communities of Niger Delta. Results from the use of a combined propensity score matching and logit model indicated that MOCs hold the key to combating human trafficking by fostering effective partnership across different sectors, if highest CSR priority is assigned to reducing incidents of human trafficking in the oil-producing communities. Embracing the fight against human trafficking should form the foundation of General Memorandum of Understanding (GMoUs) practice, which in turn will provide the enabling environment for more widespread responsible business. As most of the human trafficking in the Niger Delta is exploited by relatives or friends; MOCs should involve traditional and religious leaders in the fight and set up GMoU clusters interventions specifically for anti-trafficking agencies including NAPTIP, the police and immigration to support their actions and improve efficiency.
J43|Firms and Farms: The Local Effects of Farm Income on Firms’ Demand|How do changes in agricultural productivity affect firms? Using the predictions of a simple multi-sector general equilibrium model of the local economy and exploiting weather-induced agricultural volatility across India, I estimate the response of manufacturing firms to changes in agricultural productivity. I show that negative agricultural productivity shocks lower the cost of labor but that this does not cause firms to hire more. Firms’ production and employment in fact decrease because the shocks also reduce local income and hence the demand that firms face. My estimates provide evidence for a significant local demand effect. I then use my framework to show that this has key policy implications. I examine the introduction of a rural workfare program and assess how it affects firms. I show that the program attenuates the impact of negative agricultural shocks on firms because of its counter-cyclical effects on local wage and demand for manufacturing goods. The results highlight how policies that target households and increase their income can affect local market size and therefore the industrial sector through their general equilibrium effects.
J43|Structural Transformation, Industrial Specialization, and Endogenous Growth|The introduction of new technologies in agriculture can foster structural transformation by freeing workers who find occupation in other sectors. The traditional view is that this increase in labor supply in manufacturing can lead to industrial development. However, when workers moving to manufacturing are mostly unskilled, this process reinforces a country's comparative advantage in low-skill intensive industries. To the extent that these industries undertake less R&D, this change in industrial composition can lead to lower long-run growth. We provide empirical evidence of this mechanism using a large and exogenous increase in agricultural productivity due to the legalization of genetically engineered soy in Brazil. Our results indicate that improvements in agricultural productivity, while positive in the short-run, can generate specialization in less-innovative industries and have negative effects on productivity in the long-run.
J43|Café ¿alternativa para la sustitución de cultivos de uso ilícito?|Uno de los principales retos para la consolidación del Acuerdo Final entre la guerrilla de las FARC y el Gobierno de Colombia tiene que ver con la sustitución de cultivos de uso ilícito por otros que brinden mejores condiciones económicas, como el caso del café. El presente documento busca responder si cultivar café es una alternativa económicamente viable para la sustitución de dichos cultivos. Para ello, se usan datos cuantitativos que permiten realizar un análisis comparativo entre el cultivo del café y el cultivo de la coca. Los resultados muestran las fuertes dificultades que no solo afronta el café, sino cualquier otro cultivo, frente a la coca en cuanto a rendimientos y precio. Estas condiciones configuran un gran reto para el Gobierno Nacional en la consolidación y desempeño de la sustitución de cultivos ilícitos. *** One of the main challenges for the consolidation of the Final Agreement between FARC guerrillas and the Colombian Government has to do with the substitution of illicit crops by others that offer better economic conditions, such as coffee. This paper seeks to answer whether growing coffee is an economically viable alternative for the substitution of illicit crops. For this purpose, quantitative data is used to carry out a comparative analysis between coffee and coca. The results show the strong difficulties faced not only buy coffee but by any other crop, against coca in terms of yields and price. This conditions constitutes a great challenge for the National Government in the consolidation and performance of the substitution of illicit crops.
J43|Del papel a la sustitución de cultivos ilícitos: análisis de la implementación del punto 4 del Acuerdo de paz en el departamento del Cauca|El punto cuatro del Acuerdo de paz entre el Gobierno colombiano y las FARC-EP, que aborda la solución al problema de los cultivos ilícitos, no ha tenido un grado homogéneo de implementación a lo largo del territorio nacional. Este estudio analiza las propuestas realizadas antes y después de la firma del Acuerdo para dar solución a esta situación en el departamento del Cauca. Se encuentran tres aspectos principales. En primer lugar, existe un aparente fracaso en las políticas antidrogas implementadas hasta antes de los acuerdos de paz en el departamento, especialmente asociado a la ineficiencia de la aspersión aérea de glifosato. En segundo lugar, existe un bajo grado de implementación de las disposiciones del punto 4 en el territorio. En tercer lugar, existe una serie de violaciones sistemáticas de DD.HH a líderes sociales del Cauca, especialmente hacia aquellos que apoyan la sustitución voluntaria de cultivos ilícitos. *** Point four of the Peace Agreement between Colombian Government and the FARC-EP, which addresses problem of illicit crops, has not had a homogeneous degree of implementation throughout the national territory. This study analyzes the proposals made before and after the signing of the Agreement to solve this situation in the department of Cauca. There are three main aspects. First, there is an apparent failure in the anti-drug policies implemented in the department prior to the peace accords, especially associated with the inefficiency of aerial spray of glyphosate. Secondly, there is a low degree of implementation of the provisions of point 4 in the territory. Third, there is a series of systematic human rights violations against social leaders in Cauca, especially those that support the voluntary substitution of illegal crops.

J43|The Role of Weather on Schooling and Work of Young Adults in Madagascar|We examine the impact of rainfall variability and cyclones on schooling and work among a cohort of teens and young adults in Madagascar. We estimate a bivariate probit model using a panel survey conducted in 2004 and 2011 in this poor island nation, which is frequently affected by extreme weather events. Our results show that negative rainfall deviations and cyclones reduce the probability of attending school and encourage young men and, to a greater extent, women to enter the work force, and they reduce their French and math test scores. Less wealthy households are most likely to experience this school- to-work transition in the face of rainfall shocks. The finding is consistent with poorer households having less savings and more limited access to credit and insurance, which reduces their ability to cope with rainfall shortages. We also find that there are both contemporaneous and lagged effects of the weather shocks, and that they are of a similar magnitude. Our findings are robust to the use of a linear probability model, as well as a wide range of definitions of rainfall variations.
J43|Incentivizing Learning-By-Doing: The Role of Compensation Schemes|In this paper, we examine the impact of pay-for-performance incentives on learning-by-doing. We exploit personnel data on fruit pickers paid under two distinct compensation contracts: a standard piece rate plan and a piece rate plan with an extra one-time bonus tied to output. Under the bonus contract, we observe bunching of performance just above the bonus threshold, suggesting workers distort their behavior in response to the discrete bonus. Such bunching behavior increases as workers gain experience. At the same time, the bonus contract induces considerable learning-by-doing for workers throughout the productivity distribution, and these improvements significantly outweigh the losses to the firm from the distortionary bunching. In contrast, under the standard piece rate contract, we find minimal evidence of bunching and only small performance improvements at the bottom of the productivity distribution. Our results suggest that contract design can help foster learning on the job. This underscores the importance of dynamic considerations in principal-agent models.
J43|Protection and Profit: Empirical Evidence of Governmental and Market-based Forest Policies|In this paper, I study the effectiveness of privately managed FSC certified forests and public sustainability reserves distributed over the entire Brazilian Amazon from 2002-2015. The paper uses high-resolution data on forest cover derived from satellite images and organized in a grid of 1 km2 cells. Using a difference-in-differences estimator in a regression discontinuity environment, I find an increase in deforestation of an annual area of 8,057 ha in FSC forests after the certification. Public sustainability zones' impact on deforestation is also positive but declines over time. The effectiveness of both type of zones improves if they are located closer to (export) markets or existing infrastructure.

J43|Scabs: The Social Suppression of Labor Supply|Social norms have the potential to alter the functioning of economic markets. We test whether norms shape the aggregate labor supply curve by preventing workers from supplying labor at wage cuts—leading decentralized individuals to implicitly behave as a cartel to maintain wage floors in their local labor markets. We partner with 183 existing employers, who offer jobs to 502 workers in informal spot labor markets in India. Unemployed workers are privately willing to accept jobs below the prevailing wage, but rarely do so when this choice is observable to other workers. In contrast, social observability does not affect labor supply at the prevailing wage. Workers give up 49% of average weekly earnings to avoid being seen as breaking the social norm. In addition, workers pay to punish anonymous laborers who have accepted wage cuts—indicating that cartel behavior is reinforced through the threat of social sanctions. Punishment occurs for workers in one’s own labor market and for those in distant regions, suggesting the internalization of norms in moral terms. Finally, consistent with the idea that norms could have aggregate implications, measures of social cohesion correlate with downward wage rigidity and business cycle volatility across India.
J43| Oferta de trabajo del hogar remunerado en el Perú rural: 2015 – 2017| El objetivo de este artículo es analizar la evolución del trabajo del hogar remunerado (THR) en el Perú rural, así como los determinantes de la oferta de trabajo del hogar en dicho sector. Debido al diseño de la encuesta solamente contamos con los datos familiares de las trabajadoras del hogar remuneradas “cama afuera”; sin embargo, el porcentaje de trabajadoras del hogar remuneradas “cama adentro” es muy bajo y su inclusión no afecta las estimaciones. Dado que esta actividad es llevada a cabo en su mayoría por mujeres, y que es una entre otras alternativas laborales, postulamos que al haber menos alternativas en el sector rural, al contrario que en el sector urbano, el trabajo del hogar remunerado no es un empleo de refugio. Sobre la base de un modelo teórico de consumidor – productor, encontramos los determinantes de ofrecer la fuerza laboral a ésta actividad en relación a otras actividades, el desempleo y la inactividad. Asimismo, los determinantes de las horas ofrecidas, tanto al trabajo del hogar remunerado (THR) como a otras ocupaciones. Debido al reducido número de casos, para el trabajo empírico empleamos un pool con los datos de las ENAHO 2015 – 2017. Encontramos que los ingresos por hora en el THR son mayores que los ingresos de las mujeres en otras ocupaciones rurales. Asimismo, si bien a mayor nivel de educación es más probable que las mujeres rurales estén empleadas, el efecto marginal es mayor para las otras ocupaciones que para el THR. Las mujeres jefas de hogar, así como las casadas o convivientes tienen mayor probabilidad de trabajar en otras ocupaciones que en el THR. En el caso de la oferta de THR la elasticidad horas – salario es negativa y significativa, siendo de -0.0271 para el pool y similar para cada año por separado. En el caso de otras ocupaciones, la relación entre los ingresos y las horas trabajadas es positiva. Las obligaciones familiares reducen las horas ofrecidas al THR y aumentan las horas ofrecidas a otros trabajos. Finalmente, las jornadas de trabajo son más largas para las mujeres en la sierra y en la selva, respecto a la costa rural. JEL Classification-JEL: J15, J16, J21, J43, J46
J43|Is India’s Employment Guarantee Program Successfully Challenging Her Historical Inequalities?|By providing 100 days of guaranteed employment to every rural household, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) can challenge the hegemony of the landed elite as major employers in the Indian countryside and raise market wages which have long been depressed. This paper shows that the impact of NREGA is conditioned and complicated by historical inequalities in agricultural landownership which have persisted since the colonial period. I find that in the lean season of agriculture, the program is highly successful in raising wages and generating more public employment in districts that were not characterized by historically high levels of socio-economic inequality. In these districts, the increase in public employment crowds-out labor primarily from domestic work, reflected in increased women’s participation in the program. However, high inequality in landownership adversely impacts the bargaining power of workers and the enforcement of their entitlements under NREGA. This is most evident when I examine the impact of NREGA on rural wages. I find that in districts where land is concentrated in the hands of relatively few large landowners, private agricultural wages declined despite NREGA, whereas they remain largely unchanged in districts that have more equitable land distribution. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that NREGA has not become a credible alternative to private employment in regions with high land inequality.
J43|Young Rural Women Participation in the E-Wallet Programme and Usage Intensity of Modern Agricultural Inputs in Nigeria|We assess the extent young rural women (YRW) participate in the federal government (FGN)e-wallet programme and the subsequent impact on usage intensity of modern agricultural inputs in Nigeria. Six hundred YRW were sampled across six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. Using double-hurdle, results show that YRW rarely participate in the e-wallet programme due to the cultural and traditional context which is anchored in beliefs, norms and practices that breed discrimination and feminized poverty. This implies that Nigeriaâ€™s agricultural transformation agenda would only succeed if the FGN is able to draw on all its resources and talents, and if the YRW can be able to participate fully in the e-wallet programme. This will require intensified efforts to eliminate discrimination and promote equalities. To bridge the gender gap, the federal ministry of agriculture and rural development should pay close attention to the extent the participation of unmarried girls and young women, including nursing mothers in the e-wallet programme, may be limited by the cultural and/or domestic and child care duties. The findings suggest that FGN should discourage gender disparities in unequal access to agricultural inputs and pervasive, inequality, especially over ownership of agricultural land that limit womenâ€™s contribution to household food baskets.
J43|Adoption of improved crop varieties by involving farmers in the e-wallet program in Nigeria|The amount of improved seed used in Nigeria is extremely low. Overall, only 5 to 10 percent of cultivated land is planted with improved seeds, and about 10 percent of rural farmers use improved varieties. The objective of this investigation was to identify determinants of adoption of improved seed by farmers not participating in and those participating in the federal governmentâ€™s e-wallet program in Nigeria. We determined the impact of the e-wallet program on adoption of improved seed in rural areas. One thousand, two hundred (1200) rural farmers were sampled across six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. Results from the use of a bivariate probit model indicated that the e-wallet program continued to become increasingly popular among rural farmers; and that farmersâ€™ literacy, ownership of a mobile phone, value output, mobile network coverage, power for charging phone batteries and contact with extension agents were the positive determinants of farmer participation in thee-wallet program. Cultural obstacles to married women, growersâ€™ age, and increased distance to registration and input collection centers reduced farmersâ€™ tendency to participate in the e-wallet program. The results also showed that rural farmers depended on the e-wallet program for increased use and adoption of improved seed in Nigeria, to boost food security in sub-Saharan Africa. The results suggested the need for an improved e-wallet model by lessening constraints mostly associated with rural information and communication infrastructure, and distance to the registration and input collection centers.

J43|Jobs and Agricultural Policy: Impact of the Common Agricultural Policy on EU Agricultural Employment|This paper investigates the relationship between EU agricultural subsidies and the outflow of labor from agriculture. We use more representative subsidy indicators and a wider coverage (panel data from 210 EU regions over the period 2004-2014) than has been used before. The data allow to better correct for sample selection bias than previous empirical studies. We find that, on average, CAP subsidies reduce the outflow of labor from agriculture, but the effect is almost entirely due to decoupled Pillar I payments and the impact of Pillar II is mixed. Coupled Pillar I payments have no impact on reducing labor outflow from agriculture, i.e. on preserving jobs in agriculture. The impact of Pillar II is mixed. Our estimates predicts that a decline of 10 percent of the CAP budget would cause an extra 16,000 people to leave EU agriculture each year. A 10 percent decoupling would save 13,000 agricultural jobs each year.
J43|The productivity of family and hired labour in EU arable farming| This paper investigates the impact of labour force composition on productivity in EU arable farming. We test the heterogeneity of family and hired labour for a set of eight EU member states. To this end, we estimate augmented production functions using FADN data for the years 2001-2008. The results reject the notion that hired labour is generally less productive than family workers. In fact, hired labour is more productive than family members in countries traditionally characterised by family farms, namely France, West Germany and Poland. Here, an increase in reliance on hired labour or the shift of family labour to more productive tasks could raise productivity. This finding calls into question a main pillar of the received family farm theory. In about half the countries, there are no statistically different effects of both types of labour. For the United Kingdom, we find the classical case with family labour being more productive than hired labour. In this situation supervision by family members could increase productivity.
J43|Market access, agricultural productivity and selection into trade: evidence from Colombia|We study the impact of the selection of farmers into trade on agricultural productivity using new data on the universe of farms in Colombia. To guide our analysis, we formulate a spatial economy model where better market access induces high skill farmers to switch from subsistence to cash crops that are traded in urban centers. We estimate reduced form effects of market access using distance to historical settlements as an instrument and calibrate our model according to these effects. Structural estimates indicate that the selection of farmers into trade have a large effect on agricultural productivity. **** RESUMEN: En este documento estudiamos la elección que hacen los agricultores entre la producción de cultivos comerciales con altos costos fijos y la producción de cultivos de subsistencia con menores costos de producción. Formulamos un modelo de economía espacial en el que un mejor acceso al mercado induce a agricultores de mayor habilidad a pasar de la producción de cultivos de subsistencia a la producción de cultivos que se comercializan en los centros urbanos. Probamos las predicciones del modelo utilizando datos para Colombia que provienen del Tercer Censo Nacional Agropecuario. Explotamos la variación exógena en la ubicación de los asentamientos indígenas en el siglo XVI para estimar efectos de forma reducida del acceso al mercado sobre la decisión de producir cultivos comerciales. Utilizamos los resultados de estas estimaciones para calcular los efectos sobre la productividad agrícola de la existencia de altos costos fijos en la producción de cultivos comerciales. Los restados sugieren que las barreras a la entrada que imponen estos costos fijos en la producción de cultivos comerciales tienen un efecto importante sobre la productividad del sector agrícola en Colombia.
J43|School or work?The role of weather shocks in Madagascar|We examine the impact of rainfall variability and cyclones on schooling and work among a cohort of teens and young adults by estimating a bivariate probit model, using a panel survey conducted in 2004 and 2011 in MadagascarÑa poor island nation that is frequently affected by extreme weather events. Our results show that negative rainfall deviations and cyclones reduce the current and lagged probability of attending school and encourage young men and, to a greater extent, women to enter the work force. Less wealthy households are most likely to experience this school-to-work transition in the face of rainfall shocks. The finding is consistent with poorer households having less savings and more limited access to credit and insurance, whichreduces their ability to cope with negative weather shocks.
J43|Conectando mercados: vías rurales y producción agrícola en el contexto de una economía dual|Las economías en desarrollo se caracterizan por la coexistencia de sectores tradicionales y modernos, resultado de fallas de mercado, principalmente, costos de transacción. Las vías rurales son uno de los mecanismos para suavizar estas fricciones pues facilitan el acceso a mercados. Estudio el efecto que cambios en la calidad de las vías rurales tienen sobre las decisiones de producción agrícola de los hogares colombianos y encuentro efectos heterogéneos según la distancia a los mercados nacionales y locales. Los hogares centrales reducen su producción mientras los hogares periféricos la expanden, se vuelven más productivos e intensifican el uso de insumos. Este trabajo se une a la literatura que analiza el impacto de vías rurales sobre la productividad agrícola y el cambio estructural.
J43|Economic Shocks and Internal Migration|Previous literature shows that internal migration rates are strongly procyclical. This would seem to imply that geographic relocation does not help mitigate negative local economic shocks during recessions. This paper shows that this is not the case. I document that net in-migration rates decreased in areas more affected by the Great Recession. Using various IV strategies that rely on the importance of the construction sector and the indebtedness of households before the crisis, I conclude that internal migration might help to alleviate up to one third of the effects of the crisis on wages in the most affected locations. This is due to a disproportionate decrease in in-migration into those locations rather than an increase in out-migration. More generally, I show that differences in population growth rates across locations are mainly explained by differences in in-migration rates rather than in out-migration rates. I introduce a model to guide the empirical analysis and to quantify the spill-over effects caused by internal migration.
J43|An Offer that you Can't Refuse? Agrimafias and Migrant Labor on Vineyards in Southern Italy|In the 2011 post-Arab Spring migration wave, over 64,000 migrants landed on the southern Italian coast, with many of them potentially working illegally on farms through caporalato, a widespread system of illegal recruitment of underpaid farm labor run by Italian agrimafias. To test this hypothesis, this paper evaluates the causal effects of the 2011 migration wave on reported labor productivity focusing on vineyards in southern Italy. Based on a dynamic panel data model, labor productivity is estimated to increase by about 11% on average for 2011 and 2012. We show that this corresponds to a total of around 10 million unreported work hours, or 21,000 full-time employees, in each year. We interpret this as an increase in employment of illegal workforce due to the migration wave. Magnitude, direction, and statistical significance of the effect are confirmed under various model specifications and using synthetic control and post-lasso approaches.
J43|Operationalizing Seasonal Work in Germany| Due to a lack of sector-overarching, frequent and representative data, only little is known about the prevalence of seasonal workers in the German labor market and, in particular, about their working conditions such as forms of employment, working hours or even wages. We estimate seasonal work in Germany using a custom, representative sample of the Employment History (BeH) of the Federal Employment Agency (BA) that encompasses information on short-term employees that are new to scientific research. We achieve a reasonable fit to the – less frequent and sectorally restricted – Farm Structure Survey by the German Federal Statistical Office suggesting our method for future analyses of seasonal work. Our analyses reveal large differences between economic sectors, the share of seasonal work being highest in agriculture and forestry, followed by hotels and restaurants. While in agriculture and forestry the vast majority of seasonal workers is given by short-term employment, in the hotel and restaurant industry marginally paid (part-time) employment is the dominant type. Since 2012, the number of seasonal workers has increased in all investigated economic sectors. That said, there are hardly any signs of significant spikes since the introduction of the general minimum wage in 2015.
J43|Jobs and Agricultural Policy : Impact of the Common Agricultural Policy on EU Agricultural Employment| This paper investigates the relationship between agricultural subsidies and the outflow of labor from agriculture. We use new and more representative subsidy indicators than have been used before and panel data from 215 EU regions over the period 2004-2014. The data allow to correct better for sample selection bias than previous empirical studies. We find that, on average, CAP subsidies reduce the outflow of labor from agriculture, but the effect is entirely due to decoupled payments and rural development payments. Coupled payments have no impact on reducing labor outflow from agriculture, i.e. on preserving farm employment. Acknowledgement :

Less wealthy households are most likely to experience this school-to-work transition in the face of rainfall shocks. The finding is consistent with poorer households having less savings and more limited access to credit and insurance, which reduces their ability to cope with negative weather shocks.
J43|Seasonal Liquidity, Rural Labor Markets and Agricultural Production|Many rural households in low and middle income countries continue to rely on small-scale agriculture as their primary source of income. In the absence of irrigation, income arrives only once or twice per year, and has to cover consumption and input needs until the subsequent harvest. We develop a model to show that seasonal liquidity constraints not only undermine households’ ability to smooth consumption over the cropping cycle, but also affect labor markets if liquidity-constrained farmers sell family labor off-farm to meet short-run cash needs. To identify the impact of seasonal constraints on labor allocation and agricultural production, we conducted a two-year randomized controlled trial with small-scale farmers in rural Zambia. Our results indicate that lowering the cost of accessing liquidity at the time of the year when farmers are most constrained (the lean season) reduces aggregate labor supply, drives up wages and leads to a reallocation of labor from less to more liquidity-constrained farms. This reallocation reduces consumption and income inequality among treated farmers and increases average agricultural output.
J43|The Economics of African American Slavery: The Cliometrics Debate|This working paper explores the significant contributions to the history of African-American slavery made by the application of the tools of cliometrics. As used here “cliometrics” is defined as a method of scientific analysis marked by the explicit use of economic theory and quantitative methods. American slavery of the late antebellum period [1840-1860] was one of the earliest topics that cliometricians focused on and, arguably, the topic upon which they made the largest impact.
J43|Agriculture, Food and Jobs in West Africa|The food economy is the biggest employer in West Africa accounting for 66% of total employment. While the majority of food economy jobs are in agriculture, off-farm employment in food-related manufacturing and service activities is increasing as the food economy adapts to rapid population growth, urbanisation and rising incomes. Given the importance of the food economy in generating employment, its current structure and projected changes have major implications for the design of jobs strategies. This paper quantifies and describes the structure of employment in the food economy across four broad segments of activities: agriculture, processing, marketing and food-away-from home. It also examines some of the emerging spatial implications, in particular rural-urban linkages and rural employment diversification, which are related to the transformations that are reshaping this sector. Finally, it looks at policy considerations for designing targeted employment strategies that leverage the links between agricultural productivity, off-farm employment and rural-urban areas and ensure inclusiveness, particularly for youth and women.
J43|Agriculture, alimentation et emploi en Afrique de l’Ouest|L’économie alimentaire est le premier employeur en Afrique de l’Ouest, avec 66% de l’emploi total. Bien que la majorité de ces emplois soient encore dans l’agriculture, les activités non agricoles liées à l’alimentation progressent à mesure que le secteur s’adapte à l’évolution démographique, à l’urbanisation et à la croissance des revenus. Compte tenu du nombre d’emplois concernés, disposer d’une vision claire des perspectives de l’économie alimentaire est essentiel. Cette Note vise à quantifier et décrire la répartition de l’emploi dans les segments de l’agriculture, de la transformation, de la commercialisation et de la restauration hors domicile. Elle analyse les implications spatiales des transformations en cours, en particulier les interactions urbain-rural et la diversification de l’emploi rural. Enfin, elle propose des pistes politiques pour des stratégies d’emploi ciblées qui optimisent les synergies entre productivité agricole, emploi non agricole et interactions urbain-rural, et garantissent l’inclusion, en particulier des jeunes et des femmes.
J43|Gender Wage Gap in The Agricultural Labor Market of India: An Empirical Analysis|The gender wage gap in the agricultural labor market is observed in all the states of India. This paper will try to identify possible policies which can reduce this gender wise wage discrimination in agricultural labor market. We consider the period between 2010-11 to 2015-16 and 18 major states of India. The possible factors which can create an impact on gender wage gap are the expansion of MGNREGP, Self Help Group, primary education among rural women, expenditure on the social sector as a percentage of Net state domestic products and the cropping intensity. It initially assumes that Cropping Intensity of a state in a specific time is very much dependent on the net irrigated area of that state in that time. Our endogeneity test supports our claim. So, Instrumental variable method is applied in our Fixed Effect panel regression. The result shows that expansion of primary education among women, the number of self-help groups in the state and enhancement of cropping intensity through improving irrigation facility can play a significant role to reduce the male and female wage discrimination in the agricultural labor market in India. But participation of women in MGNREGP and social sector expenditure as a percentage of NSDP fails to create any impact on the gender wage gap.
J43|Does education enhance productivity in smallholder agriculture? Causal evidence from Malawi|Malawi is a low-income country where the majority of the poor live and work in smallholder agriculture. In settings like these, schooling is believed to be a valuable tool in lifting people out of poverty. Yet, little is known about how schooling affects agricultural productivity. The effect of education on smallholder agricultural production has been estimated before but this paper contributes to the literature by estimating, for the first time, the causal effects of education on agricultural productivity using an instrumental variable approach (IV). The introduction of free primary education (FPE) and the age of paternal orphanhood are used as IV's for education. The instruments are shown to calculate local average treatment effects for individuals who only entered school due to FPE and only left school due to paternal orphanhood. It is found that there are large differences in returns to education between the subgroups. Returns are low and insignificant when FPE is used as an IV but they are larger and there is a significant effect when age of paternal orphanhood is used. Thus, while education can have large effects on agricultural productivity, this is not so for individuals specifically targeted by large scale expansions in educational access.
J43|Sectoral minimum wages in South Africa: disemployment by firm size and trade exposure|This paper measures the impact of South African minimum wages on small and large firm employment in a sector that is exposed to international competition (agriculture) and one that is not (retail). Our results highlight that small firms in a tradable sector are the most vulnerable to minimum wage legislation. In particular, small farms shed jobs, while larger farms employed more unskilled workers as a result of minimum wages. Small firms were more affected by the minimum wage as they employed a higher proportion of low-skilled, low-wage workers. In contrast, large farms employed a lower proportion of low-skilled workers and used a more capital-intensive production process and were thus less affected by the legislation. While this shift represents a short-run response to minimum wages, it intensifies a long-run movement towards fewer, larger, more capital-intensive farms. Retail firms, on the other hand, do not exhibit the same behaviour, with zero employment losses in both small and large firms. This difference in result can be explained by the fact that firms that face international competition cannot easily increase prices when faced with wage increases. Non-tradable sectors, such as retail, can increase prices and shift the burden of higher labour costs onto the consumer as they do not face international competition. The effects of minimum wages in South Africa is, therefore, more complex than what previous research shows. We argue that an undifferentiated national minimum wage can result in intra-industry concentration and inequality could grow. This is true even if the economy-wide impact of a national minimum wage could be potentially benign.
J43|Multinational Oil Firmsâ€™ CSR Initiatives in Nigeria: the Need of Rural Farmers in Host Communities|We examine the impact of multinational oil firmsâ€™ CSR on agricultural production using binary logit model equation. The result indicates a significant relationship between CSR and agricultural production in oil host communities in Nigeria. This implies that CSR of a multinational oil firm is a critical factor for increasing participation of rural dwellers in agricultural production. The findings suggest for improved CSR investment of multinational oil firms on subsidized fertilizer, certified seed, crop protection products, farm power and rural transportation infrastructures.
J43|Wealth Heterogeneity and the Income Elasticity of Migration|How do income shocks affect international migration flows from poor countries? Income growth not only increases the opportunity cost of migration but also eases liquidity constraints. I develop a method to separate these countervailing individual effects and identify the overall income elasticity of migration. Using new administrative and census data from Indonesia, I find that positive agricultural income shocks increase labor emigration flows, particularly in villages with relatively more small landholders. However, in the most developed rural areas, persistent income shocks reduce emigration. Overall, the findings highlight the important role of wealth heterogeneity in shaping migration flows as incomes rise.
J43|Multinational Oil Firms' CSR Initiatives in Nigeria: The Need of Rural Farmers in Host Communities| We examine the impact of multinational oil firms' Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on agricultural production using binary logit model equation. The result indicates a significant relationship between CSR and agricultural production in oil host communities in Nigeria. This implies that CSR of a multinational oil firm is a critical factor for increasing participation of rural dwellers in agricultural production. The findings suggest for improved CSR investment of multinational oil firms on subsidized fertilizer, certified seed, crop protection products, farm power and rural transportation infrastructures.

J43|Reevaluating Agricultural Productivity Gaps with Longitudinal Microdata|Recent research has pointed to large gaps in labor productivity between the agricultural and nonagricultural sectors in low-income countries, as well as between workers in rural and urban areas. Most estimates are based on national accounts or repeated cross-sections of micro-survey data, and as a result typically struggle to account for individual selection between sectors. This paper uses long-run individual-level panel data from two low-income countries (Indonesia and Kenya). Accounting for individual fixed effects leads to much smaller estimated productivity gains from moving into the nonagricultural sector (or urban areas), reducing estimated gaps by over 80%. Per capita consumption gaps are also small once individual fixed effects are included. Estimated productivity gaps do not emerge up to five years after a move between sectors. We evaluate whether these findings imply a re-assessment of the conventional wisdom regarding sectoral gaps, discuss how to reconcile them with existing cross-sectional estimates, and consider implications for the desirability of sectoral reallocation of labor.
J43|You can(’t) always get the job you want: stated versus revealed employment preferences in the Peruvian agro-industry|Employment in high-value agro-export sectors has been recognized to entail the potential to contribute to poverty reduction in rural areas of developing countries. Concerns have yet been raised about the quality of the created employment and worker preferences have often been overlooked in the literature. We use a discrete choice experiment, in which we relate stated and revealed employment preference of agro-industrial export workers in Peru. We explain employment (mis)matches as a function of personal and employer characteristics. Results suggest that employment preferences are heterogeneous, but that labor market frictions are smaller than what is commonly expected in developing country contexts.
J43|Is the Allocation of Time Gender Sensitive to Food Price Changes? An Investigation of Hours of Work in Uganda|Dramatic spikes in food prices, like those observed over the last years, represent a real threat to food security in developing countries with severe consequences for many aspects of human life. Price instability can also affect the intra-household allocation of time, thus changing the labour supply of women, who traditionally play the role of 'shock absorbers'. This paper explores the nature of time poverty by examining how changes in the prices of the two major staples consumed, matooke and cassava, have affected the paid and unpaid labour time allocation in Ugandan households. We exploit the panel nature of the Uganda National Household Survey by adopting a Tobit-hybrid model. Our results show that gender differentials in the intra-household allocation of labour actually occur in correspondence with changes in food prices. We find that, overall, women work significantly more, since the additional hours women work in the labour market are not counterbalanced by a relevant reduction in their other labour activities. For men, we do not find any significant effect of price changes on hours of work.
J43|Rage Against the Machines: Labour-Saving Technology and Unrest in England, 1830-32|Can the adoption of labor-saving technology lead to social instability and unrest? We examine a canonical historical case, the so-called 'Captain Swing'ï¿½ riots in 1830s Britain. Variously attributed to the adverse consequences of weather shocks, the shortcomings of the Poor Law, or the after-effects of enclosure, we emphasize the importance of a new technology - the threshing machine. Invented in the 1780s, it spread during and after the Napoleonic Wars. Using farm advertisements from newspapers published in 66 English and Welsh towns, we compile a new measure of the technology's diffusion. Parishes with ads for threshing machines had much higher riot probabilities in 1830 - and the relationship was even stronger for machine-breaking attacks. Threshing machines were mainly useful in wheat-growing areas. To establish a causal role for labor-saving technology, we instrument technology adoption with the FAO measure of soil suitability for wheat, and show that this in turn predicts unrest.
J43|Social and Solidarity Economy as a tool for territorial development and socio-occupational inclusion|Social and Solidarity Economy is a field growing in importance in the agenda of discussions and practices in a governmental context of public policies in their several entities, multilateral organizations, as well as among researchers of the area, in Brazil and around the world. The emergence of territorial policies of Social and Solidarity Economy represent an interesting case in the construction of a “new” area of local public action. In his view, the emergence of territorial policies of Social and Solidarity Economy offers a “historic opportunity” for the consolidation and renewal that gives Social and Solidarity Economy. In this sense, this article intends discuss the connections between Social and Solidarity Economy and territorial development and presenting the Program “Territories of Citizenship” in Brazil, which targets the promotion of economic development and the universalization of basic programs of citizenship, through a strategy of sustainable territorial development.
J43|Non-farm entrepreneurship in rural sub-Saharan Africa: New empirical evidence|We report on the prevalence and patterns of non-farm enterprises in six sub-Saharan African countries, and study their performance in terms of labor productivity, survival and exit, using the World Bank’s Living Standards Measurement Study - Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA). Rural households operate enterprises due to both push and pull factors and tend to do so predominantly in easy-to-enter activities, such as sales and trade, rather than in activities that require higher starting costs, such as transport services, or educational investment, such as professional services. Labor productivity differs widely: rural and female-headed enterprises, those located further away from population centers, and businesses that operate intermittently have lower levels of labor productivity compared to urban and male-owned enterprises, or enterprises that operate throughout the year. Finally, rural enterprises exit the market primarily due to a lack of profitability or finance, and due to idiosyncratic shocks.
J43|The Political Economics of Growth, Labor Control and Coercion: Evidence from a Suffrage Reform|In this paper, we analyze how a suffrage reform in 1862/63 that shifted the de jure distribution of political power from landowners to industrialists affected Sweden’s industrialization and economic and social development from the 1860s to the 1910s. Using a newly constructed, comprehensive historical data set of the universe of approximately 2,400 Swedish local governments, we document that the change in suffrage affected a very large number of development and social outcomes at the local level, such as labor coercion, factor price manipulation in the form of entry barriers including investments in local public goods (i.e., schooling) and transportation (i.e., local railways), the real wage structure, technology adoption in both agriculture and industry, labor productivity in both agriculture and industry, changes in the composition of employment and the structure of production, demographic transition, organized labor, and persistence in dysfunctional local political institutions. Our findings are consistent with the idea that political institutions are a key determinant of long-run development and growth. Specifically, our results suggest that politically powerful landowners can block economic development using labor coercion and factor price manipulation, i.e., using entry barriers and other distortionary policies.
J43|Economic Origins of Cultural Norms: The Case of Animal Husbandry and Bastardy|This paper explores the historical origins of the cultural norm regarding illegitimacy (formerly known as bastardy). We test the hypothesis that traditional agricultural production structures influenced the historical illegitimacy ratio, and have had a lasting effect until today. Based on data from the Austro-Hungarian Empire and modern Austria, we show that regions that focused on animal husbandry (as compared to crop farming) had significantly higher illegitimacy ratios in the past, and female descendants of these societies are still more likely to approve illegitimacy and give birth outside of marriage today. To establish causality, we exploit, within an IV approach, variation in the local agricultural suitability, which determined the historical dominance of animal husbandry. Since differences in the agricultural production structure are completely obsolete in today's economy, we suggest interpreting the persistence in revealed and stated preferences as a cultural norm. Complementary evidence from an 'epidemiological approach' suggests that this norm is passed down through generations, and the family is the most important transmission channel. Our findings point to a more general phenomenon that cultural norms can be shaped by economic conditions, and may persist, even if economic conditions become irrelevant.
J43|Modeling under-5 mortality through multilevel structured additive regression with varying coefficients for Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa|Despite improvements in global child health within the last three decades, under-5 mortality remains significantly high in Sub-Saharan and Asia. Both regions did not achieve the MDG target of reducing under-5 mortality by two thirds by 2015. The underlying causes of under-5 mortality differ significantly between countries and between regions, which highlights the need to expand our understanding of the determinants of child health in developing countries. By comparing the two geographic regions of the world with the highest under-5 mortality rates, we aim to gain new insights, and bring out potential differences between these regions and the causes of under-5 mortality. In addition, we aim to identify non-linear relationships between under-5 mortality and specific explanatory variables. We analyze a large data set consisting of 35 Sub-Saharan-African countries, and 13 Asian countries, using a multilevel discrete time survival model that takes advantage of a recently developed multilevel framework with structured additive predictor in a Bayesian setting. We analyze data from 131 individual surveys from 1992 to 2015, allowing for potential non-linear effects and cluster specific heterogeneity within models. We find strong non-linear effects for the baseline hazard, the household size, the age of the mother, the BMI of the mother, and the birth order of the child. Additionally, we find considerable differences in determinants between Asian and Sub-Saharan Asian countries.

J43|General Equilibrium Effects of (Improving) Public Employment Programs: Experimental Evidence from India|A public employment program's effect on poverty depends on both program earnings and market impacts. We estimate this composite effect, exploiting a large-scale randomized experiment across 157 sub-districts and 19 million people that improved the implementation of India's employment guarantee. Without changing government expenditure, this reform raised low-income households' earnings by 13%, driven primarily by market earnings. Real wages rose 6% while days without paid work fell 7%. Effects spilled over across sub-district boundaries, and adjusting for these spillovers substantially raises point estimates. The results highlight the importance and feasibility of accounting for general equilibrium effects in program evaluation.
J43|Effects of Emigration on Rural Labor Markets|Rural to urban migration is an integral part of the development process, but there is little evidence on how out-migration transforms rural labor markets. Emigration could benefit landless village residents by reducing labor competition, or conversely, reduce productivity if skilled workers leave. We offer to subsidize transport costs for 5792 potential seasonal migrants in Bangladesh, randomly varying saturation of offers across 133 villages. The transport subsidies increase beneficiaries’ income due to better employment opportunities in the city, and also generate the following spillovers: (a) A higher density of offers increases the individual take-up rate, and induces those connected to offered recipients to also migrate. The village emigration rate increases from 35% to 65%. (b) This increases the male agricultural wage rate in the village by 4.5-6.6%, and the available work hours in the village by 11-14%, which combine to increase income earned in the village, (c) There is no intra-household substitution in labor supply, but primary workers within households earn more during weeks in which many of their village co-residents moved away. (d) The wage bill for agricultural employers increases, which reduces their profit, with no significant change in yield. (e) Food prices increase by 2.7% on net, driven by an increase in the price of (fish) protein, and offset by (f) a decrease in the price of non-tradables like prepared food and tea. Seasonal migration subsidies not only generate large direct benefits, but also indirect spillover benefits by creating slack in the village-of-origin labor market during the lean season.
J43|Evolution of the Labor Market in Romanian Development Regions|In the context of economic transition, the labor market in Romania has undergone significant changes in the volume and structure of the main indicators of labor. After 1990, fewer inhabitants of Romania, due to the negative natural growth and massive emigration has resulted in reduction of the active population and employment in all eight development regions in Romania. The paper analyzes the phenomenon of labor employment at regional level. In essence, they were followed two issues: public participation in economic and social areas and developments and structures active population. It also highlighted the differences and disparities between developing regions of Romania in the use of labor in order to identify conclusions that can improve regional development policies and enhancing effective action to fill labor resources available.
J43|Methodological Framework for ex-ante Assessment of Active Policies on the Labor Market - Experimental Approach|Ex-ante assessment is a mandatory step before the process of implementation of policies because it brings, through the analyses undertaken improvements for initial design, contributing, on a case by case basis, to increasing of efficiency, effectiveness, relevance, sustainability, equity and of its internal and external coherence. In recent years, at international level, but especially in the EU countries (EU), the ex-ante socio-economic programs and public interventions have become an extremely necessary instrument in decision-making, which is linked own economic and social development of the EU Member States. The article presents a methodological framework for ex-ante assessment of active measures for the employment growth in the context of rural areas, on the bases of efficiency, effectiveness and coherence criteria. Ex-ante social impact assessment of an active policy can have beneficial effects on employment under quantitative and qualitative aspects. The novelty of the article consist in the specific, experimental approach of the development and of ex-ante evaluation of active labor market policies, in the context of rural areas.
J43|Caste, Female Labor Supply, and the Gender Wage Gap in India: Boserup Revisited|The gender wage gap is notable not just for its persistence and ubiquity but also for its variation across regions and countries. A natural question is how greater workforce participation by women matters to female wages and the gender wage gap. Within India, a seeming paradox is that gender differentials in agricultural wages are the largest in southern regions of India that are otherwise favorable to women. Ester Boserup hypothesized that this is due to greater labor force participation by women in these regions. This is not obvious, as greater female labor supply could depress male wages as well. Other factors also need to be accounted for, especially since women have fewer opportunities for nonfarm employment. This article undertakes a formal test of the Boserup proposition. We find that differences in female labor supply are able to explain 55% of the gender wage gap between northern and southern states of India. The article also finds that women gain from greater nonfarm employment, even if their direct participation in such activity is limited. This happens because of higher wages.
J43|A profile of non-farm household enterprises in Sub-Saharan Africa|This paper provides a comprehensive descriptive profile of non-farm household enterprises in ten Sub-Saharan African countries, disaggregated by the households' consumption quintiles. Various enterprise-related aspects are covered, such as the share of households that operate an enterprise, the motivation to start a business venture, and various owner and enterprise characteristics. The figures show that household enterprises are more prevalent among wealthier households, although push factors overall dominate as entry motive. Enterprises in lower quintiles are more often operated by owners with less education, and in most countries female owners are more frequently found among poorer households. The enterprises themselves are characterised by a small size, generally solo entrepreneurship, which only marginally increases along wealth levels. Poorer households operate more seasonal types of businesses, which employ rarely any external labour, and which contribute less to total household income compared to wealthier households. While business profits grow along the welfare quintiles, profits show a big jump from the fourth to the top quintile. Finally, poor entrepreneurial households are considerably more often located in rural than in urban areas. Based on these findings, this paper suggests a set of policy recommendations that include expanding the access to and availability of finance, education, and infrastructure, and introducing gender-sensitive entrepreneurial policies.
J43|European Union’s SPS and TBT Measures, Gender Specific Obstacles and Agricultural Employment|We investigate the implications of EU non-tariff barriers in the form sanitary and phyto-sanitary (SPS) measures and technical barriers to trade (TBT) on gender relations in the agricultural labour market between 1995 and 2012. Our results indicate that women are disproportionately disadvantaged in the agricultural sector not only because of the inimical effect of the non-tariff measure, but more so because of their unequal access to opportunities such as gender inequality in secondary schooling the heavy burden of reproduction actives which makes them less available for gainful employment. However, gender parity achieved in primary education and increased access to time saving infrastructure increases their share of employment in the agricultural sector. Thus, proactive measures aimed at infrastructure investment that reduces women care burdens and building the educational capacity of women to effectively deal with such non-tariff barriers, could work to remove these gender specific obstacles, enable women respond to employment opportunities and minimise any gender disparity caused by trade.

J43|Economic effects of climate change in developing countries: Economy-wide and regional analysis for Ethiopia|Quantifying the economic effects of climate change is a crucial step for planning adaptation in developing countries. This study assesses the economy-wide and regional effects of climate change induced productivity and labor supply shocks in agriculture in Ethiopia. The study shows, in worst case scenario, the effects on national GDP may add up to -8% with uneven regional effects ranging from -10% in agrarian regions (e.g. Amhara) to +2.5% in urbanized regions (e.g. Addis Ababa). Cost-free exogenous structural change scenarios in labor markets and transaction costs may offset about 20-30% of the ripple effects of climate change. Therefore, the ongoing structural transformation in the country may underpin the resilience of the economy to climate change. Nevertheless, given the role of agriculture in the current economic structure of the country and the potency of biophysical impacts of climate change, adaptation in the sector is indispensable. Otherwise, climate change may hamper economic progress of the country, and make rural livelihood unpredictable.
J43|Anatomy of a Contract Change|"We study a contract change for tea pluckers on an Indian plantation, with a higher government-stipulated baseline wage. Incentive piece rates were lowered or kept unchanged. Yet, in the following month, output increased by 20 to 80 percent. This response contradicts the standard model and several variants, is only partly explicable by greater supervision, and appears to be ""behavioral."" But in subsequent months, the increase is comprehensively reversed. Though not an unequivocal indictment of ""behavioral"" models, these findings suggest that nonstandard responses may be ephemeral, and should ideally be tracked over an extended period of time.

J43|Agricultural Productivity and Structural Transformation: Evidence from Brazil|We study the effects of the adoption of new agricultural technologies on structural transformation. To guide empirical work, we present a simple model where the effect of agricultural productivity on industrial development depends on the factor-bias of technical change. We test the predictions of the model by studying the introduction of genetically engineered soybean seeds in Brazil, which had heterogeneous effects on agricultural productivity across areas with different soil and weather characteristics. We find that technical change in soy production was strongly labor-saving and led to industrial growth, as predicted by the model.
J43|Skill Transferability, Migration, and Development: Evidence from Population Resettlement in Indonesia|We use a natural experiment in Indonesia to provide causal evidence on the role of location-specific human capital and skill transferability in shaping the spatial distribution of productivity. From 1979-1988, the Transmigration Program relocated two million migrants from rural Java and Bali to new rural settlements in the Outer Islands. Villages assigned migrants from regions with more similar agroclimatic endowments exhibit higher rice productivity and nighttime light intensity one to two decades later. We find some evidence of migrants' adaptation to agroclimatic change. Overall, our results suggest that regional productivity differences may overstate the potential gains from migration.
J43|Determinants of Land and Labour Market Participation Decisions in Rural Ethiopia|This paper attempts to determine the factors influencing farmers' land and labour market participation decisions in rural Ethiopia. A multivariate probit estimation technique is used to account for potential interdependencies between land and labour allocation strategies. Results suggest that households that are better endowed with farming resources such as oxen and farming skills are more likely to get access to more land and labour through factor markets, while households that are less endowed with these resources are more likely to rent out their land and participate in off-farm jobs. The complementary nature of land renting out and involvement in off-farm work suggests that policy makers should give due consideration to the development of rural off-farm jobs to reduce poverty in rural areas.
J43|Driving Factors of Rural-Urban Migration in China| This study employs panel data to analyze the economic factors that drive rural-urban migration and agricultural labor supply within China. The results indicate that higher wages in urban areas, especially in the construction sector, was associated with rural-urban migration and a decline in the agricultural labor supply. The rural-urban wage differential in construction reflects the housing boom in cities set off by rapid urbanization and government policies. Most importantly, our findings raise concerns about the negative impact of rural-urban migration on agriculture in China. Policies that impact labor supply, especially in times of rapid urban development and low diffusion of agricultural technology, are critical to Chinese economic development and stability.
J43|Imperfect Substitution between Immigrant and Native Farm Workers in the United States| The preponderance of employing unauthorized foreign-born immigrant workers in the farm labor force has made immigration policy a major issue for agriculture sector. The focal points of the policy discussions include two sides of the same coin: to what extent farm growers experience labor shortages and to what extent the immigrant farm workers affect the economic opportunities of native farm workers who are mostly less-educated. In this paper we propose a three-layer nested CES framework to model the labor demand in agricultural sector and empirically investigate the substitutability among heterogeneous farm worker groups defined by different age and education levels as well as immigration status. Using wages and employment information aggregated at different education-age-year cells from the National Agricultural Worker Survey (NAWS) data over the period of 1989 and 2012, we find little evidence that inflows of immigrants are associated with significant impact on native farm workers across different age and education groups. Within a specific age-education cell, the point estimate of the elasticity of substitution between immigrant and native farm workers is around 2. Our findings has important policy implication for the need to streamline the H-2A guest worker program which was intended by legislators to decrease the size of unauthorized immigrant workers meanwhile alleviate the potential labor shortage issues.
J43|Part-Time Farming in Italy: Does Farm Size Really Matter?| This paper explores the phenomenon of part-time farming, which is a typical feature in the EU and particularly in Italy, often associated with pluriactivity and small-scale farming. With the aim of improving current understanding on agricultural employment decisions, this study investigates the drivers of farm holders’ on-farm labour supply and tests for labour allocation differences based on the size of the farm. Since the definition of ‘small farm’ is arbitrary, this study explores different criteria taking into account the farm type and the utilised agricultural area. A random effects ordered probit is employed on a balanced panel for the period 2003-2009, using micro-data from the Italian Agricultural Business Survey (REA). The findings indicate significant differences in labour market responses between small and large farms, highlighting the diverse farm structures, incentives and business requirements. Pluriactivity and market integration are found to be important drivers of on-farm labour supply and are fundamental for the stabilisation of incomes of small farmers. The empirical results support the policy claim that for smaller farmers rural development policies which encourage diversification activities and support commercialisation are much more important than farm subsidies.
J43|The impact of risk management practices on wheat productivity in France and Hungary| Wheat is a key staple crop for global food security, but its production is strongly concentrated in a few regions, among which the EU is the first producer. EU farmers are struggling to keep high productivity levels due to global market and climate challenges. Risk management practices (RMP) are often advocated as viable tools to cope against these uncertainties, but their adoption can also subtract resources to the production activity, resulting in a controversial impact on the overall farm productivity. This paper analysis whether and how much four RMP contribute to wheat farming efficiency in France and Hungary using i) a stochastic frontier model to obtain a measure of farms efficiency; ii) an endogenous switching regression model to quantify the RMP impact. Results show that RMP can benefit farm efficiency, but not all the RMP have the same effect. While insurance, diversification and contract farming can positively affect farm efficiency, cultivating different varieties can reduce farm efficiency of about 10% depending on the production conditions.
J43|Non-farmers’ willingness to farm: a large-scale choice experiment to identify policy options that can induce new entry to the agricultural industry| With the farming population aging across the developed world, securing a new generation of agricultural producers is an important step towards overcoming global food problems. The vast majority of the existing literature on new entry to agriculture base their analysis on data obtained from existing farms and farmers, an approach not necessarily adequate because the people who actually make decisions about entry are non-farmers. In this paper, we report the results of a large-scale choice experiment conducted in Japan to investigate the willingness of the country’s non-farming population to enter the agricultural industry. The results of a random parameter logit estimation showed that, in the absence of farmland, technical support and guaranteed sales, the agricultural income required to induce entry of an average Japanese person is approximately ¥22.0M (£121,000), a level well above their present income of ¥5.4M (£29,700); however, when all three services are provided, this value drastically lowers to ¥4.6M (£25,300). In addition, a ¥1M (£5,500) increase in agricultural income raises a person’s likelihood to enter the industry by 1.6 percentage points. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to quantitatively investigate non-farmers’ willingness to enter the agricultural industry.
J43|Alternative Strategies to Manage Weather Risk in Perennial Fruit Crop Production| Fruit producers in the Eastern United States face a wide range of weather-related risks during the growing season, and many of these events have the capacity to largely impact yields and profitability. This research examines the economic implications associated with responding to these risks for sweet cherry production in three different systems: using high tunnels to protect the crop, purchasing revenue insurance products, and employing weather insurance schemes. The analysis considers a distribution of revenue flows and costs using detailed price, yield, and weather data between 1984 and 2013. Our results show that the high tunnel system generates the largest net return if significant price premiums exist for earlier and larger fruit. Under most conditions, the results also indicate that net returns for the system that uses revenue-based crop insurance exceed those for the system that uses weather insurance products.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J43|The Impact of CAP Payments on the Exodus of Labour from Agriculture in Selected EU Member States| This paper examines the determinants of exit from agriculture under the implementation of CAP payments in four selected EU countries (France, Hungary, Italy and Poland) in the period 2005-08. The study employs micro-data from the European Union Labour Force Survey and regional data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network. We differentiate among the different measures of farm payments, looking at the individual impact of Pillar 1 instruments, i.e. coupled and decoupled payments, and at those in Pillar 2, targeted at rural development. The main results suggest that total subsidies at the regional level are negatively associated with the out-farm migration of agricultural workers in the two New member states, Hungary and Poland, so that the CAP would seem to hinder the exit of labour from agriculture. Conversely, the non-significant results for the ‘old’ member states may be interpreted as the result of opposing effects of coupled payments and rural development support. The diverse impact of CAP on the likelihood of leaving agriculture in the four countries reflects the heterogeneity across European member states, due to different market and production structures, which does not allow a common and simple generalisation of the effect of the CAP on labour allocation.
J43|As Famílias Pluriativas e Não Agrícolas no Rural Brasileiro: condicionantes e diferenciais de renda| Based on the discussion of the income from non-agricultural activities and its importance for the Brazilian rural population, this study analyzes: (i) the determinants of pluriactivity and non-agricultural activities in rural households; and (ii) the impact of non-agricultural activities in the income of rural households. Analyses are based on pooled data from the National Household Survey from 2001 to 2013, period that is characterized invesby remarkable changes in the economy and rural society. Results highlight that the odds of having a non agricultural activity depends both on endogenous characteristics, such as the presence of a son/daughter in adult age and education of the responsible for the household, as exogenous factors, such as the proximity of the household from urban areas and geographic region. Despite considerable improvements in employment and income from agricultural activities in the 2000s, the share of families performing exclusively agricultural activities remained reducing in rural Brazil. This dynamic would be justified, in part, by the income of non-agricultural activities, which is greater than that of exclusively agricultural families and grew faster in the period, contributing to the enhancement income disparities in rural areas.
J43|Factors affecting student load debt accrued by graduates of US veterinary medical colleges| Graduates of colleges of veterinary medicine have experienced a marked increase in acquired student loan debt. The mean inflation-adjusted student loan debt for graduating veterinarians has increased at an average annual rate of 5.11% over the period of 2002-2014 while starting salaries have decreased at a rate of 0.9% annually. This research aims to identify the factors associated with the increase in student loan debt accumulation by veterinarians in the face of relatively unchanged wages. We utilize data collected from the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) fourth-year veterinary student surveys for 2001 through 2014. The variable of interest is the inflation-adjusted total student loan debt attributed to the study of veterinary medicine. Due to the nature of debt totals, there are a large number of observations of zero in the data (14%). We employ a two-part hurdle model to identify the factors affecting both the decision to borrow and the amount which was borrowed. We find that the majority of the annual increase in debt can be explained by increases in tuition costs and an increase in the share of students paying out-of-state tuition, with some of the change attributable to the increasing share of veterinary students that are women.
J43|Employment Conditions in the Senegalese Horticultural Export Industry: A Worker Perspective|" type=""main"" xml:id=""dpr12153-abs-0001""> The rapid transformation of the agri-food sector in developing countries has created rural off-farm employment opportunities, especially for women. There is growing concern about worker welfare and employment conditions in agri-food and export sectors, but empirical evidence on this issue is scant. We analyse contractual preferences of female workers in the horticultural export sector in Senegal. We use a discrete choice experiment to assess women's preferences for a labour contract and employ a latent class model to capture preference heterogeneity. We find that women have a high willingness to accept a labour contract in the horticultural export industry, and that differences in preferences for contract attributes can be explained by women's empowerment status."
J43|Coerced Labor in the Cotton Sector: How Global Commodity Prices (Don't) Transmit to the Poor|This paper investigates the economic fortunes of coerced vs. free workers in a global supply chain. To identify the differential treatment of otherwise similar workers we resort to a unique exogenous labor demand shock that affects wages in voluntary and involuntary labor relations differently. We identify the wage pass-through by capitalizing on Tajikistan's geographic variation in the suitability for cotton production combined with a surge in the world market price of cotton in 2010/11 in two types of firms: randomly privatized small farms and not yet privatized parastatal farms, the latter of which command political capital to coerce workers. The expansion in land attributed to cotton production led to increases in labor demand and wages for cotton pickers; however, the price hike benefits only workers on entrepreneurial private farms, whereas coerced workers of parastatal enterprises miss out. The results provide evidence for the political economy of labor coercion and for the dependence of the economic lives of many poor on the competitive structure of local labor markets.
J43|Land, Child Labor, and Schooling: Longitudinal evidence from Colombia and Mexico|Several studies find that child labor incidence is higher in households with larger land holdings. The existence of this “wealth paradox” has been explained as the consequence of simultaneous imperfections in the land and labor markets. This work shows that although rural households in Colombia and Mexico seem to exhibit this same positive relationship between land and child labor, the wealth paradox disappears when individuals are evaluated using longitudinal data. A possible explanation for this is that the omission of idiosyncratic household preferences regarding schooling, child labor and land holdings in cross-sectional estimates leads to an overestimation of the effect land has on these outcomes.
J43|Labor market impacts of U.S. tight oil development: The case of the Bakken|There has been a recent boom in natural gas and oil production in the US due to high energy prices and technological advances in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. While North Dakota oil production has increased significantly since 2005 with the development of Bakken formation, the impact on the rest of the economy including agriculture, historically the largest industry in North Dakota, has received little attention. We employ a variant of the Corden-Neary resource development model to test the impact of the oil boom in North Dakota caused by technical change on employment and wages in two tradable sectors of the state economy: agriculture and energy, alongside the rest of the state's economy, using a Vector Error Correction (VEC) model marking the very first use of the dynamic vector autoregression (VAR) analysis in this theoretical framework.
J43|Entrepreneurial skills and wage employment|Purpose - – Promotion of entrepreneurial skills is often considered as an adequate policy to enhance job creation and economic growth. However, neither the definition of entrepreneurial skills, nor the costs and benefits of such a policy are clear. The purpose of this paper is to check whether the benefits of entrepreneurial skills extent beyond self-employment. The authors denote entrepreneurial skills as those competencies that enhance the likelihood of self-employment. Then the authors analyze whether they are rewarded in wage employment. Design/methodology/approach - – The authors estimate a Heckman selection model with wages in a salaried job as the main dependent variable and working in wage employment vs self-employment as the selection equation. The authors use a sample of higher education graduates from Spain, from the year 2000 interviewed in 2005 within the REFLEX survey. Findings - – Results reveal that alertness to new opportunities, ability to mobilize others and knowledge of other fields are the competencies that enhance self-employment in Spain. Yet, these skills are not rewarded in a salaried job. Therefore, benefits of policies fostering entrepreneurial skills do not extend to wage employment in Spain. Research limitations/implications - – The exclusion restriction used in the analysis is father’s education. The authors assume that all the effect of parental education on wages goes through education attainment of the individual and her ability (proxied by her grade in secondary education). A better proxy for ability would be desirable. Originality/value - – The authors identify which competencies enhance self-employment in Spain. The authors find that these competencies are not rewarded in wage employment, so the benefits of policies promoting entrepreneurial education remain within self-employment activity only.
J43|Farms, Families, and Markets: New Evidence on Completeness of Markets in Agricultural Settings| The farm household model has played a central role in improving the understanding of small‐scale agricultural households and non‐farm enterprises. Under the assumptions that all current and future markets exist and that farmers treat all prices as given, the model simplifies households' simultaneous production and consumption decisions into a recursive form in which production can be treated as independent of preferences of household members. These assumptions, which are the foundation of a large literature in labor and development, have been tested and not rejected in several important studies including Benjamin (1992). Using multiple waves of longitudinal survey data from Central Java, Indonesia, this paper tests a key prediction of the recursive model: demand for farm labor is unrelated to the demographic composition of the farm household. The prediction is unambiguously rejected. The rejection cannot be explained by contamination due to unobserved heterogeneity that is fixed at the farm level, local area shocks, or farm‐specific shocks that affect changes in household composition and farm labor demand. We conclude that the recursive form of the farm household model is not consistent with the data. Developing empirically tractable models of farm households when markets are incomplete remains an important challenge.
J43|Social Business Models in the Context of Romanian Rural Environment|The labor market in rural areas faces a new challenge, of to increase employment through entrepreneurship development and transfer of labour from subsistence agriculture sectors to non-agricultural competitive sectors under the conditions of the existence of a high percentage of workforce aging, inactive, discouraged from finding a job, with low level of education, training, entrepreneurial culture and income. The paper presents a SWOT analysis of rural workforce market and the framework of regulations regarding the development of social entrepreneurship opportunities as a modern form adapted for solving social problems. It is important to developing another type of business towards to solve social problems facing rural environment, an equitable redistribution of income, reinvest profits to create new jobs and not to accumulate it in order to deepen the economic and social inequalities. Based on a statistical investigation on the main problems faced by entrepreneurs from rural area and internationally good practices are mentioned several orientation directions of social business models in the context of rural area.
J43|Is the Allocation of Time Gender Sensitive to Food Price Changes? An Investigation of Hours of Work in Uganda|Dramatic spikes in food prices, like those observed over the last years, represent a real threat to food security in developing countries with severe consequences for many aspects of human life. Price instability can also affect the intra-household allocation of time, thus changing the labour supply of women, who traditionally play the role of â€˜shock absorbersâ€™. This paper explores the nature of time poverty by examining how changes in the prices of the two major staples consumed, matooke and cassava, have affected the paid and unpaid labour time allocation in Ugandan households. We exploit the panel nature of the Uganda National Household Survey by adopting a Tobit-hybrid model. Our results show that gender differentials in the intra-household allocation of labour actually occur in correspondence with changes in food prices. We find that, overall, women work significantly more, since the additional hours women work in the labour market are not counterbalanced by a relevant reduction in their other labour activities. For men, we do not find any significant effect of price changes on hours of work.
J43|Coerced Labor in the Cotton Sector: How Global Commodity Prices (Don't) Transmit to the Poor|This paper investigates the economic fortunes of coerced vs. free workers in a global supply chain.

J43|Child labor in China|We present the first systematic study on child labor in China. Child labor is not a negligible social phenomenon in China; about 7.74% of children aged from 10 to 15 were working in 2010, and they worked for 6.75h per day on average, and spent 6.42h less per day on study than other children. About 90% of child laborers were still in school and combined economic activity with schooling. Our results show that child labor participation is positively associated with school dropout rate. A child living in a rural area is more likely to work. Compared with place of residence, the gender of a child are less important. The educational level of the household head and its interaction with the gender of the household head seem to be unimportant. However, household assets per capita and household involvement in non-agricultural activities are negatively related to the incidence of child labor. A child from a household with more adults is less likely to work. The prevalence of child labor in China exhibits significant regional variations. The child labor incidence is correlated with the development level of each region: the Western region has the highest percentage of child labor, followed by the Eastern and Central regions.
J43|P.N. (Raja) Junankar, Development Economics: The Role of Agriculture in Development|Development Economics: The Role of Agriculture in Development is a compilation of academic writings from P.N. Junankar and coauthors on the topic of agriculture in India. These writings includeanalyses of government policies regarding the agricultural sector, farmer behavior, inequality, informal labor markets and female labor force participation. This book is a valuable contribution to the literature addressing growth within the agricultural sector in lesser developed economies.
J43|Martin Qaim, Genetically Modified Crops and Agricultural Development|Qaim is a leading academic researcher on the global impacts of genetically modified crops and his diligence and thoroughness abound in his newest book, Genetically Modified Crops and Agricultural Development. Qaim’s objective is to inform the reader about the contribution that GM crops have, and can, make to improving economic circumstances and contribute to increased food security, particularly in developing countries. He accomplishes this objective through an artful blending of storytelling and scientific fact, allowing the reader to come away with a new appreciation for the technology and its impacts. The book provides an in depth review of the commercialization of GM cotton in India, informing readers about the extent and degree of benefits that have resulted over the past decade. This book should be required reading for those involved with organizations that actively campaign and protest against GM crops. Perhaps if those opposed gained the insights presented by Qaim, the European acceptance of a beneficial agricultural technology would begin to improve.
J43|Analyzing the Impact of the World’s Largest Public Works Project on Crime|India started the implementation of a rural public works program in 2006, covering all districts of the country within three years. The program quarantees 100 days of employment per year at minimum wage to each rural household on demand, with the goal of reducing joblessness and poverty. We exploit the design and implementation of this program to investigate its employment impact on various types of crimes, ranging from burglary to kidnapping to riots. We show that the program acts as an insurance scheme because an increase in rainfall, which is negatively correlated with agricultural production, lowers the demand for jobs under the program. Controlling for rainfall, we find that employment generated by the program has a negative impact on both property and violent crime. Although crime elasticities with respect to employment are small, this finding represents another dimension of the social benefit generated by the program.
J43|Rural human capital investment’s driving effects to labor migration - An empirical study based on Vector Error Correction Model|Based on vector error correction model, this essay aims to test the relationship between the rural human capital investment and labor migration by using the data of Hunan province from 1994 to 2014. Experiment results show the long-term balanced relationship between rural human capital investment and labor migration. Rural human capital investment can boost the transfer of labor force effectively in the long run. While none obvious effect would take in a short time. There is time lag effect on human capital investment. The time needed to amend the cointegration relationship would be long and the primary factor that affects the labor migration is the prophase investment of human capital.
J43|Global financial crisis, credit access and children: Evidence from Tanzania|This paper investigates the relationship between the recent global financial crisis and child labour in Tanzania. Using the difference-in-difference methodological framework, we identify households' access to credit as a possible transmission channel of the financial crisis to child labour. Unlike most of the existing studies that employ self-reported shocks, we exploit the incidence of the global crisis as an exogenous shock to compare households that were credit recipients before the crisis with households that were not recipients of credit either prior to the crisis or in its immediate aftermath. To deal with possible bias from the endogeneity of access to credit, this study proposes a new instrument that considers the regional concentration of available micro finance institutions and the number of households' assets. Unlike instruments suggested by the existing literature, our proposed instrument incorporates information on both demand and supply sides of credit access irrespective of whether a household has actually received credit. To avoid the wealth effect which would violate the exogeniety condition, we suggest to count the number of the household's assets no matter how much value they possess. By doing so, our instrument utilizes information on how risk averse a household is and therefore their chances of making a successful loan application. The empirical results reveal that a negative shock on credit-recipient households is associated with a significant increase in child labour in Tanzania.
J43|Entrepreneurship and the Reallocation of African Farmers| African agriculture’s importance for sustainable development is well appreciated. Indeed, recent years have seen a thorough reappraisal of the sector. What are less well understood, however, are the drivers that reallocate scarce human and physical resources across occupations and space, and without which agriculture and industrial development, and hence structural transformation, will stagnate. One such endogenous driver is entrepreneurship. This paper begins with the reappraisal of African agriculture and focus on the literature on entrepreneurship in Africa’s structural transformation. Then a conceptual model to describe how entrepreneurship reallocates farmers out of agriculture into non-agricultural activities and locations is presented. Recent empirical evidence that is broadly consistent with this model is discussed. Implications and challenges for entrepreneurship development policies and further research are outlined.
J43|Migração para Áreas Rurais da Região Centro-Oeste: uma Análise sobre Emprego e Rendimento|The objective of this paper is to analyze the insertion of migrant and non-migrant residents in rural areas in the labor market in the Midwest region. Census data is used 2010 to present descriptive statistics and estimate an econometric model using the Heckman procedure. The results show that migrants are more likely to employment and higher income, being positively selected. We believe that, in general, the migrant resident in rural areas act as a promoter of regional growth and especially the agro-industrial development.
J43|A vision about the farming sector’s future: What is in there for farmers in the time of the second machine age?|Recent technological advances both on the farm and in the lab have made farming more independent form nature than ever before. Arguably, the new and accessible technologies are helping us to better understand and ‘manage’ nature and thus for first time in history farming is becoming as any other industry, susceptible to specialisation and economies of scale. This in turn, besides increased productivity, leads to fundamental organisational change away from family control towards corporate forms with associated implications for employment and rural livelihoods – automation in farming replaces both ‘muscles and brains’.
J43|The Missing Food Problem: Trade, Agriculture, and International Productivity Differences|Agriculture in poor countries has low productivity, high employment, and negligible trade flows relative to other sectors. These facts motivate a multisector, open-economy view of international productivity differences. With a quantitative multicountry model featuring nonhomothetic preferences, multiple interrelated sectors, distorted labor markets, and costly trade, I find: trade amplifies the negative effect of labor market distortions; trade costs—large for poor countries, especially in agriculture—significantly contribute to international productivity differences; and explicitly modeling agriculture reveals additional channels through which poor countries may gain from trade.

J43|Assessing the Causal Effect of Decoupled Payments on farm labour in Tuscany Using Propensity Score Methods| We analyze the impact on employment of the 2003/2005 CAP reform (decoupled payments) in Tuscany farms. We use data coming from census (2000 and 2010) and administrative archives, and apply propensity score-based methods to evaluate the average treatment effect of pay- ments on employment-related outcomes, taking into account that the assignment mechanism of payments was non-random. We further investigate impact heterogeneity using a generalized propensity-score matching methodology focussing on a subgroup of farms. Results show that there exists some effect of the payments on employment and that the impact is heterogeneous over the different amounts of payments.
J43|Bt cotton and employment effects for female agricultural laborers in Pakistan: An application of double-hurdle model| The literature dealing with impacts of Bt cotton is growing. Nevertheless, the question remains about how this technology can contribute to employment generation of rural poor. Bt-related yield benefit may intensify production and enhance labor demand for harvesting. Building on farm survey data of 352 cotton farmers in the South Punjab of Pakistan and using double-hurdle model, Bt employments effects are analyzed. Estimates show that Bt adoption has increased the probability and demand for hired labor by 6% and 17%, respectively. Cotton picking is labor intensive and female dominated activity in Pakistan. Labor disaggregation by gender enunciates the employment effects of Bt cotton for rural women, who belong to the neglected group of the society. Hence, Bt technology can play a vital role to poverty alleviation if seed quality and credit constraints are properly addressed.
J43|Female Employment reduces Fertility in Rural Senegal| The recent horticultural export boom in Senegal has created new off-farm wage employment opportunities for the rural population, especially for women. We hypothesise that female wage employment may lower fertility rates through an income effect, an empowerment effect and a substitution effect, and address this question empirically using household survey data and two different regression techniques (a Difference-in-Differences estimator and an Instrumental Variable approach). We find that besides education, female employment has a significant negative effect on fertility rates. Reducing fertility rates is considered as a prerequisite for reaching the MDGs, and our finding implies that the horticultural export boom and associated employment may indirectly contribute to this.
J43|The Impact of Non-Agricultural Employment on Farmland Transfer and Investment in Agricultural Assets: Evidence from China| This study aimed to determine the impact of non-agricultural employment of peasants on their farmland transfer and investment in agricultural assets by using theoretical models and empirical analysis. The Heckman two-step approach and ordinary least squares method of econometric estimation were used to analyze the questionnaire survey data collected from Jiangxi Province in China. Non-agricultural employment led to reduction of investment in agricultural assets and renting of land. The remittance flows from non-farm income were mainly used to improve the current quality of life, particularly housing condition, rather than to invest in agricultural assets. Migration of laborers caused farmers to rent out farmland, but the inflow of remittances from non-farm income, which increased the capital stock, did not increase the renting in of farmland.
J43|Performance and Sustainability of Kudumbashree Neighbourhood Groups on Kerala: An Empirical Analysis| Using data from the field survey and secondary sources, the study attempts to analyse the empowerment of women in Kerala through Kudumbashree. Kudumbashree is initiated by the Government of Kerala as the state poverty eradication mission in the year 1998. At present, more than 41 lakh women in Kerala have been brought under the umbrella of Kudumbashree, which accounts to about 23 per cent of the total female population of the state. Out of the total membership, highest share is constituted by the general category, followed by OBC, SC and ST respectively. Districts with greater share in linkage loan possess greater share in count of micro enterprises also. More than 61 thousand Joint Liability Groups practice collective farming in a total area of 35 thousand hectares. More than 66 per cent of the neighbourhood groups (NHGs) in the sample were involved only in micro-finance, and the rest undertook some other entrepreneurial activities. The younger section of the society participated more in the Kudumbashree activities. Among all the NHGs, more than 75 per cent had members among whom more than half lie below poverty line (BPL). More than 80 per cent of the NHGs avail credit from the banks and scheduled commercial/ nationalised banks which form the major source of credit. Logit regression analysis indicated that sustainability was positively and significantly affected by the share of BPL members in total members, per cent of members availing loan and the amount of loan outstanding per member.
J43|Evolução da Ocupação e do Rendimento das Pessoas no Espaço Rural Brasileiro no Período de 2001 a 2009| In the last decade of the 20th century it was observed an increasing diversification in the composition of the agricultural occupation and a slow increasing of Brazilian rural population in productive age. The aim of this study was to report the main tendencies on occupation and income of population in the rural space of Brazil in the 2001-2009 period. From the data of National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) and based in a log-linear regression model, an analysis on variation in population, income, average income and Gini index was made. It was identified that, despite the continuous decline of the total economically active population (EAP) occupied in the mercantile agriculture, the Brazilian rural population remained stable, mainly due to the expansion of EAP with off-agricultural occupation. The change on the profile of Brazilian rural space was more evident in the population income. These tendencies are associated with the diversification of the occupational composition, the increase of the acquisitive power, the reduction of the access to income inequality and the decrease of informal employment in the rural space. The continuity of these trends may lead to, in the rural area, both occupation and income from agricultural activities are surpassed by those originated from off-agricultural activities. Therefore, the readjustment of the rural development initiatives, which are mainly focused in the agricultural activities, is necessary.
J43|Sementes da Paixão: agroecologia e resgate da tradição| In favor of a pesticide-free farming and against genetically modified seeds that do not fall into line to its production system, farmers in the semiarid of Paraíba state have prepared Community Seed Banks (BSC), which are part of a network called Seeds of Passion. This network is based on ideals of agroecology, agricultural practice alternative and sustainable ecological principles. The farmers who participate of this network constantly advocate a peasant identity and traditional, in opposition to modernization and capitalism. Therefore, thanks to the repetition of the need to effect the rescue of farmers tradition, we have as central object to reflect about the speech of tradition rescue propagated by agroecological farmers, by technicians who work with them and by those who write about this reality, seeking to understand, through an analysis of papers that deal with the experiences of the Seeds of Passion, what are the conditions of existence of the invention of this tradition and what is the purpose of promoting such redemption in a modern historical context. Finally, this tradition is not opposed to modernity and science, but it would be a way of developing and implementing distinct knowledge of the dominant standard of rationality.
J43|Rural Livelihood Strategies in Cambodia: Evidence from a household survey in Stung Treng| The overall objective of this discussion paper is to advance the knowledge on rural livelihoods in Stung Treng, Cambodia. In a cluster analysis, five clusters with very different livelihood strategies are identified based on a sample of 600 rural households. Despite the fact that nearly all households are engaged in some form of subsistence farming, especially by growing rice, the richer clusters build on self-employment and higher-skilled wage employment. In contrast the middle income cluster mainly depends on natural resources (fish and firewood). The poorer two clusters are engaged in lowerskilled wage employment. The incidence of poverty is widespread but differences between the clusters are clearly visible. Even the better-off households have consumption poverty headcount ratios of between 37 to 50% at PPP $1.25. For households from the poorest clusters the poverty headcount ratio amounts to even 70% for income and 80% for consumption. Especially the households largely depending on natural resource extraction are characterized by a high incidence of poverty and high vulnerability. In addition, there are a number of pressures which are expected to increase poverty problems in the future. Policies aimed at reducing poverty and improving rural livelihoods need to carefully consider the close linkages between rural livelihoods and natural resources. But also a diversification away from natural resource extraction into higher-skilled jobs is found to be a strategy opening up new opportunities to improve livelihood security and raise the living standards of the poor.
J43|Wodurch wird die Arbeitszufriedenheit landwirtschaftlicher Arbeitnehmer beeinflusst?|Im Zuge von Änderungen der Agrarpolitik und des Strukturwandels entwickeln sich landwirtschaftliche Familienbetriebe zu erweiterten Familienbetrieben mit familienfremden Arbeitskräften und müssen sich in der Folge vermehrt personalwirtschaftlichen Fragestellungen widmen. Angesichts des zunehmenden Fachkräftemangels erlangt die Arbeitszufriedenheit von landwirtschaftlichen Arbeitnehmern eine wichtiger werdende Bedeutung. In dieser Studie werden die Einflüsse verschiedener betrieblicher Aspekte sowie der Lebens- und der Gesundheitszufriedenheit auf die Arbeitszufriedenheit landwirtschaftlicher Arbeitnehmer untersucht. Die Ergebnisse einer multivariaten Analyse mittels eines Regressionsmodells zeigen, dass besonders die Gesundheitszufriedenheit und die Tätigkeit selbst einen großen Einfluss auf die Arbeitszufriedenheit landwirtschaftlicher Arbeitnehmer haben. Die Ergebnisse zeigen somit Möglichkeiten auf, wie Betriebsleiter die betrieblichen Aspekte positiv beeinflussen können, um die Arbeitszufriedenheit ihrer Arbeitnehmer zu steigern. In response to changes in agricultural policy and structural changes in agriculture, family-run farms are developing into extended family-run farms with non-family employees. As a consequence, farm managers frequently find themselves having to deal with issues of personnel management. Due to the increasing shortage of skilled labour, farm workers’ job satisfaction has taken on growing importance in acquiring and retaining workers. This study investigates the influence of various farm-related factors, as well as lifestyle and health satisfaction, on the job satisfaction of agricultural employees. The results of a multivariate regression analysis show that two factors – health satisfaction and the work itself – play a particularly large role in farm workers’ job satisfaction. These results suggest options for farm managers looking to increase job satisfaction among their non-family employees.
J43|Género, migración y ruralidad en Chile|This paper analyzes the situation of the Chilean female small farmers in the context of development in the national economy from the 90s to 2012, which has led to significant changes in the demand for labor. These changes have been paralleled by significant fluctuations in the demographics of rural areas of Chile, affecting the role of women in their productive structures. This article aims to analyze the processes described from the review of recent scenarios of the Chilean economy and rural areas, using secondary information reviewed under a gender perspective.

Aspectos como la baja escolaridad, los bajos ingresos, los altos niveles de informalidad y pobreza y la estacionalidad de la producción agrícola no permiten aumentar el nivel de afiliación. Muestra también que a pesar de las características del sector rural, no existe un arreglo institucional especial para la afiliación a la seguridad social. Finalmente, el documento esboza la posibilidad de la universalización de la cobertura en salud y pensión de la población rural."""
J43|Welfare Implications of India's Employment Guarantee Programme with a Wage Payment Delay|We examine the efficacy of a popular anti-poverty programme, namely the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) of the Government of India. We argue that a chronic friction of wage payment delay in this flagship programme could adversely affect the welfare of the poor through two channels. First, it causes deferred consumption. Second, it turns labour into a credit good which makes an indebted household work harder to clear off his existing debt. The loss of welfare persists even when the worker has an outside employment option. If a programme of financial inclusion increases the indebtedness of the poor, a wage payment delay in the NREGA programme could escalate this welfare loss although the official indicator of success (i.e., participation) may not reveal this friction.
J43|More hands, more power? Estimating the impact of immigration on output and technology choices using early 20th century US agriculture|We study the impact of immigration-induced changes in labor supply within agriculture in the US during early 20th century, a sector where shifting output mix may be easier than in previously studied industries (manufacturing), on output and production choices. We find evidence of output mix adjustments at the county-level in response to immigration as predicted by trade models. Moreover, that response is only visible in diversified counties. Counties with higher initial specialization, likely with higher degree of factor (land) specificity, responded instead through input mixes and organizational changes. Suggestive evidence indicates that crop mix adjustments alone, without organizational changes, absorbed an important part of changes in labor endowments in diversified counties.
J43|Health and agricultural productivity: Evidence from Zambia|We evaluate the productivity effects of investment in preventive health technology through a randomized controlled trial in rural Zambia. In the experiment, access to subsidized bed nets was randomly assigned at the community level; 516 farmers were followed over a one-year farming period. We find large positive effects of preventative health investment on productivity: among farmers provided with access to free nets, harvest value increased by US$ 76, corresponding to about 14.7% of the average output value. While only limited information was collected on farming inputs, shifts in the extensive and the intensive margins of labor supply appear to be the most likely mechanism underlying the productivity improvements observed.
J43|Trade Liberalization and Wage Inequality: Evidence from the U.S. States|This paper examines the relationship between trade liberalization and wage inequality for 50 U.S. states during the period from 1999 to 2008. The Difference-in-Differences and fixed effects methods are employed to evaluate the effect of trade liberalization on wage inequality in the U.S. states. Empirical results reveal that trade liberalization and de-unionization do increase the wage inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Evidence shows skill-biased technological change has no significant impact on rising wage inequality. As Difference-in-Differences estimation on time-series cross sectional data involves many years, the conventional standard errors often understate the standard deviation of the estimators. This paper employs the standard bootstrapping procedure and the clustering error procedure to correct the problem, and all sign patterns still hold.
J43|Shocks and child labor: the role of markets|Economic shocks have been shown to affect child labor and particularly so when households fail to access credit. This paper endeavours to assess whether access toagricultural labor markets also reduce the impact of shocks on child labor. Using panel data from Tanzania, we confirm that households respond to transitory productivity shocks by changes in child labor, but that (1) child labor increases with increases in rainfall, (2) it increases less when households have access to a labor market and (3) the agricultural labor market seems more efficient than the credit market to smooth rainfall shocks. These findings are consistent with the theoretical model offered in the paper. They highlight that imperfect agricultural labor markets are important determinants of child labor.
J43|A labour-based approach to the analysis of structural transformation: Application to French agricultural holdings 2000|The question of farm size has long been a concern in the agricultural economics literature. The observation of a long-lasting persistence of so-called small farms drew the attention of numerous researchers. The size of farms is often approximated by the farm area in hectares or the added value and gross margin. We propose to investigate the opportunity to use labour family labour and hired, permanent and seasonal, wage labour) as an entry point for a typology of agricultural holdings, with an application on French data from the Census collected in 2000. Then, we characterize the holdings belonging to the groups defined by the typology based on the type of labour. ....French Abstract : La question de la taille des exploitations agricoles, en relation avec leurs performances, a été largement abordée par la littérature dédiée à l’économie agricole. En particulier, la persistance de l’existence de petites exploitations a attiré l’attention. La taille des exploitations est le plus souvent estimée en hectares, en valeur ajoutée ou en chiffre d’affaires. Cet article propose une entrée par le travail (familial ou salarié, saisonnier ou permanent) pour construire une typologie des exploitations françaises sur la base du Recensement Agricole 2000. Il caractérise ensuite les différents types d’exploitations identifiées.
J43|Aqua-Agricultural Production: Creation And Implementation Of A Marketing Plan Produccion Acua-Agricola: Creaciã“N E Implementacion De Un Plan De Mercadeo|Agribusiness is an important branch of the economy worldwide and the development of sub developed countries. The goal for companies today is to get noticed by major strategies reflected in marketing plans that will allow them to set standards in the markets they want to enter. The objectives merchandising as well as tactics and strategies is to get onto the minds of customers and consumers. Policies and courses of action are manifested for the planned objectives in a given time. A marketing plan was made for a projected system of Aqua-farm production. Within the structure of the project we identify: the objectives, justification, mission, vision and values, among other important aspects, as well as internal and external diagnostics company, and some strategies within the SWOT analysis.
J43|Economic Shocs and Internal Migration|Previous literature shows that internal migration rates are strongly procyclical. This would seem to imply that geographic relocation does not help mitigate negative local economic shocks during recessions. This paper shows that this is not the case. I document that net in-migrationrates decreased in areas more affected by the Great Recession. Using various IV strategies that rely on the importance of the construction sector and the indebtedness of households before the crisis, I conclude that internal migration might help to alleviate up to one third of the effects of the crisis on wages in the most affected locations. This is due to a disproportionate decrease in in-migration into those locations rather than an increase in out-migration. More generally, I show that differences in population growth rates across locations are mainly explained by differences in in-migration rates rather than in out-migration rates. I introduce a model to guide the empirical analysis and to quantify the spill-over effects caused by internal migration.

J43|Deciding to settle: rural-rural migration and agricultural labor supply in southwest Nigeria|The study investigates the factors that influence rural migrants’ decision to settle in rural communities as farm laborers in southern Nigeria. This is against the backdrop of the critical roles play by the migrants infilling the farm labor supply deficit; which is occasioned by high rural-urban drift (annual estimate is 37%). Data for the study were obtained from a sample survey of 766 rural migrants drawn from 81 communities in Southwestern Nigeria via a multistage sampling technique.The result shows that the migrants were from within and outside the country. About 76% of the migrants worked as farm laborers in the receiving community while wage employment accounted for about 80% of total employment. The logistic regression estimates reveal that, among other factors, previous migration efforts, household’ and community’ socio-economic and development statuses reduce the odds in favor of migrants’ willingness to settle in the receiving rural community.
J43|The Knowledge User Profile In The Rural Area Of Romania|The economic entities today are struggling to find the most effective way of combining the resources they have, tangible or intangible, in order to produce and sale the most wanted products, their purpose is to gain and keep the highest share of the market. These intangible resources, in our era, which is changing from industry based to knowledge based, are represented by knowledge, brain capacity and the power to use it at the highest rate. Knowledge has started to be considered a primordial factor, along with energy and matter, factors that hold the origin of the universe. The economic agents have realized that holding the latest information, in any domain or activity, and its proper use, also means holding a greater share of the market for a longer time, which leads to the final purpose of every economic unit, the profit. They can be called knowledge consumers. In Romania’s rural area things are not the same, the knowledge consumer is theoretically represented by any economical unit activating here, but, as shall be presented further in this paper, things are far from theory. Those who should be knowledge consumers are using old methods and technologies, they are based on their own experience and do not know how to use the information that regards them directly, things that have to be changed in order to be an active and competitive member of the E.U.
J43|Rainfall variability, occupational choice, and welfare in rural Bangladesh|The determinants of occupational focus versus diversification between household members in rural Bangladesh are investigated as an autonomous and proactive adaptation strategy against ex ante local rainfall variability risks. Nationally representative household level survey data are combined with historical climate variability information at the Upazila level. Flood prone Upazilas are distinguished from non-flood prone Upazilas, since the latter may be susceptible to higher risks from local rainfall variability. Adult members of the same household are found to be less likely than the household head to be self-employed in agriculture in areas with high local rainfall variability. Moreover, it is shown that occupational diversification comes at a cost in terms of lower household-level welfare (consumption). The effects of three policy actions, such as access to credits, safety net, and markets are considered. Access to market appears to be more effective in reducing the likelihood of costly within household occupational diversification as an ex ante climate risk reducing strategy as compared to access to credit and safety nets.

J43|Crop Prices, Agricultural Revenues, and the Rural Economy|Policy makers in the United States often justify agricultural subsidies by stressing that agriculture is the engine of the rural economy. We use the increase in crop prices in the late 2000s to estimate the marginal effect of increased agricultural revenues on local economies in the U.S. Heartland. We find that $1 more in crop revenue generated 64¢ in personal income, with most going to farm proprietors and workers (59%) or nonfarmers who own farm assets (36%). The evidence suggests a weak link between revenues and nonfarm income or employment, or on population. Cuts to agricultural subsidies are therefore likely to have little effect on the broader rural economy in regions like the Heartland.
J43|What motivates farm couples to seek off-farm labour? A logit analysis of job transitions|Some labour market consequences of transitions in the agriculture sector are examined by combining 20-year unbalanced panel data from Norwegian farm households and logit modelling of transition probabilities. The multi-dimensionality of the problem follows from two decision makers having four possible choices in each period: the farm operator and spouse can be working fully on the farm or having supplementary outside occupation. Transitions are modelled by five logit models. The most flexible model has a high number of parameters. Overall, the results indicate that transitions have mainly been directed towards the state where both partners work off the farm. An increasing livestock reduces the probability of moving to states with substantial off-farm labour participation. Increasing farm size tends to have the opposite effect. Recent on-farm investments come out with ambiguous effects. Having children seems to motivate operators to withdraw from off-farm labour and spouses to stay in or enter off-farm employment.
J43|Application of ICT to Agriculture as a Panacea to Unemployment in Nigeria|This study looked at the relevance of agriculture in the Nigeria society and the need for employment and application of information and communication technology into agricultural sector as a solution to unemployment problems in Nigeria. As information and communication technology is a booming sector of the economy which presently engaged the younger generations of Nigerians, it can as well be used to improve the economic development of Nigeria and Nigerians. Data was gathered through qualitative method with focus group and individual in-depth interview as tools. Participants were selected randomly from a group of students, farmers and traders in Ogun and Lagos States of Nigeria. Findings revealed that although government support was essential in improving the agricultural sector in Nigeria, it was also important for citadels of learning and the private sectors to join hands in creating the much needed awareness amongst the youths on the significance of the agricultures and application of ICT as a veritable but untapped employment opportunity. The study also revealed that there is need to include agricultural studies into present day school curricular as well as create massive awareness through the mass media, especially Nollywood industry to portray the agricultural sector in a good light in order to ensure economic growth and uptake by the younger generations.
J43|Employment Pattern, Skills and Training Issues among Informal Sector Workers in Mumbai Metropolitan Region|An informal sector in any economy provides different kinds of employment opportunities to people. In Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the female are more involved in regular jobs as compare to the causal and self-employed workers. The secondary and college studied male and female are found more in regular jobs. The high school studied male and illiterate female are working on causal jobs. The causal jobs do not require more education and skills. In self-employed category, the secondary school studied male and high school studied female are found more. The monthly income of workers involved in regular jobs is much higher than the causal and self-employed workers. The moderate malnourished females are found more as compare to the male in causal and self-employed category. The multi nominal logit regression model shows that the causal workers have positive correlation with illiterate male but it is negatively co-related with high school studied male, illiterate and secondary studied female. The monthly income, source of water, refrigerator and condom use is negatively co-related with causal workers as compare to regular workers. The self-employed workers have negative co-relation with monthly wage, source of water and watch cinema regularly as compare to the regular workers. Therefore government must provide infrastructural facilities in all slums of region. The infrastructural facilities such as water supply, electricity, sewage and solid waste collection must be provided in all slums of region. Causal workers must be provided the vocational training to start their own business. Commercial and co-operative banks must provide loans to poor people of slums. Females must be encouraged to take loan and start small business. Government must provide low cost housing to causal and self-employed workers in region. Such policies will certainly improve standard of living of informal sector workers in region.
J43|Methods of Accounting and Assessment of the Biological Assets and Agricultural Products in the Absence of an Active Market (by the International Accounting Standards)|Reform of accounting secures its refinement according to the universally recognized guidelines, assumptions and regulations set out in the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). According to this concept direct application of the IFRS or creation of the national system of accounting and reporting make the relevant information even more reliable. In addition to the financial accounting the application of IAS 41: ?Agriculture? supports the agricultural enterprises in management accounting, their development strategies and scientifically substantiated economic decisions. IAS 41: ?Agriculture? came into effect in 2003 emphasizing the specifics of agriculture and the methods how the information on farming and biological assets has to be reflected in financial reporting. IAS 41 also establishes Biological assets at their fair value that is noteworthy in terms of practicability. However, IAS application requires the national legislation to be drafted for accounting the livestock and plants and relevant changes made to the standard acts. Assessment of the biological assets and agricultural products is the biggest emerging challenge in the introduction of IAS 41. As yet, the normative documents in Georgia do not say anything as to the calculation of fair value of biological assets and agricultural products. As said above, the fair value at the active market cannot always be determined. Hence, we suggest to apply the databank we have developed. According to this method an enterprise may employ the databank in order to evaluate its own food products, perennial plants, live weight gain and brood (a calf, piglet, lamb, and stallion). In the absence of the active market, the suggested databank and methods of definition of biological assets and agricultural products make accurate and transparent assessment and accounting possible. However, it is noteworthy that whatever way the value may be defined in (depending on the availability or absence of the active market), the value determination method is to be reflected in the accounting policy developed in line with the IFRS.Assessment of the biological assets and agricultural products at their fair value is subject to adjustments, though the suggested method makes for more accurate evaluation of the performance results, transparency of information in the financial statement and efficiency of a company.
J43|Partial minimum wage compliance|In many developing countries, a significant portion of the wage distribution is found below the legal minimum wage. In order to fully understand the nature of this non-compliance, we need to compare the counterfactual wage distribution without the minimum wage law to the current wage distribution. Such a comparison could reveal partial compliance, where employers raise wages some of the way to the minimum wage, to balance out the benefits of non-compliance with the costs and penalties to the extent that they depend on the gap between the legal minimum wage and the wage actually paid. This paper presents a simple model of such partial compliance and uses its predictions to structure an empirical investigation of the impact of introducing a minimum wage law for agricultural workers in South Africa. We find that partial compliance is indeed taking place and further, the lowest wages are being raised disproportionately, consistent with the predictions of the model.

J43|A labour-based approach to the analysis of structural transformation: application to French agricultural holdings 2000|The question of farm size has long been a concern in the agricultural economics literature. The observation of a long-lasting persistence of so-called small farms drew the attention of numerous researchers. The size of farms is often approximated by the farm area in hectares or the added value and gross margin. We propose to investigate the opportunity to use labour (family labour and hired, permanent and seasonal, wage labour) as an entry point for a typology of agricultural holdings, with an application on French data from the Census collected in 2000. Then, we characterize the holdings belonging to the groups defined by the typology based on the type of labour.
J43|Occupational structure in the Polish territories at the turn of the 20th (1895-1900) century|Authors present the occupational structure of Polish lands at the turn of 20th century on the basis of censuses carried out in Germany (1895), Russia (1897) and Austria (1900). Our research provides corrections to the errors of the censuses, to a considerable extent. As a result, we present an occupational structure that allows a more complete the picture of the economic situation in the Polish territories at the end of the 19th century. The conducted research has created an opportunity to partially verify the assumption, which is common in Polish economical historiography, that a technological turning point and an industrial revolution occurred in Polish lands already in the 1870s and 1880s. Revised census data demonstrated that the extent of industrialization in Polish lands was still very limited in 1900.
J43|When the Levee Breaks: Black Migration and Economic Development in the American South|In the American South, post-bellum economic development may have been restricted in part by white landowners' access to low-wage black labor. This paper examines the impact of the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 on black out-migration and subsequent agricultural development. Flooded counties experienced an immediate and persistent out-migration of black population. Over time, landowners in flooded counties modernized agricultural production and increased its capital intensity relative to landowners in nearby similar non-flooded counties. Landowners resisted black out-migration, however, benefiting from the status quo system of labor-intensive agricultural production.
J43|Rainfall Forecasts, Weather, and Wages over the Agricultural Production Cycle|We look at the effects of rainfall forecasts and realized rainfall on equilibrium agricultural wages over the course of the agricultural production cycle. We show theoretically that a forecast of good weather can lower wages in the planting stage, by lowering ex ante out-migration, and can exacerbate the negative impact of adverse weather on harvest-stage wages. Using Indian household panel data describing early-season migration and district-level planting- and harvest-stage wages over the period 2005–2010, we find results consistent with the model, indicating that rainfall forecasts improve labor allocations on average but exacerbate wage volatility because they are imperfect.
J43|The Size Distribution of Farms and International Productivity Differences|We study the determinants of di fferences in farm-size across countries and their impact on agricultural and aggregate productivity using a quantitative sectoral model featuring a distribution of farms. Measured aggregate factors (capital, land, economy-wide productivity) account for ? of the observed differences in farm size and productivity. Policies and institutions that misallocate resources across farms have the potential to account for the remaining diff erences. Exploiting within-country variation in crop-specifi c price distortions and their correlation with farm size, we construct a cross-country measure of farm-size distortions which together with aggregate factors accounts for ? of the cross-country diff erences in size and productivity.
J43|Soil Endowments, Female Labor Force Participation, and the Demographic Deficit of Women in India|Differences in relative female employment by soil texture are used to explain the heterogeneous deficit of female children across districts within India. Soil texture varies exogenously and determines the depth of land tillage. Deep tillage, possible in loamy but not in clayey soil textures, reduces the demand for labor in agricultural tasks traditionally performed by women. Girls have a lower economic value where female labor opportunities are fewer. Consistently, higher relative female employment in agriculture improves the ratio of female to male children in districts that have a smaller fraction of loamy relative to clayey soils.
J43|The Productivity of Family and Hired Labour in EU Arable Farming| This paper investigates the impact of labour force composition on productivity in EU arable farming. We test the heterogeneity of family and hired labour for a set of eight EU member states. To this end, we estimate augmented production functions using FADN data for the years 2001-2008. The results reject the notion that hired labour is generally less productive than family workers. In fact, farms with a higher share of hired workers are more productive than pure family farms in countries traditionally characterised by family labour, namely France, West Germany and Poland. Here, an increase in reliance on hired labour or the shift of family labour to more productive tasks could raise productivity. This finding calls into question a main pillar of the received family farm theory. In about half the countries, there are no statistically different effects of both types of labour. For the United Kingdom, we find the classical case with family farms being more productive than those relying on hired labour. In this situation supervision by family members could increase productivity. As a side result, we find little evidence of non-constant technical returns to scale.
J43|The Role Of Human Factor In The Development Of Agriculture In Montenegro| We have started from the analysis of existing human resources in the paper, from the point of view of regional, qualification and age structure of the active labour force. Basic research method is deduction method, because we start from the general towards special and individual, with the aim to bring human factor and development of agriculture in Montenegro into connection. With regards to the key role of the human factor in the development of agriculture, a question emerges: is this factor in Montenegro a real opportunity or a constraint? Upon having insight into the existing situation of the human factor, we can conclude that there is an obvious discrepancy between demographic and economic centres. Expressed migration of the population from the north towards the south and from villages to cities brought the development of agricultural production into question. When the human factor engaged in agriculture is concerned, old population and elderly households prevail, which is a serious threat to the development, because depopulation and “senilization” caused abandoning villages, deagrarization and space devastation.
J43|The Effect Of Different Position Of Grape Clusters On The Bearing Shoot On Production Results Of Cabernet Sauvignon Clones| In this paper the differences were examined between clones of Cabernet sauvignon (clones ISV-F-V5, ISV-F-V6 and R5), i.e. the difference between uvological properties of grape clusters and grape berries, based on the different positions on the bearing shoot. Tests were conducted at the experimental field of the Faculty of Agriculture “Radmilovac.” Standard ampelographic methods were used in numerous analyses of grape yield, as well as uvological properties of clones. All data were statistically analyzed and processed by the method of two-factor analysis of variance with repeated measuring of one factor (height) and Tukey HSD test. Analysis of variance showed no significant differences between clones. The best results were achieved with grape clusters positioned in the base of bearing shoot. The first positioned grape clusters on the bearing shoot had the highest share in the total grape yield, the highest amount of sugar, and the highest positioned grape clusters had higher content of total acids. The differences determined between examined clones were in regard to productivity and quality of grapes which reflected also on production value.
J43|Farm Mechanisation and Rationality of Labour Use in Indian Agriculture: A Frontier Analysis of Cost of Cultivation Data| The paper examines the effective and efficient use of labour in Indian agriculture in the context of farm mechanisation. It explores the rationality of labour use in paddy production across states with the help of Stochastic Frontier Production Function analysis based on plot level data under the Cost of Cultivation Scheme during 2009-10. The study analyses the productivity, unit cost and farm income differentials and the variation in the extent of farm mechanisation and other inputs use in paddy production between and within states during 2004-05 to 2010-11. It also examines the impact of machine use on the production, productivity, cost and profitability in paddy production in India based on aggregated and disaggregated data. It is observed that there is no rational use of human labour in Indian agriculture (i.e., the present study rejects the hypothesis of equality between marginal productivity of labour and average wage rate). Machine use in agricultural production plays an important role in the increase in productivity and reduction of unit cost of production resulting profitable making farming viable in India. There is a great variation in the degree of farm mechanisation across Indian states but there is a good indication that inequality in input use and the variation in access to modern agricultural technology has decreased among the states during post-WTO period.
J43|Labour adjustments in agriculture: evidence from Romania| This paper explores the slow pace of structural change which has characterised the post-transition period in Romania and sheds light on the dynamics of labour adjustments. A multinomial logit is employed to investigate the determinants of inter-sectoral labour movements in the period 2003-06. The high share of farm employment in Romania, mostly characterised by family workers and self-employed, suggests that agriculture serves as a buffer against unemployment. Whereas the main channel of farm labour outflows is closely related to retirement, movements to other sectoral employment are signifi cantly hindered by the low levels of education. The findings are important from a policy point of view, suggesting the need for investments in human capital, specifi cally in education of the rural population with the purpose of enhancing the mobility of labour and facilitating a smooth transition across activities. At the same time, priority should be placed on rural development to encourage the diversification of the rural economy and the creation of alternative sources of income from non-agricultural activities.
J43|Some Aspects Of Employment In Romania‘S Agriculture In The European Context|Employment in agriculture is an important component of the policy of sustainable ruraldevelopment. This has implications for the effective use of agricultural potential that Romania has instabilizing rural population by achieving revenue to ensure an adequate quality of life. The analysispresented in this paper highlights common characteristics of employment in agriculture and thedisparities recorded in Romania and other countries that joined the European Union later (Poland,Hungary and Bulgaria) against one of the European countries with developed agriculture(Germany). Raised disparities concern especially the high level of employment in agriculture inRomania and low labor productivity, but other features of employment-related to demographics,mode of employment, training and education are analyzed.
J43|On Estimating The Effects of Legalization: Do Agricultural Workers Really Benefit?| The question of whether legalization affects the economic returns of immigrants has been the focus of many empirical studies in the past two decades. Their results have consistently shown that there exists significant wage differences between legal and illegal workers. However, the validity of such findings have been questioned by many researchers, given the lack of good identification strategies to correctly account for omitted variables. In this article we move away from the methods previously used in the literature, which in most part rely on selection on observables, and propose to use recently developed techniques designed specifically to address the issue of selection into treatment based (in some degree) on unobservable variables. Our results highlight that measuring such effects is much more difficult, from an econometrics standpoint, than what previous analysis claim and suggest that lower skill levels and not discrimination explain differences in economic outcomes of immigrants.
J43|O-Ring production on U.S. hog farms: joint choices of farm size, technology, and compensation| We hypothesize that hog production can be characterized by complementarities between new technologies, worker skills, and farms size. Such production processes are consistent with Kremer's O-ring production theory in which a single mistake in any one of several complementary tasks in a firm's production process can lead to catastrophic failure of the product's value. In hog production, mistakes that introduce disease or pathogens into the production facility can cause a total loss of the herd. Consistent with predictions derived from the O-ring theory, we provide evidence that the most skilled workers concentrate in the largest and most technologically advanced farms and are paid more than comparable workers on smaller farms. These findings suggest that worker skills, new technologies, and farm size are complements in production. The complementarities create returns to scale to large hog confinements, consistent with the dramatic increase in market share of very large farms over the past 20 years.
J43|Demand for Seasonal Wage Labour in Agriculture: What Does Family Farming Hide?|" type=""main"" xml:id=""jage12019-abs-0001""> This article draws on the agricultural household literature to understand the dynamics of wage labour on farms in a context of family farming. The recent evolution towards an increased use of seasonal wage labour motivates the original distinction of three types of labour: family labour, permanent-wage labour and seasonal-wage labour. Considering the two wage labour types and hiring cost for seasonal workers, our empirical results based on 2000 French data on fruit and vegetable farms suggest that the choice between hiring permanent or seasonal wage labour is not only determined by the seasonality of the activity. Indeed, the characteristics of the local labour market also affect the trade-off between permanent and seasonal wage labour. This result provides insights on the substitutability of the two labour types, especially when the local labour market is tight. Moreover, the substitution of seasonal-wage labour for permanent-wage labour can occur in the agricultural sector as a mean of increasing flexibility as well as reducing costs and commitments. Finally, family labour is found to substitute for wage labour and more specifically for seasonal-wage labour."
J43|Informal employment in transition countries: empirical evidence and research challenges|Even though informal employment is wide-spread in transition economies the literature on this phenomenon in the region is rather scarce. For policy makers it is important to know the incidence and the determinants of informal employment. In the first part of the paper we demonstrate that its incidence and to a lesser degree its determinants depend on the definition used. We then discuss studies that attempt to test for labor market segmentation in transition economies along the formal-informal divide. The presented results are inconclusive and we come to the conclusion that more work needs to be done before we can make definitive statements about whether labor markets are integrated or segmented in transition economies. Last but not least we introduce a new research area that links risk preferences and selection into labor market states. We show that if individuals have a choice, relatively risk loving workers have an increased likelihood to choose informal employment and self-employment.
J43|Climate vulnerability, communities' resilience and child labour|This article clarifies and quantifies the causal impact of climate change vulnerability on child labour incidence and intensity. For this purpose, we create an index of vulnerability to climate change, composed of biophysical vulnerability and communities? resilience. Both, participation to economic activities and to household chores have been taken into account. We find that climate vulnerability negatively affects child labour incidence and intensity, while has no significant impact on household chores. We conclude that child labour is an adjustment variable to local labour market conditions, not correlated with communities? resilience.
J43|Productivity Response to a Contract Change|This paper studies the productivity impact of a contract change. The setting is a tea plantation in India. The activity in question is tea-plucking, the output from which is measurable and contractible. Payments to pluckers consist of a baseline wage, along with piece rates per kilogram of output that vary over different production intervals. [BREAD working paper no. 412].
J43|Sector rural colombiano: Dinámica laboral y opciones de afiliación a la seguridad social|Este documento presenta un diagnóstico de los aspectos demográficos, del mercado laboral y socio-económicos que influyen en la afiliación a la seguridad social de la población en el área rural. Aspectos como la baja escolaridad, los bajos ingresos, los altos niveles de informalidad y pobreza y la estacionalidad de la producción agrícola no permiten aumentar el nivel de afiliación. Muestra también que a pesar de las características del sector rural, no existe un arreglo institucional especial para la afiliación a la seguridad social. Finalmente, el documento esboza la posibilidad de la universalización de la cobertura en salud y pensión de la población rural.
J43|Informalidad laboral cafetera: rasgos, determinantes y propuestas de política (Versión para comentarios)|Una caracterización de la informalidad del empleo cafetero, entendida como la no cotización de pensión, basada en el análisis de los datos del censo de población y las encuestas de hogares, así como de la información cualitativa obtenida de grupos focales realizados entre trabajadores y productores. La mayoría de la ocupación es informal, dado que la asistencia social es percibida como un sustituto de los pagos a la seguridad social y también debido a la insuficiencia de ingresos frente a la cotización mínima. La cotización de pensiones es más probable entre los trabajadores educados, hombres y jóvenes, donde hay presencia institucional del Ministerio del Trabajo y mejor desarrollo empresarial. La migración laboral desde municipios con alta (baja) informalidad la aumenta (reduce) en el municipio receptor. Así la formalización laboral podría ser promovida mediante una clara diferenciación entre la protección social y la asistencia social; a escala municipal proveyendo de más Inspecciones de Trabajo, también mejorando educación y productividad; revisando el mínimo de la cotización y estableciéndole incentivos, entre otros aspectos.
J43|The first poverty line? Davies' and Eden's investigation of rural poverty in the late 18th-century England|Two important and well-known surveys of the household budgets of the English rural labouring poor were produced by David Davies and Frederick Eden in the 1790s. We revisit these from the point of view of their original rationale — an investigation of the characteristics and extent of poverty in the countryside. We argue that Davies' standard of ‘tolerable comfort’ can lay claim to being the first poverty line based upon the application of a minimum consumption standard to household income. We find that the majority of households fall below this standard, although those in the south of England were worst off, that family size was the largest coefficient and poverty reduced as the age of the first child increased. The incidence of poverty was not highly correlated with the absence of a woman wage earner.
J43|Latifundia revisited: Market power, land inequality and agricultural efficiency. Evidence from interwar Italian agriculture|This paper proposes a new interpretation of the historically controversial role of Italian latifundia. Relying on standard economic theory, the paper explores a simple though neglected mechanism linking land inequality and inefficiency: market power. In underdeveloped economies with serious constraints on labor mobility, high ownership concentration will endow landowners with market power in local labor markets. The resulting equilibrium explains many of the often criticized features of latifundia, without the need to factor in irrational behavior (the preferred explanation of Italian traditional historians) or social institutions and capital market imperfections (explanations advanced by economists in different contexts). According to the model here explored the main effects of inequality are of a distributive rather than of a productive nature. The market power hypothesis is strongly supported by the available quantitative evidence provided by an unexploited dataset on all local labor markets of Italy at the end of the 1930s.
J43|Does educational attainment reduce agricultural day laborer injuries in Mexico?|Agricultural work is an inherently dangerous job with the risk of injury considered part of a worker’s compensation. We focus on the determinants of an agricultural day laborer (jornalero) having experienced an injury while working. The policy variable of interest is the worker’s level of educational attainment as workers with a higher level may be better able to understand how equipment works and safety warnings. Controlling for other factors, we find that at the variable means, a jornalero with an additional year of education has a 7.7 percent lower probability of having experienced an accident.
J43|Productivity Response to a Contract Change|This paper studies the productivity impact of a contract change for tea pluckers in an Indian plantation. The contract, implemented at the end of a three-year cycle in which contracts are generally revised, was (a) the joint outcome of negotiations between twenty unions and plantations, (b) mandated to respect a state government notification stipulating a new minimum wage for plantation workers statewide, and (c) applicable equally to all the plantations in the local region. The contract raised the baseline wage by 30% but lowered marginal incentives, by shifting the existing piece rates to higher minimum thresholds and eliminating an existing penalty per unit for low output. In the one month following the contract change, output increased by a factor between 30-60%, the exact number depending on the choice of counterfactual and the set of controls applied. This large and contrarian response to a flattening of marginal incentives is at odds with the standard model, including one that incorporates dynamic incentives, and it can only be partly accounted for by higher supervisory effort. We conclude that the increase is a “behavioral” response. Yet in subsequent months, the increase is comprehensively reversed. In fact, an entirely standard model with no behavioral or dynamic features that we estimate off the pre-change data, fits the observations four months after the contract change remarkably well. While not an unequivocal indictment of the recent emphasis on “behavioral economics,” the findings suggest that non-standard responses may be ephemeral, especially in employment contexts in which the baseline relationship is delineated by financial considerations in the first place. From an empirical perspective, therefore, it is ideal to examine responses to a contract change over an substantial period of time.
J43|Labour markets for irrigated agriculture in central Ethiopia: Wage premiums and segmentation|Labour market segmentation in developing countries has been considered in a growing literature, some of which suggests an informal sector wage premium. However, such studies have mainly focused on urban labour markets and have not discriminated between the informally self-employed and wage workers. This paper examines segmentation in rural markets for agricultural wage workers in Ethiopia, controlling for location, farming systems and observed worker characteristics. Applying an endogenous switching model with simultaneous estimation of wage equations it establishes an informal sector wage premium, self-selection into the informal sector and sectorally-distinct wage determination mechanisms.
J43|Networks And Organizational Analysis: Roles, Positions And Power Of Fragmentation Of Social And Commercial Relationships Redes Y Analisis Organizacional: Roles, Posiciones Y Poder De Fragmentacion De Las Relaciones Sociales Y Comerciales|"With the Cooperative Society of Agricultural Producers and Lombricultores of San Pedro TlapacoyÃ¡n, Veracruz, Mexico"", we observe a problem is the attitude and inter organizational relationships of the producers. Through indicators of social nets, we observe the position of actor inside the net of relationships and the relationships plays with more power of fragmentation in the net. The results indicate the importance of an actor is more in function of its position in the net that of the number of relationships that each member of the group of producers presents. We found that each actor plays different roles in the function of his individual interests and that social relationships present bigger power of fragmentation on commercial relationships."
J43|Non-Farm Entrepreneurship in Rural Africa: Patterns and Determinants|We are the first to provide a comparative empirical analysis of non-farm entrepreneurship in rural Africa, using the World Bank's unique LSMSISA dataset. This dataset covers six countries over the period 2005 to 2012. We find that rural enterprises tend to be small, informal household enterprises that provide predominantly goods and services to the local economy, and operate intermittently due to seasonality in farming. We furthermore establish that the likelihood of operating an off-farm enterprise depends on individual capabilities, household characteristics and institutional factors. While the results of some variables show consistency across the sample, we also find much heterogeneity, suggesting that rural entrepreneurship is also a response to country-level circumstances and policies. Although more than 50 years have passed since rural development was identified as a priority for African countries, rural entrepreneurship continues to fulfill mainly a risk-diversifying role. This may suggest that policies to foster effective rural-urban migration and wage employment in rural areas, have largely failed in Africa.
J43|Payment for Ecosystem Services from Forests|Every year between 2000 and 2010, our planet lost native forests roughly the size of Costa Rica. (FAO, 2010). This rapid deforestation has dramatically changed the chemical composition of the world's atmosphere, the level of biodiversity, and the presence of vegetation key to maintaining watershed function and preventing landslides. There has been a boom in the design of local and international policy instruments to prevent further deforestation and encourage forest growth. This paper reviews the theory and evidence surrounding forest-related Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes intended to slow and reverse deforestation. We cover the most recent work touching on a range of issues related to PES programs, including research on targeting, contract design, environmental effectiveness, challenges to program implementation, spillovers, and distributional considerations of conditional cash transfers. We also highlight areas of potential future research.
J43|Labor Productivity in Rural African Enterprises: Empirical Evidence from the LSMS-ISA|Although non-farm enterprises are ubiquitous in rural Sub-Saharan Africa, little is yet known about their productivity. In this paper we contribute to filling this gap by providing estimates of labor productivity in enterprises for Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, and Uganda. Using the World Bank's LSMS-ISA database, we find that rural enterprises are on average less productive than those in urban areas, and that female-owned enterprises are less productive than male-owned enterprises. By estimating Heckman selection and panel data models, we find that education and access to credit are associated with higher labor productivity, while households that experience shocks operate less productive enterprises. Furthermore we provide evidence that enterprises that operate throughout the year are more productive. We conclude that gender, education, shocks, access to finance, and location matter for labor productivity in rural Africa, and that policy decisions tackling the shortcomings could significantly contribute to a better business environment and increased labor productivity.
J43|Young Entrepreneurs in Rural Africa: Prevalence, Determinants, Productivity|Africa is not only the poorest and most rural continent, it is also the most youthful continent in terms of population. Given the large number of young job seekers that will enter the labor market over the next decade, we need a better understanding of rural non-farm entrepreneurship, particularly with regard to the role of young adults in this sector. This paper contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on (i) the prevalence of enterprises operated by young adults and the contribution they make to rural household income, the (ii) determinants of enterprise operation, and (iii) labor productivity in enterprises operated by young owners. Using the World Bank's recent LSMS-ISA database that covers six countries in Sub-Saharan African, we find that young adults present a lower share of enterprise owners and derive less income from it. Using a Heckman selection model and panel data analysis, we further find that young household head have a lower likelihood of operating and enterprise and if they operate one, these enterprises are less productive than those of older adults. We conclude that policies to support young entrepreneurs in rural Africa should not only focus on creating conditions that attract young adults to start enterprises, but to also enable young entrepreneurs to improve productivity in already existing enterprises. If these enterprises grow and survive, they can provide a part of the growing number of non-farm jobs that will be needed in Africa's rural areas.
J43|A Biological Basis for the Gender Wage Gap: Fecundity and Age and Educational Hypogamy|This paper shows how a shorter fecundity horizon for females (a biological constraint) leads to age and educational disparities between husbands and wives. Empirical support is based on data from a natural experiment commencing before and ending after China's 1980 one-child law. The results indicate that fertility in China declined by about 1.2-1.4 births per woman as a result of China's anti-natalist policies. Concomitantly spousal age and educational differences narrowed by approximately 0.5-1.0 and 1.0-1.6 years respectively. These decreases in the typical husband's age and educational advantages are important in explaining the division of labor in the home, often given as a cause for the gender wage gap. Indeed, as fertility declined, which has been the historical trend in most developed countries, husband-wife age and educational differences diminished leading to less division of labor in the home and a smaller gender wage disparity. Unlike other models of division of labor in the home which rely on innately endogenous factors, this paper's theory is based on an exogenous biological constraint.
J43|Seasonal Credit Constraints and Agricultural Labor Supply: Evidence from Zambia|Small-scale farming remains the primary source of income for a majority of the population in developing countries. While most farmers primarily work on their own fields, off-farm labor is common among small-scale farmers. A growing literature suggests that off-farm labor is not the result of optimal labor allocation, but is instead driven by households' inability to cover short-term consumption needs with savings or credit. We conduct a field experiment in rural Zambia to investigate the relationship between credit availability and rural labor supply. We find that providing households with access to credit during the growing season substantially alters the allocation of household labor, with households in villages randomly selected for a loan program selling on average 25 percent less off-farm labor. We also find that increased credit availability is associated with higher consumption and increases in local farming wages. Our results suggest that a substantial fraction of rural labor supply is driven by short-term constraints, and that access to credit markets may improve the efficiency of labor allocation overall.
J43|Informal Employment in Transition Countries: Empirical Evidence and Research Challenges|Even though informal employment is wide-spread in transition economies the literature on this phenomenon in the region is rather scarce. For policy makers it is important to know the incidence and the determinants of informal employment. In the first part of the paper we demonstrate that its incidence and to a lesser degree its determinants depend on the definition used. We then discuss studies that attempt to test for labor market segmentation in transition economies along the formal-informal divide. The presented results are inconclusive and we come to the conclusion that more work needs to be done before we can make definitive statements about whether labor markets are integrated or segmented in transition economies. Last but not least we introduce a new research area that links risk preferences and selection into labor market states. We show that if individuals have a choice, relatively risk loving workers have an increased likelihood to choose informal employment and self-employment.
J43|L’evoluzione della presenza femminile nell’agricoltura italiana ed i nuovi tratti dell’imprenditoria delle donne|This paper analyses the evolution of the women work in agriculture, focusing on the development of female entrepreneurship. Agriculture Census data and other statistical sources allow to underline the relevant transformation of female presence in agriculture: from a total submission to the male direction up to the ’50, the industrial transformation of the Italian economy, including agriculture, promoted a progressive emerging of women relevance in agriculture also as entrepreneurs. Further, the paper underlines the increasing importance of the females among the new multidimensional forms of entrepreneurship. This modern and dynamic trait of female enterprises is driven and supported by the new direction of EU agricultural policy. However, the paper stresses also the weakness of women enterprises. Indeed, a comparison of the female and male enterprises highlights a weaker performance of the first ones in term of dimension of enterprises, revenues and education.
J43|Particulate Pollution and the Productivity of Pear Packers|We study the effect of outdoor air pollution on the productivity of indoor workers at a pear-packing factory. Increases in fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a pollutant that readily penetrates indoors, leads to significant decreases in productivity, with effects arising at levels below air quality standards. In contrast, pollutants that do not travel indoors, such as ozone, have little, if any, effect on productivity. This effect of outdoor pollution on indoor worker productivity suggests an overlooked consequence of pollution. Back-of-the envelope calculations suggest the labor savings from nationwide reductions in PM2.5 generated a sizable fraction of total welfare benefits.
J43|Does the Jack of All Trades Hold the Winning Hand? Comparing the Role of Specialized versus General Skills in the Returns to an Agricultural Degree|This paper examines the roles of specialized versus general skills in explaining variation in the returns to an agriculture degree among graduates working both inside and outside the agricultural industry. The focus on returns by sector of employment is motivated by our finding that most agricultural graduates are employed in non-agricultural jobs. In that study, a sample of alumni graduating from a large Midwestern public university between 1982 and 2006 shows that alumni with majors more specialized in agriculture earned a premium from working in the agriculture industry, but this advantage has diminished over time. Agricultural graduates with more general training earn more outside than inside agriculture. Higher-ability graduates in more industry-focused curricula tend to sort into the agricultural industry, while higher-ability graduates in broader curricula tend to choose jobs outside of agriculture. All graduates are more likely to accept agricultural employment when the farm economy is strong, but agricultural graduates who enter agricultural jobs when the farm economy is weak suffer lifetime earnings reductions. These findings suggest that greater levels of specialization may limit a graduate's ability to adjust to changing economic circumstances. Agriculture degree programs could benefit from curriculum innovations that focus on developing more generalized skills.
J43|Estimating the Impact of Minimum Wages on Employment, Wages, and Non-Wage Benefits: The Case of Agriculture in South Africa|Assessments of the impact of minimum wages on labor market outcomes in Africa are relatively rare. In part this is because the available data do not permit adequate treatment of econometric issues that arise in such assessments. This paper, however, attempts to estimate the impact of introducing a minimum wage law in the agriculture sector in South Africa, based on 15 waves of the biannual Labor Force Survey conducted between September 2000 and September 2007. The chosen sample includes six waves before the legislation's effective date (March 2003) and nine afterwards. To assess whether the changes experienced by farm workers are unique, we identify a control group that has similar characteristics to the treatment group. Our econometric approach involves using two alternative specifications of a difference-in-differences model. We test whether employers reduced employment, and whether they responded at the intensive margin by reducing hours of work. The results suggest a significant employment reduction in agriculture from the minimum wage (and particularly a noticeable move away from employment of part-time workers), an increase in wages on average, and a rise in non-wage benefits compliance. Our analysis also indicates that, firstly, overall average of hours worked fell in the post-law period, suggesting that employers adjusted to some extent on the intensive margin. Secondly, it appears that hours of work increased more in areas where wages were lower in the pre-law period, driven largely by the fall in part-time employment.
J43|Labor Movement and Economic Contribution : Evidence from Europe|A movement of labor across sectors is the familiar scenario in every country. Labor generally moves from relatively low-paid sector to relatively high-paid sector. The purpose of this study is to estimate the effect of a change in employment in agricultural, industrial, and service sector on economic performance through panel data analysis. The result reveals that only a movement in industrial sector positively contributes to the economy which leads to the integrated policy aimed at improving the condition in manufacturing sector.
J43|Impact of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Program on Rural Poor - A Simple Theoretical Discourse|The basic objective of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Program (MGNREGP) is to provide safety net for the rural poor and to stabilize agricultural production through creating productive assets via employing labourers. Two important linked aspects are worth noting in respect of implementation of the program. Implementation of MGNREGP in multiple cropping areas can increase the employment opportunities among the landless agricultural labourers and thus has inevitably raised their bargaining power particularly during the time of second crop i.e. post rainy season cultivation. Besides this, Government of India has persistently been hiking per man-day MGNREGP wage. Both these instances undoubtedly increase the reservation wage in agricultural labour market which in turn may have an adverse effect on the farm income in the multi-cropping areas. In this paper, maximum possible per man-day MGNREGP wage is determined at which the corresponding agricultural wage can help the marginal farmers to sustain their net farm income at least at subsistence level. This paper also establishes the fact that as a result of the hike of MGNREGP wage, sustenance of subsistence net farm income may lead to price hike in agricultural sector. The study also attempts to analyze the results in respect of aggregate net pecuniary benefits of the rural poor in the light of MGNREGP considering different agricultural frameworks.
J43|Generation Dynamics and Territorial Aspects of Italian Agriculture|The ageing of farmers and lack of successors are major concerns for the future of the sector. The paper analyses the age structure of family workers with a twofold objective. The ageing dynamics is analyzed in order to seek out its inertial components as well as any new trends there may be. The latest Census shows that the unbalance basically lies the failure to replace the family workforce, now about to retire. A cluster analysis seeks to shed light on the factors that influence the participation of young workers in agricultural activities. Different territorial patterns of relations emerge. In the Northern provinces a positive relationship between a higher share of young farmers and a more solid productive structure in the primary sector emerges, as well as a better-off economy. In the Southern provinces a higher share of young farmers is associated with a more fragile context that offers fewer employment alternatives.
J43|Os sentidos do passado: questão agrária e luta pela terra no interior de São Paulo (Brasil, 1949)|In this article, search the memories of the communist uprising of 1949, Fernandópolis, in the Northwest of São Paulo, Brazil. The dispute around the memory and the construction of meanings is related to the hiding the historical struggle for land and against exploitation in the country. The official versions about the movement are marked for limited communism memories. Other memories relate to the struggle of workers during the decades of 1940-50 to the land struggles of rural landless contemporary. This interpretive act is relevant, since attributes meaning to fact and constitute in evidence plural experiences.
J43|The Legacies of Forced Freedom: China's Treaty Ports|This paper investigates the long-run development of China's treaty ports from the mid-eighteenth century until today. Focusing on a sample of prefectures on the coast or on the Yangtze River, I document the dynamic development paths of treaty ports and their neighbors in alternate phases of closedness and openness. I also provide suggestive evidence on migration and sector-wise growth to understand the advantage of treaty ports in the long run. © 2014 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
J43|Â¿Acceden al subsidio por desempleo los asalariados rurales en Uruguay? Análisis de la situación actual y simulación de esquemas alternativos|Concerning rural labor, Uruguay is a special case in the region since the level of coverage of social security for rural workers is high (above 70%), while they have some benefits that are typically not found for these workers, such as a specific unemployment allowance. In this work, using administrative records of employment histories available between 1997 and 2009, the effective access of rural workers to the unemployment insurance scheme is analyzed and the access to two alternative systems is simulated. Results show that in the current system the level of coverage of the insurance for rural workers facing unemployment is low (46.5%) and that the general system of unemployment insurance applied for the rest of formal employees would have a coverage 15% higher if it is applied to rural workers. However, in none of the scenarios presented the coverage of the unemployment insurance exceeds 70%. This would indicate that there are special conditions of the contributions structure and the duration of employment periods of these workers that do not allow them to complete the requirements to access the right to the unemployment insurance. Therefore, additional policies would be required.
J43|Rural Labor Markets: insights from Indian villages|In this paper, labour market behaviour in rural India is examined, with the objectives of assessing the structure of the work status among sample individuals and of testing segmented labour market theory. Simple regression techniques and an estimated modified Mincer equation to determine earnings are used in the paper, followed by the application of multinomial regression analysis. Labour markets are segmented based on social background to some extent, which is in line with segmented labour market theory based on caste, sex and assets. Most of the more highly educated remain unemployed due to a lack of sufficient employment opportunities, even though higher education increases the probability of being engaged in regular employment. However, households invest heavily in childrenâ€™s education in the hope that they will obtain regular employment. Policies that promote asset ownership, household savings and skills development would increase peopleâ€™s chances of obtaining regular employment with higher earnings.
J43|Konsequenzen des Mindestlohns für Arbeitgeber und Arbeitnehmer in der Landwirtschaft: Hypothesen und Datenlage|Zum 01. Januar 2015 wird in Deutschland flächendeckend ein gesetzlicher Mindestlohn in Höhe von 8,50 Euro brutto pro Stunde eingeführt. In der Landwirtschaft verdienen vergleichsweise viele Beschäftigte weniger als den Mindestlohn, so dass mit Anpassungsreaktionen landwirtschaftlicher Betriebe gerechnet werden muss. In diesem Working Paper werden diesbezüglich mögliche Arbeitshypothesen formuliert, und aktuell für die Forschung zugängliche Datensätze werden auf ihre Eignung für entsprechende quantitative Wirkungsanalysen geprüft. Die meisten Mikrodatensätze, deren Evaluationspotenzial in Bezug auf hinreichend große Branchen positiv bewertet werden kann, lassen sich aufgrund zu geringer Fallzahlen nicht für Analysen zur Landwirtschaft verwenden. Grundsätzlich kommen die Ergebnisse der Testbetriebsbuchführung (Bundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft) für Mindestlohnstudien in Frage, sie erlauben jedoch keine genaue Identifikation der vom Mindestlohn betroffenen Betriebe. Insgesamt sind die Möglichkeiten der quantitativen Wirkungsanalyse im Bereich Landwirtschaft begrenzt. In zukünftigen Mindestlohnstudien wird es daher notwendig sein, qualitative Methoden einzusetzen.
J43|Selection, Agriculture, and Cross-Country Productivity Differences|Cross-country labor productivity differences are larger in agriculture than in non-agriculture. We propose a new explanation for these patterns in which the self-selection of heterogeneous workers determines sector productivity. We formalize our theory in a general-equilibrium Roy model in which preferences feature a subsistence food requirement. In the model, subsistence requirements induce workers that are relatively unproductive at agricultural work to nonetheless select into the agriculture sector in poor countries. When parameterized, the model predicts that productivity differences are roughly twice as large in agriculture as non-agriculture even when countries differ by an economy-wide efficiency term that affects both sectors uniformly. (JEL J24, J31, J43, O11, O13, O40)
J43|The Shadow Value of Legal Status--A Hedonic Analysis of the Earnings of U.S. Farm Workers| The purpose of this study is to estimate the shadow price of the legal status of farm workers. A hedonic function in terms of farm work experience, gender, education level, language skill, and legal status is estimated with control variables for employer type, farm work type, as well as other geographical and time variables. The data is drawn from the National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS). The preliminary results show that while legal status did contribute significantly to the wage differences it is not the major factor. After taking account of the composition shift in demographic characteristics, the quality adjusted labor prices still doubled in the past two decades.
J43|Crop Prices, Agricultural Revenues, and the Local Economy of the U.S. Heartland| Economists broadly recognize that the U.S. rural economy is no longer a farm economy, yet policy makers often justify support for agriculture by stressing the sector’s importance to the rural economy. We use the historically high crop prices in the late 2000s to estimate the marginal effect of increased agricultural revenues on local economies in the U.S. Heartland. We find that $1 in additional crop revenue generated 67 cents in local income, most of which went to farm proprietors and workers (58 percent) or nonfarmers who own farm assets (36 percent). There is no evidence of an effect on nonfarm income or employment, or on population.
J43|Rural Employment Scheme and Agricultural Wage Rate Nexus: An Analysis across States| This paper on Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has covered two objectives; one, whether the introduction of MGNREGS has increased the wage rates for agricultural labourers across the states and two, if so what are the factors that determine the growth rate of wages for farm labourers. The study is based on the secondary data on farm wages published by the Labour Bureau of India by gender and farm operation across the states and has covered the period 2000-01 to 2010-11. To present a comparative picture, the study period has been divided into two sub-periods, viz. pre- MGNREGS (2000-01 to 2005-06) and post-MGNREGS (2005-06 to 2010-11). The study has shown that the real wage rates have increased substantially during post-MGNREGS period as compared to pre- MGNREGS period for both male and female agricultural labourers in all the major farming operations. The rate of increase in wage rates has been found to be higher across the female agricultural labourers as compared to their male counterparts. The regression analysis has suggested that the average days of employment per household by MGNREGS, productivity of foodgrains, and road density have positively fuelled the growth rate of wages for both male and female farm labourers.
J43|Dynamics of Labour Demand and its Determinants in Punjab Agriculture| The study on dynamics of labour demand in Punjab agriculture has revealed that between 1985-86 and 2006-07, the per-hectare labour use has declined by about 23 per cent; more so, in the case of dominant crops like wheat and paddy that have experienced large-scale mechanization. Wheat and paddy had together accounted for about 52 per cent of the gross cropped area in 1985-86, which further increased to 73 per cent in 2006-07. However, increase in labour use in cotton cultivation has been only marginal. The positive effect of agricultural growth on labour use has got neutralized due to the significant displacement of human labour by machines and also due to rising wage rates. The elasticity of labour use in agriculture has fallen drastically during the past two decades indicating little potential for absorption of additional labour in agriculture.
J43|Determinants to Leave Agriculture and Change Occupational Sector: Evidence from an Enlarged EU|The objective of this paper is to explore the determinants to leave agriculture and change occupational sector. We adopt a 3-step multivariate probit where we control for selection bias at two stages in the decisions to work and, at a later stage, exit agriculture. The analysis is based on the European Union Labour Force Survey data expanded with additional regional indicators. The main results suggest that younger individuals are more likely to leave farming activities, although the largest outflows of agricultural labour are mainly associated with the retirement of people. Self-employed and family workers are generally less likely to leave agriculture and those with low levels of educations are found to be significantly constrained in entering the non-farm economy. Moreover, labour market conditions at the regional level do matter for switching occupational sector. Differences in the results among the selected NMS and the EU-15 can be explained by the diverse production structures, suggesting different capacities to release and absorb labour.
J43|Hidden Underemployment Among Irish Farm Holders 1996-2011| This paper examines the factors driving hidden underemployment on Irish farms during the course of the economic boom in Ireland and the subsequent economic decline post 2008. This measure of hidden underemployment is due to differences between the farmer‟s reported amount of labour and the standard labour requirement estimated in the Teagasc National Farm Survey. Hidden underemployment can be attributed to a number of factors relating to inadequate employment situations as described at the 16th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (16th ICLS) such as low productivity, casual work practices and the poor utilisation of skills and other factors specific to agriculture and/or self employment. We place particular attention upon the potential role of off-farm labour supply in solving the underemployment problem. We use a two-stage residual inclusion model and a random effects probit model to examine the forces behind farm underemployment. This paper provides an interesting set of results given that the end of the economic boom phase co-incided closely but not precisely with the decoupling of farm-level subsidies in 2006.
J43|Migration and Agricultural Efficiency in Kosovo| Kosovo, like most of rural Central and Eastern Europe, has witnessed substantial out-migration in recent years, prompting debates on the effect of migration on agricultural efficiency. This paper addresses this issue, drawing on a large (n=2217) and representative sample of agricultural households. A twostage estimation procedure is followed: a frontier technique to estimate the effect of migration on farm efficiency, followed by a propensity score based matching approach to robustly estimate the sample average effect on efficiency for different levels of migration intensity. Migration has an efficiency decreasing effect which is amplified for better educated and older workers.
J43|Off-farm labour participation of Italian farmers, state dependence and the CAP reform| We analyse the determinants of off-farm labour participation of farmers, an issue relevant in view of the agricultural sector coping with increasing productivity and in terms of rural development. We apply a farm-household theoretical model. The data for the empirical analysis are a 5 year (2003-2007) balanced panel of 3294 Italian farms, drawn from the Farm Accounting Data Network. The explanatory variable is the dummy indicator of the farm operator working or not off the farm. The explanatory variables comprise personal, household, and farm characteristics, and few variables of the local labour market. Since in the period a major reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) took place, we also add related variables. For estimation, we use different dynamic models, accounting for both heterogeneity and state dependence, as well as for the initial conditions (Heckmann, 1981; Wooldridge, 2005; Orme, 2001). Our results suggest that, when keeping into account all these features, present work state is almost totally explained by previous state and by idiosyncratic characteristics, which implies a strong persistence. Variables concerning personal characteristics found to be relevant in cross-sectional analyses are not found to be significant in the dynamic setting. Finally, the variables related to the reform have no statistically significant effect on the decision to work off-farm.
J43|Agricultural Labour Market Flexibility in the EU and Candidate Countries|Factor markets that function well are a crucial condition for the competitiveness and growth of agriculture. Institutions and regulation may give rise to agricultural labour market heterogeneity, which could have important effects on the functioning of the labour market and other agricultural factor markets in EU member states. This paper first defines the institutional framework for the labour market, and then presents a brief literature review of previous studies of labour market institutional frameworks. Based on the literature, a survey to characterise agricultural labour markets was undertaken, which was implemented for a selection of EU27 and EU candidate countries, with responses based on expert opinion. The survey data were then used to construct indices of labour market flexibility/rigidity for the countries examined. These indices were used to make inter-country labour market comparisons and to draw inferences about the institutions and functioning of the agricultural labour market.
J43|Determinants of Farm Labour Use: A Comparison between Ireland and Italy| This paper examines the effect of the decoupling of farm direct payments upon the off-farm labour supply decisions of farmers in both Ireland and Italy, using panel data from the Farm Business Survey (REA) and FADN database covering the period from 2002 to 2009 to model these decisions. Drawing from the conceptual agricultural household model, the authors hypothesise that the decoupling of direct payments led to an increase in off-farm labour activity despite some competing factors. This hypothesis rests largely upon the argument that the effects of changes in relative wages have dominated other factors. At a micro level, the decoupling-induced decline in the farm wage relative to the non-farm wage ought to have provoked a greater incentive for off-farm labour supply. The main known competing argument is that decoupling introduced a new source of non-labour income i.e. a wealth effect. This may in turn have suppressed or eliminated the likelihood of increased off-farm labour supply for some farmers. For the purposes of comparative analysis, the Italian model utilises the data from the REA database instead of the FADN as the latter has a less than satisfactory coverage of labour issues. Both models are developed at a national level. The paper draws from the literature on female labour supply and uses a sample selection corrected ordinary least squares model to examine both the decisions of off-farm work participation and the decisions regarding the amount of time spent working off-farm. The preliminary results indicate that decoupling has not had a significant impact on off-farm labour supply in the case of Ireland but there appears to be a significantly negative relationship in the Italian case. It still remains the case in both countries that the wealth of the farmer is negatively correlated with the likelihood of off-farm employment.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J43|The Impact of CAP Reforms on Farm Labour Structure| The labour force engaged in the agricultural sector is declining over time, and one can observe the reallocation of labour from family members to hired workers. Using farm-level data, this paper analyses the on-farm labour structure in Greece and assesses the factors driving its evolution over the period 1990-2008. The impact of agricultural policies and farm characteristics is examined in a dynamic panel analysis. Family and hired labour are found to be substitutes rather than complements, while agricultural support measures appear to negatively affect demand for both family and hired labour. Decoupled payments and subsidies on crops are found to have a significant impact on both sources of labour, as well as subsidies for rural development that do not favour on-farm labour use. The paper also finds that structural labour adjustments are the result of farm characteristics, such as farm size and location. The results are robust to various estimation techniques and specifications.
J43|The Impact of CAP Payments on the Exodus of Labour from Agriculture in Selected EU Member States|This paper examines the determinants of exit from agriculture under the implementation of CAP payments in four selected EU countries (France, Hungary, Italy and Poland) in the period 2005-08. The study employs micro-data from the European Union Labour Force Survey and regional data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network. We differentiate among the different measures of farm payments, looking at the individual impact of Pillar 1 instruments, i.e. coupled and decoupled payments, and at those in Pillar 2, targeted at rural development. The main results suggest that total subsidies at the regional level are negatively associated with the out-farm migration of agricultural workers in the two New member states, Hungary and Poland, so that the CAP would seem to hinder the exit of labour from agriculture. Conversely, the non-significant results for the ‘old’ member states may be interpreted as the result of opposing effects of coupled payments and rural development support. The diverse impact of CAP on the likelihood of leaving agriculture in the four countries reflects the heterogeneity across European member states, due to different market and production structures, which does not allow a common and simple generalisation of the effect of the CAP on labour allocation.
J43|Sozialökonomische Effekte des demographischen Wandels in ländlichen Räumen Sachsen-Anhalts<BR>[Socio-economic effects of demographic change in rural areas of Saxony-Anhalt]|Diese Untersuchung befasst sich mit der Rolle der Landwirtschaft im Bereich der ländlichen Daseinsversorgung. Zum einen wird untersucht, ob und wenn ja, inwieweit der landwirtschaftliche Sektor von dem demographischen Wandel tangiert wird. Zum anderen wird analysiert, in welchem Rahmen landwirtschaftliche Betriebe Aufgaben der öffentlichen Daseinsvorsorge schon unternehmen bzw. künftig unternehmen können, die die Kommunen aus finanziellen bzw. organisatorischen Gründen nicht mehr in der Lage sind anzubieten. In der Region Altmark wurden im Jahr 2011 Experteninterviews mit 137 politischen, wirtschaftlichen und kulturellen Entscheidungsträgern sowie im Jahr 2012 Interviews mit 134 landwirtschaftlichen Betriebsleitern durchgeführt. Neben diesen Interviews wurden statistische Daten sowie die relevante Sekundärliteratur analysiert. Die wichtigsten Ergebnisse lassen sich wie folgt zusammenfassen. Die politischen, wirtschaftlichen und kulturellen Akteure der Altmark haben erkannt, dass die Bevölkerungsentwicklung ein dominanter Standortfaktor ihrer Region ist. Auch die landwirtschaftlichen Betriebsleiter nehmen die Auswirkungen des demographischen Wandels sowohl in der Region als auch auf den Betrieben, vor allem bei der Rekrutierung qualifizierter Arbeitskräfte, stärker wahr . Die Befragungsergebnisse unterstreichen sehr deutlich, dass landwirtschaftliche Betriebe - häufig sogar ohne Vergütung - einen Beitrag zur öffentlichen Daseinsvorsorge leisten. Die Gründe für diese Übernahme sind nicht betriebswirtschaftlich zu erklären, da die meisten Betriebe hierfür gar nicht, und wenn, dann nur sehr bescheiden vergütet werden. Der Hauptgrund liegt in der emotional-sozialen Verbundenheit zu der heimatlichen Region, also einer engen Bindung der landwirtschaftlichen Betriebe mit dem ländlichen Raum und seinen Bewohnern. Versicherungstechnische Regelungen wirken für manche Betriebsleiter als ein Hemmnis für die Übernahme von Aufgaben der öffentlichen Daseinsvorsorge.
J43|Does Common Agricultural Policy Reduce Farm Labour Migration? A Panel Data Analysis Across EU Regions| This paper deals with the determinants of labour out-migration from agriculture across 153 EU regions over the 1990-2008 period. The central aim is to shed light on the role played by CAP payments on this important adjustment process. Using static and dynamic panel data methods, we show that standard neo-classic drivers, like the relative income and the relative labour share, represented significant determinants of the inter-sectoral migration of the agricultural labour. Overall, CAP payments have contributed significantly to job creation in agriculture, although the magnitude of the economic effect is quite small. Moreover, Pillar I subsidies have exerted an effect from three to five times stronger than Pillar II payments.
J43|Agricultural Labour Market Flexibility in the EU and Candidate Countries: Paper| Well functioning factor markets are a crucial condition for the competitiveness and growth of agriculture. In the case of labour, institutions and regulation may give rise to agricultural labour market heterogeneity which could have important effects on the functioning of the labour market and other agricultural factor markets in EU Member States. At the same time, the functioning of the labour market and markets for other factors of production are influenced by changes in agriculture and the rural economy and in EU policies. This paper first defines the institutional framework for the labour market. Following on from this a brief literature review of previous studies of labour market institutional frameworks is presented. The paper identifies the most important elements of the labour market institutional framework to be further analysed. Based on the literature, a survey to characterise the agricultural labour markets was undertaken. This survey was implemented for a selection of EU27 and EU candidate countries, with responses based upon expert opinion. In turn the survey data was used to construct indices of labour market flexibility/rigidity for the countries examined. These indices were then used to make inter-country labour market comparisons and to draw inferences about the institutions and functioning of the agricultural labour market.

J43|Production Contracts and Farm Business Growth and Survival| Using farm-level panel data from the U.S. Census of Agriculture, this research examines whether hog producers with production contracts increased output more, or were more likely to survive in business over 5 years, compared with independent producers. Additionally, this research examines whether independent producers who adopted a production contract grew more than similar independent operations who did not contract. The local availability of contracts serves as an instrumental variable to address the potential endogeneity of the contracting decision. Results indicate that the use and adoption of production contracts affect farm size growth and survival differently depending on the initial size of an operation.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

J43|Les trajectoires professionnelles des salariés agricoles / Career paths of agricultural workers|L'importance croissante du travail salarié dans les exploitations agricoles françaises nous amène à réfléchir sur le parcours professionnel de ces salariés. Ce travail appliqué vise à caractériser les différents parcours possibles et à apporter quelques clés de lectures pour mieux les appréhender. Nous mobilisons une base de données originale, issue de la Mutualité Sociale Agricole (MSA). La caractérisation des trajectoires professionnelles, effectuée par une méthode d'analyse séquentielle, combinée avec une classification ascendante conduit à distinguer sept trajectoires types. Nous proposons ensuite une première qualification de ces trajectoires types permettant de montrer comment celles-ci suivent des schémas classiques, tout en se singularisant du fait de certaines caractéristiques des emplois offerts par le secteur agricole. _ - The increasing share of employees in French farms raises the interest on the career of these employees. This empirical study aims to characterize the different possible courses and bring some key readings for a better understanding. We use an original database, from the Mutualité Sociale Agricole (MSA). The characterization of career paths, produced by a sequential analysis method, combined with a sequential analysis, leads to distinguish seven kinds of trajectories. Then, we propose a first characterization of such typical trajectories to show how they follow traditional patterns, while singling due to certain characteristics of the jobs offered by the agricultural sector.
J43|Cambios ocupacionales en los contextos rurales de México|El objetivo de este trabajo es realizar una revisión de los principales cambios en la estructura ocupacional y las condiciones laborales de la fuerza de trabajo en las áreas rurales de México. A partir de la información de la Muestra del Censo General de Población y Vivienda del año 2000 y 2010 se analiza la información de 27 grupos de ocupación y nueve regiones geoIlustracions, a la luz del proceso de consolidación de las reformas económicas en el contexto rural mexicano en las últimas décadas. Entre los resultados de mayor interés se confirma la disminución de la población ocupa- da en actividades agropecuarias, la creciente inserción laboral de las mujeres en ocupaciones no agropecuarias, la mayor presencia de varones en ocupaciones agropecuarias no tradicionales, las diferencias de oportunidades laborales entre las regiones Norte y Sur de México, y la contracción de la oferta de empleos tanto agropecuarios como no agropecuarios.
J43|Structural change, collective action, and social unrest in 1930s Spain|The Spanish 2nd Republic (1931-1936) witnessed one of the fastest and deepest processes of popular mobilization in interwar Europe, generating a decisive reactionary wave that brought the country to the Civil War (1936-1939). We show in the paper that both contemporary comment and part of the historiography makes generalizations about the behaviour of the working classes in the period that stress idealistic, re-distributive and even religious motives to join movements of protest. In some other cases, state repression, poverty, and deteriorating living standards have been singled out as the main determinants of participation. This paper uses collective action theory to argue that key institutional changes and structural changes in labour markets were crucial to understand a significant part of the explosive popular mobilization of the period. We argue first that, before the second Republic, temporary migrants had been the main structural limitation against the stabilization of unions and collective bargaining in agricultural labour markets and in several service and industrial sectors. We then show how several industries underwent important structural changes since the late 1910s which stabilized part of the labour force and allowed for union growth and collective bargaining. In agricultural labour markets or in markets in which unskilled temporary workers could not be excluded, unions benefitted from republican legislation restricting temporary migrations and, as a consequence, rural unions saw large gains membership and participation. Historical narratives that focus on state repression or on changes in living standards to explain collective action and social conflict in Spain before the Civil War are incomplete without a consideration of the role of structural changes in labour markets from 1914 to 1931.
J43|Land tenure inequality, harvests, and rural conflict ; evidence from Southern Spain in the 1930s|This paper analyses rural conflict in one of the most volatile areas of interwar Europe, the latifundia regions of the South of Spain. The historical and economics literature argues that rural conflict was a bottom-up, spontaneous response of landless peasants to unemployment, bad harvests, land ownership inequality, changes in property rights, and the lack of enforcement of pro-worker legislation. A second generation of historical studies has focused on democratization and concomitant changes in collective bargaining and labor market institutions. Was conflict caused by structural factors like poverty, inequality or unemployment or was conflict an endogenous response to political change? This paper analyzes the pattern of conflict in in three Andalusian provinces (Córdoba, Jaén and Seville) in the early 1930s to argue that the timing and geographical distribution of conflict is consistent with a wave of mobilization linked to greater political opportunities favored by lower repression, pro-worker institutional change, and labor market intervention. Time-series and cross-sectional variation in levels of rural conflict suggest conflict was not a spontaneous response to dismal living standards and inequality. Rather, it emerged in large, fast growing towns of Andalusia and was mediated by the strategic interaction of authorities and experienced rural unions. The instances of rural conflict analyzed here suggest it is very difficult for new democratic governments in agrarian societies to stave rural conflict off with labor-friendly intervention. It is often argued that conflict precedes political and institutional change, but it is shown here that conflict can emerge abruptly as a response to those changes.
J43|New deal or no deal in the Cotton South: The effect of the AAA on the agricultural labor structure|The Agricultural Adjustment Act has often been held responsible for the rapid reduction of share tenants and sharecroppers (laborers paid shares of the crop) during the 1930s. However, this conclusion has come with limited empirical backing. We shed new light on the consequences of this New Deal policy by empirically testing the role that the AAA cotton reduction program had on the displacement of share tenants and sharecroppers in the Cotton South. The results suggest that the AAA played a significant role in the displacement of black and white sharecroppers and black managing tenants even though it was a violation of AAA contracts for landlords to displace these workers.

J43|The evolution and sustainability of seasonal migration from Poland to Germany: From the dusk of the 19th century to the dawn of the 21st century|We document and suggest a rationale for the durability of seasonal migration from Poland to Germany, a phenomenon persisting for more than a century. We refer to the role of the tradition of engaging in seasonal migration as a force that helped invigorate the process and contribute to its sustainability even when, to different degrees and at different times, the process was interrupted by a shifting political, regulatory, and legal environment. Evidence in support of the role of tradition is provided, among other things, by the continuation of the seasonal flow of migrants from once border regions - which became internal regions following WWII - despite the fact that since the redrawing of the German-Polish border, proximity is no longer a factor encouraging repeated, short-term seasonal moves.
