J53|Dissonant Works Councils and Establishment Survivability|Using subjective information provided by manager respondents on the stance taken by the works council in company decision making, this paper investigates the association between a measure of works council dissonance or disaffection and plant closings in Germany, 2006-2015. The potential effects of worker representation on plant survivability have been little examined in the firm performance literature because of inadequate information on plant closings on the one hand and having to assume homogeneity of what are undoubtedly heterogeneous worker representation agencies on the other. Our use of two datasets serves to identify failed establishments, while the critical issue of heterogeneity is tackled via manager perceptions of works council disaffection or otherwise. The heterogeneity issue is also addressed by considering the wider collective bargaining framework within which works councils are embedded, and also by allowing for works council learning. It is reported that works council dissonance is positively associated with plant closings, although this association is not found for establishments that are covered by sectoral agreements. Taken in conjunction, both findings are consistent with the literature on the mitigation of rent seeking behavior. Less consistent with the recent empirical literature, however, is the association between plant closings and dissonance over time, that is, from the point at which works council dissonance is first observed. Although the coefficient estimate for dissonance is declining with the length of the observation window, it remains stubbornly positive and highly statistically significant. Finally, there is evidence that establishments with dissonant works councils are associated with a much higher probability of transitioning from no collective bargaining to sectoral bargaining coverage over the sample period than their counterparts with more consensual works councils.
J53|Works Councils, Training and Employee Satisfaction|This paper investigates the role of works councils in job satisfaction. Using the recently developed Linked Personnel Panel, we consider both the direct and indirect impact via further training. Basic estimates on an individual level do not reveal clearly direct effects, but on an establishment level, the existence of a works council increases the average job satisfaction in a company. In more extended approaches, we also find a positive, weakly significant link on an individual level accompanied by positive training with regard to job satisfaction if we control for personal characteristics, working conditions, firm size, collegiality variables and industry dummies. Firms with industry-wide bargaining agreements drive this result. The effects are stronger if the firm carries the training costs and if the share of trained workers within the firm measures training. The direct impact of works councils remains positive but becomes insignificant if Lewbel’s instrumental variables estimator is applied.
J53|Employer-Provided Training and Productivity : Evidence from a Panel of Japanese Firms|This study presents evidence on the quantitative relationship between employer-provided training and productivity among Japanese firms. The important contributions of this study are its construction of a panel of training stock at the firm-level, its distinction between manufacturing and service firms, and its comparison of the relative contribution of training to productivity and wages. The results indicate, first, that training significantly contributes to the labor productivity of the firm. Second, the estimated elasticity of productivity with respect to training stock is greater for service firms than for manufacturing firms. Third, the elasticities of productivity and wages to training stock are similar in size, meaning that the returns to firms' training investments are shared by their workers in proportion to the wage share of the value-added. These results suggest that policies to promote firms' training investments have the potential to improve productivity and wages, particularly for firms in service sector.

J53|Bargaining and Conflict with Up-front Investments: How Power Asymmetries Matter|We examine settingsâ€”such as litigation, labor relations, or arming and war -- in which players first make non-contractible up-front investments to improve their bargaining position and gain advantage for possible future conflict. Bargaining is efficient ex post, but we show that a player may prefer Conflict ex ante if there are sufficient asymmetries in strength. There are two sources of this finding. First, up-front investments are more dissimilar between players under Con- flict, and they are lower than under Bargaining when one player is much stronger than the other. Second, the probability of the stronger player winning in Conflict is higher than the share received under Nash bargaining. We thus provide a rationale for conflict to occur under complete information that does not depend on long-term commitment problems. Greater balance in institutional support for different sides is more likely to maintain peace and settlements.
J53|Works Councils and Organizational Gender Policies in Germany|While education and labor force participation of women have been increased, there is still a substantial gender gap in labor market opportunities. This gives rise to the question of what factors lead employers to promote work-family balance and gender equality. We address this question by examining the influence of works councils on the gender policies of establishments in Germany. Using data of the IAB Establishment Panel, we find that the incidence of a works council is associated with an increased likelihood that an establishment provides family-friendly practices and promotes equal opportunities of men and women. This finding also holds in a recursive multivariate probit model that accounts for potential endogeneity of works council incidence.

J53|Personal Attitudes, Job Characteristics and Health|Using a new German individual data set, we investigate the influence on health with respect to personal traits measured by the Big Five, collegiality, commitment and job characteristics. Among the Big Five conscientiousness, agreeableness and emotional stability correlate positively with good health. Job characteristics like activities combined with substantial decision authority, no physically demanding tasks, pleasant environmental conditions, little time pressure and no necessity of multitasking affect health in the same direction. If employees get help if needed from their colleagues and if they do not feel unfairly criticized by others in the firm, they usually have no health problems. For mental health, all Big Five items are influential whereas no statistical significance could be found for the number of days workers were absent due to sickness except in cases of neuroticism.
J53|Employment Rights Implementation and Industrial Relations Systems: The Case of the Outsourcing Policy in Banking Industry|Outsourcing is sensitive subject in Indonesia, not only from manpower or employment point of views but also from the public policy angle. There were some violations happened at banking industry on outsourcing implementation. One example can be given when bank assigned outsourcing workers for core type of job, instead of supporting job as required by regulations. This is an example where outsourcing workers have limited avenue to seek for assistance to defend their rights for any dispute settlement and resolution. At least at the bipartite level when there is violation against their rights as a worker, including violation of employment rights, they have no representative to defend their employment rights. Generally, outsourcing workers have limited access or no union labor neither at outsourcing service provider as their employer or at their service user where they are currently assigned. However, though there are some “unfortunate” situations faced by outsourcing workers, but there are also situation where there are banks provide compensation and/or benefit and/or opportunities better than the law and decree requirements through outsourcing agencies. Furthermore, outsourcing workers who are placed in some banks have opportunities to enrolled in trainings as part of job requirements. Workers are also well prioritized for banks’ permanent role candidate selection. The outsourcing practice in Indonesia banking industry, specifically on how outsourcing workers received their employment rights including other added value benefits, have become the interest of researchers to have further study and analysis on the rationales. The research focusing on 3 different bank categories who are implementing outsourcing arrangements for their routine operations; 2 state-owned banks, 2 private-owned banks, and 2 foreign banks. The research and analysis should be able to complement previous studies on the outsourcing implementation. The purpose of the research is to have deep understanding on the outsourcing implementation in the banking industry, specifically whether banks have fulfilled obligations as required by the regulations, including outsourcing workers’ rights. Research have resulted with: 1) banking industry outsourcing workers’ rights characteristic have already implemented as required by the relevant labor regulations. 2) As outsourcing user, 3 bank categories have fulfilled the completion of compensation and benefit as required by the Manpower Law number 13 Year 2003, including workers’ employment rights; wages, overtime pay, other forms of other welfare aspects, and type of work performed by outsourcing workers. And 3) Regulator or Government that governing the outsourcing implementation require banks to comply and implement regulations and policies as required.

J53|"The ""Good Workplace"": The Role of Joint Consultative Committees, Unions and HR Policies in Employee Ratings of Workplaces in Britain"|Using new, rich data on a representative sample of British workers, we examine the relationship between joint consultation systems at the workplace and employee satisfaction, accounting for possible interactions with union and management-led high-commitment strategies. We focus on non-union employee representation at the workplace, in the form of joint consultative committees (JCCs), and the potential moderating effects of union representation and high-involvement human resource (HIHR) practices. Our findings suggest a re-evaluation of the role that JCCs play in the subjective well-being of workers even after controlling for unions and HIHR policies. There is no evidence in our estimates of negative interaction effects (i.e., that unions or HIHR negatively influence the functioning of JCCs with respect to employee satisfaction) or full mediation (i.e., that unions or HIHR are substitutes for JCCs when it comes to improving self-reported worker well-being). If anything, there is a significant and positive three-way moderating effect when JCCs are interacted with union representation and high-involvement management. This is the first time â€“ to the authors' knowledge â€“ that comprehensive measures of subjective employee well-being have been estimated with respect to the presence of a JCC at the workplace, whilst controlling for workplace institutions that are themselves designed to involve and communicate with workers.
J53|Why Do Firms (Dis)Like Part-Time Contracts?|This paper investigates the full-time/part-time wage gap by using matched employer-employee data on the entire population of workers and firms in Italy over a 32-year period. Relying on regression models that control for worker, firm, and match fixed effects, we find that part-time work attracts a wage premium compared to full-time work. This finding, coupled with the detrimental effect of part-time work on productivity documented by Devicienti et al. (2018), explains why firms are often unwilling to concede part-time positions to employees asking for them.
J53|Firm Wage Premia, Industrial Relations, and Rent Sharing in Germany|This paper investigates the influence of industrial relations on firm wage premia in Germany. OLS regressions for the firm effects from a two-way fixed effects decomposition of workers’ wages by Card, Heining, and Kline (2013) document that average premia are larger in firms bound by collective agreements and in firms with a works council, holding constant firm performance. RIF regressions show that premia are less dispersed among covered firms but more dispersed among firms with a works council. Hence, deunionization is the only among the suspects investigated that contributes to explaining the marked rise in the premia dispersion over time.
J53|Befunde zu Betriebsräten und Betriebsratswahlen: Stellungnahme für den Ausschuss für Arbeit und Soziales des Deutschen Bundestages|Das Betriebsverfassungsgesetz ist eine der tragenden Säulen der Arbeitsmarktordnung in Deutschland, mit dem das Miteinander von Arbeitnehmern und Arbeitgebern und die Ausge-staltung der Arbeitsbedingungen geregelt werden. Betriebliche Mitbestimmung wird hierzulande in der Regel mit der Interessenvertretung der Beschäftigten auf Basis des Betriebsverfassungsgesetzes gleichgesetzt. Die Bildung eines Betriebsrates ist ein gesetzlich abgesichertes Recht für Beschäftigte in Betrieben mit fünf und mehr Arbeitnehmern. Es bedarf folglich keiner Übereinkunft mit dem Arbeitgeber. Dass in den meisten Betrieben oder Unternehmen kein Betriebsrat besteht, ist darauf zurückzuführen, dass die Wahl eines Betriebsrates die Initiative der Beschäftigten voraussetzt. Im Jahr 2016 waren rund sechzig Prozent aller Beschäftigten in Betrieben tätig, in denen es eine Form von Mitarbeitervertretung gibt. Es liegen bisher keine empirischen Erkenntnisse vor, dass von der bisherigen Ausgestaltung des Betriebsverfassungsgesetzes bremsende Effekte auf die Initiative von Beschäftigten ausgehen, einen Betriebsrat zu gründen.
J53|Designing wearables for use in the workplace: The role of solution developers|Wearables (such as data glasses and smartwatches) are a particularly visible element of Industrie 4.0 applications. They aim at providing situation-specific information to workers, but at the same time they can also be used for surveillance and control because they generate data on the work process and sometimes even on movement patterns and vital data of the employees. Wearables technology is at an early stage of development, in which the interests and perspectives of relevant stakeholders, especially technology developers and the management, are of particular importance. This article explores the role of solution developers and their understanding of work processes in which wearables are to be used. It is based on expert interviews with solution developers, academic and company experts. The analysis shows an ambivalent understanding of work: On the one hand, it is characterized by the perception of workers as potential sources of error. It focuses on the optimization of individual workplaces and their ergonomics, while broader questions of work design and work organization are ignored. On the other hand, the technology developers see and discuss the potentials and dangers of wearables technologies with regard to individualization, data protection and control in a differentiated manner.
J53|Co-determination: A driving force for corporate social responsibility in German companies?|"This discussion paper examines the relationship between co-determination and corporate social responsibility (CSR) in German companies, thereby addressing two distinct literatures. On the one hand, most quantitative studies of co-determination focus on its economic impact, with relatively little attention paid to other kinds of outcomes. On the other hand, few studies on CSR have looked at the role of worker representatives. Using a new measure of co-determination strength, the Mitbestimmungsindex (MB-ix), it is demonstrated that co-determination strength is positively related to the presence of ""substantive"" CSR policies, such as the adoption of targets for reducing pollution, but is unrelated to ""symbolic"" CSR policies, such as membership in UN Global Compact. The paper therefore sheds new light on the role of co-determination and provides a more differentiated view of the spread of what has been termed ""explicit"" CSR in Germany, one of the most prominent of the ""coordinated market economies""."
J53|Voluntary Quits: Do Works Councils Matter? An Analysis of the Reform of the German Works Constitution Act 2001|Most of the literature on the effects of German works councils does not deal with the issue of potential endogeneity of works council existence. Exploiting exogenous variation in works council authority stemming from a 2001 reform of the German Works Constitution Act, I apply a regression difference-in-difference using establishment panel data. I find that increasing works council size and the introduction of one full-time councilor causally reduces the number of voluntary quits by about 30 %. This decline is driven entirely by collective voice effects and there is no evidence for monopoly effects in place. Similar to the findings of previous research, the effect is significant only in establishments which are subject to a collective agreement. The results suggest that the effectiveness of works councils either heavily relies on the support of unions, or that works councils mainly serve as a guardian of collective agreements.

J53|Strikes, employee workplace representation, unionism, and industrial relations quality in European establishments|This paper investigates the relationship between different types of workplace representation and strikes using the 2009 European Company Survey. It also examines the role of the workplace climate, union organization, and collective bargaining. Our principal finding is that works councils are associated with reduced strike activity. But this result is sensitive to the union status of work councilors: where union members make up a majority of works councilors any beneficial effect of the entity on strike incidence is no longer evident in the data. Not only do union-dominated works councils experience greater strike activity than their counterparts with minority union membership, but also more strikes than establishments with union workplace representation where union members are in a minority. Dissonance between the parties, as indexed by degree of divergence between the opinions of employer and employee representative survey respondents as to the state of industrial relations at the workplace, is associated with elevated strike activity. If our measure of dissonance is exogenous, this result suggests that industrial relations quality may be key to strike reduction independent of workplace representation. Finally, there is some indication that union density at the workplace is directly associated with strike incidence, as well as evidence that strikes are more likely when collective bargaining occurs at higher than company level.
J53|The Shortfall in Formal Employee Participation at the European Workplace|Cross-country data are used to establish perceived shortfalls in employee involvement based on the responses of employee representatives in EU establishments with formal workplace employee representation. The desire for greater involvement is smaller where workplace representation is via works councils than union bodies, a finding that also obtains across country clusters. However, the favorable influence of the works council institution, if not information provision, does not carry over to situations in which management is adjudged uncooperative and untrustworthy. Whether the views of these respondents are representative of the workforce and hypothetically of a workforce currently without representation is also considered.
J53|Employment Protection Legislation, Labor Courts, and Effective Firing Costs|Labor courts may influence firing costs. Apart from the procedural costs, there is the likelihood that labor courts declare firings as unfair or nil, which significantly increase severance payments over those established for fair dismissals by Employment Protection Legislation. In this paper we model the determinants of the wedge between mandated and effective firing costs arising from labor courts resolution of dismissals, and show how it is affected by EPL reforms, looking at recent EPL reforms in Spain (implemented in 2010 and 2012) that significantly widened the definition of fair economic dismissals.
J53|What drives the four decades-long decline in labour’s share of income?|Alexander Guschanski and Ozlem Onaran (2018) of the University of Greenwich Political Economy Research Centre provide evidence that changes in bargaining power, in particular the fall in union density and welfare state retrenchment, lie at the core of rising income inequality between labour and capital. The research challenges the established consensus that inequality is an unavoidable outcome of technological change or globalisation, and shows the importance of labour market institutions and social protection policies. The results of their recent project, funded by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, will be presented at the Royal Economics Society Annual Conference.
J53|What Do Workers Want? The Shortfall in Employee Participation at the European Workplace|A shortfall in employee voice attendant upon union decline has long been forewarned. Data from the third European Company Survey is used to establish perceived shortfalls in employee involvement based on the responses of employee representatives in establishments where formal workplace employee representation is practiced. Among the main findings is that the desire for greater involvement in decision making is smaller where representation is via a works council-type apparatus rather than through the agency of a union body. Similar, albeit more pronounced marginal effects are associated with information provision, most notably where employee representatives are (a) 'satisfactorily' informed on a variety of establishment issues or (b) are asked to give their opinions/involved in joint decisions in the event of some major human resource decision. The latter results are robust to subsets of the data based on variations in trust between the parties and the perceived quality of the industrial relations climate, where there is an overwhelming desire for more participation in those circumstances in which management is adjudged uncooperative and untrustworthy. On net, it remains the case that a shortfall in employee participation is observed across all types of establishments in the sample and, by extension, it would appear to those without any workplace representation at all.
J53|The One Constant: A Causal Effect of Collective Bargaining on Employment Growth?|A large number of articles have analysed 'the one constant' in the economic effects of trade unions, namely that collective bargaining reduces employment growth by two to four percentage points per year. Evidence is, however, mostly related to Anglo-Saxon countries. We investigate whether a different institutional setting might lead to a different outcome, making the constant a variable entity. Using linked-employer-employee data for Germany, we find a negative correlation between being covered by a sector-wide bargaining agreement or firm-level contract and employment growth of about one percentage point per annum. However, the correlation between employment growth and collective bargaining is not robust to the use of panel methods. We conclude that the results of the literature using cross-section data might be driven by selection.
J53|Performance Pay and Enterprise Productivity: The Details Matter|Much of the empirical literature on PRP (Performance Related Pay) focuses on a question of whether the firm can increase firm performance in general and enterprise productivity in particular by introducing PRP and if so, how much. However, not all PRP programs are created equal and PRP programs vary significantly in a variety of attributes. This paper provides novel and rigorous evidence on the productivity effect of varying attributes of PRP and shows that the details of PRP indeed matter. In so doing we exploit the panel nature of our Finnish Linked Employer-Employee Data on the details of PRP. We first establish that the omitted variable bias is serious, makes the cross-sectional estimates on the productivity effect of the details of PRP biased upward substantially. Relying on the fixed effect estimates that account for such bias, we find: (i) group incentive PRP is more potent in boosting enterprise productivity than individual incentive PRP; (ii) group incentive PRP with profitability as a performance measure is especially powerful in raising firm productivity; (iii) when a narrow measure (such as cost reduction) is already used, adding another narrow measure (such as quality improvement) yields no additional productivity gain; and (iv) PRP with greater Power of Incentive (the share of PRP in total compensation) results in greater productivity gains yet returns to Power of Incentive diminishes very slowly.
J53|Do German Works Councils Counter or Foster the Implementation of Digital Technologies?|As works councils' information, consultation and co-determination rights affect the decision process of the management, works councils play a key role in the implementation of digital technologies in establishments. However, previous research focuses on the potential of digital technologies to sub-stitute for labor and its impact on labor market outcomes of workers. This paper adds the role of industrial relations to existing literature by analyzing the impact of works councils on the implementation of digital technologies. Theoretically, the role of works councils in the digital transformation is ambiguous. Using establishment data from the IAB Establishment Survey of 2016 combined with individual employee data from the Federal Employment Agency and occupational level data about the physical job exposure, empirical evidence indicates an ambivalent position of works councils to-wards digital technologies. The sole existence of works councils leads to statistically significant lower equipment levels with digital technologies. However, works councils foster the equipment with digital technologies in those establishments, which employ a high share of workers who are conducting physical demanding job activities. Thus, this study highlights the importance of establishment-level workforce representation for the digital adoption process within Germany.
J53|The ''Good Workplace'': The Role of Joint Consultative Committees, Unions and HR policies in Employee Ratings of Workplaces in Britain|Using new, rich data on a representative sample of British workers, we examine the relationship between joint consultation systems at the workplace and employee satisfaction, accounting for possible interactions with union and management-led high-commitment strategies. We focus on non-union employee representation at the workplace, in the form of joint consultative committees (JCCs), and the potential moderating effects of union representation and high-involvement human resource (HIHR) practices. Our findings suggest a re-evaluation of the role that JCCs play in the subjective well-being of workers even after controlling for unions and HIHR policies. There is no evidence in our estimates of negative interaction effects (i.e., that unions or HIHR negatively influence the functioning of JCCs with respect to employee satisfaction) or full mediation (i.e., that unions or HIHR are substitutes for JCCs when it comes to improving self-reported worker well-being). If anything, there is a significant and positive three-way moderating effect when JCCs are interacted with union representation and high-involvement management. This is the first time -- to the authors' knowledge -- that comprehensive measures of subjective employee well-being have been estimated with respect to the presence of a JCC at the workplace, whilst controlling for workplace institutions that are themselves designed to involve and communicate with workers.
J53|Works Councils, Training and Employee Satisfaction|This paper investigates the role of works councils in job satisfaction. Using the recently developed Linked Personnel Panel, we consider both the direct and indirect impact via further training. Basic estimates on an individual level do not reveal clearly direct effects, but on an establishment level, the existence of a works council increases the average job satisfaction in a company. In more extended approaches, we also find a positive, weakly significant link on an individual level accompanied by positive training with regard to job satisfaction if we control for personal characteristics, working conditions, firm size, collegiality variables and industry dummies. Firms with industry-wide bargaining agreements drive this result. The effects are stronger if the firm carries the training costs and if the share of trained workers within the firm measures training. The direct impact of works councils remains positive but becomes insignificant if Lewbel's instrumental variables estimator is applied.
J53|Adoption of High Performance Work Organization, trade unions and employment redundancy in India|Following Osterman’s research framework of High Performance Work Organizations (HPWOs), the author, using his data sets from the three surveys conducted in India in 2001 and in 2011-2012, examined the adoption and diffusion of HPWOs in India and the factors behind them. It was found that HPWOs spread in India between 2000 and 2011, showing the regional variations in the diffusion and the contributing factors behind the adoption. The opposition of the trade unions against the HPWOs would become less significant once a single HPWO practice was introduced in the workplace. While the HPWOs did not show any significant association, the analysis suggests that trade unions affect managerial decisions to a greater degree than India’s restrictive labor law against employment downsizing.
J53|Ajustements de l'emploi et des salaires : quels compromis en temps de crise ? Une analyse quantitative et qualitative à partir de l'enquête REPONSE 2010-2011|Since 2008 in France, the establishments implemented wage, employment and working time adjustments to deal with the effects of the economic crisis. This paper aims at understanding the way social actors have negociated wage and employment adjustments. Did personal representatives influence managerial decisions in terms of adjustment ? Were they involved in concessions bargaining by relying on cross referencing of the REPONSE 2010-2011 survey (provided by French Ministry of Labour) on French industrial relations between 2008 and 2010 and of case studies conducted in French establishments between 2012 and 2014. Our analysis allows underlying different kinds of concession bargaining which depend on the nature of industrial relations and of the impact of economic downturn on companies' activity. We also show that concessions may have some more or less durable effects on the employment relation. Finally, our analysis sheds light on the implications of recent reforms in collective bargaining in France, which may facilitate unbalanced concession bargaining in favour of employer
J53|Theory and Evidence on Employer Collusion in the Franchise Sector|"In this paper we study the role of covenants in franchise contracts that restrict the recruitment and hiring of employees from other units within the same franchise chain in suppressing and hiring of employees from other units within the same franchise chain in suppressing find that ""no-poaching of workers agreements"" are included in a surprising 58 percent of major franchisors' contracts, including McDonald's, Burger King, Jiffy Lube and H&R Block. Theoretical models of oligopsony and dynamic monopsony, as well as incentives for investment in job training, are discussed in the context of these no-poaching agreements. Although the occurrence of no-poaching agreements is difficult to predict from franchise or industry characteristics, no-poaching agreements are more common for franchises in low-wage and high-turnover industries."
J53|Supply-side labour market reforms: a neglected cause of the productivity crisis|In spite of impressive stories about a Second Machine Age or Industry 4.0, growth rates of labor productivity in the US, Japan and Western Europe declined, during the last 10-15 years, to their lowest levels since World War II. Recent contributions on the productivity slowdown by mainstream economists produced an impressive amount of statistical data that certainly add to our understanding, but they fail addressing the negative impact of supply-side labor market reforms on innovation and productivity. I present theoretical arguments of how labor market deregulation can negatively influence innovation and productivity growth and I review empirical evidence.
J53|Recent developments of Italy’s industrial relations system|The article reviews the recent developments of Italy’s industrial relations system, covering both bargaining rules and outcomes. An increasing fragmentation is observable in collective bargaining at the national level, with the spread of new agreements amongst small and recently created associations of workers and employers, leading to lower labor costs. The role of decentralized bargaining has remained secondary and subordinate to the provisions decided at the national level, although several - gradually more generous tax breaks have been introduced in order to encourage the diffusion of firm-level wages. Giving decentralized bargaining a greater role in setting wages and in labour organization would allow for a better alignment of wage growth and increases in productivity, relaxing some of the rigidity in national bargaining, especially in terms of the duration of agreements and of the automatic indexing mechanisms, which risk making inflation more persistent.
J53|The Role of Works Councils for Severance Payments|Using representative German employee data, we analyse the role of works councils for the incidence of severance payments subsequent to dismissals. While there is a positive relation with severance payments after those dismissals which stem from plant closings, the incidence of a works council is negatively associated with severance pay subsequent to individual layoffs. In both cases, we find a negative moderating effect of individuals' higher reemployment chances. We also explore gender differences and differences between the types of previously held jobs.

J53|Strikes, Employee Workplace Representation, Unionism, and Trust: Evidence from Cross-Country Data|This paper investigates the determinants of industrial conflict in companies, using a multi-country workplace inquiry for 2009 and 2013 and various measures of strike activity. The principal goal is to address the effect of formal workplace representation on strikes, distinguishing in the first instance between works councils on the one hand and broadly equivalent trade union based entities on the other. The role of unionism is also central to this inquiry, not only with respect to the degree to which workplace representation is union dominated but also and more familiarly perhaps through workplace union density and the level at which collective bargaining is conducted. Attention is also paid to the quality of industrial relations, as reflected in dissonance, namely divergent assessments of managers and employee workplace representatives as to the state of industrial relations. Although country effects do matter, it is reported that works councils are associated with reduced strike activity. However, any such effect is sensitive in particular to the union status of work councilors and time. There is also some indication that collective bargaining at levels higher than the company can exacerbate strike activity but this effect does not persist, possibly because of decentralization and the development of hybrid bargaining structures. For its part, good industrial relations appears key to strike reduction, independent of workplace representation.
J53|Ceding control: an experimental analysis of participatory management|Abstract We use an experiment to evaluate the effects of participatory management on firm performance. Participants are randomly assigned roles as managers or workers in firms that generate output via real effort. To identify the causal effect of participation on effort, workers are exogenously assigned to one of the two treatments: one in which the manager implements a compensation scheme unilaterally or another in which the manager cedes control over compensation to the workers who vote to implement a scheme. We find that output is between seven and twelve percentage points higher in participatory firms.
J53|Benefit Generosity and Injury Duration: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from Regression Kinks|In this paper, we investigate the effect of benefit generosity on claim duration and temporary benefits paid among temporary disability claims for workers' compensation. While previous studies have focused on natural experiments created by one-time large changes in minimum or maximum weekly benefits, we exploit variation around a kink in benefit generosity inherent in all workers' compensation systems in the United States. Using administrative data on the universe of injured workers in Oregon, we also find that more-generous benefits leads to longer injuries, but with implied elasticities that are smaller than the average elasticity from previous difference-in-difference studies. Our preferred estimates suggest that a 10-percent increase in benefit generosity leads to a 2- to 4-percent increase in injury duration. We derive similar duration-benefit elasticities when studying changes in benefits paid at the kink. We also introduce the first evidence that more-generous benefits encourage subsequent claim filing.
J53|The Role of Works Councils for Severance Payments|Using representative German employee data, we analyse the role of works councils for the incidence of severance payments subsequent to dismissals. While there is a positive relation with severance payments after those dismissals which stem from plant closings, the incidence of a works council is negatively associated with severance pay subsequent to individual layoffs. In both cases, we find a negative moderating effect of individuals’ higher re-employment chances. We also explore gender differences and differences between the types of previously held jobs.
J53|Workplace Employee Representation and Industrial Relations Performance: New Evidence from the 2013 European Company Survey|Using cross-country data from the European Company Survey, we investigate the relationship between workplace employee representation and management perceptions of the climate of industrial relations, sickness/absenteeism, employee motivation, and staff retention. For a considerably reduced subset of the data, a fifth indicator – strike activity – is also considered alongside the other behavioral outcomes. From one perspective, the expression of collective voice through works council-type entities may be construed as largely beneficial, especially when compared with their counterpart union agencies either operating alone or in a dominant position. However, if heightened distributional struggles explain these differential outcomes in workplace employee representation, it should not go unremarked that the influence of formal collective bargaining is seemingly positive.
J53|Do Good Working Conditions Make You Work Longer? Evidence on Retirement Decisions Using Linked Survey and Register Data|We analyze the potential role of adverse working conditions and management practices in the determination of employees' retirement behavior. Our data contain both comprehensive information regarding perceived job disamenities, job satisfaction, and intentions to retire from nationally representative cross-sectional surveys and information on employees' actual retirement decisions from longitudinal register data that can be linked to the surveys. Using a trivariate ordered probit model, we observe that job dissatisfaction arising from adverse working conditions is significantly related to intentions to retire, and this in turn is related to actual retirement during the follow-up period.
J53|The German Model of Industrial Relations: (Where) Does It Still Exist?|Using data from the representative IAB Establishment Panel, this paper charts changes in the two main pillars of the German IR model over the last 20 years. It shows that collective bargaining coverage and worker representation via works councils have substantially fallen outside the public sector. Less formalized and weaker institutions such as voluntary orientation of uncovered firms towards sectoral agreements and alternative forms of employee representation at the work-place have partly attenuated the overall erosion in coverage. Multivariate analyses indicate that the traditional German IR model (with both collective agreements and works councils) is more likely found in larger and older plants, and it is less likely in plants managed by the owner, in single and foreign-owned plants, in individually-owned firms or partnerships, and in exporting plants. In contrast, more than 60 % of German plants did not exhibit bargaining coverage or orientation or any kind of worker representation in 2015. Such an absence of the main institutional features of the German IR model is mainly found in small and medium-sized plants, in particular in the service sector and in eastern Germany, and its extent is increasing dramatically.
J53|The Twin Track Model of Employee Voice: An Anglo-American Perspective on Union Decline and the Rise of Alternative Forms of Voice|We present a simple framework for analyzing decline in union voice in the Anglo-American world and its replacement by non-union, often direct, forms of worker voice. We argue that it is a decline in the in-flow to unionisation among employers and workers, rather than an increase in the outflow rate, that accounts for this decline. We show how union decline is predicted by experience good and cost-disease models of trade unionism and is linked to specific institutional and policy constraints on union organizing in the Anglo-American world. We show how the co-existence of union and non-union forms of worker voice is predicted by transaction cost economics, while the growth in non-union forms of worker voice is aided by declining costs of employers ''making'' voice mechanisms. We draw on ''spurt'' theories of unionisation to help understand factors underpinning union decline, including falling costs of employer opposition to unionisation as density falls, as discuss possibilities for ''bottom-up'' growth in union-like forms of worker voice implied by ''spurt'' theories.
J53|Jevons’s Ideal Role for Labor Unions as a Form of Co-operation|This research examines the ideas about labor unions found in William Stanley Jevons's works. I focus on the collaborative role Jevons envisioned for these organizations as part of a broader cooperative vision between workers and capitalists. Even though Jevons was not a supporter of labor unions and regarded them as monopolies with limited power to increase wages, on the one hand, and with great potential for generating dead losses of wages due strikes, on the other, he did not consider indispensable their elimination as long as they were guided to co-operate with business. This study concludes that there is more than one form of co-operation in Jevons’s thought. One explicit, from capitalist to workers, via profit sharing, and a second one, implicit, through the collaboration of workers to capitalists via their participation in labor organizations different than traditional labor unions. A major implication of this scheme is that both forms of co-operation have to be present for it to be beneficial for both classes. The latter, however, would not ensure that they are equally beneficiated.
J53|Inequality as Lack of Co-operation in Economic Thought|This study is about the notion of co-operation by economic thinkers of the 19th century in the United Kingdom. It presents a comparison and contrast of their ideas as well as an analysis of the relationship between co-operation and economic and social inequality. Two approaches of such relationship are identified. First, an economic-centered view, found in Charles Babbage and William Stanley Jevons, where the benefits of co-operation are linked to profit sharing, the increase of productivity and the expansion of the economic system. Second, Robert Owen’s and John Stuart Mill’s ideas on co-operation, even though with different implications, are mainly socially-oriented. Here, it is possible to see a broader social concern that led them to suggest reforms that could have implications in terms of social (e.g., education and gender), and not only economic inequality. Marx’s analysis of co-operation does not belong to any of these approaches. In his view, under capitalism, the effect of some forms of co-operation may generate or reinforce inequality.
J53|Labour market and collective bargaining in Iceland: sharing the spoils without spoiling the shares|Iceland has high living standards, low poverty, high inclusiveness and one of the most sustainable pension systems. It is the most highly unionised country in the OECD and, in the past, successful social pacts have protected the lowest paid workers during crises, and on occasion helped fight inflation. Nevertheless, Iceland experiences recurrent bursts of social tensions and labour unrest that often result in large wage awards, particularly in times of economic boom. Iceland is prone to accentuated economic cycles, and the pro-cyclical nature of collective bargaining aggravates these harmful dynamics. Social partners often have disagreements over what has been agreed in the past and they can have differing views on the state of the economy. Trust among the social partners has been undermined and wage co-ordination is low. There is a large number of unions, many of them very small, and wage demands are often not consistent with macroeconomic stability. Labour unrest frequently originates in the public sector as wages lag behind the private sector. Fostering trust and increasing wage co-ordination would make collective bargaining more effective and help sustain the benefits of the system for future generations. A technical committee should be established to provide reliable and impartial information to wage negotiators. Wage negotiations could start with “wage guidelines” issued by the major labour and employer confederations. State mediator should have greater powers in order to improve wage co-ordination and support the “wage guidelines”. This working paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of Iceland (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-iceland.htm).
J53|Generation Y on the labour market - expectations for shaping the work-life balance|Entering of the generation Y on job market causes many interesting insights for both researchers, who analyze the specifics of this generation, as well as practitioners of modern organizations' management. Despite some differences in the characteristics of generation Y authors involved in this issue agree that generation Y is focused on education and development with simultaneous desire to maintain a balance between work and personal life. More often than older generations, they are willing to use the various programs, offered by company, supporting reconciliation of professional and personal life. The aim of the article is to present issues concerning the functioning of the representatives of generation Y in the labor market with particular emphasis on the issue of balancing professional work and personal life. The conducted research aimed to analyze the opinion of representatives of generation Y about the expectations associated with their professional work with special emphasis on creating a balance between work and personal life. In order to obtain answers to the research's questions method of diagnostic survey and questionnaire technique were used. To complement the obtained data, the additional qualitative research unstructured interviews were conducted. Respondents confirmed the hypothesis that for their generation balance between work and personal life is very important. The collected respondents' opinions showed the image of flexible employment, as a good way to reconcile work and other obligations, which gives the ability to have multiple sources of income and that is a good solution especially for young people and people entering the labor market. The results of the conducted interviews pointed to a number of factors, that in opinion of young workers are important values in life and are related to the maintaining work-life balance.

J53|Employee representation in japanese family and non-family SMEs|This paper analyzes differences in the effects of employee representations between family firms and non-family firms. First, managers from non-family firms have a more favorable response towards unions as organizations than managers from family firms. Managers from family firms tend to regard unions as harmful to their management, because unions may bring in outsiders, to the detriment of the management. Second, voice-oriented employee associations tend to exist more in non-family firms than in family ones. Third, these associations have a voice effect suppressing turnover rates in non-family firms, though not in family ones.

J53|Berufs- und Spartengewerkschaften. Neue Akteure und Perspektiven der Tarifpolitik|Seit den fruehen 2000er Jahren beobachten wir einen zunehmenden Einfluss von Berufs- und Spartengewerkschaften. Diese Verbaende sind prominente Beispiele fuer die neue Unuebersichtlichkeit der Arbeitsbeziehungen. Der Band behandelt in sozialwissenschaftlicher Perspektive die in Wissenschaft und oeffentlichkeit kontrovers diskutierten Fragen der wesentlichen Folgen: Veraendert der Wandel von Berufsverbaenden zu Berufsgewerkschaften und ihre damit verbundene Zielverschiebung nachhaltig die etablierten Strukturen der Interessenvertretung? Fuehrt ihre Tarifpolitik zu einem hoeheren Streikniveau in der traditionell arbeitskampfarmen Bundesrepublik? Nimmt ihr Einfluss auf die Funktions-, insbesondere die Stabilitaetsbedingungen der Arbeitsbeziehungen, vor allem die Tarifpolitik, nicht nur kurz-, sondern auch langfristig zu? Werden weitere Berufsgewerkschaften entstehen? Welche Konsequenzen hat die nunmehr gegebene Gewerkschaftskonkurrenz fuer die etablierten Gewerkschaften?
J53|Globalisierung und betriebliche Mitbestimmung|Der vorliegende Beitrag diskutiert verschiedene Szenarien zum Einfluss von Auslandsdirektinvestitionen auf die betriebliche Mitbestimmung in Deutschland. Vorliegende Studien sprechen dafür, dass die Funktionsfähigkeit betrieblicher Mitbestimmung in Betrieben mit ausländischen Eigentümern beeinträchtigt ist. Ein positiver Zusammenhang zwischen dem Vorhandensein eines Betriebsrats und der betrieblichen Produktivität sowie der Nutzung personalpolitischer Maßnahmen zur Steigerung der betrieblichen Leistungsfähigkeit lässt sich nur in Betrieben mit inländischen, nicht aber in Betrieben mit ausländischen Eigentümern nachweisen. Darüber hinaus sind kooperative Beziehungen zwischen Betriebsrat und Management in Betrieben mit ausländischen Eigentümern weniger wahrscheinlich als in Betrieben mit inländischen Eigentümern. Trotz der eingeschränkten Funktionsfähigkeit haben die Beschäftigten in Betrieben, die sich in ausländischem Eigentum befinden, ein erhöhtes Interesse an betrieblicher Mitbestimmung. Dies dürfte mit einer erhöhten Beschäftigungsunsicherheit und einem verstärkten Druck zur kurzfristigen Gewinnerzielung zusammenhängen.
J53|"From the ""planning euphoria"" to the ""bitter economic truth"": The transmission of economic ideas into German labour market policies in the 1960s and 2000s"|This paper compares the interconnections between dominant economic thought and processes of policy-making in the area of labour market reforms in Germany in the late 1960s and the early 2000s. The transition in labour market policies in this period could be described as a change from an active to an activating approach. At the level of economic discourse these policy changes correspond to a paradigm shift from Keynesian to neoclassical/neoliberal economic thought. We investigated these changes by focussing on two distinct reforms of labour market policies and carried out a critical discourse analysis of the relevant public and academic discourse of economists. We find that the paradigm shift in economic thought was accompanied by a shift in economists' discourses on labour market policy issues.
J53|Changes in Bargaining Status and Intra-Plant Wage Dispersion in Germany. Much Ado about Nothing?|A number of studies have reported that union decline is associated with rising overall wage inequality, not least in Germany where the phenomenon has been linked to economic resurgence. The present paper takes an unconventional approach to this potential source of rising inequality by examining intra-plant wage dispersion in the wake of establishments exiting from or entering into collective bargaining. Our estimation strategy hinges upon the identification of comparable groups of establishments and on both short-run and medium- to long-term changes in the wage structure. Using two main empirical strategies, we report at most a modest widening effect on dispersion for plants abandoning collective agreements. The converse does not apply for those establishments joining collective agreements. These two effects cast doubt on some of the more exaggerated claims as to the importance of deunionization to wage inequality.
J53|German Model or German Models? The spatial distribution of capital and labour in the corporate governance of stock listed companies|In the varieties of capitalism literature, Germany is understood as a monolithic model of a coordinated market economy. This analysis shows how institutions for configuring capital and labour at the national level are implemented at state and regional level. By focussing on the labour side this article gives a contribution to the investor dominated shareholder value discussion. It identifies a spatial distinction between capital and labour and concludes a variation of German Models instead of one German Model.
J53|Globale Rahmenvereinbarungen in der europäischen Automobilzulieferindustrie|"Die Entwicklung von Arbeits- und Beschäftigungsbedingungen in der Automobilzulieferbranche wird in erheblichem Maße vom Standortwettbewerb zwischen Hochlohn- und Niedriglohnstand-orten geprägt. Die deutschen Standorte stehen dabei insbesondere im Wettbewerbe mit Werken in Mittelosteuropa. Auf Basis von Fallstudien von sechs deutschen Automobilzulieferern und einer Befragung betrieblicher Arbeitnehmervertreter erörtert dieses Discussion Paper die Mög-lichkeiten und Strategien von Gewerkschaften und betrieblichen Arbeitnehmervertretern, mit-hilfe von Globalen Rahmenvereinbarungen (GRV) Mindeststandards im Bereich von Arbeits- und Beschäftigungsbedingungen zu schaffen. Dabei werden drei Fragen verfolgt: Welche Ziele und Motive verbinden die Akteure mit dem Abschluss einer GRV? Welche Auswirkungen können im europäischen Raum beobachtet werden? Und welche Faktoren beeinflussen diese Auswirkungen? Die hier diskutierten Daten und Befunde stammen aus dem von der Hans-Böckler-Stiftung geför-derten Forschungsprojekt ""Standortperspektiven in der Automobilzulieferindustrie"", das von Martin Krzywdzinski (WZB) und Axel Schröder (WZB) gemeinsam mit Martin Schwarz-Kocher und Heinz Pfäfflin (IMU Institut) sowie Inger Korflür und Ralf Löckener (Sustain Consult) durchgeführt wurde. In die vorliegende Ausarbeitung sind viele Anregungen aus gemeinsamen Diskussionen im Projektteam eingeflossen, für die wir allen Kolleginnen und Kollegen herzlich danken."
J53|Productivity and distribution effects of codetermination in an efficient bargaining|Codetermination can be regarded as an extreme regulatory intervention of the legislator in the labor market which might affect the efficiency of production and the bargaining power of labor. Based on a model that covers both efficient bargaining and employment bargaining a simple equation is derived that is suited to empirical testing. The empirical test is based on German data and includes years before and after the extension of German codetermination law in 1976. The estimates determine the productivity of labor and relative bargaining power of capital and labor. It turns out that codetermination does not affect productivity, but leads to a significant increase in workers' bargaining power and the distribution of rents.
J53|Syndicalisme Québécois Face à l'Enjeu des Partenariats Public-Prive : Le Cas de la Sous-traitance<BR>[Unionism Quebecers Facing the Public-Private Partnerships: The Case of Outsourcing]|Recent developments in labor relations in Quebec inclined several controversies. The public sector has undergone major changes and has had to adapt and reposition. Like the private sector, subcontracting is normalized with the progress of the neoliberal discourse in public space. This article compares the existing literature between public-private partnerships and outsourcing, trying to prove potential links. A theoretical design is appropriate to support the thesis of reconfiguration of labor markets. The article shows that outsourcing in the public sector is simply a pledge of confusion and inconsistency. Far from achieving its objectives, it has served a factor of tension and conflict between the Quebec government and the unions.
J53|Explaining Cross-National Variation in Workplace Employee Representation|Across Europe, there are many differing opinions on whether workplace employee representation should be encouraged or discouraged. Yet there is very little evidence on the variations in workplace employee representation across Europe or the reasons for this. We use a workplace survey covering 27 EU countries to show that its incidence is strongly and independently correlated with the degree of centralization in a country's industrial relations regime and the extent of legislative support. Industry rents are also important in explaining trade union presence, but are unimportant in the case of works councils. Turning to the effects of workplace employee representation, we find support for the exit-voice model – traditionally associated with Anglo-Saxon regimes – whereby worker representation is associated with poorer perceptions of the employment relations climate and with lower voluntary quit rates.
J53|Von Konflikt ohne Partnerschaft zu Partnerschaft ohne Konflikt: Industrielle Beziehungen in Deutschland (From conflict without partnership to partnership without conflict: Industrial relations in Germany)|Der Aufsatz betrachtet das Lebenswerk von Walther Mueller-Jentsch als wichtigsten deutschen Forscher der letzten Jahrzehnte ueber kollektive Arbeitsbeziehungen und das „deutsche Modell“ der Sozialpartnerschaft. Im Mittelpunkt steht das von Mueller-Jentsch entwickelte Konzept der „Konfliktpartnerschaft“ als Beschreibung des derzeitigen Stands der industriellen Beziehungen in Deutschland vor dem Hintergrund ihrer Geschichte seit Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts. (The essay considers the lifetime achievement of Walther Mueller-Jentsch as a scholar and leading figure of the discipline of industrial relations in Germany during the last decades. The essay focuses on Mueller-Jentsch’s concept of Konfliktpartnerschaft (conflictual partnership), conceived to characterise the current state of industrial relations under the “German model”, against the background of their history since the beginning of the twentieth century.)
J53|Die neue Konfliktformation. Klassen-Kaempfe in fragmentierten Arbeitsbeziehungen (The new conflict formation: Class conflicts in the age of fragmented labour relations)|Der Beitrag setzt sich mit Walther Mueller-Jentschs Soziologie industrieller Beziehungen auseinander. Er argumentiert, dass die Transformation des einstigen Sozialkapitalismus zwei Welten sozialer Regulation hervorgebracht hat, deren ‘Grenzregime’ zunehmend umkaempft ist. Es handelt sich, so die These, um Klassen- Auseinandersetzungen in fragmentierten Arbeitsbeziehungen. Bewegungen, die von der einen in die andere Regulationswelt fuehren, lassen sich, wie auch Wolfgang Streeck feststellt, mit dem Konzept der Konfliktpartnerschaft nicht mehr angemessen verstehen. Deshalb gehoert auf den Pruefstand, was in der Soziologie industrieller Beziehungen lange als gesichertes Wissen galt. (The paper discusses Walther Mueller-Jentsch’s sociology of industrial relations. He contends that the transformation of erstwhile social capitalism has produced two distinct worlds of regulation, the ‘border regime’ of which is increasingly contested. It argues that what we are witnessing are class conflicts in the context of fragmented labour relations. As Wolfgang Streeck also notes, the movements that stretch from one world of regulation to the other can no longer be adequately grasped by the concept of ‘conflict partnership’. We must therefore reconsider some of the ideas that have long been taken for granted in the sociology of industrial relations.)
J53|Interorganisationale Netzwerke und tarifpolitische Fragmentierung: Hebt Mehr-Arbeitgeber-Beschaeftigung die Tarifeinheit aus den Angeln? (Inter-organisational networks and the fragmentation of collective bargaining: Do multi-employer work arrangements undermine ‘Tarifeinheit’?)|Der Aufsatz stellt die Auswirkungen einer netzwerkfoermig reorganisierten Wertschoepfung auf das System der Tarifpolitik zur theoretischen und empirischen Diskussion. Im Vordergrund steht die These, nach der eine solche (Re-)Organisation interorganisational segmentierte Belegschaften schafft, und zwar auch in den traditionellen Kernzonen industrieller Wertschoepfung. Von diesem Prozess werden verschiedene Dimensionen des etablierten Tarifsystems beruehrt: (1) Im Hinblick auf die Kollektivakteure entstehen neuartige Vertretungsluecken und -konkurrenzen, (2) die Prozesse der Aushandlung sind aufgrund der Vervielfaeltigung der Verhandlungsbeziehungen von einem Auseinanderfallen von Regelfindung und -durchsetzung betroffen und (3) die Ergebnisse der Tarifpolitik verschieben sich neben der Absenkung von Verguetungen und der Entstehung tariflicher Parallelwelten in Richtung von Regelambiguitaet und Regelkonflikt. Fasst man diese Entwicklungen unter dem Oberbegriff tarifpolitischer Fragmentierung zusammen, wird deutlich, dass Tarifeinheit in ihren organisationsbezogenen Grundlagen herausgefordert wird, was netzwerkadaequate Handlungsoptionen der Sozialpartner jenseits etablierter Praktiken erforderlich werden laesst. (This article puts the networked form of value creation and its impact on the German collective bargaining system centre stage. Here, we are primarily concerned with the hypothesis that a network-based reorganisation of value creation creates interorganisationally segmented workforces, even within the traditional core of manufacturing. This process affects various dimensions of the established collective bargaining system: (1) With respect to the collective actors, new representation gaps and representational competition emerge, (2) negotiation processes are marked by a gap between rule definition and rule enforcement because of the multiplication of relationships, and (3) apart from wage reduction and parallel wage standards, collective bargaining outcomes move in the direction of rule ambiguity and rule conflict. Summarising these developments in wage-setting arrangements under the term ‘fragmentation”, it becomes obvious that the organisational foundations of ‘Tarifeinheit’ are challenged. This triggers a need for social partners to develop network-adequate responses beyond traditional practices in collective bargaining.)
J53|Berufs- und Spartengewerkschaften. Zur Kritik des Tarifeinheitsgesetzes (Professional unions. A critique of the Collective Agreement Unity Act)|Seit den fruehen 2000er Jahren wandeln sich einige Berufsverbaende zu Berufsgewerkschaften und etablieren sich als unabhaengige Tarifpartner im Verkehrs- und Gesundheitssektor. Der Beitrag behandelt zunaechst ihre wesentlichen gemeinsamen Merkmale. Im Mittelpunkt steht das 2015 in Kraft getretene Tarifeinheitsgesetz, welches das abgeschaffte Prinzip der Tarifeinheit wieder einfuehrt („ein Betrieb, eine Gewerkschaft“). Unsere umfassende Kritik argumentiert nicht, wie es ueblicherweise der Fall ist, aus juristischer Sicht, sondern aus der Perspektive der Arbeitsbeziehungen. Sie erfolgt auf drei Ebenen: Probleme der Praktikabilitaet der Verfahren, der breitere Kontext der Gewerkschaftsentwicklung, befuerchtete, aber unrealistische Konsequenzen fuer das System der Arbeitsbeziehungen. (Since the early 2000s some professional associations have changed into professional unions and have established themselves as independent bargaining partners in the transport and health sectors. The paper begins by presenting the most important common characteristics of such professional unions. It focuses on the Collective Agreement Unity Act which came into force in 2015 and re-establishes the abolished principle of bargaining unity (‘one company, one union’). Our comprehensive critique does not take the usual legal perspective but rather an industrial relations one. It is based on three levels: Practical problems of the applicability of procedural rules, the broader context of trade union development, feared but unrealistic consequences for the system of employment relations.)
J53|Konflikt ohne Partnerschaft? Arbeitsbeziehungen im Dienstleistungssektor (Conflicts without any kind of partnership? Industrial relations in the service sector)|Der Beitrag setzt sich mit der These von Wolfgang Streeck auseinander, nach der das Konzept der Konfliktpartnerschaft von Mueller-Jentsch an Erklaerungskraft verloren hat. Mit Blick auf den privaten Dienstleistungssektor wird hier argumentiert, dass der empirischen Diagnose von Streeck in weiten Teilen zuzustimmen ist. Mittelfristig ist mit der Herausbildung einer stabilen Konfliktpartnerschaft in diesem Bereich der Arbeitsbeziehungen nicht zu rechnen. Vielmehr gewinnen staatsnahe Akteure an Bedeutung. Das Konzept von Mueller-Jentsch bleibt aber relevant als analytischer Bezugsrahmen und begriffliche Heuristik, um Wandlungsprozesse zu untersuchen. (This contribution reflects on Wolfgang Streeck’s argument that the concept of ‘conflict partnership” developed by Walther Mueller-Jentsch has lost its descriptive and explanatory power today. With regards to the private service sector, I agree with Streeck that we won’t witness the evolution of a stable conflict partnership in the service sector for the next decades ahead. But this does not mean that the theoretical concept of ‘conflict partnership” is no longer relevant. It is still useful as a heuristic and analytical tool to analyse processes of transformation in the industrial relations system.)
J53|Konfliktpartnerschaft – still alive. Veraenderter Konfliktmodus in der verarbeitenden Industrie (Conflict partnership – still alive. The changed conflict mode in the manufacturing industry)|Die deutschen industriellen Beziehungen haben sich in den letzten drei Jahrzehnten strukturell in drei Welten der Arbeitsbeziehungen segmentiert. Zugleich hat sich der Konfliktmodus in der ersten Welt, die durch die exportorientierte Industrie gepraegt ist, stark modifiziert: Durch komplexe Systeme der feinjustierten Interessenverarbeitung ist der oeffentlich wahrnehmbare Grosskonflikt die Ausnahme geworden, dezentrale Konflikte sind dagegen der Regelfall. Mit Bezug auf das von Mueller-Jentsch pointierte Konzept der Konfliktpartnerschaft wird die These vertreten, dass auch mit diesem veraenderten Konfliktmodus weiterhin von einer Konfliktpartnerschaft, die ein spezifischer Modus der Sozialpartnerschaft ist, in der exportorientierten Industrie gesprochen werden koenne. (Over the last three decades, the German industrial relations have segmented into three worlds of labour relations. At the same time the conflict mode in the first world, which is dominated by the export-oriented industry, has changed. Due to the complex system of adjusted knowledge processing, big, publicly observable conflicts are rather the exception whereas decentralised conflict solutions are the rule. According to Mueller-Jentsch’s concept of conflict partnership it is argued here that despite the changed environment and conflict modes, the term conflict partnership is still an appropriate mode in the export-oriented economy.)
J53|Arbeit, Arbeitsbewusstsein und Interessenorientierung von Hochqualifizierten Angestellten (Work, work-identity and interest representation of highly-qualified staff)|Die in der Privatwirtschaft angestellten Akademiker sind ein irritierender Gegenstand fuer die Soziologie, da sie sich nicht den klassentheoretischen Strukturkategorien fuegen. Formal betrachtet sind sie Lohnabhaengige wie die gewoehnlichen Arbeiter, orientieren sich aber aufgrund ihres Bildungsweges, ihrer komplexen Taetigkeiten und –in zahlreihen Faellen- ihrer Managementfunktionen an den oberen Schichten, entwickeln eine Arbeitsidentitaet der Beitragsorientierung, und verhalten sich distanziert gegenueber Gewerkschaft und Betriebsrat. Dieses Muster geriet in den 1990er Jahren aufgrund der oekonomischen Krise ins Wanken. Bei der Suche nach Antworten auf die Frage, welche Veraenderungen danach eingetreten sind, begleitet und kommentiert der Artikel die Hochqualifiziertenforschung in der juengeren deutschen Industriesoziologie. Er kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass die Kernelemente des traditionellen High-trust-Modells re-stabilisiert wurden. Eine gesonderte Betrachtung ist der Situation der Hochqualifizierten in der IT-Industrie und der Frage der Gleichstellung hochqualifizierter Frauen gewidmet. (The subject of academic staff in the private sector causes irritation in sociology because it does not fit the structural categories of class theory. In a formal view professionals and middle managers are wage earners like normal workers. However due to their educational background, their complex jobs, and – in many cases – their managerial functions, they are oriented to the upper classes, have a high-commitment work-identity and tend to keep their distance from unions and works councils. In the economic crisis of the 1990s this model of work seemed to erode. In search of answers to the question of what changes have taken place thereafter this article discusses research on highly-qualified staff in the younger German sociology of work literature. It comes to the conclusion that the key elements of the traditional high-trust-model have become restabilised. A separate issue is the situation of highly-qualified specialists in the IT-industry and the question of equal career prospects for highly-qualified women.)
J53|Konfliktpartnerschaft und andere Spielarten industrieller Beziehungen (Conflict partnership and other species of industrial relations)|Die nachstehende Replik geht nach einer Praezisierung des Konzepts der Konfliktpartnerschaft auf die wesentlichen Kritikpunkte ein, die die Beitraeger zur Kontroverse Konfliktpartnerschaft erhoben haben. Sie greift deren Hinweise auf die Fragmentierung der deutschen industriellen Beziehungen in zwei bzw. drei Regulierungswelten auf und argumentiert, dass unbeschadet dessen die Konfliktpartnerschaft immer noch als das praegende Modell fuer die deutschen industriellen Beziehungen anzusehen sei, wenn auch fuer einen – im Vergleich zu frueheren Dekaden – eingeschraenkteren Bereich. (The following reply starts with a detailed definition of the concept of conflict partnership and addresses the main criticisms of the contributors about the controversy of this concept in former issues. It takes up their suggestions concerning the fragmentation of German industrial relations into two or three worlds of regulation. Finally, it argues that conflict partnership remains the constitutive model for German industrial relations, albeit for a more limited field compared to earlier decades.)
J53|Financialisation of wages and works councils’ policy: Profit sharing in the German metalworking and electrical engineering industries|Profit sharing wages are of growing importance in Germany. They are indicating a nascent trend of financialisation of wages. However, little is known about the regulation of profit sharing wages especially on plant level and the way they affect the policies of works councils. Plant level wage policy is a subject of codetermination according to the German Works Constitutions Act, and wage policy has always been one of the most crucial topics of works councils’ activities. What is the role works councils play regarding the negotiation and regulation of profit sharing wages? What is the collective interest they define and pursue in this respect? And what are the effects of wage financialisation on the legitimacy of works councils? These questions are analysed with respect to the development of profit sharing wages in the German metalworking industry. Based on a variety of research methods, our analysis shows that profit sharing wages are a source of legitimacy for the works councils. In many cases the works councils, usually regarded as victims of financialisation, are actively striving for the financialisation of wages in their companies. However, they have to cope with the problem that profit sharing nowadays is based on a redistribution of income between capital and labour, between firms and between different categories of employees.
J53|Nuevas funciones de la negociación colectiva y alteración de su marco normativo|La negociación colectiva en su origen en la sociedad industrial desplegaba dos funciones relativamente simples y complementaria: de un lado se presentaba como instrumento de tutela incrementada de los derechos de los trabajadores más allá de los previstos por parte de la normativa estatal, al mismo tiempo que tendía a establecer un régimen homogéneo de condiciones de trabajo en la empresa y/o el sector productivo con vistas a evitar escenarios de competencia desleal por la vía del dumping social. Sin llegar a desaparecer las anteriores funciones, la normativa laboral y la propio desarrollo del modelo económico le viene exigiendo a la negociación colectiva la asunción de nuevas y decisivas funciones: adaptación a las peculiaridades empresariales y sectoriales para dar respuestas a los singulares requerimientos de las partes en el ámbito local, adaptación de las condiciones de trabajo al cambio del ciclo económico o de la coyuntura empresarial, distribución equitativa de sacrificios entre los diferentes grupos de trabajadores, la gestión de la segmentación laboral provocada con naturalidad por el mercado, así como propiciar la flexibilidad laboral en un escenario de competitividad globalizada. La capacidad de asumir todas estas funciones por parte de la negociación colectiva es el gran reto que se le presenta en el escenario actual, bajo el riesgo de perder de lo contrario capacidad de protagonismo y de centralidad en el gobierno del sistema de relaciones laborales
J53|Nuevas funciones de la negociación colectiva y alteración de su marco normativo|El sistema de negociación colectiva en España tiene características que contrastan con otros países: su universalidad, una baja afiliación y un alto grado de presión sindical en la fijación de los salarios. La alta cobertura de la negociación colectiva, generada por la regulación de dicho sistema, está íntimamente relacionada con estos factores. El objetivo del artículo es analizar la cobertura de la negociación colectiva en España, atendiendo especialmente a la legislación que la sustenta. Además, se pretende fundamentar las razones por las que dicha cobertura es tan alta y analizar el problema existente en torno a la medición de las tasas de cobertura. Para ello, se construye una tasa alternativa que tiene en cuenta los trabajadores excluidos del derecho a negociación colectiva usando datos de la Encuesta de Población Activa. Esto permitirá tener en cuenta algunos matices legislativos al establecer comparaciones internacionales o conclusiones sobre los efectos de la negociación colectiva en España.
J53|Análisis de las inaplicaciones de convenios tras la reforma laboral|La reforma laboral de 2012 incorporó un mecanismo sencillo para la inaplicación de un convenio colectivo, con el objetivo de que las empresas en crisis pudieran ajustar los costes salariales para evitar recortes más profundos en el empleo. Desde esa fecha, las inaplicaciones no han sido muy frecuentes en la práctica, situándose el porcentaje de trabajadores afectados por las mismas por debajo del 1% (con la excepción del año 2013, en que se elevó al 1,5%). El análisis de una muestra de 447 empresas que inaplicaron un convenio colectivo en el periodo 2012-2013, ha permitido observar cómo, tras el profundo deterioro de los ingresos de explotación, los resultados y la rentabilidad económica que tuvo lugar al inicio de la crisis, los tres indicadores mencionados se han ido recuperando ligeramente a partir de 2012, primer año en que las inaplicaciones fueron posibles. Lo mismo ha sucedido (con un año de retraso) con el nivel de empleo, aunque no con el coste laboral medio, que sólo ha comenzado a recuperarse en 2014. También se ha podido constatar que las empresas que inaplican presentan una elasticidad del empleo ante cambios en los salarios de -0,37.
J53|La crisis económica, las reformas laborales y la negociación colectiva|El objetivo principal del artículo es analizar si la crisis económica y las reformas laborales aprobadas a lo largo de la crisis han tenido alguna incidencia sobre la capacidad negociadora de los distintos interlocutores sociales. Para ello, se explica cómo las consecuencias de la crisis, no contrarrestadas por la recuperación económica que se produce desde mediados de 2013, han podido influir en la capacidad de los trabajadores y los sindicatos para negociar las condiciones de trabajo y salariales, dificultándolas, aparte de que la recuperación económica ha ido acompañada de una mayor precarización del empleo, lo que parece que va en la misma dirección de debilitar la posición de los trabajadores. Por otro lado, las reformas laborales aprobadas en los últimos años, como las que se producen en materia de despido y de modificación de las condiciones de trabajo y, sobre todo, en la regulación de la negociación colectiva, refuerzan las razones que van en el mismo sentido que la crisis económica de empeorar la posición de los trabajadores. Y ese debilitamiento de la negociación colectiva de los trabajadores tiene como consecuencia más relevante la devaluación salarial.
J53|Application of the Grounded Theory Methodology in HRM Research Within Private and Public Sector – An Attempt at a Meta-Analysis of Articles Published on the ISI Master Journal List Between 2010 and 2014 (Wykorzystanie metodologii teorii ugruntowanej w badaniach z zakresu ZZL w sektorze prywatnym i publicznym – proba metaanalizy artykulow opublikowanych w latach 2010–2014 na tzw. liscie filadelfijskiej)|The aim of the study is to assess the cognitive value of research results presented in the articles concerning HRM in which the grounded theory methodology was used. The article puts forward the meta-analysis as a tool for comparing the results of previous empirical research published during the period of the last five years (2010–2014) on the ISI Master Journal List. I hope that my research will add to debates on issues of HRM within the private and public sector.
J53|A Weibull Analysis of the Current Job Tenure in Taiwan with both Accelerated Failure-Time and Proportional Hazards Matrics|Relations of current job tenure, which refers to the length of time in the current role at a specific firm, with firm-specific human capital and their determinants are examined theoretically. The approach of estimation for the survival model is explored by associating Weibulls parametric log-linear duration model with the accelerated life model, as well as both proportional and relative hazards as embedded in Cox's proportional hazards model. By fitting the survivalmodel to household data from the May 2012 Manpower Utilization Survey of Taiwan, the estimation results can be briefly summarized as follows: (1) The duration of the current job tenure appears to be positively associated with formal schooling and general experience levels, government and large-sized firms, typical employment, full-time job, married with spouse present,and the prime agers of 29-44, and hence negatively related to the situations that it otherwise would be, i.e., medium- or small-sized firm, atypical employment, part-time job, single or no spouse status, and the mid and elderly agers of 45-64. (2) The current job tenure of the reference subject fails around 8 times as earlier (or ages around 8 times as fast) as that of the subject with covariates. More interestingly, this implies that the risk that the current job tenure of the subject fails is exposed at a given survival time to only around an eighth times the risk that the current job tenure of the reference subject fails at about an eighth time as earlie as the survival time. (3)Of all the covariates, formal schooling level imposes the greatest positive effect on the time length of current job tenure and hence have the greatest mitigating effect on the risk of current job tenure; conversely, atypical employment imposes the largest negative effect on the time length of current job tenure and hence have the largest increasing effect on the risk of current job tenure. (4) Estimation results from Weibull do have implications similar to correspondingly respective results from both the accelerated failure-time and proportional hazards metrics.

J53|İkame Etkisi, Baskı Etkisi ve Bu Etkiler ile Sendikalaşma Eğilimi Arasındaki İlişki|The aim of this study is to explore the levels of workers’ willingness to unionize, their perceptions about substitution effect and suppression effect, and the relationship between the willingness and the effects. To do so, a survey was conducted among 215 workers. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the mentioned levels, and multiple linear regression analysis was utilized to reveal the mentioned relationship. At the end of the research, we discover that there is a high level of suppression effect and a low level of substitution effect among workers and a stronger tendency on willingness to unionize, and the willingness is robustly predicted by suppression effect.
J53|Collective bargaining systems and macroeconomic and microeconomic flexibility: the quest for appropriate institutional forms in advanced economies|Abstract This paper addresses the design of the machinery of collective bargaining from the perspective of microeconomic and macroeconomic flexibility. In the former context, somewhat greater attention is given over to enterprise flexibility than external adjustment. In the latter context, close attention is also paid to changes in collective bargaining along the dimensions of bargaining coverage, structure, and coordination. Support is adduced for the German, contemporary Scandinavian, and British models. The role of trust in securing micro and macro flexibility also receives attention, suggesting that the polder or Dutch model might also be expected to populate the firmament of fit-for-purpose collective bargaining arrangements.

J53|Job-Related Well-Being Through the Great Recession|We study how job-related well-being (measured by Warr’s ‘Enthusiasm’ and ‘Contentment’ scales) altered through the Great Recession, and how this is related to changing job quality. Using nationally representative data for Britain, we find that job-related well-being was stable between 2001 and 2006, but then declined between 2006 and 2012. We report relevant changes in job quality. In modelling the determinants of job-related well-being, we confirm several previously-studied hypotheses and present some new findings: downsizing, work re-organisation, decreased choice, and linking pay to organisational performance each reduce well-being; indicators of skills challenge in jobs have more of a positive association with Enthusiasm than with Contentment, while effort has a more negative association with Contentment than with Enthusiasm. Our estimates are largely orthogonal to the effects of personality traits and demographic controls on well-being. Using a standard decomposition, we find that the 2006–2012 fall in job-related well-being is partly accounted for by accelerations in the pace of workplace change, rising job insecurity, increased effort and changing participation.

J53|Gender inequality in job quality. What has happened in Spain during the recession?|Through a representative sample of 5,381 (3,079 men and 2,302 women) and 4,925 (2,719 men and 2,206 women) employees in 2008 and 2010, and a using two-stage structural equation model, this article empirically analyses the multi-dimensional determinants (direct effects) of gender-related job quality in Spain. The research revealed four main results. First, despite the economic crisis, job quality in Spain had improved over the analysis period. Second, the improvement in job quality during the crisis was more favourable to men than it was to women. Third, the gender differences in the explanation of job quality during the crisis increased considerably in favour of men. Fourth, this increase in gender difference in job quality in favour of men is explained by a worsening of 4 of the 5 explanatory dimensions thereof: intrinsic job quality; work organisation and workplace relationships; working conditions, work intensity and health and safety at work; and extrinsic rewards. Only inequality in the work-life balance dimension remained stable from 2008 to 2010. In terms of employment and gender equality public policy our research results suggest two important conclusions. In the first place, the importance of paying much greater attention to working environment and social relation dimensions in gender-related employment public policies. Second, gender equality public policy should also address new problems associated with the accelerated changes at work. In particular, the different job quality problems between highly skilled and less skilled working men and women, the link between gender gap and occupations, and the need to consider the different institutional regimes and organised labour to overcome gender-related job inequalities.
J53|Immediate Manager Gender and Female Wages - The Importance of Manager Position|One argument for increasing female representation in management is the anticipation that female managers are particularly beneficial for female employees through, e.g., role modeling or mentoring. Contrary to the expected positive association, we find that female wages are negatively associated with working directly for a female as opposed to male manager using a representative sample of matched employee-employer data from Sweden. However, dividing the sample by managerial position, and controlling for important sorting of employees, the negative association is found only among lower-level managers and not among high-level managers. We discuss decision-making power as one possible explanation for this heterogeneity.
J53|The impact of the economic crisis on the changes in industrial relations in the countries of the Central and Eastern Europe|Enlargement of the European Union in 2004 significantly increased the diversity of industrial relations among the countries of the EU. In comparison with the countries of the former EU-15, the new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) were characterized by weaker trade unions, faster decline in union density, lower coverage of collective bargaining and their greater decentralization, and by the lack of statutory forms of information and consultation of employees at company level. The main aim of this paper is to examine the impact of the economic crisis on institutions shaping industrial relations in the CEE countries during the period 2008–2014. This article will answer the question if the crisis has accelerated the convergence of industrial relations, or even the opposite — further deepened the existing differences and what the responses of social partners on the crisis were. The paper uses theoretical and conceptual analysis methods based on a survey of literature and statistics (especially from ICTWSS data base and EU-linked sources such as ETUI and EIRO).
J53|Is Flexible Labor Good for Innovation? Evidence from Russian Firm-level Data|The level of innovation activity of the Russian enterprises is inferior to the level of innovation activity of enterprises in developed countries. At the same time, Russian enterprises actively use fixed-term contracts, which help them to reduce the labor costs and adapt to changes in demand, to increase the flexibility of labor and improve the selection of employees at the workplaces. Fixed-term contracts can contribute to innovation, because they enhance the flexibility of labor relations and create savings in the use of workers. However, fixed-term contracts can reduce the likelihood of innovation because they reduce investment in human capital, leading to a reduction in labor productivity. Which trends dominate in labor relations is the subject of this study. For the study we used data about enterprises from the annual Russian Enterprises Survey in 2014. The sample is representative for Russia and includes small, medium and large enterprises with more than 30 employees in seven sectors (mining, industry, construction, transport and communications, trade, finance, business services). For the analysis, we used bivariate probit model, Heckman correction model and probit model with continuous endogenous regressor (the share of workers with fixed-term labor contracts). The results showed that fixed-term contracts have a positive effect on the innovation activity of enterprises only when they are used in a limited quantity. With an increase in the percentage of workers with fixed-term contracts, the likelihood of innovation activity of enterprises declines.
J53|Paid Vacation Use - The Role of Works Councils|We investigate the relationship between co-determination at the plant level and paid vacation in Germany. From a legal perspective, works councils have no impact on vacation entitlements, but they can affect their use. Employing data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), we find that male employees who work in an establishment, in which a works council exists, take almost two additional days of paid vacation annually, relative to employees in an establishment without institution. The effect for females is much smaller, if discernible at all. The data suggests that this gender gap might bue due to the fact that women exploit vacation entitlements more comprehensively than men already in the absence of a works council.
J53|Relationship Between Levels Of Organization Learning,Relacion Entre Los Niveles De Aprendizaje Organizacional|The present study aims to value organizational learning at three levels: individual, group and organizational and identify the relationship between them. We also determine whether there are significant differences between levels and sociodemographic data of the employees. For this purpose, quantitative information was obtained from 415 people working in 8 large businesses in the Central region of the state of Coahuila by using a structured questionnaire to analyze collected data which was processed using SPSS software. One of the findings, infers that, the greater individual learning, so is the greater the group and organization learning. We found significant differences in gender, with the factors of group learning.
J53|Analisys Of Learning Development Three Levels: Individual, Group And Organizational And Its Relationship With The Percieved Competitive Advantage Of The Company, Analisis Del Desarrollo Del Aprendizaje En Sus Tres Niveles: Individual, Grupal Y Organizacional Y Su Relacion Con La Ventaja Competitiva Percibida De La Empresa|The development of organizational learning is essential, because when it is superior to competitors, it can be used strategically to influence the competitive advantage of firms. This study analyses the relationship between organizational learning within its three different levels: individual, group and organizational. We also examine how these levels impact the competitive advantage perceived in eight big manufacturing companies of the central region of the state of Coahuila, Mexico. The methodology is a quantitative approach consisting of applying a structured questionnaire to a non-probabilistic sample of 391 workers and employees. The results show that organizational learning, at the three levels, it is related to perceived competitive advantage
J53|Explaining Cross-National Variation in Workplace Employee Representation|Across Europe, there are many differing opinions on whether workplace employee representation should be encouraged or discouraged. Yet there is very little evidence on the variations in workplace employee representation across Europe or the reasons for this. We use a workplace survey covering 27 EU countries to show that its incidence is strongly and independently correlated with the degree of centralization in a country's industrial relations regime and the extent of legislative support. Industry rents are also important in explaining trade union presence, but are unimportant in the case of works councils. Turning to the effects of workplace employee representation, we find support for the exit-voice model - traditionally associated with Anglo-Saxon regimes - whereby worker representation is associated with poorer perceptions of the employment relations climate and with lower voluntary quit rates.
J53|Is Price Competition More Efficient than Quantity Competition? A Reversal with Unionized Oligopolists|Abstract In the context of union-duopoly decentralized bargaining, we argue that, prior to the realization of any employment and production plans, firms and unions may collectively decide about their bargaining agenda. That is, whether they will subsequently negotiate about only wages (“Right-to-Manage”) or about both wages and employment (“Efficient Bargains”). We show that under price competition in the product market the equilibrium bargaining agendas always involve only wages. Under quantity competition, however, and provided that the union bargaining power is low enough, one firm/union pair agrees on Efficient Bargains while the other pair agrees on Right-to-Manage. Thus, if sufficient product differentiation among firms exists, then social welfare can be higher under quantity competition than under price competition; the role of unions is critical for this result.
J53|Employees on Corporate Boards|Employees in Swedish firms have the legal right to be represented on the company board. However, in a considerable share of Swedish listed firms, this option is not exercised. This paper asks why that is the case. We use a simple framework, based on rational choice by individual employees. Our sample consists of 226 listed non-financial Swedish firms in 2001-2007. The results are in line with our predictions. Employee board representation does not impact firm performance, neither positively nor negatively. The main driver of employee board representation is the number of eligible employees. Furthermore, employee board representation decreases with firm risk, slow growth, and internationalization. We conclude that when the law grants the right for employees to be represented on the board a simple model based on individual utility maximization provides an explanation for why the right is used in some firms and not in others.
J53|Who's the Boss? The Effect of Strong Leadership on Employee Turnover|Despite the importance placed on supervision in the workplace, little is known about the effects of a boss’ leadership quality on labor market outcomes such as employee job retention. Using plausibly exogenous assignment of junior officers to bosses in the U.S. Army, we find positive retention effects for those assigned to immediate and senior bosses who are good leaders. These effects are strongest for officers with high SAT scores. Junior officers who share the same home geographic region, high SAT, and undergraduate institution as their bosses who also have strong leadership qualities retain at the highest rates.
J53|Corporate Governance and Human Resource Management|In seeking to compare the consequences of different corporate governance regimes around the world, an initial focus was on overall growth consequences. However, given that different types of national corporate governance regime appear to do better than others at specific times, and the great variations in national development within the main broad national corporate governance families, there has been a growing interest in the specific effects on the firm itself [Morgan et al., 2010], rather than seeing it as a transmission belt between relative owner and stakeholder rights on the one hand, and macro-economic outcomes on the other hand [La Porta et al., 1997, 1999, 2000]. At the simplest, such analysis has sought to interpose relative worker rights and social protection under the law as a variable that might dilute owner rights, diverting firms from a shareholder value maximisation agenda [Botero et al., 2004]. However, this goes little beyond simple hierarchical models that suggest that a single institutional feature underwriting property rights can explain everything of significance that goes on in the firm. So a growing body of applied work looks at the consequences of dominant corporate governance regimes for a key stakeholder grouping that has sunk human capital within the firm. Indeed, arguments are made for a re-evaluation of types of institutional arrangement and associated patterns of firm finance in relation to what might best explain particular sets of HRM and employment practices, and the direct effect on organisational performance, alongside how this might affect overall economic growth [Goergen et al., 2012, Gospel and Pendleton, 2003, Black et al., 2008, Pendleton, 2005]. There are many different dimensions to national corporate governance regimes, encompassing the legal, the political, the economic, and, indeed, embedded patterns of social behaviour; there is much debate within the literature as to which is the most important aspect of each.
J53|Profit sharing and its effect on income distribution and output: a Kaleckian approach|This study investigates how profit sharing influences the economy by using a Kaleckian model. Unlike existing research, I endogenise the profit share. The analysis shows that profit sharing decreases or increases the equilibrium capacity utilisation rate depending on whether the productivity-enhancing effect of profit sharing is weak or strong. Moreover, the presented numerical simulations show that the profit-sharing effects on income distributions differ according to the relative strength of the productivity-enhancing effect of profit sharing.
J53|Productivity Shocks in a Union‐Duopoly Model|We study the impacts of idiosyncratic productivity shocks when: firms have asymmetric productivities; firms and unions bargain over wages; and firms decide employment. The efficient firm pays a higher wage but has lower marginal production costs (due to its productivity advantage). Profits and worker surplus are higher at the efficient firm. A positive productivity shock affecting the efficient firm is always welfare improving; while if affecting the inefficient firm it may be welfare detrimental (if consumers' gain does not compensate the loss in worker surplus and industry profit). Consumer surplus increases more when the productivity shock affects the inefficient firm.
J53|Labor Market Flexibility and FDI Flows: Evidence from Oil-Rich GCC and Middle Income Countries|In this paper we empirically examine the impact of labor market flexibility on FDI flows to oil-rich GCC and compare it to middle income countries in 2006-2011. We account for potential endogeneity and nonstationarity and adopt system GMM and IV estimation methodologies. Our findings show that in middle income countries overall flexibility increases FDI flows under both system GMM and IV methodologies. In GCC countries overall LMF decreases FDI flows under system GMM methodology. Results also show a positive “GCC region” influence outweighing the negative flexibility influence. Growth potential and infrastructure development matter for both GCC and middle income countries.
J53|Employment protection legislation and labor court activity in Spain|Labor courts may introduce a significant wedge between “legal” firing costs and “effective” (post-trial) firing costs. Apart from procedural costs, there is uncertainty over judges’ rulings, in particular over the likelihood of a “fair” dismissal ultimately being ruled as “unfair”, which may increase firing costs significantly. In 2010 and 2012, reforms of Employment Protection Legislation widened the definition of fair economic dismissals in Spain. In this paper we look at Labor Court rulings on dismissals across Spanish provinces before and after the EPL reforms (2004-2014). We make this comparison taking into account a set of co-variates (local labor market conditions, characteristics of the Labor Courts, pre-trial conciliations, congestion of Labor Courts) which may determine the selection of dismissal cases ruled by Labor Courts. Our results suggest that, despite the 2010 and 2012 EPL reforms, the proportion of economic redundancies being ruled as fair by Labor Courts has not substantially increased, although it is now less negatively associated with the local unemployment rate than in the pre-reform period.
J53|How Does China's New Labour Contract Law Affect Floating Workers?|China's new Labor Contract Law took effect on January 2008 and required firms to give migrant workers written contracts, strengthened labor protections for workers and contained penalties for firms that did not follow the labor code. This paper uses survey data of migrant workers in the Pearl River Delta before and after the law and a retrospective question on when workers received their first labor contract to assess the effects of the law on labor outcomes. The evidence shows that the new law increased the percentage of migrant workers with written contracts, which in turn raised social insurance coverage, reduced the likelihood of wage arrears, and raised the likelihood that the worker had a union at their workplace.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J53|How Should India Reforms Its Labour Laws?|We examine the current policy debate around the reform of labour laws in India, which has been stimulated in part by the success of the Gujarat model of economic development. Gujarat's deregulatory reforms have included changes to the legal regime governing employment terminations, which could form a basis for a change in national-level labour laws. Evidence linking labour law deregulation to growth, however, is weak, whether the focus is on India or the experience of other countries. Building labour market institutions is a long-term process which requires investment in state capacity for the management of risks associated with the transition to a formal economy.
J53|Tarifbindung im Einzelhandel: Trends und Lohneffekte|Eine Bestandsaufnahme der aktuellen Tarifstruktur im deutschen Einzelhandel zeigt, dass die Bedeutung von Kollektivverträgen deutlich zurückgegangen ist: Während 2000 noch knapp drei Viertel aller Beschäftigten im Handelsgewerbe an einen Tarifvertrag gebunden waren, sind es im Jahr 2010 nur noch knapp die Hälfte. Aus betrieblicher Perspektive ist der Anteil tarifgebundener Betriebe über den entsprechenden Zeitraum von 56 auf 31% zurückgegangen. Betriebe mit Kollektivvertrag unterscheiden sich im Hinblick auf zahlreiche Charakteristika von Betrieben ohne Tarifbindung: Sie sind im Durchschnitt größer, älter und zahlen zwischen 25 und 32% höhere Entgelte.
J53|Performance Analysis Of Projects Implementation In Heis|According to the European Commission, Romania is still facing significant mismatch between the skills of graduates of tertiary education and the market needs. This paper is highly relevant for the future implementation of HEIs, since they have a strong economic role and they can significantly influence long-term national social and economical development. Romania did not manage to materialize community funds allocated for the 2007-2013 programming period to its full potential. Accordingly, the proposed thesis intends to analyse how Romanian HEIs were able to manage community resources attracted by grants and how the implemented projects achieved their set objectives. According to the data collected so far, the results will show that the performance of the projects is directly dependent on the proportion of fully dedicated staff in organizational design of the project. The originality of the undertaken study is that it starts from a realistic approach, according to which the rules of the game should be adapted, depending on the players (in our case – HEIs).

J53|CEO identity and labor contracts: Evidence from CEO transitions|This paper assesses how CEO transitions shape labor contracts within firms. We argue that family links between a new CEO and his predecessor act as a commitment device for upholding implicit contracts with the workforce. Consistent with this view, we find evidence of a wage insurance mechanism during a CEO transition. Dynastically-promoted CEOs relative to external CEOs are associated with up to 25% less job separations and 20% lower wage growth. Crucially, we show that differences, in terms of job separations, between dynastic and non-dynastic CEO successions are significantly greater when labor markets are more frictional.

J53|Functioning Model Of Human Resource Management On The Example Of Hotel „Holiday Inn“ In Belgrade|Human resources with their knowledge and competencies have become the main drivers of economic development, and increasing productivity, as the basis for the success of the organization, is based on human capital. Modern organizations have realized that only satisfied employees mean satisfied end-users, so they understood care about the employees as a necessary part of management. The paper analyzes, on the example of the hotel “Holiday Inn” in Belgrade, the connection between caring for employees and the degree of success of the organization, measured also by the number of loyal and new guests. The ways in which the company invests in its employees, and how they take care of the overall satisfaction of employees and their motivation, will depend the satisfaction of the guests, and the survival of organizations in the market.
J53|Collective Bargaining and Innovation in Germany: Cooperative Industrial Relations?|The effect of collective bargaining on innovation has long been in dispute. At the level of theory, the hold-up problem has been used to justify positive as well as negative effects of unionism. At the empirical level, although some would consider the North American evidence as cut and dried, this is not the case for other countries. In Europe there is some suggestion that certain industrial relations systems, either alone or in combination with the regulatory framework in which they are embedded, may tip the balance in favor of a beneficial union effect. In the present paper, we assemble nationally representative data for Germany – for many observers the exemplar of a cooperative industrial relations regime – to investigate the impact of collective bargaining on (several measures of) process innovation and product innovation. Our cross section and longitudinal analysis fails to indicate that unionism retards innovation. Indeed, in conjunction with workplace representation, collective bargaining at sectoral level might even be pro innovative.
J53|Pacts for Employment and Competitiveness as a Role Model? Their Effects on Firm Performance|Pacts for employment and competitiveness are an integral component of the ongoing process of decentralization of collective bargaining in Germany, a phenomenon that has been hailed as key to that nation's economic resurgence. Yet little is known about the effects of pacts on firm performance. The evidence largely pertains to employment and is decidedly mixed. The present paper investigates the association between pacts and a wider set of outcomes – wages, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, and survivability – in a RDD framework where the controls comprise establishments that negotiated over pacts but failed to reach agreement on their implementation. An extensive set of simulations are run to test for robustness of the key findings of the model. There is no evidence of pacts negatively impacting any of the selected measures of establishment performance. Indeed, the positive effects reported for wages, productivity, and innovation are sustained in simulations.
J53|Responsabilité sociale de l’entreprise et manipulation des salariés au travail : un éclairage institutionnaliste à partir d’une analyse de la littérature sur les codes de conduite|Les travaux autour de la responsabilité sociale de l’entreprise (RSE) se sont considérablement développés au niveau international depuis une dizaine d’années. Les crises répétées de nos modèles sociaux ont amené les chercheurs à s’interroger sur les modes alternatifs de régulation du capitalisme et, ce faisant, à faire de la RSE une voie de recherche féconde et salutaire – y compris dans l’opinion publique. C’est particulièrement le cas en management et depuis peu en économie des ressources humaines où la question du rôle de la RSE dans les pratiques d’encadrement de la relation d’emploi est de plus en plus débattue. Pour autant, peu de place est accordée à l’analyse critique des dispositifs de RSE intra-firme, lesquels se fondent pourtant souvent sur des pratiques ambivalentes qui laissent apparaître des formes de manipulation des salariés au travail. Il s’agit là de la thèse que nous souhaitons défendre dans cet article à partir d’une analyse de la littérature sur le concept de manipulation appliquée aux cas des codes de conduite des entreprises.
J53|The one constant: a causal effect of collective bargaining on employment growth? Evidence from German linked‐employer‐employee data|A large number of articles have analysed ‘the one constant’ in the economic effects of trade unions, namely that collective bargaining reduces employment growth by 2–4% points per year. Evidence is, however, mostly related to Anglo‐Saxon countries. We investigate whether a different institutional setting might lead to a different outcome, making the constant a variable entity. Using linked‐employer‐employee data for Germany, we find a negative correlation between being covered by a sector‐wide bargaining agreement or firm‐level contract and employment growth of about 1% point per annum. However, the correlation between employment growth and collective bargaining is not robust to the use of panel methods. We conclude that the results of the literature using cross‐section data might be driven by selection.
J53|Leadership and persistency in spontaneuous dishonesty|Extensive evidence shows that when given the opportunity, people cheat for monetary rewards, but only to the extent that they can keep a positive self-concept. In this study, we investigate various factors that may influence the degree to which people can keep their positive self-concept while cheating for monetary gains. We find that authentic leadership, gender, cheating norm, experience of cheating, and expectations of others’ cheating behavior have no effect on participants’ spontaneous dishonestyon an abstract task. Therefore, reducing people’s cheating behavior might be a long-term project for the management of fraudulent organizations and more difficult than might be expected.
J53|Unions and Collective Bargaining in the Wake of the Great Recession|This paper provides the first definitive estimates of union density in Portugal, 2010-2012, using a unique dataset. The determinants of union density at firm level are first modeled. Next, estimates of the union wage gap are provided for different ranges of union density. Since these estimates fully reflect the reality of an industrial relations system in which collective agreements are extended to nonunion workers and firms, the final issue examined is contract coverage. The pronounced reduction in the number of industry-wide agreements and extension ordinances in recent years has been uncritically equated with a fall in coverage. However, the authors show that the number of workers covered by new and existing agreements has remained largely unaffected by economic crisis. The reduced frequency of new agreements and extensions is instead attributed to downward nominal wage rigidity in deflationary times, rather than (as yet) the expression of a crisis in collective bargaining.
J53|Pacts for Employment and Competitiveness as a Role Model? Their Effects on Firm Performance|Pacts for employment and competitiveness are an integral component of the ongoing process of decentralization of collective bargaining in Germany, a phenomenon that has been hailed as key to that nation's economic resurgence. Yet little is known about the effects of pacts on firm performance. The evidence largely pertains to employment and is decidedly mixed. The present paper investigates the association between pacts and a wider set of outcomes – wages, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, and survivability – in a RDD framework where the controls comprise establishments that negotiated over pacts but failed to reach agreement on their implementation. An extensive set of simulations are run to test for robustness of the key findings of the model. There is no evidence of pacts negatively impacting any of the selected measures of establishment performance. Indeed, the positive effects reported for wages, productivity, and innovation are sustained in simulations.
J53|The Institutional and Economic Limits to Bargaining Decentralization in Italy|Italy is not immune from the long term trend towards greater bargaining decentralization under way in Western Europe. The article surveys the main actions undertaken in recent years, either by social partners or by government intervention, in order to reduce the obstacles to this process, without altering the relative importance of different levels of bargaining. Empirical evidence shows that firm-level bargaining has been associated with innovative managerial practices, but also that a significant share of firms would be willing to sign contracts that would grant higher wages or preserve occupational levels in order to obtain higher flexibility in the use of the workforce. From an institutional standpoint, the main obstacles preventing the adoption of such deals are: i) unresolved issues related to the measurement of trade unions' weight at the national level and to the coexistence of two different workers' representation systems, ii) limits to contract enforcement, iii) limited scope for action of second level bargaining in determining both wages and work organization. The effectiveness of tax breaks encouraging a closer link between wage and productivity at the firm level has been undermined by poor monitoring and frequent changes to the eligibility criteria.
J53|Sustainable Strategic Directions Of Regional Development In Romania In The Context Of European Integration|The economic competitiveness of a country is analyzed from several perspectives, including through the labor of the land available, gifted people’s skills and abilities, the level of employment, the standard of living and the level of population welfare. Currently, according to international hierarchies on competitiveness drawn up by the World Economic Forum (WEF), Republic of Moldova is in the second half of the league, failing, than with some small exceptions, to move towards more favorable positions. This is due to a set of factors whose action is felt for a long time, and improve prospects hierarchical position requires major revisions mentalities, policies, strategies and means of act ion. This article aims to analyze the theoretical and practical aspects on the role of labor, along with other factors in ensuring economic competitiveness of Republic of Moldova in the process of pre-accession to the European Union and integration into European economic structures. Efficient investment in human capital through education and training system should be an essential component of the country's strategy to ensure a high level of sustainable economic growth and employment knowledge-based workforce that provides both personal fulfillment and increased welfare and national competitiveness.
J53|Hiring Discrimination Against Pro-union Applicants: The Role of Union Density and Firm Size|We study the causal impact of revealing pro-unionism during the recruitment stage on hiring chances. To this end, we conduct a randomised field experiment in the Belgian labour market. When matched with employer and sector data, the experimentally gathered data enable us to test the heterogeneity of discrimination against pro-union applicants by the union density in the sector and the size of the firm. We find that disclosure of pro-unionism affects hiring chances in a negative way and that—in line with our expectations based on the literature—this negative impact is stronger in highly unionised sectors.

J53|Tarifeinheit, Tarifpluralität und Spartengewerkschaften: Ein Plädoyer für gesetzgeberische Zurückhaltung|This paper critically discusses the reasoning and the consequences of a recent parliamentary bill which intends to restore the traditional principle of one collective bargaining agreement per business in Germany that has been overturned by the Federal Labour Court. It argues that the empirical evidence on the effects of allowing multiple bargaining agreements and of the recently emerged occupational unions on strikes, wages and transaction costs is weak and does not justify the encroachment on the freedom of association associated with this bill.
J53|Tarifpluralität fünf Jahre nach dem BAG-Urteil|This article examines the likely effects of a draft bill of the German government which aims at restraining multi-unionism in Germany. We argue that since 2010, when the Federal Labour Court eased restrictions on multi-unionism, hardly any signs of adverse effects of this court ruling can be observed. Furthermore, the draft bill would have strong negative consequences for small, mainly occupation-based, unions in Germany. Therefore, the bill does not seem to be a good instrument for regulating labour relations in Germany.
J53|Tarifeinheit per Gesetz – 10 Thesen zu den Plänen der Bundesregierung zur Wiedereinführung der Tarifeinheit|One basically has to welcome the plans of the German Government to legally clarify the questions arising from a collision of collective labour agreements caused by a revised jurisdiction. Companies need clear guidelines on how to handle the demands of several trade unions. Reciprocally, the trade unions, too, need legal security shown, for example, by the high compensation claims against the Air Traffic Controllers’ Union (GDF) jeopardising its existence. The legislator should no longer allow the collective labour system in the field of essential services to suffer from a growing discontent of the affected citizens being the main sufferers from the strikes.
J53|Spartengewerkschaften, Statuskonflikte und Gemeinwohl: Gesetzlicher Ordnungsrahmen statt Laissez-faire|In December 2014, the German Federal Government adopted a draft law on the exclusive applicability of collective agreements - the so-called Tarifeinheitsgesetz. Critics see this as an unacceptable interference to the freedom of association. They point out, that despite multi-unionism you can neither observe a substantial increase in new trade unions being set up nor an increase in labor disputes. Proponents of the legal regulation argue that the industrial peace obligation would be jeopardized by competing unions. Craft unions negotiated twice as intense as industrial unions. In industries with union competition, risk of conflicts would accumulate. In addition, the public interest would be harmed if unions battled out their rivalries during collective bargaining negotiations. The proposed law tackled these problems by providing stronger incentives for cooperation between competing unions.
J53|Inside the Ford-UAW Transformation: Pivotal Events in Valuing Work and Delivering Results|In 2009, the Ford Motor Company was the only one of the Big Three automakers not to take the federal bailout package. How did Ford remain standing when its competitors were brought to their knees? It was a gutsy decision, but it didn’t happen in isolation. The United Auto Workers joined with Ford to make this possible—not only in 2009, but in a series of more than fifty pivotal events during three decades that add up to a transformation that simultaneously values work and delivers results. The pivotal events—some planned and some unplanned; some at the facility level and some at the enterprise level –were not all successful. All had the potential, however, to further the transformation, and all provide insight into how large-scale system change really happens. The authors— each with years of experience with Ford, the UAW, and the industry—provide an unprecedented inside look at how core operating assumptions are shifted and at the emergence of integrated operating systems for quality, safety, and other aspects of the enterprise. It is a transformation built on a foundation of dignity and mutual respect, guided by a vision of combining good jobs with high performance.

J53|Labor Market Flexibility and FDI Flows: Evidence from Oil-Rich GCC and Middle Income Countries|In this paper we empirically examine the impact of labor market flexibility on FDI flows to oil-rich GCC and compare it to middle income countries in 2006-2011. We account for potential endogeneity and nonstationarity and adopt system GMM and IV estimation methodologies. Our findings show that in middle income countries overall flexibility increases FDI flows under both system GMM and IV methodologies. In GCC countries overall LMF decreases FDI flows under system GMM methodology. Results also show a positive “GCC region” influence outweighing the negative flexibility influence. Growth potential and infrastructure development matter for both GCC and middle income countries.
J53|The added value of European Works Councils: A case study approach in Greek subsidiaries|As reported in similar studies, the necessity for social cohesion and workers motivation had as a result the adoption of EU 94/45/EC on European Works Councils (EWCs). This fact has been the cornerstone of the venture to establish a social dimension of the European Union, since it gives employees the right to information and consultation as part of the effort to develop a socially responsible transnational management. This paper includes several results of a conducted research on the introduction and functioning of European Works Councils in the Greek industrial relations system. The research concentrated on the oil/lubricants and food/beverage sectors. More specifically, the scope of the research was to test the hypothesis that EWCs create added value (positive or negative) in industrial relations within subsidiaries of MNCs in Greece and to explore the determining factors of that fact, using a qualitative approach in a combination of several case studies and interviews with representatives of the parties concerned. The research findings indicate that on the one hand EWCs contribute to the creation of positive added value (benefits) to those companies and on the other hand the negative added value (costs) is very limited. Furthermore, this paper searches the contributing factors to the EWCs added value such as internationalisation of the company, trade union structure, previous experience on workers participation schemes etc. The paper concludes that EWCs are more effective in internationalised corporations, which face the challenge of more concentrated industrial relations at a transnational level (Euro-companies) than in other enterprises, which adopt a more decentralised and national-oriented industrial relations model. Moreover, according to the research findings, whereas the European trade unions have acted for several years as pressure groups for the adoption of EWC directive, the MNCs meet the most important benefits by the EWCs function.
J53|Worker problem-solving and the nature of the firm: new theory, new evidence|This paper proposes a different theory of the firm and demonstrates how it can be employed to yield hypotheses about differences in innovation and human resource strategy according to the shareholder/stakeholder and liberal/coordinated market dichotomies. The theory assumes that feasible production and demand sets are nonconvex due to interaction among activities; thus firms exist to permit the identification and exploitation of profit opportunities through coordinated action. This implies that firms face a nonconvex profit landscape comparable to the fitness landscapes invoked in evolutionary biology. Given the complexity of these landscapes and the uncertainty of the location of profit hills, there is a tradeoff between exploiting existing or adjacent hills and prospecting for more distant ones: the first minimizes risk, the second maximizes potential profit. A further assumption is then introduced, that shareholder firms seek to maximizes the present value of expected future profit streams, while stakeholder firms maximize the likelihood of achieving profitability over a given time horizon. Combining these theoretical priors, we characterize the likely innovation, organizational and human resource characteristics of the two types of firms and the effects exerted by their external environment, as described in the Varieties of Capitalism literature. These theoretical predictions are confirmed in a set of case studies of a stakeholder firm in liberal and coordinated environments and a shareholder firm in a coordinated environment. This is seen through differences in the role of worker problem-solving, which brings together innovation and learning, organizational structure and human resource strategy.

Pioneers may think articulating a reasonable vision, the exact motivating forces for workers and giving preparing make associations to learn. This suspicion is not simply imperfect – it's hazardous despite heightened rivalry, progresses in innovation, and movements in client inclinations.

J53|Do the Flexible Employment Arrangements Increase Job Satisfaction and the Loyalty of the Employees? An Evidence from Great Britain|This study explores the relationship between job satisfaction, employee loyalty and various types of flexible employment arrangements using the Workplace Employee Relations Survey (WERS) in 2004 and 2011. A propensity score matching and fixed effects regressions are applied. Finally, Bayesian Networks (BN) and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are employed in order to confirm the causality between employment types explored and the outcomes of interest. Furthermore, an instrumental variables (IV) approach based on BN framework is proposed and applied in this study. The results support that there is a positive causal effect from these employment arrangements on job satisfaction and employee loyalty.

The determinants of union density at firm level are first modeled.

The reduced frequency of new agreements and extensions is viewed as an aspect of downward nominal wage rigidity in deflationary times (the counterpart of ""upward nominal wage rigidity"" in more normal times) rather than the immediate expression of a crisis in collective bargaining per se."
J53|Precariousness meets passion – Fields of conflict in editorial and social work|This article deals with everyday work experiences in the two sectors of social and editorial work. It stems from two processes of co-research, in-volving a group of eleven editorial workers and journalists in Milan in 2011, and another group of 19 social workers in Turin in 2012. In both cases, co-research was understood as a tool by which to learn about con-flicts and contradictions in everyday work, analyse one's own coping prac-tices, understand the reasons for the absence of collective conflict capaci-ties, and increase mobilisation. Both social and editorial work are tradi-tionally associated with high workforce involvement, strong levels of identification with one's work, and intrinsic motivations related to per-sonal interaction with the recipients of social services or the creative act of producing texts. This article explores how processes of precarisation affect such cognitive and emotional labour, and vice versa. This is done in two steps. First, current changes in work organisation and labour control are described, and a comparison is drawn between the sectors of editorial and social work. Second, workers’ daily experiences with management’s con-trol strategies are analysed. Emerging areas of conflict and workers’ daily coping practices are identified. The focus is on how professional identities are impacted by experiences of precarisation and by the losses in auton-omy and work quality that result from changing patterns of work organisa-tion. Two questions are raised. First, how does the evident destabilisation of professional identities affect workplace consent and workers’ readiness to engage in emotional, creative, and/or social labour? Second, what are the consequences for workers’ involvement in collective action, their con-flict capacities, and strategies?
J53|Workplace ethnographies – an underestimated source of subject-oriented work research|The article tries to argue why workplace ethnographies, with their deep immersion into daily social action, are more than other approaches appro-priate to illuminate hidden and subjective levels of work. Insofar they should be more picked up by the current debates on subjectivation, subjec-tivity and informal organisation of work in German sociology of work and industrial sociology. A cursory view of the rich tradition of ethnographic research and of examples within the anglophone language area will show the methodical and factual gains of this approach. The US-American “Workplace Ethnography Project” demonstrates an interesting way to de-duce more general insights and patterns from ethnographic case studies. Exemplary findings can be linked to the German debate. Finally a view on one of the few German ethnographic studies will show its value to the analysis of subjectivity, subjectivation and informal organisation of work: and gives reasons for pursuing similar research.
J53|Reflexive and experience-based trust and participatory research: Concept and methods to meet complexity and uncertainty in organisations|In the course of general changes in work, informal processes are becoming ever more important, and the question emerges how to understand and organise them. This is a great challenge for research. Quantitative research methods are confronted with the problem that complex processes cannot be investigated and understood by simple inquiry. Qualitative methods are more adequate but should be complemented by participatory research methods in order to really grasp the phenomena. This article demonstrates the potential of participatory research to meet this challenge, using the concept of reflexive experience-based trust as a regulation resource in enterprises. This leads to a discussion of basic questions of social research: the separation of researcher and “object of research” is called into question as well as the separation of means, ends and objects of research. A concrete research and design project is presented which exemplifies the potentials of participatory research and the notion of reflexive experience-based trust.
J53|Research for whom? Labour sociology between observation, co-management and social critique|What is the relationship between labour sociologists and the workers they examine, and what function do researchers acquire within the complex field of force that is the workplace? These questions are addressed, mainly drawing upon the author’s personal research experiences as a labour soci-ologist at one of the leading German institutes of labour research (SOFI, at University of Goettingen). After discussing in how far the social divide be-tween researchers and their objects of research impede or rather support a thorough analysis of work organisation, and how labour sociologists can resist the tendency to be turned into (cheap) corporate consultants, the question will be tackled whether labour sociology can still claim political relevance today. The article ends with some reflections on how new strategies of research could possibly pave the way for politics of emanci-pation, on the shop-floor and beyond.
J53|Participation in enterprises and in research: The case of innovation work|This article shows new facets of employee participation in the field of innovation work in enterprises, as well as in the research on this field of work. The necessity of employee participation in innovation work is dem-onstrated against the backdrop of new insights into innovation processes and their making. Moreover, for discovering the employees’ specific ac-tion patterns in innovation work (which are primarily geared to informal action and experiential knowledge), and for developing adequate work structures for the management of innovations, co-production of knowl-edge and workplace design between practitioners and researchers is necessary. This participatory research process is demonstrated in its complexity using the example of ‘co-operative transfer of experience’ as an operational field of action, which was observed and designed in a joint research project with several partners from science and practice. In conclusion, the features and scientific quality of the presented participatory research process are described, and the possibilities and boundaries of a further approximation to principles of action research are discussed.
J53|Participatory research on innovation – Methodological approaches to challenges in the field and practical experiences|Innovation processes in organisations are subject to profound changes: For example economisation, standardisation, and intensification of labour. It is a key challenge to conduct participatory research in this organisational set-ting, especially when increasing workloads of interview partners form a strict schedule for necessary interview or discussion time. The article in-troduces a participatory research design to address these challenges. The methodology was developed and applied in the research project “Smart Innovation” which studied impediments and promoters of innovation in the mechanical engineering branch. It combines agile principles with clas-sical elements of participatory research. Interview partners are involved with active parts throughout the research process and seen as experts of their work. Yet, participation in hierarchical organisations and under time and market pressure entails a potential for undesired limitations and side-effects. In fact, participative methods can enhance economic tendencies and backfire on emancipation.

J53|Can German Unions Still Cut It?|Using linked employer-employee data, this paper estimates the effect of collective bargaining coverage on wages over an interval of continuing decline in unionism. Unobserved firm and worker heterogeneity is dealt with using two establishment sub-samples, comprising collective bargaining joiners and never members on the one hand and collective bargaining leavers and always members on the other, each in combination with subsets of worker job stayers. The counterfactuals are then reversed for robustness checks. Joining a sectoral agreement is found always to produce higher wages, while leaving one no longer produces wage losses if the transition is to a firm agreement. Leaving a firm agreement to non- coverage also leads to wage reductions, while joining one from non-coverage seems decreasingly favorable. The reverse counterfactuals yield correspondingly smaller estimates (in absolute value) of wage development than reported for the initial counterfactuals. Finally, although small, the union wage gap persists.
J53|Improvement of Managerial Communications in Sports Clubs|Organizational decisions are highly dependent on the quality and quantity of information being exchanged. Poor or incomplete information can negatively impact a manager's ability to successfully make decisions. Due to the nature of the work in sports clubs the teachers perform (activity in sports stadiums, travel for competitions, etc.), usually they are not in the same building with their management. This fact requires modifying the communication of information through one accessible. As techniques and technology have invaded our lives the most optimal way is the communication of information throw technical devices. Nowadays almost everyone has a cell phone, which he carries all the time. Thus, communication using the smart phone is effective, fast and safe.
J53|Labor Disputes and Job Flows|Using a data set of individual labor disputes brought to French courts over the years 1996 to 2003, the authors use variations in local conditions of the activity of the labor courts to assess the effect of dismissal costs on the labor market. First, the authors present a simple theoretical framework to explain the links between litigation costs, judicial outcomes, and firing costs. Second, they regress job flows on indicators of judicial outcomes, using an instrument, based on local shocks in the supply of lawyers. They find that when the numbers of lawyers increase, workers litigate more often, which should increase the firing costs for the firms. This increased filing rate causes a large decrease in employment fluctuations, especially for shrinking or exiting firms. The total effect on employment growth is slightly positive, and this result is more sensitive to the adopted specification.
J53|What Makes a Good Worker? Richard Edwards Is Still Relevant|Since the 1970s, developed nations have seen the rise of the service economy, and forms of work organization have changed radically. As a result, employers have new requirements in the form of worker autonomy and so-called â€œsoftâ€ skills. These changes seem to mark a break with the expectations of submission and conformity highlighted by Edwardsâ€™s analysis. Nevertheless, the changes in employersâ€™ practices reflect not so much the disappearance of forms of control as a shift towards less authoritarian but equally powerful forms based on the shifting of responsibility on to employees and the internalization of organizational norms. In making this case, we draw more particularly on the example of front-line workers in retailing and the hotel and restaurant industry.
J53|Corporate Social Responsibility and Social Dialogue in Human Resources Management in the Banking Sector in Greece: A Case Study of Elder Bank Employees|Corporate Social Responsibility constitutes a powerful tool for Greek Banks for the development and formulation of their public image. However, many times this does not conform to socially accepted practices in the management of their human resources. In this current phase of economic crisis and restructuring in the banking sector some crucial issues have emerged. A major one is the problem of supporting and encouraging the employment of elder employees in a framework of practices, principles and values, which embed internationally accepted standards emanating from CSR and HR management. Balancing the public image of banks in relation to a difficult social reality regarding the issue of elder bank employees goes through the formulation of a consultation and social dialogue system including all social factors involved. In this article we propose the development of a structured system for public consultation and social dialogue based on primary research on a weighted sample of elder employees and managers of banks, as well as trade unions heads. This system will comprehensively address the issue of active ageing in the banking sector by proposing effective actions and solutions per policy area: awareness, using awareness indicators, maintaining employment and supporting career pathways, combating stereotypes related to age, etc. The proposed consultation system aims to increase transparency, collegiality and quality in decision making processes. The consultation system is governed by general principles, stages, fields and levels of social dialogue and takes into account the conditions for the development of social dialogue mechanism. The authors believe that the system proposed is also applicable in other branches (provided necessary adaptations are made); therefore it provides a useful tool for applying a policy dealing with worsening labour relations in the context of current circumstances
J53|Fluktuacja sprzedawców w ocenie mened¿erów polskich przedsiêbiorstw|In order to succeed in the competitive market, sales organizations strive to maintain a high level of their salespeople loyalty. It is a fundamental challenge for most companies, strictly linked with the problem of salesforce turnover. For long this topic has received a lot of attention from academic researchers and management practitioners alike due to the significant, lasting and adverse effects caused by sales staff turnover. In spite of ongoing research into this area, not all aspects of salespeople turnover are well explored and explained. Most of the research activity to date was focused on identifying the behavior and attitude of individuals leaving the sales organizations. Consequently, the turnover was analyzed as a response mechanism to stress or dissatisfaction with the organisation. On the other hand, one area that seems to be most under-researched is the assessment of salespeople turnover carried out by sales managers and the impact of their actions on the turnover. This problem deserves more attention as it is crucial to understand what actions can be taken within the sales organizations to limit the adverse effects of sales force turnover. The author aimed to fill the apparent void in existing research by examining the following research questions: How do managers of Polish sales organizations’ assess the salespeople turnover? To what extent does their assessment depend on their professional experience and selected features of their organizations? The results of questionnaire survey (using a sample of more than three hundred Polish sales managers) contribute to wider research into the organizational drivers of salespeople turnover
J53|The governance of offshoring and its effects at home. The role of codetermination in the international organization of German firms|This paper focuses on the links between labor market institutions and offshoring, with specific reference to the role of codetermination in shaping the international operations of German firms. We use case studies to illustrate how works councils deal with three important aspects of offshoring processes: the timeliness of information they receive from the management, the negotiation of compensation mechanisms, and the design of alternative strategies. While we found no evidence of works councils impeding offshoring, there are elements to suggest that they may influence the way such decisions are taken and moderate their effects on employment in the home country.

J53|Reciprocity and Workers’ Tastes for Representation|Using unique survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, this study examines the influence of reciprocal inclinations on workers’ sorting into codetermined firms. Employees with strong negative reciprocal inclinations are more likely to work in firms with a works council while employees with strong positive reciprocal inclinations are less likely to work in such firms. However, the results also show striking gender differences in the relationship between reciprocity and taste for representation. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
J53|Declining Unions and the Coverage Wage Gap: Can German Unions Still Cut It?|That German trade unionism is in profound decline seems to be beyond dispute. More controversial is the implied change in union impact on worker wages. A linked employer-employee dataset is deployed over an interval of continuing decline in unionism to address this issue. Over the sample period 2000–2010 it is found that joining a sectoral agreement always produces higher wages, while exiting one no longer leads to wage losses if the transition is to a firm agreement. Leaving a firm agreement to non-coverage also leads to wage reductions, while joining one from non-coverage appears decreasingly favorable. The one constant is the persistence of a small positive union wage gap. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
J53|Organisationsdefizite der deutschen Gewerkschaften|The results of the recently released German General Social Survey (ALLBUS) show that in 2014 the net density rate of trade unions in Germany declined to less than 18 per cent. This was the lowest level since German unification. An in-depth analysis of union membership reveals that unionisation of male, full-time and older employees is above average. The latest membership decline will continue if the unions do not succeed in organising more women, young people and white collar workers. Furthermore, unions have not yet been able to profit from scepticism towards liberal economic policies, which has slightly grown within the group of employees since 2004, as the index of economic freedom reveals.

J53|Rigidität durch Flexibilität: flexible Arbeit und das Wachstum von Managementbürokratien|Flexibility in labour markets increases transaction costs. Using organisation-level data representative for the Netherlands, we show that firms have higher shares of managers in their personnel if they employ more flexible workers. This fits to earlier observations that Anglo-Saxon countries with flexible labour markets have substantially thicker management bureaucracies than “Rhineland” countries with more regulated labour markets. We also find that percentages of managers in younger firms do not differ from those in older firms, while smaller firms have relatively more managers than larger firms. Moreover, not-for-profit and government organisations have relatively thinner management bureaucracies than private firms. Copyright ZBW and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
J53|Die Erosion von „Made in Germany“|Over the past 15 years, German economic policy has shown apparent similarities to what happened 20 years earlier in the Netherlands: Trade unions have made modest wage claims and the number of “atypical” (and often poorly paid) jobs has steadily risen. Such a policy has a price: a lower propensity to innovate and lower growth rates of labour productivity. During 1991 and 2001, when Germany was known as “the sick man of Europe”, it still achieved average annual labour productivity growth of 2.16%. Between 2001 and 2013, this percentage was reduced by half, and during the period after the Hartz reforms (2006 to 2013), annual growth averaged just 0.90%. This paper presents theoretical arguments and empirical findings that explain why this reduction is not a random process. Copyright ZBW and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
J53|Labor in the Twenty-First Century:The Top 0.1% and the Disappearing Middle-Class|The ongoing explosion of the incomes of the richest households and the erosion of middle-class employment opportunities for most of the rest have become integrally related in the now-normal operation of the U.S. economy. Since the beginning of the 1980s, employment relations in U.S. industrial corporations have undergone three major structural changes â€“ summarized as â€œrationalization,â€ â€œmarketization,â€ and â€œglobalizationâ€ â€“ that have permanently eliminated middle-class jobs in the United States. From the early 1980s, rationalization, characterized by plant closings, terminated the jobs of high-school educated blue-collar workers, most of them well-paid union members. From the early 1990s, marketization, characterized by the end of a career with one company as an employment norm, placed the job security of middle-aged whitecollar workers, many of them college educated, in jeopardy. From the early 2000s, globalization, characterized by the movement of employment offshore to lower-wage nations, left all members of the U.S. labor force, whatever their educational credentials and work experience, vulnerable to displacement. Initially, these structural changes in employment could be justified as business responses to changes in technologies, markets, and competitors. Once U.S. corporations transformed their employment relations, however, they often pursued rationalization, marketization, and globalization to cut current costs rather than to reposition themselves to produce competitive products. Defining superior corporate performance as ever-higher quarterly earnings per share, companies turned to massive stock repurchases to â€œmanageâ€ their own corporationsâ€™ stock prices. Trillions of dollars that could have been spent on innovation and job creation in the U.S. economy over the past three decades have instead been used to buy back stock for the purpose of manipulating stock prices. Legitimizing this financialized mode of corporate resource allocation has been the ideology, itself a product of the 1980s and 1990s, that a business corporation should be run to â€œmaximize shareholder value.â€ Through their stock options and stock awards, corporate executives who make these resource-allocation decisions are themselves prime beneficiaries of the focus on rising stock prices as the sole measure of corporate performance. While rationalization, marketization, and globalization undermined stable and remunerative employment structures, the â€œfinancializationâ€ of the U.S. corporation entailed the distribution of corporate cash to shareholders through stock repurchases, often in addition to generous cash dividends, and, incentivizing these distributions, the stock-based remuneration of top corporate executives. In this essay, I review evidence on the fundamental structural changes related to rationalization, marketization, and globalization that, since the early 1980s, have eroded U.S. middle-class employment opportunities. Then, I analyze how, in many different ways and in many different industries, the financialized mode of corporate resource allocation has undermined the prosperity of the U.S. economy. I go on to show how justified by the ideology that companies should be run to â€œmaximize shareholder value,â€ this financialized behavior boosts the remuneration of top corporate executives, providing a major explanation for the increasing concentration of income among the top 0.1% of U.S. households that is, through the very way it is achieved, based on the systematic destruction of middle-class employment opportunities available to members of the U.S. labor force.
J53|Argentina’s Worker-Recuperated Enterprises, 2010- 2013: A Synthesis of Recent Empirical Findings|Argentina’s empresas recuperadas por sus trabajadores (worker-recuperated enterprises, ERTs) are formerly investor- or privately-owned businesses in crisis ultimately taken over and re-opened by their employees, most commonly as worker cooperatives. Since 2002, the Programa Facultad Abierta (Open Faculty Program) of the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature at the University of Buenos Aires has carried out a series of national studies of Argentina’s ERTs. The aim of this article is to present the conclusions of the fourth survey of Argentina’s ERTs carried out by the Facultad Abierta. This survey focused on ERTs that emerged between March 2010 and December 2013, providing the most complete and up-to-date database of the characteristics of Argentina’s ERTs, and showing evidence of a wave of new worker-recuperated enterprises emerging in the postcrisis years, especially since 2010. The key findings presented in this article include: the political economic reasons for the emergence of ERTs; the characteristics of the growing ERT movement today as compared to earlier ERTs; the nature of the conflicts and issues leading to the creation of Argentina’s new ERTs; a critical analysis of new legal frameworks for ERT firms, comparing and contrasting them to older legal outlets for their formation; and the involvement of unions with Argentina’s ERTs.
J53|The Italian Road to Creating Worker Cooperatives from Worker Buyouts: Italy�s Worker-Recuperated Enterprises and the Legge Marcora Framework|This paper highlights the first phase of a research program, completed in late 2014 and early 2015 that homes in on worker-recuperated enterprises (imprese recuperate dai lavoratori) in Italy. The paper specifically focuses on Italy�s worker buyouts (WBOs) facilitated by its Legge Marcora (Marcora Law) framework�the form of worker-recuperated enterprises predominating in Italy. The paper first offers a definition of WBOs as a subset of workerrecuperate enterprises. It also reviews the most common scenarios from which WBOs emerge globally. It then overviews Italy�s Legge Marcora�s legal and financial framework, and situates the emergence of WBOs since the early 1980s as direct responses to market failure, business closures, rising unemployment, and, with the most recent WBOs, coinciding with the Great Recession and subsequent austerity measures that continue to negatively impact the country. The paper then discusses key findings from our research on WBO creation in Italy, touching on their most salient demographic and geographic particularities. Throughout the paper distinguishes Italy�s WBOs as exemplar because of their resilience in times of crisis, and the inclusion of multiple stakeholders in its WBO framework, namely: workers, the cooperative sector, and the state.
J53|The Dynamic Effects of Works Councils on Labour Productivity: First Evidence from Panel Data|We estimate dynamic effects of works councils on labor productivity using newly available information from West German establishment panel data. Conditioning on plant fixed effects and control variables, we find negative productivity effects during the first five years after council introduction, but a steady and substantial increase in the councils' productivity effect thereafter. Given the frequently reported positive correlation between council existence and plant productivity, this finding supports causal interpretations.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J53|Betriebsratswahlen 2014: Ein Rückblick auf Basis der IW-Betriebsratswahlbefragung|Betriebsräte sind ein zentrales Kennzeichen der industriellen Beziehungen hierzulande. Regulär werden sie alle vier Jahre zwischen März und Mai neu gewählt – zuletzt 2014. Eine Analyse der Betriebsratswahlen 2014 zeigt, dass sie in den Belegschaften der Betriebe, in denen ein Betriebsrat existiert, auf ein breites Echo gestoßen sind. Die Wahlbeteiligung lag bei knapp 77 Prozent. In drei von zehn Betriebsräten sind mehr oder weniger Interessenvertreter von ihrer beruflichen Tätigkeit freigestellt als vom Betriebsverfassungsgesetz eigentlich vorgesehen. Diese tolerierten Abweichungen können auch als Beleg für die Vertrauenskultur zwischen Belegschaft und Geschäftsführung gedeutet werden. Frauen haben im Durchschnitt ein Viertel der Mandate errungen. Der gewerkschaftliche Organisationsgrad der Betriebsräte liegt im Durchschnitt bei knapp 64 Prozent. Bei der Wahl ihres Vorsitzenden setzen die Betriebsräte wie in den Jahren zuvor auf Erfahrung und Kontinuität. Auch hier setzt sich überproportional häufig ein Gewerkschaftsmitglied durch.
J53|Strukturwandel des Arbeitskampfs: Deutschland im OECD-Ländervergleich|Mit jahresdurchschnittlich drei Ausfalltagen je 1.000 Beschäftigten gehört Deutschland nach wie vor zu den OECD-Ländern mit den stabilsten Arbeitsbeziehungen. Im Vereinigten Königreich fielen seit 2010 im Durchschnitt 26 Tage pro Jahr aus, in Frankreich 139 Tage. Dass im Ausland mehr gestreikt wird, hängt auch mit den politischen Massenstreiks zusammen, die im Zuge der Wirtschafts- und Finanzkrise zugenommen haben. In Deutschland ging die Krise nur mit wenigen Ausfalltagen einher, Regierung und Gewerkschaften näherten sich sogar wieder an. Insgesamt hat sich das Streikgeschehen hierzulande in den Dienstleistungssektor verlagert. Seit 2005 entfallen mehr als drei Viertel aller arbeitskampfbedingten Arbeitsausfälle auf den tertiären Sektor. Mit dieser Tertiarisierung des Streiks ist auch die Anzahl der Streikenden je bestreikten Betrieb von 583 (1995/1999) auf 64 (2010/2014) zurückgegangen. Dafür nahm die Streikdauer von durchschnittlich 0,9 Tagen auf 2,8 Tage zu.
J53|Kompetenz, Selbstwirksamkeitserwartung und die Rolle von Vorbildern in der Ordnungsethik (The Importance of Moral Competence, Self-efficacy and Role Models for Order Ethics)|Nach der zentralen Forderung der Ordnungsethik muessen moralische Normen durch formale und informelle Institutionen, die moralisches Handeln anreizkompatibel machen, implementiert werden. Als eine minimale (normative) Bedingung muessen diese Institutionen in der Lage sein, den homo oeconomicus zu motivieren. Aber auch wenn eine Institution diese Bedingung erfuellt, wird sie nur diejenigen realen Personen zum moralischen Handeln motivieren, die ueber die relevanten Kompetenzen und Selbstwirksamkeitsueberzeugungen verfuegen. An dieser Stelle kann die angewandte Ordnungsethik auf Befunde aus der Psychologie und der experimentellen oekonomik zurueckgreifen. Man kann zeigen, dass Vorbilder Selbstwirksamkeitsueberzeugungen stuetzen koennen und somit aus Sicht der Ordnungsethik wichtiger sind, als deren Vertreter traditioneller Weise annehmen. (According to the order ethics approach to business ethics, moral rules must be implemented by formal and informal institutions, which provide incentives for acting morally. As a minimal (normative) condition, these institutions must be able to motivate the homo economicus. But even if an institution passes this test, it will only motivate actual people (i.e. the homo psychologicus) to follow moral rules, if they have the relevant competences and self-efficacy beliefs. At this point applied order ethics can draw on findings of psychology and experimental economics. It turns out, that role models can support self-efficacy beliefs and are thus more important for order ethics than has traditionally been assumed.)
J53|Zur Bedeutung der Experimentellen Wirtschaftsforschung fuer die Wirtschaftsethik – Dargestellt an Beitraegen zur Korruptionsforschung (On the Relevance of Experimental Economics Research for Business Ethics: Illustrated with Contributions on Corruption Research)|Die experimentelle Wirtschaftsforschung kann eingesetzt werden, um kausale Einflussfaktoren von Verhalten unter kontrollierten Rahmenbedingungen zu identifizieren. Insbesondere ermoeglicht sie Einsichten ueber Verhaltenstendenzen in moralischen Dilemmata wie z. B. Situationen, in denen Korruption moeglich ist. Anhand des Beispiels der Korruptionsforschung beleuchtet der Beitrag, wie experimentelle Studien zur Verbesserung des Verstaendnisses von moralischen Intuitionen und zur Gestaltung von Rahmenbedingungen fuer ethisches Handeln in der Wirtschaft genutzt werden koennen. (Experimental economics can be used to identify causal influences on behavior under controlled conditions. In particular it enables insights into behavioral tendencies in moral dilemmas, such as situations in which corruption is possible. By the example of research on corruption the paper sheds light on how experimental studies can be employed to gain a better understanding of moral intuitions and to design frameworks for ethical conduct in business.)
J53|Individuelles Verhalten und gerechte Strukturen – Grenzen einer verhaltensoekonomisch fundierten Wirtschaftsethik (Individual Behavior and Just Structures. The Limitations of Behavioral Business Ethics)|Der Verhaltensoekonomik wird das Potenzial zugeschrieben, Erkenntnisse ueber moralisches Verhalten und Gerechtigkeitsvorstellungen durch Beruecksichtigung von psychologischen und verhaltenswissenschaftlichen Faktoren in wirtschaftlichen, aber auch gesellschaftlichen Kontexten zu generieren. Dieses Potenzial der Verhaltensoekonomik fuer den gesellschaftlichen Kontext wird im vorliegenden Text kritisch hinterfragt. Es wird argumentiert, dass die Verhaltensoekonomik nur wenig zur Ausgestaltung sozialpolitischer Arrangements und somit zur Weiterentwicklung einer Sozialstaatsethik beitragen kann, da sie aufgrund ihrer Fokussierung auf individuelles Verhalten die strukturellen Probleme hinsichtlich der Gestaltung gesellschaftlicher Institutionen nicht in den Blick nimmt. (Behavioral economics is said to have the potential to provide insight about moral behavior and justice principles by including psychological and behavioral factors to the economic and social analysis. This potential of behavioral economics is critically challenged in this text. It is argued that the contribution to the further development of ethical considerations and social policy is very limited since behavioral economics analyzes exclusively individual behavior and therefore does not account for the struc-tural problems regarding the arrangement of social institutions.)
J53|Zum systematischen Verhaeltnis von Ordnungsethik und Verhaltensoekonomik (The Systematic Relationship between Ethics of Institutional Order and Behavioral Economics)|Die Arbeit zielt auf die Begruendung eines komplementaeren Verhaeltnisses einer voraussetzungsaermeren Ordnungsethik und der Verhaltensoekonomik ab. Dabei zeigt sie erstens, inwiefern der Rekurs auf ein bestimmtes Homo-Oeconomicus-Modell als Zurechnungsschema (Heuristik) zu einer methodologisch dysfunktionalen Modellbildung fuehrt, zweitens die zentralste Argumentationsfigur der Ordnungsethik nicht nur auf ein empirisch pruefbares, sondern sehr restriktives HO-Modell angewiesen ist, drittens eine parallel auch verwendete Begruendung fuer die Verwendung eines restriktiven HO-Modells auf einem logischen Zirkelargument basiert und viertens die ordnungsethische Grundidee ein Potentialitaetsargument zugrunde legt, dessen Schlagkraft im Lichte verhaltensoekonomischer Erkenntnisse sehr begrenzt ist. (This paper provides a new line of reasoning for a complementary relationship between a less requiring Ethics of Institutional Order and Behavioral Economics. Firstly, it shows how the understanding of a specific homo-oeconomicus-model as a heuristic rule leads to methodologically dysfunctional modelling. Secondly, it stresses how a central argument of Ethics of Institutional Order requires an empirically testable and very restrictive homo-oeconomicus-model. Thirdly, it reveals the use of a circular argument for a different but widely accepted reasoning for the use of a restrictive homo-oeconomicus-model. With evidence from Behavioral Economics, it fourthly undermines the justification of an excessive application of Ethics of Institutional Order.)

On the Morality of Dispositions and Institutions)|Dieser Beitrag bestimmt das Verhaeltnis zwischen Verhaltensoekonomik und Ordnungsethik. Er entwickelt in acht Thesen das Argument, dass ein methodisch reflektiertes Homo Oeconomicus-Modell unverzichtbar wichtige Beitraege zu Forschung und Lehre zu leisten vermag: zur Erforschung der situativen Stabilitaetsbedingungen moralischer Dispositionen ebenso wie zur Ausbildung gesellschaftlicher Fuehrungskraefte. Aus ordnungsethischer Sicht wird der Verhaltensoekonomik empfohlen, sich staerker institutionentheoretisch sowie insbesondere organisationstheoretisch auszurichten. (This paper elaborates on the relationship between behavioral economics and order ethics. We argue that a methodologically reflected concept of homo oeconomicus can contribute a great deal to both academic research and teaching: It can improve our understanding of the stability conditions of moral dispositions and can inform societal leadership. From the perspective of order ethics, the paper recommends behavioral economics to focus more on the analysis of institutions, especially in the context of organizations.)
J53|Moral Action / Moral Behavior. ueber existentielle Initiativen – Zur Phaenomenologie der Moralitaet im oekonomischen Raum (Moral Action / Moral Behavior. The Phenomenology of Morals in the Economic Space)|Im folgenden Beitrag wird Moral als konsensueller Prozess im sozialen Geschehen betrachtet. Moral wird in Form assertorischer Aussagen vorgetragen, denn wer will, dass sich alle moralisch verhalten, will nicht alleine dastehen. Wer traut sich (wann?), moralisch aufzutreten? Die folgende Eroerterung stellt auf das Personal der Moral, also wer bereit ist, zu welchen Bedingungen moralisch zu handeln, ab. Moral ist aktivierbar, die Konstellation muss stimmen, aber vor allem braucht sie Moral Entrepreneurs. (The paper at hand focuses on morality as a consensual process of the social activity of others. Morality is presented in an assertoric manner in order to urge others behaving morally as well. No one wants to stand alone. Who dares (when?) to act morally? The following discussion sheds light on the personal of morality. Who is willing to act morally under which conditions? Morality can be activated but it needs the right framework conditions. Above all, moral entrepreneurs are needed.)
J53|Moralische Charakterbildung, Leadership Excellence und Corporate Character (Moral Character Formation, Leadership Excellence and Corporate Character)|In der Tradition der europaeischen Unternehmensethik ist der Charakter der Akteure ein grundlegender und alles dominierender Zurechnungsmodus fuer tugendhaftes Handeln. Die psychologische und voelkerkundliche Diskussion einer „Charakterkunde“ in der zweiten Haelfte des 19. Jahrhunderts hat diese Tradition vor allem in Deutschland durch nationalsozialistische und antisemitische Interpretationen desavouiert. Aber es gibt noch einen weiteren, aus theoretischer Sicht entscheidenderen Grund fuer den Traditionsbruch. Aristoteles theoretische Diskussion der ethischen Tugenden und die Praxis des „Ehrbaren Kaufmanns“ lassen hier wenig Zweifel. In funktional differenzierten Gesellschaften ist Charakter ein schwieriger Begriff, weil er sich nicht mehr auf den Status von Buergern, sondern als Forderung nach Integritaet als offener Rechtsbegriff auf Funktionstraeger bezieht. Der Artikel diskutiert vor diesem Hintergrund und mit der Linse der Governanceethik die mit den psychologischen Verhaltenswissenschaften und der experimentellen oekonomik gegebenen Optionen eines strukturalistischen Charakterbegriffs, der sich als Einheit der Differenz von Individuum, Organisation und Gesellschaft begreift und damit auch die Qualitaet von Fuehrungskraeften definiert. (In the tradition of European business ethics the character of the actors is a fundamental and dominant mode for the attribution of virtuous action. The psychological and ethnological discussion of a “science of character” in the second half of the 19th century brought this tradition into bad repute, above all in Germany as a result of the National Socialist and anti-Semitic interpretations. But there is a further reason for this break with tradition, which is decisive from a theoretical point of view. Aristotle's theoretical discussion of the ethical virtues and the practice of the “honourable merchant” allow little doubt about this. In functionally differentiated societies character is a difficult concept because it no longer refers to the status of citizens but is an open legal concept demanding integrity from functionaries. Against this background the article discusses the options for a structuralist concept of character provided by the psychological behavioural sciences and experimental economics as seen through the lens of Governance Ethics.)
J53|Learning from learning networks. Experiences of the Finnish Workplace Development Programme|This paper examines the feasibility of a learning networks-based strategy to improve the ability of publicly supported workplace development programmes to produce broad-based and long-term learning effects in working life. After looking at typical shortcomings of programmes based on the utilisation of demonstration projects, critical prerequisites of an alternative strategy based on the utilisation of learning networks are explored. The empirical part of the paper makes an analysis of five learning network projects funded by the Finnish Workplace Development Programme TYKES (2004-10). The analysis shows that of three levels of developmental learning, the networks succeeded best at the level of local sustainability, whereas their results concerning external generativity fell short of the aim. At the end reasons for that are discussed.
J53|Power and contexts: Some societal conditions for organisational action research – Clashes between economic-management and pedagogic-social discourses|Based on action research co-operation with a team of teachers at a Social and Healthcare College in Denmark 2012-2013, the article raises the question: What are the conditions for organisational action research projects in a neoliberal context? The article has three purposes. Firstly, we want to show that mapping and delimitating relevant contexts are critical in an organisational AR project, because it is always arbitrary what you delimit as your field of inquiry, initially. The consequences of ignoring this in the project described were fatal. Secondly, the article draws attention to clashes between two societal Discourses: an economic-management Discourse versus a pedagogic-social Discourse. Unfortunately, we were not aware of the strength and the extent of the economic-management Discourse before it was too late. Thirdly, the article speaks in favor of continuous context inquiring dialogues with immediate and additional stakeholders questioning, among others, if the action research project is practicable at all.
J53|Prekaere Demokratie? Zu den Auswirkungen atypischer Beschaeftigung auf die betriebliche Mitbestimmung (Precarious democracy? The effects of atypical employment on plant-level co-determination)|Die demokratische Mitbestimmung von Arbeitnehmern entwickelte sich in der zweiten Haelfte des 20. Jahrhunderts fast durchweg positiv. Das zeigte sich, wie T.H. Marshall dargelegt hat, insbesondere in der Zunahme ihrer Staatsbuergerrechte. Im vorliegenden Text wird jedoch gezeigt, dass diese positive Entwicklung seit Ende des 20. Jahrhunderts entscheidenden Veraenderungen unterworfen ist. Die politische Konstellation der Postdemokratie laesst sich auch fuer das Feld der Industriellen Beziehungen und konkret fuer die Entwicklung der Mitbestimmung analysieren. Zwar bleiben die Ausdifferenzierungen und Institutionen der Staatsbuergerrechte von Arbeitnehmern formal stabil. Aber durch die Zunahme von prekaerer Beschaeftigung werden die Staatsbuergerrechte neu stratifiziert. Anhand empirischer Untersuchungen der Leiharbeit und einer Fallstudie zum Einsatz von Werkvertraegen wird gezeigt, wie Leiharbeiter und Werkvertragsnehmer mitunter gravierenden staatsbuergerlichen Defiziten im Vergleich zu Stammbeschaeftigen in einem Normalarbeitsverhaeltnis unterliegen und dadurch die betriebliche Mitbestimmung von innen erodiert. (Democratic employee participation has improved during the second half of the 20th century. According to T.H. Marshall, the increase of civil, political and social rights is a clear indicator for this development. In this paper we argue that fundamental changes have taken place since the end of the 20th century. The political constellation of post-democracy is currently shaping industrial relations and the area of co-determination in particular. Formally the differentiation of rights and their institutions remain robust, but the increase in precarious employment is leading to a new stratification as our empirical research on temporary work and contract work in their corporate contexts indicates. Here, temporary and contract workers are confronted with serious deficits in civil rights compared to the permanent workforce – endangering co-determination from the inside.)

Die dieses Schwerpunktheftes spiegeln sowohl die inhaltliche als auch die methodische Heterogenitaet der aktuellen Diskussion wider. Sie differenzieren und erweitern den Informationsstand ueber einzelne Formen und deren Folgen (vor allem von Minijobs und Leiharbeit) sowie ueber die sowohl kurz- als auch langfristigen Probleme, welche mehreren Formen gemeinsam sind (z. B. Qualifikationsrisiken, geringe Chancen der Aufwaertsmobilitaet).
J53|Gewerkschaften zwischen Konkurrenz und Kooperation? Inter-organisationale Beziehungen in der Facility Services-Branche (Unions between competition and cooperation? Inter-organizational relations in facility services)|Der Aufsatz untersucht qualitativ-explorativ, auf welche Weise sich netzwerkfoermige Wertschoepfung und Mehr-Arbeitgeber-Beziehungen in der Facility Services-Branche auf die inter-gewerkschaftlichen Beziehungen auswirken. Mit Hilfe eines strukturationstheoretisch inspirierten Ansatzes identifizieren wir insbesondere drei zentrale Praktiken der Gewerkschaften, um Inter-Gewerkschaftsbeziehungen zu bearbeiten, und zwar die Domaenenabgrenzung, die Ressourcenakkumulation sowie die tarifpolitische Regelsetzung. Mit Hilfe von drei Fallstudien ueber Unternehmen der Facility Services-Branche koennen wir aufzeigen, dass die Gewerkschaften insbesondere dann einem kompetitiven Muster folgen, wenn die Praxis der tarifpolitischen Regelsetzung zwischen den Gewerkschaften staerker abweicht und die bisherigen Praktiken der Domaenenabgrenzung sowie der Ressourcenakkumulation fortgesetzt werden. (This paper explores how value creation networks and multi-employer relationships in facility services affect inter-union relations. Building on an approach that is inspired by structuration theory we identify three central practices that unions deploy to shape their inter-union relations, i.e. defining jurisdictions, accumulating resources and collective bargaining. Empirically, we focus on three company case studies that shed light on the practices unions deploy to shape their relationships in the field of facility services. Our qualitative material reveals that unions enact a competitive pattern of these practices if the collective bargaining approaches diverge between the single unions involved and if the traditional practices of defining jurisdictions and accumulating organizational resources are deployed.)
J53|Der Beitrag der Arbeitnehmervertreter zur fachlichen und geschlechtlichen Diversitaet von Aufsichtsraeten: Erkenntnisse einer qualitativ-explorativen Analyse (Worker directors and supervisory board diversity: Results from a qualitative explorative analysis)|Die Rolle der Arbeitnehmervertreter im Aufsichtsrat wurde vielfach untersucht, sowohl theoretisch als auch empirisch. Studien zu den Effekten der Unternehmensmitbestimmung betrachten die Arbeitnehmervertreter im Aufsichtsrat dabei haeufig als „homogene Bank“ und ruecken deren Rolle als Sachwalter der Arbeitnehmerinteressen in den Mittelpunkt. In unserer Studie hingegen fokussieren wir auf die diversitaetserhoehende Funktion der Arbeitnehmervertreter und werfen damit ein neues Schlaglicht auf die Aufsichtsratsmitbestimmung. Basis unserer auf die Perspektive der Betroffenen ausgerichteten qualitativ-explorativen Untersuchung sind dreizehn leitfadengestuetzte Interviews. Unsere Ergebnisse stuetzen die Einschaetzung, dass Arbeitnehmervertreter in Aufsichtsraeten die im Aufsichtsrat vertretenen Perspektiven erweitern und die Aufsichtsratsarbeit bereichern koennen, indem sie (a) die Wissensbasis im Aufsichtsrat verbreitern und (b) die geschlechtliche Diversitaet von Aufsichtsraeten erhoehen. (The role of worker directors on German supervisory boards has repeatedly been studied, both theoretically and empirically. However, studies that analyze the effects of codetermination on supervisory boards often regard employee representatives as a “homogeneous bench” and focus on their role as intermediaries between employee and owner interests. In our study, we focus on the contribution of employee representatives to board diversity, and hence shed new light on the effects of supervisory board codetermination. In our qualitative explorative study, based on thirteen semi-structured interviews, we take the perspective of the parties involved. The results of our study support the view that employee representatives on supervisory boards can fruitfully enhance board diversity and widen their perspectives by (a) increasing the knowledge resources of the board and by (b) making boards more gender balanced.)
J53|Zwischen Instrumentalisierung und Bedeutungslosigkeit. Mitarbeiter-Partizipation im organisationalen Kontext in Mittel- und Osteuropa|Im vorliegenden Band behandeln renommierte Autoren aus dem Bereich der Sozial- und Managementwissenschaften in deutsch- und englischsprachigen Beitraegen das Thema der Partizipation in Organisationen in gleichermassen konzeptueller wie empirischer Sicht. Waehrend sich die eher konzeptuell gehaltenen Beitraege dem Begriff und der Semantik der Partizipation sowie prominenten betrieblichen Partizipationspraktiken eher skeptisch naehern, widmen sich die staerker empirisch argumentierenden Beitraege der Vermessung und Beschreibung von Stand und Entwicklung der Institutionen und Praktiken der betrieblichen Partizipation in mittel- und osteuropaeischen Transformationslaendern. Waehrend im konzeptuellen Teil neben der betrieblichen Partizipation auch generelle gesellschaftliche Aspekte der Partizipation sowie der Bereich der Wissenschaft untersucht werden, fokussieren sich die empirischen Arbeiten auf die betriebliche Partizipation und ruecken dabei Transfer und Verbreitung verschiedener Partizipationsmodelle wie partizipative Fuehrung, Mitarbeitergesellschaften oder Arbeitnehmervertretungen ins Zentrum ihres Interesses. Und waehrend die konzeptuellen Beitraege tendenziell den Aspekt der Instrumentalisierung der Partizipation hervorheben, arbeiten die empirischen Beitraege eher ihre relative Bedeutungslosigkeit in den Laendern Mittel- und Osteuropas heraus. Der Band bietet auf diese Weise einem akademischen ebenso wie einem praktisch interessierten Publikum wichtige konzeptuelle und empirische Er-kenntnisse zur Rolle, zu Grenzen und Loesungsansaetzen von partizipativen Strukturen und Instrumenten im Kontext der Restrukturierung von Arbeit, Personal und Organisation im Transformationsprozess.
J53|How the EU’s Eastern Enlargement Changed the German Productive Model. The Case of the Automotive industry|What impact did the Eastern Enlargement of the European Union have on the productive models and labor relations in the German automotive industry? Did it lead to a “race to the bottom” and “social dumping”? This article examines the evolution of value chains and product strategies as well as the development of employment and labor relations in the German automotive industry and discusses the hypotheses of “dualization” or “disintegration.” It is based on case studies of automobile manufacturers and suppliers as well as on statistical data about employment, foreign trade, and foreign direct investment. The analysis shows that the use of low-cost locations in CEE allowed German automotive companies to strengthen their focus on high-quality products without losing their price competitiveness. German companies have used relocation threats to demand labor cost reductions and higher flexibility on working times and employment (i.e., the use of agency work) in their home country locations. These demands, however, did not go as far as to break the governance compromises in the German automotive industry. The metalworking union and the works councils still remain strong enough to reach compromises that guarantee employment security in exchange for higher flexibility and that set limits on the use of precarious employment forms.
J53|Labor Process and the Social Structure of Accumulation in China1|Inspired by the interplay between social structure of accumulation theory and labor process theory, this paper is to specify the particular mechanism that labor institutions take in accomplishing Chinaâ€™s rapid capital accumulation in the reform era. The paper starts by proposing a framework to understand the relation among overtime work, labor process, and the wage gap and presents the puzzling contradiction between low wages and the need to sustain the reproduction of labor power for Chinese workers. The paper then details the bi-directional determination between the subordination of labor in the workplace and the wage gap, and further analyzes the critical conditions for the stability of the current labor institutions and sustaining capital accumulation.
J53|Вовлеченность работников и система социально-трудовых отношений . Involvement of employees and the system of social and labor relations |В условиях глобализирующейся экономики, быстрого распространения знаний и технологий повышается роль и значимость работников. Успех предприятия во многом определяется степенью их вовлеченности. Повысить конкурентоспособность товаров и услуг и победить в конкурентной борьбе возможно только на основе использования современных методов управления. А они предполагают тотальную вовлеченность работников в процессы улучшения организации. Существуют различные представления о том, что ведет к повышению заинтересованности работников в результатах своего труда и в деятельности предприятия в целом. Как правило, исследователями изучается влияние одного или нескольких факторов на проблему. Данная статья имеет целью подчеркнуть, что вовлеченность работников – это системная проблема, обосновать идею о том, что система социально-трудовых отношений (СТО), как система согласования интересов всех участников СТО, является мощным организационным ресурсом для развития вовлеченности работников в процессы улучшения организации, а также предложить новый метод системной оценки СТО с акцентом на обратных связях, что позволит оценить гармоничность системы СТО и, как следствие, ее эффективность с позиции системного подхода, т. е. с учетом согласованности целей системы СТО и организации, временных процессов и обратных связей. In the conditions of a globalizing economy, with the rapid dissemination of knowledge and technologies, the role and importance of employees is increased. A company's success is largely deter- mined by the degree of their involvement. To improve the competitiveness of goods and services and to win in the competition, it is necessary to use modern management methods, which assume total involvement of employees in the process of improving the organization. Ideas vary about what leads to increased interest of employees in the results of their work and the activities of the enterprise as a whole. Typically, researchers have studied the effects of one or more factors on participation. This paper aims to (1) emphasize that the involvement of employees is a systemic problem, (2) suggest that a system of labor relations, as a system for coordinating the interests of all participants, is a powerful organizational resource for the development of employee involvement in improving the organization, and (3) propose a new method for systemic evaluation of social and labor relations with an emphasis on feedback. The proposed method permits evaluating the harmony of the system of social and labor relations and, consequently, its effectiveness from the perspective of a systemic approach, i.e. taking into account coherence of the objectives of the system of social and labor relations and organization, temporal processes, and feedback.

J53|An Opinion on Strategic Directions for an Economy in the Capitalist Periphery: The Case of India|This paper is based on sixteen years of intensive examination and research into three Industrial Sectors (manufacturing, process and technology) of Western India and all observations contained herein are born out of and relate directly to those sectors. The premise upon which we stand is that if business ethics and corporate governance co-exists then with proper HR interventions a value centred corporate culture will very likely emerges and the journey towards achieving organisational excellence becomes that much easier. In the postgraduate textbook entitled Organisational Excellence through Business Ethics and Corporate Governance the authors had begun by defining ethics and stating that ethics was the precondition for generating value centred corporate cultures? They then delved deep into what ethics entrails and how it impacts the organisation as well as the individual within it. Thereafter they went in to the concept of Corporate Governance, defined it, viewed how it developed, examined how it was practiced overseas and then how it came to India. In this paper the authors attempt to show how good governance is based on ethics and how those who head the functions of People Management, Company Secretary, and Accountancy (cost and chartered) can gainfully use it for realising the larger interest of the organisations they belong to. To that extent, this paper is just what the title suggests: an opinion on the subject based on ongoing research.
J53|Works Councils and Collective Bargaining in Germany: A Simple but Crucial Theoretical Extension|A model by Huebler and Jirjahn (2003) suggests that rent-seeking activities of works councils are more limited in establishments covered by collective bargaining. The model predicts that works councils should have a stronger productivity effect and a weaker wage effect in covered than in uncovered establishments. While empirical studies have provided supporting evidence for the predicted productivity effects, the results on the wage effects of works councils in covered and uncovered establishments are very mixed. This article extends Huebler and Jirjahn’s model to reconcile the empirical findings. The extended model takes into account that collective bargaining coverage not only limits the opportunities for rent-seeking activities but also strengthens the effectiveness of performance-enhancing work practices negotiated between employers and works councils. The latter influence of collective bargaining coverage can result in a higher wage effect of works councils in covered establishments.
J53|The Effect of Labour Relations Laws on Union Density Rates: Evidence from Canadian Provinces|We provide evidence on the potential for reforms in labour law to reverse deunionization trends by relating an index of the favorability to unions of Canadian provincial labour relations statutes to changes in provincial union density rates between 1981 and 2012. The results suggest that shifting every provinceâ€™s 2012 legal regime to the most union-friendly possible could raise the national union density by up to 7 percentage points in the long run. This effect appears driven by regulations related to the certification of new bargaining units, the negotiation of first contracts and the recruitment of replacement workers. The effects of reform are largest for women, particularly university-educated women employed as professionals in public services. Overall, the results suggest a limited potential for labour relations reforms to address growing concerns about labour market inequality.
J53|Long-term consequences of an innovative redundancy-retraining project: The Austrian Steel Foundation|In the late 1980s privatization and down-sizing of nationalized steel mills and related firms in the metal industry have lead to large-scale redundancy plans. A special Steel Foundation was created as part of a social plan. This foundation acted like an independent training center, where displaced workers would spend relatively long training periods (sometimes several years), obtaining personality and orientation training, as well as formal education. The last step of the integrative program was placement assistance as well as assistance for creating one’s own business. The foundation was financed by (higher) contributions from unemployment insurance funds, by the previous firms themselves, as well as by a collectively-bargained special tax on the remaining workers in the steel firms. Moreover the trainees themselves would have to support the foundation by giving up the interest accruing to their redundancy payments. I use combined data from Austrian social security records and from the Employment Service to look at participation decisions and on post-foundation economic performance, i.e. days worked and wage growth. As a control group I take all displaced workers from the firms who formed the foundation, using Instrumental Variables to solve the selection problem. The results show considerable wage gains - even for a period of five years after leaving the Foundation - as well as improved employment prospects. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis is performed to assess the long-term success of the Foundation.
J53|Works councils in family businesses in Germany: Why are there so few?|Works councils are an inherent part of the German economic and social system. An analysis of the prevalence of works councils in Germany reveals that they are not uniformly distributed across all types of businesses. Works councils occur less frequently in owner-managed businesses - regardless of their size - than in companies run by employed managers. The reasons for this low prevalence are still largely unknown as there has been practically no discussion of this phenomenon in the literature so far. This paper delivers first answers to this question by conducting an exploratory study. Based on a literature analysis and an empirical analysis of a secondary dataset, we found some explanations why works councils are so rarely established in family businesses. These explanations refer to special characteristics of the owner-manager (i. e. eagerness for independence) as well as to special characteristics of family businesses as a whole (i. e. performance and organizational changes).
J53|Relative deprivation and labour conflict during Spain’s industrialization: the Bilbao estuary, 1914–1936|What drove social conflict in Spain’s industrial areas in the period before the Spanish Civil War? This paper is concerned with contrasting the determinants of working-class conflict in northern Spain at the beginning of the twentieth century. Our hypothesis is that the key determinant of conflicts in emerging industrial areas during the interwar period was the struggle to obtain satisfactory family income in a context of combined high price fluctuation, unemployment and economic boom and bust. We suggest two new ways to decipher how economic factors interact with labour conflict. We introduce the family as the relevant income unit when considering wage struggles and relative deprivation. And secondly, we study the reactions to short-term variations of income on families by using monthly rather than quarterly or annual data.
J53|Managing The Human Resources In Beer Industry| The human resources’ management in business systems comprises a selection of goals, a policy determination, as well as planning, organizing, coordination and control of activities in the field of human resources, by taking over the management actions, in order to achieve the selected goals and to realize the purpose of the management function, as a sub-system of an organization’s operation. The basic tasks of the human resources management are: planning, knowledge managing, improvement of work process and quality, control and evaluation of achievements. The paper’s goal is to point out to a significance, which it has for its successful business, according to an analysis and description of the most important activities of the human resources’ management, as theoretically, as well as practically, in a concrete business system.
J53|Farmers’ Management Capacities As A Success Factor In Agriculture: A Review| Farms operating under more or less similar environmental and socio-economic conditions often reflect significant differences in production and economic results they achieve. Such differences are most commonly attributed to: biological factors, the level of specialization, the intensity of production, the size of farms and/or implemented production practice, etc. It is considered that the differences in achieved results, that is, the success of a farm can be, to a large extent, explained by variations in farmers’ management capacities. Management capacities can be defined as possession of appropriate personal characteristics and capabilities of farmers (managers) to cope with specific problems and opportunities at the right time and in the right way. With the changes taking place within the modern agricultural production, it is becoming more and more difficult to maintain competitive advantages, thus the farmers are progressively confronted with the requirements for certain management capacities which will enable them to take advantage of the existing conditions in the best possible way, i.e. to choose and implement the optimal production practice. As the management capacities are rarely explicitly defined and quantified, particularly when it comes to agricultural producers, the aim of this study is to provide a review of the previous research in this field while highlighting the significance of these issues.
J53|Diffusion and outlook of firm-level bargaining in Italy|The article surveys the main actions, either defined by social partners or by government intervention, which have attempted to encourage firm-level bargaining decentralization in recent years. The overall structure and the relative importance of different levels of bargaining have not however been modified by the many innovations introduced. Empirical evidence shows that firm-level bargaining has been associated with innovative managerial practices, but also that a significant share of firms would be willing to sign contracts that would grant higher wages or preserve occupational levels in order to obtain higher flexibility in the use of the workforce. Uncertainty in the application of laws and contracts can make it harder to reach such deals.
J53|Variable Pay, Industrial Relations and Foreign Ownership: Evidence from Germany| We use a representative sample of German establishments to show that those with foreign ownership are more likely to use performance appraisal, profit-sharing and employee share ownership than those with domestic ownership. Moreover, we show that works councils are associated with an increased probability of using each of the three practices when under domestic ownership but not when under foreign ownership. These results inform the ongoing debate over institutional duality, the extent to which foreign firms adopt uniform practices independent of local institutions, and the extent to which they adapt and participate in those local institutions.
J53|Les délégués syndicaux sont-ils discriminés ?|This paper offers the first estimate of union representatives’ wages and discusses its possible interpretations. After recalling the French institutional context in terms of collective bargaining, we clarify the theoretical specificities of the strategic interaction occurring between employers and union representatives during the bargaining process. We discuss the reasons why it may be rational for an employer to discriminate against union representatives. Using employer-employee data and an original econometric strategy, we then estimate that, under plausible assumptions, union representatives’ wages are on average 10 % lower than that of their unionized and non-unionized coworkers. Several tests suggest that this wage gap may indeed reflect discrimination against union representatives. This interpretation is consistent with the representatives’ opinions : almost half of them feels discriminated against, and this proportion varies with the representatives’ observable characteristics similarly to their wage penalty.

J53|Works Councils: An Agency Perspective|Este artículo estudia el papel que juegan los comités de empresa (o works councils europeos) en la toma de decisiones de la empresa. El trabajo utiliza un modelo de teoría de la agencia donde los representantes laborales deben monitorear la información prevista por los gerentes de las empresas, procurando mejorar el bienestar de los trabajadores a quienes representan. Sin embargo, los representantes son estudiados como agentes económicos independientes quienes pueden perseguir intereses privados, no necesariamente alienados con los intereses de la fuerza laboral de la empresa. El modelo inicialmente considera que los trabajadores pueden dar incentivos monetarios a los representantes, contingentes a los resultados de su actividad. Para poder eliminar cualquier intención de coalición entre representantes y gerentes, los trabajadores deben pagar altos valores monetarios a sus representantes, haciendo que el bienestar de los trabajadores se disminuya. En segundo lugar, el modelo utiliza un mecanismo más real de alinear a los representantes e introduce un modelo de elecciones al final del periodo. Esta estructura del modelo introduce un trade-off intertemporal a los representantes entre aceptar transferencias de una coalición con los gerentes en el primer periodo y perder las rentas de estar en el puesto de representantes en un segundo periodo. Las elecciones incrementan el costo de entrar en coaliciones con los gerentes y permiten alinear más fácilmente los intereses de los representantes con el de los trabajadores.
J53|Employee Satisfaction, Labor Market Flexibility, and Stock Returns Around The World|"We study the relationship between employee satisfaction and abnormal stock returns around the world, using lists of the ""Best Companies to Work For"" in 14 countries. We show that employee satisfaction is associated with positive abnormal returns in countries with high labor market flexibility, such as the U.S. and U.K., but not in countries with low labor market flexibility, such as Germany. These results are consistent with high employee satisfaction being a valuable tool for recruitment, retention, and motivation in flexible labor markets, where firms face fewer constraints on hiring and firing. In contrast, in regulated labor markets, legislation already provides minimum standards for worker welfare and so additional expenditure may exhibit diminishing returns. The results have implications for the differential profitability of socially responsible investing (""SRI"") strategies around the world. In particular, they emphasize the importance of taking institutional features into account when forming such strategies."
J53|Gefährdung der Solidarität oder Aufbruch in die Moderne? Die Auswirkungen der Tarifpluralität auf den deutschen Arbeitsmarkt|As a consequence of a ruling of the Federal Labour Court in 2010, the German labour market entered a new regime, allowing multiple unions to operate in the same firm. This alteration has instigated an intense debate about its possible consequences for labour relations. We examine the conceptual and empirical basis for this concern. Our analysis does not lead us to expect an important increase neither in the foundation of occupational unions nor in strike activities. We therefore argue that multi-unionism should be viewed as a natural feature of German industrial relations.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

J53|RBV and the Road to the Control of External Organizations|Although primarily focusing on the internal resource endowment of the firm, RBV has the potential to address the firm’s embeddedness in the business environment as well. At present, RBV research lacks a sound understanding of the development of competitive advantages in industries. A change regarding the unit of analysis, however, allows for considering causes and effects on the micro and the macro level as well. The paper stresses the entrepreneurial dimension of RBV and the firm’s impact on the environment by comparing RBV and RDA reasoning. Using the explanatory power of the isolating mechanisms and applying system dynamic modelling, it turns out that RBV can move into the direction of a ‘New IO’.
J53|Broad-based Employee Stock Options in the U.S.Company Performance and Characteristics|This paper analyses data on 490 companies with broad-based stock option plans, matched to data from CompuStat in order to compare their characteristics and performance to that of other public companies. Major findings are that 1) companies with broad-based plans have higher levels of labor productivity, employment growth, and sales growth than otherwise-similar firms; 2) productivity and profitability levels rise as broad-based plans are adopted, and 3) average compensation levels are higher among such companies both before and after the introduction of broad-based plans, indicating that stock options appear to come on top of other compensation.
J53|German Universities as State-sponsored Co-operatives|Most universities in Germany are public firms but they have many properties of co-operatives. The most important thereof are described and analysed together with the characteristics of state-sponsorship. The real companions of the university as a co-operation are its professors. The same is true for the faculty level, perhaps even more so. However, especially the students are also organised in a co-operative form as are the representatives of all membership groups together. The state is making some crucial reforms that transform this university model or may even destroy it. In any case, the change is slow, painful and open-ended.
J53|The Singularity of the German Doctorate as a Signal for Managerial Talent: Causes, Consequences and Future Developments|The paper focuses on signaling options for managerial talent under different higher education regimes. The educational paths in a sample of top managers of the 100 largest publicly traded companies in the U.S., France and Germany are consistent with our theoretical conjectures. For the singular role of the German doctorate, the traditional chair system in doctoral education and training is essential. The effects of higher education reforms are discussed. In Germany the doctorate is a powerful signal for managerial talent. Future signaling options are closely tied to German higher education reform.

J53|Women in Managerial Positions in Europe: Focus on Germany|"Prejudices and stereotypical beliefs about the role of women in society often limit their chances of reaching top leadership positions. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the socio-economic structure and the gender pay gap in managerial positions in Germany building on a review from a cross-national perspective of women?s progress to high-ranking positions and of initiatives to overcome the ""glass ceiling"". Suggestions are made for improving the situation of women in order to permit more balanced gender participation in the economy, while also promoting national competitiveness and higher levels of wellbeing for the society."
J53|Work Styles, Attitudes, and Productivity of Scientists in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom: A Comparison by Gender|"With scientific research growing increasingly multidisciplinary in nature, team playing and communication skills have become critical in the achievement of scientific breakthroughs. This study adds valuable evidence to the oft-cited ""productivity puzzle"" in the sciences by comparing the work styles, attitudes, and productivity of female and male scientists. The application of t-test analysis to data on scientists from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands indicates that women report relatively higher abilities in communication skills and teamwork than men. Also, both female and male scientists report difficulties in balancing work and family responsibilities, but proportionately more women than men rely on outside sources of childcare. A separate distribution analysis of academic productivity demonstrates substantial overlap between men and women in the number of scientific publications per year. These results add support to mounting pressure for policy reforms that effectively support the retention and advancement of women in the sciences."
J53|Low-skill Work in Flux|This paper addresses the question of how far traditional assumptions about low-skill jobs are still appropriate today. Are we really dealing with activities without any particular skill requirements? How do firms proceed in filling such posts? What role is being played in this respect by ?atypical? employment relationships? The analysis is based on an evaluation of available studies on recruitment problems and low-skill jobs and case studies of recruitment into low-skill jobs in several service industries. There are several indications that job requirements are changing and becoming more differentiated, which would suggest that low-skill work is in a state of flux. Firms adopt a range of different recruitment strategies in order to fill such posts, among which flexible employment relationships and so-called mini-jobs play a role.
J53|Flexibility, Dual Labour Markets, and Temporary Employment. Empirical Evidence from German Establishment Data|The study examines, what forms and instruments firms use to react flexibly to demand-induced output fluctuations, and, if they are used in a complementary or substitutable way. Empirical evidence shows a rather complementary relationship. Moreover, the determinants of temporary employment (fixed-term contracts and temporary agency work) and the impact of these flexible employment forms on job security and job stability of regular employment are analyzed. One result is that positive developments of sales covary with a higher probability and more wide-spread use of temporary employment, which concurs with dual labour market theory. But estimations for job security and job stability indicate that temporary employment does not lower the number of layoffs and quits as is proposed by the core-periphery hypothesis.
J53|A Competence-based Theory of the Firm|The research question of the article is: Does the competence-based view, representing a theory of sustaining competitive advantage, offer simultaneously a comprehensive theory of the firm? In order to develop an answer, it appears to be necessary to elaborate the theoretical basis of the competence-based view by delimitating this perspective from the resource-based one. The scrutiny suggests that the competence-based view represents a theory of the firm with other answers than current theories of the firm in use. Moreover, not all the answers of the competence-based view as to the theory of the firm are convincing. Therefore, fundamental weaknesses and shortcomings, which can be dispelled, are pointed out.
J53|Personnel Economics: An Economic Approach to Human Resource Management|The theoretical idea of personnel economics is to apply simple economic principles to the field of human resources management. Personnel economics as a research field has grown rapidly since the first text book on ?Personnel Economics? was published in 1998. The development is driven by new theoretical insights based on institutional and behavioural economics and new empirical methods and data sets. Those new theoretical insights are very fruitful to analyze reasons and consequences of various human resource management practices, to understand what actually drives and motivates employees, and what causes organisations to be successful or to fail. With the new data sets and econometric methods the theories that have been laid out in personnel economics either many years ago or very recently can now be tested thoroughly. And the evidence produced by the new data and methods is strongly supportive, which is not only reassuring for researchers, but it also suggests that practitioners can actually rely on the ideas because they are born out in the data. So, personnel economics is not only a vivid research field, but also of great value for human resource managers, particularly for those taking strategic HR decisions. The fruitfulness of personnel economics is demonstrated with four examples: training strategies of companies, recruiting in tight labour markets, career incentives, team size and effort, and entrepreneurial signalling towards employees and creditors.
J53|Pourquoi pas? Rational Choice as a Basic Theory of HRM|"A broad spectrum of theories from different disciplines is portrayed in contemporary HRM (as a discipline of business administration). Theories from psychology, sociology and economics correspond to the variety of problems addressed in HRM which are again situated at different levels of analysis, namely on the individual, group and organizational level. A narrow focus solely on economic approaches, as sometimes suggested in personnel economics, is therefore not sufficient. Instead, the contemporary ""rational choice"" approach may serve as a ""new"" basis for the discipline. The approach stems from economics and sociology and, as an off-spring of these, combines elements of action and structure in its basic explanatory models. Also it is able to explain effects that emerge on the system or macro level. Indepth explanations allow model building at different levels of analysis, namely on an environmental, organizational and individual level, which can be seen as a major prerequisite of explanations in HRM. In addition ""rational choice"" is conscious of the ignorance of its underlying action theory and this exposes it to the body of physiological and psychological knowledge. Anomalies of classic economic theory can therefore be restricted, for instance by using the method of decreasing abstraction. The method of decreasing abstraction serves as a basic principle or heuristic device for model building, in order to separate ""rational choice"" from traditional anti-reductionism. This article introduces basic elements of the modern ""rational choice"" approach: the macro-micro-macro model of explanation, homo socio-oeconomicus as a model of man and exchange theory as a baseline model of aggregation. A final summary discusses research questions and applications of ""rational choice"" in HRM."
