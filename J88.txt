J88|Employment Protection, Employment and Unemployment Rates in European Union Countries During the Great Recession|For mainstream economics, rigidities in the labour market are the primary determinants of high and persistent long-term unemployment rates, leading to the need to reform labour market institutions and make them more flexible. Flexible labour markets would not only help to smooth normal business cycle fluctuations (implying a small impact of these fluctuations on employment and unemployment) but also to reduce the negative impacts on labour market of structural shocks. If we focus on the labour market performances in the European Union during the Great Recession, we can easily detect the existence of significant differences in the impact of this common structural shock on the domestic labour markets. For mainstream economics, the countries with the best results in terms of unemployment and employment would have been those that had a more flexible labour market at the beginning of the crisis and/or those having implemented reforms to increase this flexibility. The aim of this paper is to determine the validity of this argument, that is, whether labour reforms making the labour market more flexible effectively ensure macroeconomic stability by reducing the impact on the labour market of economic shocks. Using panel data techniques, we investigate whether, as mainstream studies argue, the evolution of employment and unemployment in the EU labour markets is explained, and to what extent, by the levels and changes registered in the indicators of employment protection legislation. Conversely, we examine whether, as heterodox and post-Keynesian studies suggest, this evolution is explained by the changes registered in economic activity (i.e., GDP growth).
J88|Multiple Violations of Labor Market Regulations: Patterns in the Peruvian Labor Market and the Impact of Enforcement|This paper quantifies labor law violations and how the enforcement efforts impact on the compliance level by considering the possibility of different labor regulations being violated simultaneously. The findings for the Peruvian labor markets over the period 2004-2013 indicate that: (i) multiple violations of labor regulations are an important feature of Peruvian labor markets; (ii) young workers, workers with low level of education, indigenous workers, workers in micro firms and workers employed in the agricultural sector have higher chances of being deprived of several labor benefits simultaneously; (iii) the enforcement of labor regulations, captured through the number of labor inspections at the region level, is effective in detecting and penalizing extreme situations of multiple violations of the labor law, but the evidence also suggests that firms adjust only partially as an attempt to reduce the amount of a potential fine if discovered, and that laid off workers during the adjustment process moved to the informal sector where firms are not inspected. These findings are useful from a policy perspective indicating that there is space to improve firms’ incentives when facing an increase in the enforcement effort.
J88|Raising the Overtime Premium and Reducing the Standard Workweek: Short-Run Impacts on U.S. Manufacturing|A nine-factor input model is developed to estimate the monthly demand for employment, capital, and weekly hours per worker/workweek in U.S. Manufacturing. The labor inputs correspond to production and non-production workers disaggregated by overtime and non-overtime employment. Policy simulations are conducted to examine the short-run effects on the monthly growth rates for employment, labor earnings, capital usage, and the workweek from either a) raising the overtime premium to double-time, or b) reducing the standard workweek to 35 hours. Although the growth rate policy effects are heterogeneous across disaggregated labor input categories, on aver- age both policy changes exhibit negative effects on the growth rates of industry-wide employment, earnings, and non-labor input usage. The growth rate of the workweek is virtually unaffected by raising the overtime premium but is negatively impacted by reducing the standard work week.
J88|The effect of minimum wages on low-wage jobs: evidence from the United States using a bunching estimator|We propose a novel method that infers the employment effect of a minimum wage increase by comparing the number of excess jobs paying at or slightly above the new minimum wage to the missing jobs paying below it. Using state-level variation in U.S. minimum wages, we implement our method by providing new estimates on the effect of the minimum wage on the frequency distribution of hourly wages. First, we present a case study of a large, indexed minimum wage increase using administrative data on hourly wages from Washington State. Then we implement an event study analysis pooling 138 minimum wage increases between 1979 and 2016. In both cases, we find that the overall number of low-wage jobs remained essentially unchanged. At the same time, the direct effect of the minimum wage on average earnings was amplified by modest wage spillovers at the bottom of the wage distribution. Our estimates by detailed demographic groups show that the lack of job loss is not explained by labor-labor substitution at the bottom of the wage distribution. We also find no evidence of disemployment when we consider higher levels of minimum wages. However, we do find some evidence of reduced employment in tradable sectors. In contrast to our bunching-based estimates, we show that conventional studies can produce misleading inference due to spurious changes in employment higher up in the wage distribution.
J88|Paid Sick Leave and Employee Absenteeism|This paper studies the response of sickness absences to changes in the replacement rate for sick leave. In June 2008 a national law modified both the strength of monitoring and the monetary cost of sick leaves for public sector employees in Italy. This paper focuses on the National Health Service, which accounts for about 21% of the total number of workers employed in the Italian public administration. Using administrative data I show that absenteeism largely decreased following the reform. I identify the effects of an increase in the monetary cost of an absence using a difference-in-differences strategy that exploits variation in changes to the replacement rate for sick leave. Under the assumption that changes in monitoring had the same proportional impact on absenteeism within the same institutions, I estimate that a 1 percentage point decrease in the replacement rate reduces absenteeism by 1%.

J88|Introducing Severance Payment Systems in Japan ——A Proposal for Vacancy Decontrol——| In Japan, the court requires job restoration rather than a severance payment from a firm after it decides that a dismissal has been abusive. This results in a high settlement cost for termination. This paper makes two proposals for introducing severance payments to reduce settlement costs in Japan. The first applies to existing contracts and proposes to specify levels of severance payments that would replace the current job restoration requirement after the court determines that a case is abusive. The second applies to new employees either for a recently vacated position or a new position and proposes vacancy decontrol, which allows firms to set the levels of severance payments freely while also honoring the existing contracts. Within this category, this paper proposes government-assisted vacancy decontrol, a transitional measure, where the government sets a minimum level of statutory severance payment, which is equal to six months of wages for a worker who has worked for 20 years, following the Taiwan precedent. After the need for the transitional measure is dissolved, complete vacancy decontrol should be introduced, abolishing the statutory severance payment. We have proposed that even at this stage, the government should publicly set a default level of the severance payment, which a firm should observe unless an explicit agreement or contract stipulates otherwise. The government should immediately introduce some form of vacancy decontrol for senior workers who have already retired from a regular job.
J88|What if supply-side policies are not enough? The perverse interaction of flexibility and austerity|In this work we develop a set of labour market and fiscal policy experiments upon the labour- and credit- augmented “Schumpeter meeting Keynes” agent-based model. The labour market is declined under two institutional variants, the “Fordist” and the “Competitive” set-ups meant to capture the historical transition from the post-WWII toward the post Thatcher-Reagan period. Inside these two regimes, we study the different effects of supply-side active labour market policies (ALMPs) vs. demand-management, passive labour market ones (PLMPs). In particular, we analyse the effects of ALMPs aimed at promoting job search, and at providing training to unemployed people. Next, we compare the effects of these policies with unemployment benefits meant to sustain income and therefore aggregate demand. Considering the burden of unemployment benefits in terms of the public budget, we link such provision with the objectives of the European Stability and Growth Pact. Our results show that (i) an appropriate level of skills is not enough to sustain growth when workers face adverse labour demand; (ii) supply-side policies are not able to reverse the negative interaction between flexibility and austerity; (iii) PLMPs outperform ALMPs in reducing unemployment and workers’ skill deterioration; and (iv) demand-management policies are better suited to mitigate inequality and to sustain long-run growth.
J88|Agencia y pobreza en la población económicamente activa mexicana|En esta investigación se subraya la importancia de la libertad de agencia para mejorar los niveles de pobreza en la población económicamente activa mexicana. Consideramos que la libertad de agencia es una condición básica para reducir la pobreza y mejorar el bienestar en nuestra sociedad. Hemos elegido un espacio particular en el cual se desenvuelven 54,696,638 personas en México, que conforman el mundo de la población económicamente activa. Tomamos como proxy de libertad de agencia a la responsabilidad, dentro de sus tres categorías: responsabilidad anterior (ex–ante), responsabilidad posterior (ex-post) y responsabilidad autrui (ex–aliud). Los resultados muestran que en México hace falta responsabilidad autrui por parte de las instituciones y empresas y responsabilidad posterior del trabajador. Los bajos niveles en estos dos tipos de responsabilidad no permiten avanzar ni en el mejoramiento de las condiciones de empleo ni en los niveles de pobreza de los trabajadores no cualificados.

J88|The labour-augmented K+S model: a laboratory for the analysis of institutional and policy regimes|In this work we discuss the research findings from the labour-augmented Schumpeter meeting Keynes (K+S) agent-based model. It comprises comparative dynamics experiments on an artificial economy populated by heterogeneous, interacting agents, as workers, firms, banks and the government. The exercises are characterised by different degrees of labour flexibility, or by institutional shocks entailing labour market structural reforms, wherein the phenomenon of hysteresis is endogenous and pervasive. The K+S model constitutes a laboratory to evaluate the effects of new institutional arrangements as active/passive labour market policies, and fiscal austerity. In this perspective, the model allows mimicking many of the customary policy responses which the European Union and many Latin American countries have embraced in reaction to the recent economic crises. The obtained results seem to indicate, however, that most of the proposed policies are likely inadequate to tackle the short-term crises consequences, and even risk demoting the long-run economic prospects. More objectively, the conclusions offer a possible explanation to the negative path traversed by economies like Brazil, where many of the mentioned policies were applied in a short period, and hint about some risks ahead.
J88|Do Equal Employment Opportunity Statements Backfire? Evidence From A Natural Field Experiment On Job-Entry Decisions|Labor force composition and the allocation of talent remain of vital import to modern economies. For their part, governments and companies around the globe have implemented equal employment opportunity (EEO) regulations to influence labor market flows. Even though such regulations are pervasive, surprisingly little is known about their impacts. We use a natural field experiment conducted across 10 U.S. cities to investigate if EEO statements in job advertisements affect the first step in the employment process, application rates. Making use of data from nearly 2,500 job seekers, we find considerable policy effects, but in an unexpected direction: the presence of an EEO statement dampens rather than encourages racial minorities’ willingness to apply for jobs. Importantly, the effects are particularly pronounced for educated job seekers and in cities with white majority populations. Complementary survey evidence suggests the underlying mechanism at work is “tokenism”, revealing that EEO statements backfire because racial minorities avoid environments in which they are perceived as regulatory, or symbolic, hires rather than being hired on their own merits. Beyond their practical and theoretical importance, our results highlight how field experiments can significantly improve policymaking. In this case, if one goal of EEO regulations is to enhance the pool of minority applicants, then it is not working.

J88|The Effect of Prenatal Maternity Leave on Short and Long-term Child Outcomes|Maternity leave policies are presumed to be essential to ensure the health of pregnant workers and their unborn children. However, little is known about the optimal duration of prenatal maternity leave and existing policies are not evidence-based. We evaluate a substantial maternity leave extension in Austria, which increased mandatory leave prior to birth from six to eight weeks. Our estimation strategy exploits that the eligibility for the extended leave was determined by a cutoff due date. As an additional source of exogenous variation, we use information on non-working mothers, who are not eligible for maternity leave. Across estimations, we consistently find no evidence for significant effects of this extension on children’s health at birth, subsequent maternal health and fertility, and longterm human capital outcomes of children. Our finding is confirmed by a supplementary cross-country panel analysis.
J88|Employment Protection and Firm Relocation: Theory and Evidence|We examine the determinants of the decision to relocate activities abroad for firms located in OECD countries. We argue that particular firm-specific features play a crucial role for the link between employment protection and relocation. Stricter employment protection laws over time in the current production location discourage firms' relocation abroad. While larger, more productive firms and firms with higher labour intensities have, ceteris paribus, higher propensities to relocate, they also face higher exit barriers if the country from which they consider relocating has strict employment protection laws. Our predictions are supported empirically, using firm level panel data for 28 OECD countries over the period 1997-2007.
J88|Can RTA labor provisions prevent the deterioration of domestic labor standards? : the cases of statutory minimum wages and employment protection regulations|This study investigates whether labor clauses in regional trade agreements (RTAs) are effective to maintain or improve the domestic labor standards in the signatory countries. The effects of RTA labor clauses on two measures of labor standards, statutory minimum wages and the strictness of employment protection, are empirically analyzed using a unique dataset that classifies the population of effective RTAs into those with and without labor clauses, together with multi-year data on minimum wages and the indicator of employment-protection strictness for a wide variety of countries. The result shows that having labor-clause-free RTAs with more or larger trading partners are associated with lower statutory minimum wages although this negative association is not found for labor-clauseinclusive RTAs. The separate estimation for countries in different income groups further demonstrates that this result is chiefly driven by middle-income countries that sign RTAs with high-income partners, implying that signing RTAs with more or larger high-income trading partners would create to the government of a middleincome country, which has a comparative advantage over the high-income partners in labor-intensive sectors, a downward policy pressure on statutory minimum wages whereas labor clauses could alleviate such a negative policy effect of RTAs on minimum wages. This finding is also contrasted with the case of actual wages for which no evidence is found for the impact of RTAs with or without labor clauses to reaffirm that labor-clause-free RTAs could create downward policy pressure on statutory minimum wages but RTAs might not bring market pressure on actual wages regardless of whether or not the RTAs include labor clauses. Finally, unlike this case of statutory minimum wages, the empirical analysis finds no clear evidence for the potential impacts of RTAs either with or without labor clauses on the strictness of employment protection in the signatory countries.

J88|The Minimum Wage, Exports, and Firm Performance: Evidence from Indonesia|This paper examines the interrelationship between changes in the provincial minimum wage, firms' export behavior, and firms' performance in Indonesia. In this regard, we apply two-stage least squares regression analysis to detailed firm-level data of manufacturing enterprises between 2002 and 2014. We find that an increase in the minimum wage is associated with decreases in a firm's employment rate, its probability of exporting, and its overall performance in terms of productivity and markup. We also use the 2012 minimum wage reform in Indonesia to conduct a combined propensity score matching and difference-in-difference analysis to mitigate the potential endogeneity of minimum wage regulation. Our findings are generally robust to alternative estimation methods. Moreover, the findings suggest that Indonesian exports and the country's comparative advantage in international markets are not negligibly affected by higher labor costs through minimum wage growth.

J88|Job Quality, Health and Productivity: An evidence-based framework for analysis|The nature, content and milieu of work – i.e. the quality of the working environment – matter in many ways for people, firms and society as a whole. There is a great deal of evidence to show clear associations between job quality and the health of workers, their ability to successfully combine work and life while fully mobilising their skills and abilities to build a career, and their productivity. Investments in quality working environments can be welfare enhancing and economically efficient. Policies and practices reflect these findings insufficiently, an apparent paradox that finds its roots in various market failures. There is scope for public intervention to raise awareness, to ensure better coordination of key stakeholders (employers, workers’ representatives and various public entities) and to put in place the right financial incentives for firms to invest in better working conditions. Action in this field is also important in view of ongoing considerable changes in the labour market. The future of work is very uncertain at this stage; the digitalisation and uberisation of work have the potential for improvements in working conditions but also bear the risk of de-skilling, lower pay, lower job security and poor working conditions for parts of the labour force.
J88|Recent Research on the Minimum Wage: Implications for Missouri|I discuss the sources of the policy disputes surrounding the mini-mum wage, both theoretical and empirical. I focus on recent research, particularly on margins other than the level of employment, and ex-amine the distributional implications of minimum wage increases. I consider the impacts of recent proposals to increase the minimum wage in the state of Missouri.
J88|Towards a European Full Employment Policy|Full employment in the European Union member states is a challenge but feasible, also in downswings of the business cycle and during stages of increased robotization. It requires a labor legislation that ensures flexibility and retraining, responsive labor sharing during the business cycle and to individual life cycle needs, government interventions to supply supplemental employment and revamping dual education. The future of work is better ensured with coordinated European full employment labor policies establishing fair work conditions based on long-run business strategies as well as a fair distribution of national income between labor and capital.

J88|The CBR-LRI Dataset: Methods, Properties & Potential of Leximetric Coding of Labour Laws|Leximetric data coding techniques aim to measure cross-national and inter-temporal variations in the content of legal rules, thereby facilitating statistical analysis of legal systems and their social and economic impacts. In this paper we explain how leximetric methods were used to create the CBR Labour Index (CBR-LRI), an index and related dataset of labour laws from around the world spanning the period from 1970 to 2013. Datasets of this kind must, we suggest, observe certain conventions of transparency and validity if they are to be usable in statistical analysis. The theoretical framework informing the construction of the dataset and the types of questions which it is are designed to answer should be made explicit. Then the choices involved in the selection of indicators, the definition of coding algorithms, and the aggregation and weighting of data to create composite measures, must be spelled out. In addition, primary legal sources should be referenced, and it should be clear how they were used to generate reported values. With these points in mind we provide an overview of the CBR-LRI dataset's main features and structure, discuss issues of weighting, and present some initial findings on what it reveals of global trends in labour regulation.
J88|Minimum age regulation and child labor: New evidence from Brazil|We suggest new evidence on minimum age regulations using a natural experiment. In 1998, a constitutional reform has changed the minimum working age from 14 to 16 in Brazil. The reform was the legislative counterpart of a broad set of measures taken by a government strongly committed to fighting child labor. We document the fact that enforcement and compliance may have been heterogeneous across regions and job types. The setting allows improving upon past approaches based on the comparison of employment rates of children below and above the minimum age. Precisely, we observe 14-year old children the year after the reform and exploit discontinuous treatment depending on their birthdate (only those who turned 14 after mid-December 1998 are banned). Regression discontinuity and difference-in-discontinuity designs show no effect of the ban overall, nor a reallocation towards less visible activities, or a substitution of labor within families. Importantly, however, we find a significant drop in child labor among those with highest chances of compliance, namely children in visible activities and in regions characterized with an above-average intensity of labor inspections. We provide power calculation and extensive sensitivity checks.
J88|Does employment protection legislation promote immigrant self-employment?|The paper analyses the effect of employment protection legislation on immigrant self- employment rates, using OECD indicators on the strictness of employment protection legislation (EPL). As migrants are outsiders in the labour market, the effect of employment protection on their probability of finding a job should be most likely negative, even if the net effect of employment protection on aggregate employment is unclear. We find no significant effects of EPL of migrant self-employment rates, in a multivariate context.
J88|The Problem of Unpaid Internships: Legal Guide to Complaints Under the European Social Charter|Young people entering the job market are in a precarious economic position. Across Europe, and in Belgium in particular, those who wish to enter into the professional world are faced with the de facto mandate that in order to gain experience and build the connections that will enable them to find paid professional work in the future, they must complete several internships. Yet many of these internships are unpaid or underpaid, forcing some young people to rely on their savings or their parents and shutting others out of the process entirely. The European Committee of Social Rights (the “Committee”) accepts collective complaints lodged by non-governmental organisations alleging violations of the European Social Charter (the “Charter”). The EU Public Interest Clinic prepared this draft Complaint for the non-profit organization European Youth Forum, alleging that unpaid internships in Belgium violate the Charter. Specifically, the provisions in Belgian law that enable unpaid internships, and the lack of enforcement of provisions that aim to curtail them, violate Articles 4, 7, and 10 of the Charter, which provide for fair remuneration, the protection of young people, and financial assistance for vocational training, respectively.
J88|Working conditions and regulation|Do employers invest sufficiently in the working conditions of employees? We examine this question in a simple principal-agent model. We show that, even though investment is contractible, the principal underinvests whenever her agent's alternatives are rather poor. This provides a reason for regulation. The indirect regulatory approach of taking measures that improve the agent's bargaining power or outside option at least weakly enhances the agent's well-being and welfare. The direct regulatory approach of demanding a certain standard of working conditions increases the principal's investment, but may nonetheless leave the agent's well-being unaffected and deteriorate welfare. This holds true since due to a standard, the principal may provide the agent with a lower-powered incentive scheme and implement a lower effort level.
J88|Labor Market Institutions and the Future of Work: Good Jobs for All?|Work and employment around the globe change continuously, but there are potentially more rapid and fundamental transformations ahead as new technologies can have major impact on what jobs will exist in the future, how people will work and how the global division of labor will evolve. This contribution tries to assess the current outlook into the foreseeable future and highlights the importance of labor market institutions that can effectively influence the future of work. The paper in particular addresses the need to reform and update labor market regulation, social protection and active labor market policies as well as the education systems.
J88|Structural Convergence vs. Systems Competition: Limits to the Diversity of Labour Market Policies in the EMU|Does a monetary union, for it to be successful, impose limits on the diversity of labour market policies and institutions in its member states? I argue that one should not overstretch functionalist arguments in this matter; the problem at hand is political and the challenge is to identify common standards and policy rules that are functionally relevant (taking on board a combination of arguments on what a wellfunctioning monetary union requires) and legitimate in view of shared aspirations across the member states. What is ‘needed’ and what is ‘imposed’ by monetary unification in Europe, depends on the fundamental aspirations that drive the European project at large. Already in the 1990s, reform in labour markets was justified by the advent of the monetary union. The European Employment Strategy emphasised supply-side flexibility: an agenda for flexible labour markets was interwoven with an agenda of investment in individual labour market opportunities and the development of ‘enabling’ policies. This essay develops a broader argument: to sustain a wellfunctioning monetary union that serves the EU’s aspirations, we need a consensus on labour market institutions that support symmetry and stability. Therefore, collective action and ‘protective’ policies are in order. Enabling and protective policies can be mutually reinforcing, in creating resilient social systems. With regard to symmetry, the member states need labour market institutions that can deliver on wage coordination; this limits the diversity of social systems cohabiting in a monetary union, since it excludes totally decentralised and uncoordinated bargaining. Institutions that monitor competitiveness should be embedded in social dialogue, and distributive concerns should be mainstreamed in the monitoring of competitiveness. Mainstreaming distributive concerns into competitiveness makes the ‘assignment’ for national social partners complex and challenging, but such an encompassing approach may stand a better chance to achieve legitimacy.

Tomamos como caso el de Chile, que, a pesar de haber implementado importantes reformas modernizadoras en la economÃ­a, aÃºn registra tasas bajas de participaciÃ³n femenina. Usando un modelo macro estÃ¡ndar, estimado economÃ©tricamente, se muestra que hay importantes ganancias en aumentar los servicios de jardines infantiles a travÃ©s de la productividad mÃ©s que por un aumento de la oferta laboral, punto que remarca la literatura de conciliaciÃ©n trabajo y familiar mÃ¡s que la literatura macro tradicional. La segunda contribuciÃ³n es que los cambios en la composiciÃ³n del financiamiento entre trabajadores y empresas se diluyen en la economÃ­a a nivel agregado. AsÃ­, la principal consecuencia de polÃ­tica econÃ³mica para otras economÃ­as con bajas tasas de participaciÃ³n femenina es que aumentar los niveles de conciliaciÃ³n trabajo y familia, y por tanto la productividad, tienen importantes efectos positivos a nivel macroeconÃ³mico sin que los costos de su financiamiento compensen los beneficios.
J88|Minimum Wages and the Distribution of Family Incomes|Using the March Current Population Survey data from 1984 to 2013, I provide a comprehensive evaluation of how minimum wage policies influence the distribution of family incomes. I find robust evidence that higher minimum wages shift down the cumulative distribution of family incomes at the bottom, reducing the share of non-elderly individuals with incomes below 50, 75, 100, and 125 percent of the federal poverty threshold. The long run (3 or more years) minimum wage elasticity of the non-elderly poverty rate with respect to the minimum wage ranges between -0.22 and -0.55 across alternative specifications that subsume most of the approaches used in the literature to construct valid counterfactuals. Inverting the policy's effect on the cumulative distribution, I estimate minimum wage elasticities for unconditional quantiles of family incomes. The long run minimum wage elasticities for the 10th and 15th unconditional quantiles of equivalized family incomes range between 0.15 and 0.49 depending on specification. A reduction in public assistance partly offsets these income gains, which are on average 72% as large when using an expanded income definition including tax credits and non-cash transfers.
J88|Income Support Policies for the Working Poor|This paper asks what governments in the EU Member States and some US states are doing to support workers on low wages. Using model family simulations, we assess the policy measures currently in place to guarantee an adequate disposable income to working families, taking into account minimum wages, social security contributions, taxes and cash benefits. We show that despite increased efforts over the past decade, disposable incomes of certain types of minimum wage workers still fall well below the EU at-risk-of-poverty thresholds in many countries. Single earners with dependent children are especially at risk of poverty. We discuss the options for making progress.
J88|Labor Market Institutions and the Future of Work: Good Jobs for All?|Work and employment around the globe change continuously, but there are potentially more rapid and fundamental transformations ahead as new technologies can have major impact on what jobs will exist in the future, how people will work and how the global division of labor will evolve. This contribution tries to assess the current outlook into the foreseeable future and highlights the importance of labor market institutions that can effectively influence the future of work. The paper in particular addresses the need to reform and update labor market regulation, social protection and active labor market policies as well as the education systems.
J88|The European Youth Guarantee: A Preliminary Assessment and Broader Conceptual Implications|This paper assesses the current situation of youth unemployment in the European Union. In this context, the main questions are whether the European Youth Guarantee has had any effects and how the school-to-work transitions of young individuals in Europe could be improved.
J88|The economics of employment tribunals|Employment tribunals or labor courts are responsible for enforcing employment protection legislation and adjudicating rights-based disputes between employers and employees. Claim numbers are high and, in Great Britain, have been rising, affecting both administrative costs and economic competitiveness. Reforms have attempted to reduce the number of claims and to improve the speed and efficiency of dealing with them. Balancing employee protection against cost-effectiveness remains difficult, however. Gathering evidence on tribunals, including on claim instigation, resolution, decision making, and post-tribunal outcomes can inform policy efforts.
J88|Egalitarian Policies and Effective Demand: Considering Balance of Payments|This study examines the effectiveness of redistribution policies considering balance of payments. Unlike Bowles (2012) and Abe (2016, 2015), we assume that capital movement is sluggish to consider the short-run effects. Results indicate that conventional egalitarian policies such as increasing unemployment compensation and strengthening dismissal regulations can be effective, whereas an asset-based redistribution such as a decrease in the ratio of monitoring labor cannot be. These results contradict Bowles (2012). We need to reevaluate conventional egalitarian policies if the effects of effective demand and adjustment of capital continue in the long run.
J88|Optimal Regulation with Exemptions|Despite decades of research on mechanism design and on many practical aspects of cost-benefit analysis, one of the most basic and ubiquitous features of regulation as actually implemented throughout the world has received little theoretical attention: exemptions for small firms. These firms may generate a disproportionate share of harm due to their being exempt and because exemption induces additional harmful activity to be channeled their way. This article analyzes optimal regulation with exemptions where firms have different productivities that are unobservable to the regulator, regulated and unregulated output each cause harm although at different levels, and the regulatory regime affects entry as well as the output choices of regulated and unregulated firms. In many settings, optimal schemes involve subtle effects and have counterintuitive features: for example, higher regulatory costs need not favor higher exemptions, and the incentives of firms to drop output to become exempt can be too weak as well as too strong. A final section examines the optimal use of output taxation alongside regulation, which illustrates the contrast with the mechanism design approach that analyzes the optimal use of instruments of a type that are not in widespread use.
J88|The labour market policy in the EU|In the era of demographic changes and need for rationalization of public expenditure, the European Union social policy promotes the activation approach. In addition, there can be noticed a growing importance of increasing the efficiency of public policies. The authors are presenting the main theoretical assumptions concerning efficiency as well as classification of methods for measuring of efficiency of labour market policies. Moreover, the EU countries are classified in clusters according to their level of expenditure on different categories of LMP. The paper is based on critical analysis of literature as well as analysis of secondary research findings. The cross-country labour market situation in the EU is based on the analysis of the Eurostat data by the k-means method. There is a need to work out a complex evaluation of labour market policies in the EU to provide comparative analysis of the EU countries (or groups of countries). It would allow determining the level of development of the country in terms of the efficiency of labour market policies.The EU countries with the best labour market situation represent diverse levels of LMP expenditure.
J88|The Political Economy of State Regulation : The Case of the English Factory Acts|This paper proposes a theory of why the state enacted social policy that regulated the length of the working day in 19th century industrial England. This paper will argue that, far from being capable of self-regulation, the capitalist labor market during Britainâ€™s industrial revolution is best conceptualized as consisting of two major social coordination problems resulting from conflicting interests between and within capital and labor. Left unregulated, this dual social coordination problem caused the overexploitation of labor, with dire consequences for both the capitalist and working classes. The reason why this coordination problem could not self-correct was because the wage-labor bargain contained the externality of unwaged household labor. The existence of this externality became deleterious to firmsâ€™ profitability and workersâ€™ survival, especially given the high levels of female labor force participation. This social coordination problem justified and required state regulation into industrial relations. By conceptualizing protective policy as the solution to a dual social coordination problem caused by conflicting interests among heterogeneous firms and workers, this paper extends the Polanyian framework with an explicit theory of exploitation based on the classical theory of competition and a feminist emphasis on social reproduction and unwaged labor.
J88|"From the ""planning euphoria"" to the ""bitter economic truth"": The transmission of economic ideas into German labour market policies in the 1960s and 2000s"|This paper compares the interconnections between dominant economic thought and processes of policy-making in the area of labour market reforms in Germany in the late 1960s and the early 2000s. The transition in labour market policies in this period could be described as a change from an active to an activating approach. At the level of economic discourse these policy changes correspond to a paradigm shift from Keynesian to neoclassical/neoliberal economic thought. We investigated these changes by focussing on two distinct reforms of labour market policies and carried out a critical discourse analysis of the relevant public and academic discourse of economists. We find that the paradigm shift in economic thought was accompanied by a shift in economists' discourses on labour market policy issues.
J88|On the Interaction Between Trade Reforms and Labor Market Regulation: Evidence from the MENA Countries' Labor Markets|Using a panel of MENA countries, this paper tries to examine the interaction between trade reforms and labor market regulations on the outcome of the labor market. The theoretical predictions of this literature show that the effects of trade liberalization in any given country are conditional on the nature of labor market regulations since trade liberalization is more likely to have a positive impact on employment and wages in countries with flexible labor markets and vice versa. Moreover, more regulated labor markets tend to have higher wages at the expense of sector wide employment. Our main findings show that labor market rigidity reduces the positive impact of trade reform on employment. While this result is stronger for females, it is not for males.
J88|Enforcement matters: The effective regulation of labour|The distinction between de jure and de facto regulation is well understood in theory, but has rarely been applied to cross‐country empirical work on the impact of labour regulation on labour market outcomes for lack of data. Policy debate has been based on measures of stringency of law, suggesting a negative correlation between labour regulation and labour market outcomes. This article provides new cross‐country measures of labour law enforcement and evidence of a negative correlation between stringency and intensity of enforcement. Previous results concerning the consequences of labour regulation and the legal origins theory no longer hold when a measure of effective labour regulation is used.
J88|Revisiting the Relationship between Financial Development and Child Labor in Developing Countries: Do Inequality and Institutions Matter?|This paper analyzes the relationship between financial development and child labor for a panel of developing countries over the period 1960 to 2004. We find that financial development measured by the ratio of private credit to GDP tends to increase child labor and this result is driven by countries with high level of inequality, above to the mean of the Gini coefficient. This could reflect that with access to credit, households tend to invest in their own farm or family business, raising the opportunity cost of schooling and inducing more working children. These findings are robust to the use of different estimation techniques like instrumental variables strategy and generalized method of moments. But this positive effect is likely to be non nonlinear, especially financial development and education spending are effective in reducing child labor only in countries with better control of corruption. This suggests that better institutions by improving the quality of education services and its return tend to alter the positive impact of financial development which occurs via the high opportunity cost of education.
J88|La reforma laboral implementada durante el segundo gobierno de Alfonso López Pumarejo|En este artículo se estudian los elementos más relevantes de la reforma laboral propuesta y puesta en práctica por el presidente Alfonso López Pumarejo durante su segunda gestión de Gobierno. La reforma fue implementada fundamentalmente a través de la Ley 6ª de 1945. Los elementos más relevantes de la misma fueron la institucionalización y regulación de los movimientos obreros para que contribuyesen de esta forma a la estabilidad del crecimiento económico y el desarrollo empresarial pretendido en ese momento por el Estado colombiano, así como el reconocimiento de un conjunto de reivindicaciones y derechos a los trabajadores urbanos, que hicieron de esta reforma la más avanzada en Colombia en términos sociales durante el siglo XX.
J88|The role of private companies in the Danish active labour market policy|In this paper the authors present a new, extended approach, involving collaboration strategies between public employment services and private companies, which were under implementation in 2015 in Aarhus (Denmark). The main thesis of the paper is that the cooperation of public labour market institutions with labour demand representaives is crucial in realisation of active labour market policy. The Danish labour market policy is based on the flexicurity model that combines the flexibility of employment assisted by employment security assured by both, developed active labour market programmes and a rationalized system of benefits. The authors also propose some reccommendations for Poland in the area of boosting cooperation between public employment services and business representatives following the Danish example. The research method was the analysis of secondary data, such as literature overview, as well as strategies and reports made on behalf of the Jobcenter Aarhus.
J88|Enforcement of labor market regulations: heterogeneous compliance and adjustment across gender|Abstract This paper explores microdata from Argentine household surveys to analyze how changes in the enforcement of labor regulations affect the compliance level and other labor outcomes among men and women. Using information of the highly decentralized labor inspection system in Argentina, I construct an enforcement measure with variation at the province, sector, and time level (share of inspected firms) which I instrument using a measure of the arrival cost of labor inspectors to the firms. The main findings reveal that when enforcement increases, the compliance with mandated benefits and formal wages increase among men, while informal wages decline. Among women, the compliance level declines jointly with informal wages. These heterogenous impacts are explained by labor regulations that make formal and informal men more substitutable in the production process than formal and informal women.
J88|Are Labor Inspections Protecting Workers’ Rights? Adding the Evidence from Size-based Labor Regulations and Fines in Peru|This paper analyzes how changes in the enforcement of labor regulations impact on the compliance rate in a context where the labor rules and the characteristics of the labor inspection system differ by firm size. In addition to the channels analyzed in the existing literature –the deterrence effect of labor inspections and the movement of displaced workers into the informal sector, this paper adds a margin of adjustment not analyzed before: firms can reduce their size to take advantage of lower penalties for violating the labor rules and/or less stringent regulations. I analyze empirically which forces have dominated for workers employed in firms of different size in Peru during 2008-2013. I measure the enforcement of labor regulations as the number of labor inspections per hundred workers at the regional level, and I instrument it using a measure of the arrival cost of labor inspectors to the firms. The findings reveal that the degree of enforcement had little impact on the compliance with labor regulations. The effect of firms reducing their size to enjoy lower fines and/or less stringent regulations was small in magnitude and the direction of the effect was not clear. The general lack of effect of the enforcement measure on the compliance with the labor rules indicates that the labor inspection system is not effective in Peru, either because it is not able to generate the incentives to comply with labor regulations (e.g. because of lack of resources) or because it fails to overcome the consequences of the adjustment process associated to an increase in the compliance level (e.g. displaced workers moving into the informal sector of the economy).
J88|No Big Deal: The Impact of New York City’s Paid Sick Days Law on Employers|In June 2013, New York City became the seventh — and the largest — U.S. jurisdiction to provide workers with paid sick days, with the passage of the Earned Sick Time Act, which took effect in April 2014. Under this law, covered workers employed in New York City private-sector companies and non-profit organizations with five or more employees accrue job-protected paid sick leave at a rate of one hour for every 30 hours worked. Employees of companies with one to four workers are entitled to unpaid sick leave. The law covers about 3.9 million workers employed in the City, 1.4 million of whom did not have access to paid sick days prior to its passage. When it was first proposed, critics of the paid sick time law argued that it would lead to a loss of jobs in the City and impose a major cost burden on employers, especially small businesses. They also predicted that such a law would invite widespread abuse by employees. However, as this report shows, these fears have proven unfounded. By their own account, the vast majority of employers were able to adjust quite easily to the new law, and for most the cost impact was minimal to nonexistent. Indeed, a year and a half after the law took effect, 86 percent of the employers we surveyed expressed support for the paid sick days law.
J88|Experimenting with Entrepreneurship: The Effect of Job-Protected Leave|This paper studies whether potential entrepreneurs remain in wage employment because of the danger that they will face worse job opportunities should their entrepreneurial ventures fail? Using a Canadian reform that extended job-protected leave to one year for women giving birth after a cut-off date, it studies whether the option to return to a previous job increases entrepreneurship. The results are driven by more educated entrepreneurs, starting firms that survive at least five years and hire paid employees, in industries where experimentation is more valuable.

J88|Promoting Youth Employment in Europe: Evidence-based Policy Lessons|Youth unemployment has become a severe economic and societal problem in many European countries. Based on the existing empirical evidence on different policy options, this chapter draws lessons for future policy making in order to effectively promote youth employment in Europe. In conclusion, one should not be overly optimistic by expecting any short-term remedies. Although effective policy tools are available, they largely require forward-looking structural reforms.
J88|Labor clauses in regional trade agreements and effects on labor conditions : an empirical analysis|"An increasing number of bilateral or plurilateral trade agreements (or regional trade agreements: RTAs) include ""labor clauses"" that require or urge the signatory countries to commit to maintaining a certain level of labor standards. This paper performs an empirical analysis of the impacts of such labor clauses provided in RTAs on working conditions that laborers in the RTA signatory countries actually face, using macro-level data for a wide variety of countries. The paper first examines the texts of labor provisions in more than 220 effective RTAs and (re-)classifies ""RTAs with labor clauses"" according to two criteria: (i) the agreement urges or expects the signatory countries to harmonize their domestic labor standards with internationally recognized standards, and (ii) the agreement stipulates the procedures for consultations and/or dispute settlement on labor-condition issues between the signatory countries. Based on this labor-clause RTA classification, the paper estimates the impacts of RTA labor clauses on working conditions in countries with two empirical specifications using the sample covering 136 countries or economies and years from 1995 through 2011. The estimation is extended to takes into account possible lags in the labor-condition effects of labor clauses as well as to consider potential difference in the impacts for countries in different income levels. The empirical results for the four measures of labor conditions (mean monthly real earnings, mean weekly work hours per employee, fatal occupational injury rate, and the number of the ILO's Core Conventions ratified) find no evidence for possible pro-labor-condition effects of RTA labor clauses overall, which should be consistent with the view of economics literature that questions the relevance of linking trade policy with issues in the domestic labor standards."
J88|Egalitarian Policies, Effective Demand, and Globalization: Considering Budget Constraint|This paper examines the effectiveness of redistribution policies under budget constraint considering government spending for the productivity improvement as Bowles (2012) and effective demand based on Abe (2015). It shows that an asset-based redistribution policy is not always effective under effective demand and budget constraint. However, the increase of effective demand because of income distribution improves employment, labor productivity, and wage rates because of increased government spending for productivity improvement as the results of saving rate from profit income show.
J88|Does Career Risk Deter Potential Entrepreneurs?|Do potential entrepreneurs remain in wage employment because of concerns that they will face worse job opportunities should their entrepreneurial ventures fail? Using a Canadian reform that extended job-protected leave to one year for women giving birth after a cutoff date, we study whether the option to return to a previous job increases entrepreneurship. A regression discontinuity design reveals that longer job-protected leave increases entrepreneurship by 1.9 percentage points. These entrepreneurs start incorporated businesses that hire employees—in industries where experimentation before entry has low costs and high benefits. The effects are concentrated among those with more human and financial capital.
J88|Analyzing the Influence of Occupational Licensing Duration and Grandfathering on Labor Market Outcomes|The length of time from the implementation of an occupational licensing statute (i.e., licensing duration) may matter in influencing labor market outcomes. Adding to or raising the entry barriers are likely easier once an occupation is established and has gained influence in a political jurisdiction. States often enact grandfather clauses and ratchet up requirements that protect existing workers and increase entry costs to new entrants. We analyze the labor market influence of the duration of occupational licensing statutes for 13 major universally licensed occupations over a 75-year period. These occupations comprise the vast majority of workers in these regulated occupations in the United States. We provide among the first estimates of potential economic rents to grandfathering. We find that duration years of occupational licensure are positively associated with wages for continuing and grandfathered workers. The estimates show a positive relationship of duration with hours worked, but we find moderately negative results for participation in the labor market. The universally licensed occupations, however, exhibit heterogeneity in outcomes. Consequently, unlike some other labor market public policies, such as minimum wages or direct unemployment insurance benefits, occupational licensing would likely influence labor market outcomes when measured over a longer period of time.
J88|Enforcement of Labor Market Regulations: Heterogeneous Compliance and Adjustment across Gender|When compliance with labor market regulations is low, the enforcement of the labor law becomes a concept that is closer to the regulatory environment that firms and workers face. Firms are expected to react to variations in the enforcement level, and the response may differ for male and female workers. This paper explores microdata from Argentine household surveys to analyze: (i) how changes in the enforcement of labor regulations affect the level of compliance with the labor law among men and women, and (ii) how changes in the enforcement of the labor law generate adjustments of other labor outcomes, for men and women separately. Using information of the highly decentralized labor inspection system in Argentina, I construct an enforcement measure with variation at the province, sector, and time level (share of inspected firms). To deal with the potential endogeneity of this measure, I instrument using a measure of the arrival cost of labor inspectors to the firms. The main findings reveal different patterns of adjustment for men and women. When the degree of enforcement increases: the compliance with employment and social security regulations increases for men and decreases for women; the share of wage employees increases and the share of self-employed declines for men, with no changes for women; no changes are found in hourly wages and in the provision of non-mandated benefits. These results bring additional evidence about how the regulatory environment can impact on the decisions of firms and workers about participating in the informal sector. More importantly, they stress that both the written labor regulation and the degree of enforcement are essential parts in the provision of social and labor protection.

J88|The Effect of New Jersey’s Paid Parental Leave Policy on Employment|Paid parental leave policy remains a continuing source of controversy in the United States. Advocates for parental leave policy maintain that it has a positive effect on child rearing outcomes and family happiness. Critics, however, maintain that paid parental leave will cause firms to hire fewer women. This paper evaluates the critics’ claim that paid family leave entitlements will reduce employment using the New Jersey family leave law that took effect in 2009. We conduct a difference-in-difference analysis that compares county-level employment in western New Jersey using eastern Pennsylvania as a control. We disaggregate county-level employment to test whether women, workers of childbearing age, educated workers experienced larger employment effects in western New Jersey (relative to eastern Pennsylvania) following the New Jersey family leave law. We also conduct similar comparisons within New Jersey. Our estimates suggest that the New Jersey family leave law reduces overall employment by about 3.3 percent. However, the employment reductions among women, people of childbearing age, and more highly skilled workers are relatively larger. Finally, we find little evidence that family leave mandates have employment effects for unskilled workers.
J88|Wage Effects of Unionization and Occupational Licensing Coverage in the United States|Recent estimates in standard models of wage determination for both unionization and occupational licensing have shown wage effects that are similar across the two institutions. These cross-sectional estimates use specialized data sets, with small sample sizes, for the period 2006 to 2008. The authorsâ€™ analysis examines the impact of unions and licensing coverage on wage determination using new data collected on licensing statutes that are then linked to longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) from 1979 to 2010. They develop several approaches, using both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, to measure the impact of these two labor market institutions on wage determination. The estimates of the economic returns to union coverage are greater than those for licensing statutes.
J88|Social Cooperatives of Disabled Persons in Poland: Postulates and Reality (Spoldzielnie socjalne osob niepelnosprawnych w Polsce– postulaty a rzeczywistosc)|Disabled persons are at risk of exclusion from the labor market. Such exclusion may result in social marginalization or even social exclusion. Various legal instruments are used in attempts to prevent this phenomenon. Social cooperatives, classified as entities of the social economy, may play a significant role in the professional activation of the disabled. However, social cooperatives of disabled persons in Poland face barriers that limit their role in the process of the professional and social inclusion of disabled persons. Currently, the situation diverges considerably from the postulates formulated in justification for draft acts whose passage was to have contributed to the development of the cooperative activities of disabled persons.
J88|The Labor Market Consequences of Regulating Similar Occupations: The Licensing of Occupational and Physical Therapists|This study shows the influence of occupational licensing on two occupations that provide similar services: occupational therapists and physical therapists. Most of the tasks for these two occupations differ, but several jobs overlap, and individuals in both occupations could have legal jurisdiction over these tasks. We empirically examine how these two occupations interact with one another in the labor market on wage determination and employment. Unlike previous studies, our study examines two occupations that are female dominated both within the professions and among its leadership. Our results show that occupational licensing can raise the wages of members of both occupations, but the duration of state occupational licensing statutes is the dominant influence on wage determination. Occupational licensing is also associated with a reduction in annual hours worked and in the relative numbers of members in each of the professions. Moreover, the ability of physical therapists to have direct access to patients is associated with a reduction in hourly earnings for occupational therapists, suggesting some substitution for certain service tasks across the two occupations. The ability of these two occupations to be both complements to and substitutes for one another provides new evidence on how the growing number of regulated occupations that are similar interact and influence one another.
J88|The case against child labor bans|We argue that enforcing blanket child labor restrictions in developing economies, as advocated in the ILO Convention 138, is harmful even in the long run. The social return to child labor can be higher than its private return if laws against crime and laws in favor of compulsory education are not enforced, in which case child labor crowds out both child crime and crime against children.
J88|EU Blue Card: A promising tool among labour migration policies? A comparative analysis of selected countries|In 2007 the Commission proposed a Directive aimed exclusively at third-country nationals moving to Europe for the purpose of highly qualified employment that would set up a harmonized entry procedure, lay down common residence conditions and facilitate mobility through Europe. The Directive, named Blue Card, was meant to make Europe more attractive for highly qualified migrants by offering a fast-track entry procedure and social benefits in the EU. The Commission, despite the reluctance of Member States, managed to push through the Directive, which was finally approved in 2009. In the first three years since the Blue Card first entered into force in the majority of Member States in 2012, no more than 30,352 cards have been issued, of which about 26,200 by a single Member State. Why? Through a detailed analysis of the conditions set by the Directive and their comparison with the ones posed by the national labour migration schemes - in particular in Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands -, this paper aims to demonstrate that the causes of failure are not to search in the Blue Card instrument per se, but rather in the ways this has been implemented in the single Member States.
J88|Determinants of job quality — Evidence for European country groups|Based on a micro-level approach and using data from the European Working Conditions Survey, covering 27 countries, we analyse the determinants of job quality. With cluster analysis applied to 11 dimensional indices, we form three homogeneous country groups and identify, by estimating twice-censored Tobit models, the main determinant factors affecting the individual level of job quality in each group. We verify the relevance of variables related to worker characteristics, firm characteristics, and the country in which the individual works. Among worker characteristics, education and employment status are the factors with the highest impact on job quality, while the economic sector is the most important firm characteristic. The results suggest the existence of important differences among groups regarding the magnitude of the impact of some factors. The highest dissimilarities are found between the group with better jobs (Nordic countries plus Belgium) and the group with lower quality jobs (Central and Eastern European countries plus Portugal and Greece). Variables related to age, education, dimension of the firm, and economic sector are those in which more heterogeneity is found among the groups.
J88|Do Changes in Regulation Affect Temporary Agency Workers’ Job Satisfaction?|This paper evaluates the impact on temporary agency workers’ job satisfaction of a reform that considerably relaxed regulations covering the temporary help service sector in Germany. We isolate the causal effect of this reform by combining a difference-in-difference and matching approach and using rich survey data. We find that the change of the law substantially decreased agency workers’ job satisfaction while regular workers’ job satisfaction remained unchanged. Further analysis reveals that the negative effect on agency workers’ job satisfaction can be attributed to a decrease in wages and an increase in perceived job insecurity. These results are also robust to the use of different specifications and placebo tests.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J88|The Change and Transformation of Social Insurance System of Turkey|Turkish social insurance system based on the contributory principle finds its basis in the Ottoman era. During classical period of Ottoman Empire, similar practices of old age pension, survivors'benefit, disability and employment injury benefits were seen in Jannissaries and Guilds. After Tanzimat, the insurance protection for the civil servants was provided by pension funds. The fund application for each public institution, was continued until the codification of Law on Retirement Fund No.5434. The unification of different social security schemes was realized by the foundation of this Fund. After WW2, in Turkey it can be seen the foundation of modern social insurance system. Until 1983, all of the working class protected under the social insurance system. However, the presentation of different regimes for each sectors, gave harm to social justice and the investment failure of insurance funds in profitable investments caused decreasement of funds. With the frequently application premium amnesties and the removing of the age limit to be a prerequisite of a pension the national insurance model, that constitued newly, faced with the danger of collapse. The contribution of social security reforms that made in 1999 and 2008, will be seen in medium and long term.
J88|Political instability and labour market institutions|This paper investigates the relationship between political instability and labour market institutions. We develop a theoretical model in which political instability creates incentives for a government to introduce labour market regulation in the economy. The distortionary effect of regulation on unemployment effectively puts a constraint on the design of fiscal and public policies. We empirically investigate these predictions using panel data for 21 OECD countries for the period 1985–2006. Our results are consistent with the view that political instability is associated with more regulated labour markets, lower labour taxation, and lower unemployment benefit replacement rates.
J88|From deregulation to re-regulation : trend reversal in German labour market institutions and its possible implications|"""From the mid-1980s until 2005 the German labour market was characterised by continuous deregulation. In the period of an improving German labour market, the German governments have since imposed measures to re-regulate the labour market in order to strengthen employees' rights. At the same time one can observe a tendency towards atypical forms of employment and an increase in low-wage employment. Two closely interrelated questions arise: What role did deregulation play with respect to the overall improvement of the German labour market and shifts in the employment structure? How could re-regulation impact labour market performance and employment structure in the future? The paper presents evidence that institutional reforms were an important driver of the improvement of the German labour market as well as of changes in the employment structure but definitely not the only one. This result suggests that with regard to the potential effects of recent re-regulation neither concerns about severe job losses nor hopes for a much better quality of jobs should be overestimated.""

J88|Impact of labour market reforms on economic activity in European Union: short term costs and long term benefits|The main objective of this paper was to quantify the long- and short-term impacts of labour market reforms on economic activity in EU countries, including Croatia. Therefore, we derived a model using the pooled mean group estimator (PMG) for the period from 2000 to 2011. Before performing dynamic panel analysis based on the PMG estimator, the unit root and panel cointegration tests were performed. According to the results, labour market reforms have positive and statistically significant long-term impact on GDP per capita. On the other hand, labour market reforms also have a statistically significant and negative effect on GDP per capita in the short-run. Control variables (industrial production and the rate of the active population) also have significant impacts on GDP per capita. In addition to econometric analysis, we also present an overview of empirical and theoretical research on labour market reforms in developed, developing and transition countries.
J88|Pooling Multiple Case Studies Using Synthetic Controls: An Application to Minimum Wage Policies|We propose a simple, distribution-free method for pooling synthetic control case studies using the mean percentile rank. We also test for heterogeneous treatment effects using the distribution of estimated ranks, which has a known form. We propose a cross-validation based procedure for model selection. Using 29 cases of state minimum wage increases between 1979 and 2013, we find a sizable, positive and statistically significant effect on the average teen wage. We do detect heterogeneity in the wage elasticities, consistent with differential bites in the policy. In contrast, the employment estimates suggest a small constant effect not distinguishable from zero.
J88|The minimum wage versus the earned income tax credit for reducing poverty|Minimum wage increases are not an effective mechanism for reducing poverty. And there is little causal evidence that they do so. Most workers who gain from minimum wage increases do not live in poor (or near-poor) families, while some who do live in poor families lose their job as a result of such increases. The earned income tax credit is an effective way to reduce poverty. It raises only the after-tax wage rates of workers in low- and moderate-income families, its tax credit increases with the number of dependent children, and evidence shows that it increases labor force participation and employment in these families.
J88|How are minimum wages set?|The minimum wage has never been as high on the political agenda as it is today, with politicians in Germany, the UK, the US, and other OECD countries calling for substantial increases in the rate. One reason for the rising interest is the growing consensus among economists and policymakers that minimum wages, set at the right level, may help low-paid workers without harming employment prospects. But how should countries set their minimum wage rate? The processes that countries use to set their minimum wage rate and structure differ greatly, as do the methods for adjusting it. The different approaches have merits and shortcomings.
J88|Egalitarianism Policy and Effective Demand under Globalization|The study examines egalitarianism policies in terms of the relationship between labor and capital and extends the model developed by the economist Bowles. We introduce the demand factor to the Bowles model (2012), which discussed the effectiveness of the income and asset redistribution policies in a global economy. The improvement of productivity and the decrease in the ratio of monitoring labor through asset-based redistribution increase the real wage rate because of its lure for foreign capital. At this point in the Bowles model, the labor supply increases and then employment increases. In contrast, in our model, with the addition of the demand factor, the improvement of productivity increases employment, but the decrease in monitoring labor does not always increase employment as both demand and supply increase. This means that asset-based redistribution in a global economy is not always effective.
J88|Labor Clauses in Regional Trade Agreements and Effects on Labor Conditions: An Empirical Analysis|his paper attempts to perform an empirical analysis of the effects of “labor clauses” provided in bilateral or plurilateral trade agreements (or regional trade agreements: RTAs) on working conditions that laborers in the RTA signatory countries actually face, using macro-level data for a wide variety of countries. The paper first reexamines the labor-provision classification of 223 RTAs in force proposed in the author’s other study (Kamata, 2014) by reviewing the texts of a selected set of those RTAs, and re-defines “RTAs with labor clauses” according to two criteria: (i) the agreement urges or expects the signatory countries to harmonize their domestic labor standards with internationally recognized standards, and (ii) the agreement stipulates the procedures for consultations and/or dispute settlement on labor-condition issues between the signatory countries. Based on this RTA labor-clause (re-)classification, this paper then estimates the impacts of a country’s trade intensities with partners of RTAs with labor clauses and of those without on four measured working conditions in the country: average earnings, average work hours, fatal occupational injury rate, and the number of the ILO’s fundamental conventions ratified. The empirical result indicates that RTAs with labor clauses do not differ from RTAs without labor clauses in the direction of their impacts (improving or worsening) on actual working conditions, and trade intensity with RTA partners should not have a statistically significant impact on the country’s working conditions regardless of whether or not those RTAs include labor clauses. It, however, may be premature to conclude that RTA labor clauses are not effective, since there should be some technical issues inherent in the method and data employed in the current study.
J88|NEETs Analysis in Romania|In the last few years the policies and the strategies were created in order to reduce social exclusion. For this purpose problems faced by youths concerning education and employment are defined by the acronym NEET. This article describes and analyzes the evolution of the NEET marker in Romania compared to UE countries. To reduce the number of NEET youths it is of foremost importance that the youths feel part of the inclusion process. It is vital the creation of a financial and educational policy tailored to meet the young people needs as a long term goal with the purpose of reducing the percent of unemployed youths or those lacking any form of professional training after finishing school. Practically everything is reduced to the establishment of trust relationships between youths and their teachers.
J88|Persistence of informality in a developing country|Informality is a common phenomenon in developing countries and an unusual one in industrialized countries. The persistence of informal employment is indicative of the impossibility of moving out of this status for a certain period of time. Using pseudo panel data, empirical evidence is presented to show that this phenomenon occurs in a developing country like Colombia where education helps mitigate said persistent occurrence. The authors also present evidence that a minimum salary increase does not only result in increased informality, but also increases the persistence of informality. This kind of evidence can be used for discussing the persistence of informality in other developing countries.
J88|The impact of minimum wage on employment in an economic downturn using data from 17 OECD countries for the period 1985-2008|The impact of minimum wage on employment has been a field of conflicts among economists in labor economics. This divergence of views usually takes the form of conflicting empirical studies. However, in our research we managed to find only one study on the employment effect of minimum wages during economic recessions using cross-country evidence. In this paper we try to investigate this issue using a sample of 17 OECD countries with data for the period 1985-2008. We also try to account for institutional and other policy related differences that might have an impact on employment other than the minimum wage. Our empirical analysis points a positive effect of minimum wage on employment and labor force participation rate for teenagers, young adults and youth, but negative effect for the prime-aged and those who belong in the age group 55-64 years old. Regarding the economic circle, we find that, generally in economic downturns our initial results for all age groups do not change significantly.
J88|Employment protection and collective bargaining during the great recession: a comprehensive review of international evidence|In this article, we present information from a unique database of labour market reforms implemented in 111 developed and developing countries between 2008 and 2014. We show that the number of reforms implemented each year has gradually increased up to 2012 and that the majority of reforms were passed in advanced economies – with some EU member states particularly hit by the crisis being the most active reformers (e.g. Spain, Greece, Italy). Moreover, the results show that permanent contracts and collective bargaining were the most popular areas of labour market policy interventions and that the majority of reforms decreased the strictness of employment protection legislation – although large disparities emerge across world regions in this respect. Finally, the article compares our database to different indicators of employment regulation in order to check the consistency of our results.
J88|Arbeit – Politik – Recht: Das Recht(ssystem) als Forschungsdesiderat in den Arbeitsbeziehungen – Einleitung zum Schwerpunktheft|Das deutsche System der industriellen Beziehungen weist im internationalen Vergleich gemeinhin ein hohes Mass an Verrechtlichung auf. Umso ueberraschender ist der Umstand, dass das Recht und seine Akteure, Institutionen und Verfahren in der Forschung ueber Arbeitsbeziehungen seit Jahrzehnten wenig explizite Aufmerksamkeit erfahren. Die Forschung ueber industrielle Beziehungen kann davon profitieren, diese rechtsbezogenen Prozesse des Wandels in den Blick zu nehmen. Mit dem hier vorgelegten Schwerpunktheft moechten wir dazu einladen, das Recht, seine Institutionen, Akteure und Verfahren, explizit als Bestandteil der Analyse industrieller Beziehungen zu verstehen. Wir versammeln Beitraege aus den verschiedenen Disziplinen, um einen Einstieg in die Debatte zu forcieren. Der Beitrag von Ulrich Walwei befasst sich mit dem Phaenomen der Verrechtlichung als Verstaatlichung und diskutiert aus einer klassischen „law-and-economics“-Perspektive, welche marktbezogenen Effekte von der politisch hoch umstrittenen Re-Regulierung des Arbeitsmarktes zu erwarten sind. Im Ergebnis raet er dazu, politische Hoffnungen oder Befuerchtungen in die eine oder andere Richtung nicht zu ueberhoehen. Norbert Cyrus und Markus Kip behandeln am Beispiel von Beschaeftigten mit prekaerem Aufenthaltsstatus das Problem der Rechtsmobilisierung. Welche Restriktionen lassen sich konstatieren, und welchen Beitrag koennen (und wollen) Gewerkschaften leisten, die Defizite zu ueberwinden? Die Frage der Rechtsmobilisierung adressiert das Phaenomen der Justizialisierung und duerfte insbesondere auch fuer die Debatte ueber die Revitalisierung der Gewerkschaften von grosser Relevanz sein. Auch Nadine Absenger und Daniel Seikel befassen sich mit dem Phaenomen der Justizialisierung. In einer interdisziplinaeren Kooperation aus Rechts- und Politikwissenschaft diskutieren sie die Frage, welche Auswirkungen die Rechtsprechung des EuGH auf das deutsche Tarifvertragssystem hat. Dabei kommen sie zu einem ambivalenten Befund. Waehrend individuelle Arbeitnehmerrechte haeufig gestaerkt werden, werden die kollektiven Selbstbestimmungsrechte und damit die Handelungsfreiheit der Tarifparteien empfindlich beschraenkt. Ralf Rogowski schliesslich widmet sich in seinem Beitrag der Herausbildung eines transnationalen oder globalen arbeitsrechtlichen Raumes. Mit der Idee des „reflexive labour law“ knuepft er dabei an die systemtheoretischen Traditionen der Rechtssoziologie an.
J88|Von der Deregulierung zur Re-Regulierung: Trendwende im Arbeitsrecht und ihre Konsequenzen fuer den Arbeitsmarkt (From deregulation to re-regulation: A turn around in German labour law and its possible implications)|"Der Zeitraum von Mitte der achtziger Jahre des letzten Jahrhunderts bis zum Ende der ersten Dekade des neuen Jahrtausends war durch eine fortwaehrende Deregulierung des Arbeitsrechts gekennzeichnet. Die aktuelle, wie auch die vorhergehende Bundesregierung leiteten zuletzt eine Re-Regulierung ein, die auf eine Staerkung von Arbeitnehmerrechten zielt. Dies geschah vor dem Hintergrund einer sich in der letzten Dekade deutlich verbessernden Arbeitsmarktlage. Gleichzeitig gewannen aber auch sog. ""atypische Erwerbsformen"" und Niedriglohnbeschaeftigung an Bedeutung. Damit stellen sich zwei Fragen, die eng zusammenhaengen: Welche Rolle spielte die Deregulierung des Arbeitsrechts mit Blick auf die Verbesserung der Arbeitsmarktlage und die veraenderte Struktur der Beschaeftigung? Wie koennte sich die gerade vollziehende Re-Regulierung in den beiden genannten Dimensionen auswirken? Das Papier liefert Hinweise, dass Deregulierung ein wichtiger, aber sicher nicht der einzige Treiber fuer Verbesserungen am Arbeitsmarkt und Umschichtungen in der Beschaeftigung war. Das Ergebnis legt damit nahe, dass weder die mit einer Re-Regulierung verbundene Befuerchtung von Jobverlusten noch die damit im Zusammenhang stehenden Hoffnungen in Richtung einer hoeheren Qualitaet der Beschaeftigung ueberschaetzt werden duerfen. (In the period from the mid 1980s until 2005 the German labour market was characterised by continual deregulation. The previous as well as the present German governments have recently imposed measures to re-regulate the labour market aimed at more protection for workers. This is happening in a period in which the German labour market has significantly improved. At the same time one can observe a tendency towards more atypical employment forms and an increase in low-wage employment. Two questions arise which are closely connected: What role did deregulation play with respect to the overall improvement of the German labour market and with respect to shifts in the composition of employment? And what may be the possible impacts of re-regulation in future with respect to both labour market performance and employment composition? The paper presents evidence that deregulation was obviously one important driver of the improvement of the German labour market as well as of shifts in employment but definitely not the only one. This result suggests that with regard to the potential effects of recent re-regulation neither concerns with respect to job losses nor hopes concerning less precarious employment should be overestimated.)"
J88|Oeffentliche Auftragsvergabe – eine neue Arena der industriellen Beziehungen? Konzeptionelle ueberlegungen und erste empirische Befunde (Public procurement – a new industrial relations arena? Conceptual considerations and preliminary empirical findings)|Mit dem Bedeutungszuwachs der oeffentlichen Auftragsvergabe werden Entscheidungen ueber Arbeitsbedingungen zunehmend jenseits der eingespielten Formen des Interessenausgleichs getroffen. Welche Verfahren der Entscheidungsfindung sich hier herausbilden und wie dies die etablierten Macht- und Interessenstrukturen in den industriellen Beziehungen veraendert, ist Kernfrage des Beitrags. Er zielt zudem darauf, Einflussfaktoren, Gegenstaende, Akteure und Mechanismen der Entscheidungsfindung im Bereich der oeffentlichen Auftragsvergabe in systematisierender Weise zu beschreiben und auf diese Weise zu einem besseren Verstaendnis der Konturen dieser emergenten Arena der industriellen Beziehungen beizutragen. Die Auswertung erster empirischer Studien zu Deutschland, Daenemark und Grossbritannien ergibt, dass die gezielte Nutzung der Auftragsvergabe als Instrument der Arbeitsmarktregulierung laenderuebergreifend auf grosse Huerden stoesst, und die traditionell staerker ausgepraegten Mitbestimmungsrechte von Arbeitnehmern in Deutschland und vor allem Daenemark in dieser emergenten Arena der industriellen Beziehungen bislang nur bedingt zum Tragen kommen. (As public procurement becomes ever more important, decisions on working and employment conditions are increasingly being taken outside of the established forms of interest reconciliation. Core questions of this article are: what new decision-making processes are emerging and what effects are they having on the established power structures and interest representation bodies in industrial relations? It also seeks to systematically describe the factors influencing decision-making in public procurement, the objects of that decision-making and the actors and mechanisms involved. Analyses of first empirical studies of Germany, Denmark and the UK show that the use of public procurement as an instrument of labour market regulation across countries comes up against major hurdles and that the traditionally stronger codetermination rights enjoyed by workers in Germany and, particularly, Denmark have to date had only a limited effect in this emerging industrial relations arena.)
J88|Der Einfluss industrieller Beziehungen auf die Arbeitsmarktstruktur – Ein Essay (The influence of industrial relations on labour market structure – An essa|In Deutschland hat sich in den vergangenen 20 Jahren ein hohes Mass an Arbeitsmarktdifferenzierung nach Loehnen und Arbeitsvertraegen durchgesetzt. Die Beitraege dieses Sonderbands befassen sich mit betrieblichen, tarifpolitischen und staatlichen Ansaetzen der Gegensteuerung. Unser Essay stellt erstens die veraenderten Rahmenbedingungen der industriellen Beziehungen in Deutschland vor und erarbeitet zweitens einen ueberblick ueber die theoretischen Ansaetze und empirischen Ergebnisse der Aufsaetze. Sie unterscheiden sich in ihren sozialtheoretischen Grundannahmen ebenso wie in den Diagnosen und Prognosen: So konstatieren einige Beitraege eher stabilisierende Effekte der Regulierung auf die Ungleichheitsstruktur waehrend andere Nivellierungstendenzen und Gestaltungsoptionen fuer die Zukunft betonen. Unser Essay plaediert abschliessend fuer die Relevanz oekonomischer Kategorien in der Analyse industrieller Beziehungen. (In the last 20 years, the German labour market has developed a high degree of stratification with respect to income and wage contracts. The contributions to this special issue discuss approaches to counteract these tendencies at the micro-, meso- and macro-levels. Our essay firstly summarises the changing context for industrial relations and secondly develops an overview of the theoretical approaches and empirical findings presented in the articles in this volume. The articles differ with respect to their social-theoretical frameworks as well as their diagnoses and prognoses: some contributions claim stabilising effects on stratification while others emphasise levelling tendencies and options for change in the future. In our concluding remarks we argue in favour of strengthening economic categories in the analysis of industrial relations.)
J88|Working time arrangements and family time of fathers: How work organization(s) shape fathers’ opportunities to engage in childcare|This analysis takes the diagnosis of a gap between German fathers’ attitudes and practices as starting point to analyze the influence of the work organization on a father’s time with his children. With qualitative interview data and quantitative diary data, the fathers´ ideals and their practices are confronted systematically. It is found that fathers´ work time arrangements may influence the availability of time they have for their children. Here, not only the amount of time is crucial but also the possibilities for the flexible organization of work. However, work organizations influence childcare practices mainly through the work culture which shapes the employed fathers´ anticipated options.
J88|La reforma laboral de 2012 y el crecimiento del empleo a tiempo parcial involuntario. ¿Nuevos mecanismos de ajuste del mercado de trabajo?|El empleo a tiempo parcial (ETP), especialmente el de carácter involuntario, ha crecido notablemente durante la crisis. Algunos trabajos vinculan esta situación con su uso empresarial como mecanismo de flexibilidad, al permitir ajustar las horas de trabajo a la evolución del ciclo. Por otra parte, la reforma laboral de 2012 ha introducido importantes mecanismos de flexibilidad interna para las empresas, especialmente en relación con el tiempo de trabajo. El objetivo del artículo será doble. Primero, determinar en qué medida están cambiando los determinantes del ETP, sustituyéndose su rol habitual como opción voluntaria de compatibilización por otro involuntario como mecanismo de flexibilización. Segundo, analizar el papel desempeñado por la reforma de 2012 en la explicación de estas tendencias. Los resultados señalan que, aunque se han producido cambios profundos en el perfil del ETP, resulta cuestionable que se fundamenten en los contenidos de la reforma laboral. Al contrario, parece que son las propias consecuencias de la crisis las responsables de estos cambios.
J88|SMARTer Indicators for Decent Work in a Post-2015 Development Agenda: A Discussion and a Proposal|The aim of this paper is to contribute to the ongoing discussion about the design of a post-2015 development framework by proposing indicators to monitor employment outcomes. Our analysis of the current MDG employment indicators shows that measurement problems, the inappropriate use of aggregate statistics, ambiguous interpretability, and assumptions that often do not hold true in the context of developing countries are major shortcomings of the current indicators. Based on this critique, we develop a new set of indicators for productive employment and decent work. We propose four indicators: (i) the growth of labor value added per worker, (ii) the working poverty rate, (iii) (a) the share of workers receiving less than an absolute labor income and (b) the share of workers receiving less than 60 percent of the median labor income. We demonstrate the empirical application of these indicators using the country cases of Uganda and Peru.
J88|Hiring Workers with Disabilities when a Quota Requirement Exists: The Relevance of Firm’s Size|We evaluate the impact of a mandatory quota of workers with disabilities using a sharp regression discontinuity design. We use data from a panel of Spanish firms where there is a mandatory quota of 2 % for firms with 50 or more workers. Non-parametric estimations show that strictly beyond the cut-off of 50 workers there is an increase of 1.4 points in the percentage of workers with disabilities in the firm, just fulfilling the quota of 2 %. However, this effect has some lack of precision. In addition, for larger firm’s sizes the variation in the percentage of workers with disabilities is likely related with differences in firms’ characteristics. dependence and endogenous initial conditions.
J88|The Whistleblowing Policies in Romania’s Labour Law|Whistleblowers are workers or civil servants who identify illegal or immoral acts in the public institution or the company they work in, and choose to report them to the competent bodies of the state. The consequence of their act can be sacrificing one’s own career, or even their social life. However, society owes them so very much, and it is normal to create a mechanism to protect whistleblowers against the potential retaliation of the organization – or of the representatives of the public institution – in relation to which they violated their confidentiality obligation. The paper includes a compared law analysis of the means to protect whistleblowers, in an attempt to identify weak points in the Romanian legislation. It also comprises an analysis of the concrete ways in which the legislation that protects whistleblowers public servants is applied in Romanian public institutions. Proposals to define and clarify the circumstances of whistleblowing acts that are susceptible of protection, and de lege ferenda proposals meant to extend and render more efficient their protection if the Romanian institutions have been formulated.
J88|Labour Law and Inclusive Development|This paper, based on the V.V. Giri Memorial Lecture for 2013, argues that labour law should be seen as a developmental institution, capable of promoting both equality and efficiency, and hence inclusive development. Labour law rules, precisely because they redress the inequality of bargaining power inherent in the employment relationship, may promote economic efficiency, since they counteract the effects of contractual incompleteness, while mitigating labour market risks. The World Bank view that laws designed to help workers often harm them is neither theoretically well informed nor empirically supported. There is a need for new thinking to escape the intellectual rigidities currently afflicting labour law.
J88|The selected issues of labour market policy in Germany – implementation possibilities in Poland|The author in the article presents the conditionings and the main changes introduced through labour market reforms implemented in Germany since the activity of the Hartz Commission. There were presented the components of all four Hartz Reforms and the directions of its continuation after 2005. The aim of the publication is to determine, which of the German solutions are possible to implement in the Polish economic and social conditionings. The research method undertaken in that paper was the analysis of secondary data – both statistical as well as reports and publications connected with German labour market policy.
J88|Employee Satisfaction, Labor Market Flexibility, and Stock Returns Around The World|"We study the relationship between employee satisfaction and abnormal stock returns around the world, using lists of the ""Best Companies to Work For"" in 14 countries. We show that employee satisfaction is associated with positive abnormal returns in countries with high labor market flexibility, such as the U.S. and U.K., but not in countries with low labor market flexibility, such as Germany. These results are consistent with high employee satisfaction being a valuable tool for recruitment, retention, and motivation in flexible labor markets, where firms face fewer constraints on hiring and firing. In contrast, in regulated labor markets, legislation already provides minimum standards for worker welfare and so additional expenditure may exhibit diminishing returns. The results have implications for the differential profitability of socially responsible investing (""SRI"") strategies around the world. In particular, they emphasize the importance of taking institutional features into account when forming such strategies."
J88|Fair Trade in the Fields of Florida: The Impact of the Penny-Per-Pound on Tomato Pickers|Despite the enduring appeal of fair trade activism, little evidence exists on its effectiveness in improving producer welfare. This paper provides evidence on the direct effects of a fair trade premium on its target beneficiaries, using the case of the Penny-Per-Pound, a program that increased the piece-rate wages received by tomato pickers in Florida. It highlights that in output-constraint settings, common in agriculture, a piece-rate compensation scheme can result in externalities among workers. By inadvertently incentivizing the workers to increase their effort whereas the total output is fixed, the program amplified the externality and generated unforeseen risks for worker displacement.
J88|Policy Myopia and Labour Market Institutions|In the public debate, poor employment performance has often been associated with the existence of extensive labour market regulations and a lack of commitment to far- sighted public policies. This paper investigates the relation between policy myopia and labour market institutions. We develop a theoretical model in which policy myopia leads an incumbent government to choose institutions that allow the creation of rents in the labour market and reduce resources available to public goods provision and social expenditure. We test these predictions empirically using panel data for 21 OECD countries for the period 1985{2006. We show that policy myopia is associated with more regulated labour markets, lower unemployment bene t replacement rates, and smaller tax wedges on labour.
J88|Aspectos de la evolución reciente de los mercados laborales de América Latina y el Caribe|En este artículo se presentan tres hechos estilizados que caracterizaron a la evolución de los mercados laborales de América Latina y el Caribe en el período comprendido entre 2003 y 2012 y que representan quiebres de tendencia respecto de la evolución previa. Se argumenta que estos cambios se relacionan con el contexto económico-productivo y el marco político-institucional. Se muestra cómo la magnitud y las pautas del crecimiento económico incidieron en las características de la generación de empleo, subrayando la repercusión de cambios entre y dentro de los sectores económicos y de los segmentos de diferentes niveles de productividad. Asimismo, se enfatiza el aporte de los cambios en la institucionalidad laboral a la evolución de los indicadores laborales. Finalmente, se destacan los últimos avances y las debilidades persistentes en el desempeño laboral, y también algunos factores que constituyen riesgos para la continuidad de las recientes tendencias laborales favorables.
J88|You get what you pay for: Schooling incentives and child labor|Can schooling promotion deter child participation in hazardous forms of child labor? We examine two interventions intended to promote schooling and deter child labor for children associated with carpet factories in Kathmandu. The first intervention provides scholarships for school-related expenses. The second provides the scholarship and an in-kind stipend conditional on school attendance. Paying for schooling expenses promotes schooling but only at the beginning of the school year when most schooling expenses occur. The scholarship combined with the conditional stipend increases school attendance rates by 11%, decreases grade failure rates by 46%, and reduces carpet weaving by 48%. Financial support lasted one year. Effects on schooling and weaving do not persist past the year of support. “You get what you pay for” when schooling incentives are used to combat hazardous child labor.
J88|Expanding Federal Family and Medical Leave Coverage: Who Benefits from Changes in Eligibility Requirements?|The Family and Medical Leave Act provides job-protected, unpaid leave to employees in firms with 50 or more employees. However, coverage and eligibility restrictions result in 49.3 million employees (44.1 percent) in the private sector being ineligible for leave in 2012. This paper looks at eligibility by demographic characteristics and finds that the probability of being eligible increases with educational attainment. Young men with high school degrees or less had the lowest rate of FMLA eligibility of all the demographic groups. Our analysis of the FMLA Employee and Workplace surveys examines various proposals to expand eligibility coverage. Expanding FMLA coverage to smaller employers and to employees working fewer hours would increase access to job-protected leave for 1.4 million to 8.3 million more employees in the private sector. Women of childbearing age would especially benefit from an expansion in eligibility coverage.
J88|Expanding Family and Medical Leave to Small Firms|The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) gives eligible employees the right to take job-protected, unpaid leave to bond with a new child, care for a family member or military service member, or for one’s own serious illness for up to 12 weeks in a year. About 60 million private sector employees (55.9 percent) were eligible for family and medical leave under the FMLA in 2012. However, more than two-in-five private sector employees do not have access to job-protected leave because they are employed by small employers, which are exempt from the FMLA, and/or because they do not meet the tenure and hours worked requirements for eligibility. If the FMLA were amended to cover all firms and worksites regardless of size, an estimated 34.1 million private-sector employees would gain access to job-protected family and medical leave, if they otherwise meet the eligibility requirements relating to length of tenure and hours of work.
J88|Documenting the Need for a National Paid Family and Medical Leave Program: Evidence from the 2012 FMLA Survey|The United States is the only high-income country that does not mandate paid family and medical leave. Instead American workers rely on a patchwork of employer-provided benefits, private insurance, state programs, public assistance, and savings to make ends meet during a leave event. About 30 percent of private-sector employees taking unpaid leave incur debt as result of their leave. More than 2.5 million employees cannot afford to take leave to care for self, a family member with a serious health condition, during pregnancy, to bond with a new child, or to care for an injured military service member every year. Our analysis of the Department of Labor’s 2012 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) Survey found that 12.6 percent of private-sector employees took family and medical leave in 2012, while 4.5 percent had unmet leave needs. This means that one-in-four employees needing leave had their leave needs unmet in the past 12 months. Not being able to afford unpaid leave (49.4 percent) and the risk of loss of job (18.3 percent) were the two most common reasons given for not taking needed leave. Employees with children living at home and female employees had the greatest need for leave, but also had the highest rates of unmet leave.
J88|Women, Working Families, and Unions|One of every nine women in the United States (11.8 percent in 2013) is represented by a union at her place of work. The annual number of hours of paid work performed by women has increased dramatically over the last four decades. In 1979, the typical woman was on the job 925 hours per year; by 2012, the typical woman did 1,664 hours of paid work per year. Meanwhile, women's share of unpaid care work and housework has remained high. Various time-use studies conclude that women continue to do about two-thirds of unpaid child-care (and elder-care) work and at least 60 percent of routine housework. The research reviewed here suggests that unions can provide substantial support to women trying to balance their paid work and their unpaid care responsibilities.
J88|Business As Usual: New Jersey Employers’ Experiences with Family Leave Insurance|This study examines New Jersey employers’ experiences with employees who need time off to care for a seriously ill child or family member or to bond with a new baby since 2009, when the state began offering paid family leave through the statewide Family Leave Insurance (FLI) program. This program builds on the state’s Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) Program, which has been in place since 1948 and has covered maternity leave since 1970. Since 2009, New Jersey has provided benefits for more than 100,000 FLI leaves, the vast majority of which were used for the care of new babies. This study examines how this relatively new, statewide program has affected employers’ processes for administering and managing employee leaves. Does the program generate excessive paperwork, for instance, or burden employers in other ways? Is the program being abused, as some initially feared? And how, if at all, has it helped employers?
J88|The Affordable Care Act: A Family-Friendly Policy|Most of the discussion of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has focused on the extent to which it has extended health insurance coverage to the formerly uninsured. This is certainly an important aspect of the law. However by allowing people to buy insurance through the exchanges and extending Medicaid coverage to millions of people, the ACA also largely ends workers’ dependence on their employer for insurance. This gives tens of millions of people the option to change their job, to work part-time, or take time off to be with young children or family members in need of care, or to retire early.
J88|Changes in Labour Market Transitions in Ireland over the Great Recession|This paper assesses the impact that the 2009 Great Recession had on individual's transitions to and from unemployment in Ireland. The rate of transition from unemployment to employment declined between 2006 and 2011, while the rate from employment to unemployment increased. The impact of some of the factors identified as contributing to the likelihood of a transition taking place were found to have changed over this period. In particular, young people are much less likely to exit unemployment, but at the same time they have a lower risk of becoming unemployed. Education has become an increasingly important factor in both supporting unemployment exits and reducing the risk of becoming unemployed since the recession. The scarring impact of long-term unemployment appears to have fallen substantially in Ireland post-recession. The results from a decomposition analysis show that compositional changes are largely unimportant in explaining the change in the transition rates between 2006 and 2011.
J88|Labor Market Deregulation and Female Employment: Evidence from a Natural Experiment in Japan|"This paper provides novel evidence on the causal effect on female employment of labor market deregulation by using the 1985 amendments to the Labor Standards Law (LSL) in Japan as a natural experiment. The original LSL of 1947 prohibited women from working overtime exceeding two hours a day; six hours a week; and 150 hours a year. The 1985 amendments exempted a variety of occupations and industries from such overtime restriction on women. We first define ""jobs"" using an industry by occupation matrix. For each job (close to 5,000 jobs in total), we carefully identify whether or not it was made exempt from the overtime restriction on women by the 1985 amendments. Applying a difference-in-difference model to census data, we find a statistically significant and economically meaningful impact on female employment of this particular piece of labor market deregulation. Furthermore the 1985 treatment is found to have a lasting and growing impact on female employment. Our finding is consistent with the recent literature that points to the importance of paying particular attention to the issues surrounding working hours when policymakers design public policy to promote female employment."

J88|Designing labor market regulations in developing countries|Governments regulate employment to protect workers and to improve labor market efficiency. However, employment regulations can be controversial, often complicated by opposing ideological views. Thus, it is important for policymakers in developing countries to base decisions on empirical evidence of the impacts of these regulations. The majority of the evidence suggests that most countries have set their regulations in the appropriate range. But it can be costly when countries either overregulate or underregulate their labor market.
J88|The effect of overtime regulations on employment|Regulation of standard workweek hours and overtime hours and pay can protect workers who might otherwise be required to work more than they would like to at the going rate. By discouraging the use of overtime, such regulation can increase the standard hourly wage of some workers and encourage work sharing that increases employment, with particular advantages for female workers. However, regulation of overtime raises employment costs, setting in motion economic forces that can limit, neutralize, or even reduce employment. And increasing the coverage of overtime pay regulations has little effect on the share of workers who work overtime or on weekly overtime hours per worker.
J88|Occupational Standards – Key Concept for Labour Market|The globalization, the scientific and technique revolution, the important modifications in organizational culture and business ethics determine the development of a labour market more and more demanding. The occupational standards represent one of the answers to these challenges, pointing out both economical and social aspects. The working paper analyses the occupational standards functions, the conceptual framework, as well as the Romania alignment to the UE recommendations in this matter. The author has experience in occupational analysis, occupational and qualification standards, due to her participation in two projects developed in this area.
J88|Routinization and the Decline of the U.S. Minimum Wage|The U.S. minimum wage declined in real terms since the late 1970s. In the same time, the wage of the least skilled workers fell in real terms, while the wage of the highest skilled workers increased. To shed light on these issues, I use a simple model of routinization. High-ability workers, after having received additional education, can substitute low-ability co-workers by machines. Technical progress results in more high-ability workers receiving additional education and in a declining wage for low-ability workers. A government opposes both unemployment and wage inequality. I calibrate the model and show that technical progress induces the government to lower the minimum wage. Hence, the model contributes to understand the decline in the U.S. minimum wage.
J88|Employee Satisfaction, Labor Market Flexibility, and Stock Returns Around The World|We study the relationship between employee satisfaction and abnormal stock returns around the world, using lists of the “Best Companies to Work For” in 14 countries. We show that employee satisfaction is associated with positive abnormal returns in countries with high labor market flexibility, such as the U.S. and U.K., but not in countries with low labor market flexibility, such as Germany. These results are consistent with high employee satisfaction being a valuable tool for recruitment, retention, and motivation in flexible labor markets, where firms face fewer constraints on hiring and firing. In contrast, in regulated labor markets, legislation already provides minimum standards for worker welfare and so additional expenditure may exhibit diminishing returns. The results have implications for the differential profitability of socially responsible investing (“SRI”) strategies around the world. In particular, they emphasize the importance of taking institutional features into account when forming such strategies.

J88|Mechanisms for the Formulation and Implementation of Employment Policy in Argentina|The paper identifies and assesses the mechanisms used to formulate and to implement the employment policy in Argentina. Specifically, it investigates the range of factors that have had a direct or indirect effect on determining the institutional organization surrounding such policies, as well as the context in which the mechanisms of employment policy have been developed. It also reviews the structure of employment policy and how it functions, as well as the main challenges to its consolidation as a component of a development strategy. The following factors are identified and described: a) mechanisms for tripartite coordination and coordination across jurisdictions and sectors; b) pillars essential to supporting employment policy, such as inspection, vocational education and training, and public employment services, as well as information, management and assessment systems; and c) accountability mechanisms.
J88|The Effect of Maritime Security Regime (ISPS Code) on World Supply of Seafarers|The efforts of IMO on the security of ports and ships after 11/9 are presented. IMO’s resolution on fatigue of crews -cause of marine accidents- is also presented. The introduction of ISPS code -carried out under the pressure of USA- made by a non holistic approach, created a number of issues involving and affecting seafarers. IMO and ILO, and other industry’s organizations, but USA, tried subsequently to correct this repercussion. ISPS created four issues: the fair treatment of seafarers –especially serious in USA ports; shore leave; SUA and PSI conventions, which all changed seafarers’ working conditions, analyzed here. Important is also the ‘criminalization of seafarers’, which had the most serious impact on crews. Moreover, examined is the possible impact of MLC 2006 Convention -in force since 2013- on seafarers supply. The efforts of OECD countries and EU, to reverse the falling supply of well qualified marine officers in last 10 years or so, showing in 2010 a deficit of 13,000 officers, are shown. This problem is more acute when world fleet grows, as this was the situation between 2003 and early 2013. OECD, EU, but Greece, also worried for the possible transfer of “shipowning know-how” from them…
J88|Addressing Labour Market Segmentation: The Role of Labour Law|Labour market segmentation is problematic because of its links to poor job quality, inequality and discrimination, on the one hand, and inefficiency in resource allocations, on the other. Segmentation is the result of contractual ordering which is often privately efficient but socially sub-optimal. The law largely reflects the economics forces and social norms which give rise to segmentation, but can amplify and perpetuate its effects. The rise of atypical employment in some contexts and of informal employment in others is at least in part a response to the emergence of the standard employment relationship or SER as a legal model and normative benchmark for certain aspect of labour law, in particular employment protection legislation. Attempts to counter segmentation and informality by extending the scope of the SER, on the one hand, and by accepting atypical forms but aligning them more closely with the SER, on the other, have met with limited success. The most successful strategies for labour law reform are those based on an integrated policy approach in which some flexibilisation of employment protection rules is combined with complementary mechanisms for mutualising labour market risks, including collective bargaining, workplace social dialogue, work-life balance laws, work sharing arrangements, targeted fiscal reforms, and active labour market policy.
J88|Labour Law & Inclusive Development: the Economic Effects of Industrial Relations Laws in Middle-Income Countries|We use leximetric data coding techniques and panel data econometrics to test for the economic effects of laws governing worker representation and industrial action in the large middle-income countries of Brazil, China, India, Russia and South Africa. We find that more worker-protective laws on employee representation tend to be correlated with higher scores on the Human Development Index. By contrast, in the case of laws on industrial action, some negative effects on human development indicators are reported. Our findings imply that laws supporting employee voice and collective bargaining may have beneficial social effects in middle-income countries. We find no rise in unemployment due to more protective labour laws.
J88|The Legal Framework Governing Business Firms & its Implications for Manufacturing Scale & Performance: The UK Experience in International Perspective|This paper reviews empirical studies examining the economic effects of laws governing the formation, financing and organisation of business firms with the aim of putting the UK experience in a comparative perspective. The literature identifies two models of legal support for manufacturing which imply different directions for policy: on the one hand, the Silicon Valley model of venture capital funded growth which depends on liquid capital markets and flexible labour markets, and the northern European and Japanese model which is based on long-term innovation, stable ownership, and institutionalised worker-management cooperation. The UK has some of the legal features of the Silicon Valley model, but important parts are missing: for example, the Californian rule under which post-employment restraints ('restrictive covenants') are void on the grounds of their anti-competitive effects has no equivalent in the UK. Conversely, although the UK has certain elements of the northern European or east Asian model of institutionalised corporate governance, it is unlikely to be able to replicate the 'productive coalition' approach of these countries as long as the legal framework prioritises shareholder rights and the market for corporate control, and provides limited encouragement for job security. The Silicon Valley and 'productive coalition' models are ideal types which can distract from the fact that most countries, the UK included, are hybrid systems with some of the characteristics of each model. Rather than designing laws and policies exclusively with one model or the other in mind, it may be preferable to consider specific laws and policies on their own merits, while bearing in mind that a given legal rule or policy does not operate in isolation from others and that there may be some 'network effects' in operation due to the way that particular rules interact.
J88|Globalization and labor market institutions: International empirical evidence|A widespread concern is that labor market institutions erode in the course of globalization, which, in turn, decreases employment and wages. By using panel data and cross-sectional data, I investigate the influence of globalization on labor market regulation. I use the indicators of labor market institutions by Gwartney et al. (2012) and the KOF indices of globalization. To deal with potential reverse causality, I employ a system GMM panel estimator and use a constructed trade share as proposed by Frankel and Romer (1999) as an instrumental variable for globalization in cross-sectional models. The results do not show that globalization induced labor market deregulation.
J88|Segmentación del mercado de trabajo en la Argentina|En este artículo se analiza la segmentación laboral en el mercado de trabajo de la Argentina. Un mercado laboral está segmentado si trabajadores comparables arrojan diferencias en resultados (ejemplo, salarios), si sus mecanismos de fijación de remuneraciones difieren y si hay barreras que impiden la movilidad de los trabajadores. Se utilizan datos estáticos y dinámicos y se aplican diversos métodos (paramétricos y no paramétricos) para someter a prueba la existencia de segmentación laboral. Los resultados permiten repensar las políticas públicas que generan un impacto en el funcionamiento del mercado laboral.
J88|Structural change, collective action, and social unrest in 1930s Spain|The Spanish 2nd Republic (1931-1936) witnessed one of the fastest and deepest processes of popular mobilization in interwar Europe, generating a decisive reactionary wave that brought the country to the Civil War (1936-1939). We show in the paper that both contemporary comment and part of the historiography makes generalizations about the behaviour of the working classes in the period that stress idealistic, re-distributive and even religious motives to join movements of protest. In some other cases, state repression, poverty, and deteriorating living standards have been singled out as the main determinants of participation. This paper uses collective action theory to argue that key institutional changes and structural changes in labour markets were crucial to understand a significant part of the explosive popular mobilization of the period. We argue first that, before the second Republic, temporary migrants had been the main structural limitation against the stabilization of unions and collective bargaining in agricultural labour markets and in several service and industrial sectors. We then show how several industries underwent important structural changes since the late 1910s which stabilized part of the labour force and allowed for union growth and collective bargaining. In agricultural labour markets or in markets in which unskilled temporary workers could not be excluded, unions benefitted from republican legislation restricting temporary migrations and, as a consequence, rural unions saw large gains membership and participation. Historical narratives that focus on state repression or on changes in living standards to explain collective action and social conflict in Spain before the Civil War are incomplete without a consideration of the role of structural changes in labour markets from 1914 to 1931.
J88|A Skeptical View of Mechanisms for Business Cycle Harmonization in the Euro Area|The European Monetary Union brought with it a standardization of monetary policy and a system of fixed exchange rates. This was accompanied by disincentive effects which, in turn, resulted in serious economic distortions. Proposals are currently being made - not only by DIW Berlin - as to how compensatory payment mechanisms could be used to better synchronize the economic development of the member states in the euro area in future. The present article discusses some of the problems of such transfer systems in detail and, on the whole, evaluates such mechanisms far more skeptically than the previous two articles in this issue. Comprehensive compensatory payment systems are always associated with a risk of resource wastage. Furthermore, these systems can also have undesirable negative effects. The alternative to a compensatory payment system, some form of common European unemployment insurance, is not a workable solution since national benefits already act as automatic stabilizers. Such a move would ultimately only lead to a transfer of competences to the supranational level. This would be accompanied by a harmonization of national unemployment benefit systems and the deferral of control functions to a neutral European authority - and thus, more red tape. Moreover, the introduction of a common unemployment insurance scheme would, at least initially, result in a significant redistribution of resources, which could raise questions about distribution in the donor countries.
J88|Female Transition to Retirement|The European countries’ policies related to female participation in the labour market as well as approach to retirement ages have evolved in the course of the past two decades.This is the response to demographic, social and economic developments in Europe. After many decades of low and falling age of transition to retirement, women engage more in the labour market activity, and they also retire later. In this paper we look at the past and future evolution of transition from work to retirement of women. We also look at the current developments at the labour market as well as directions of changes in pension systems, from the gender equality perspective. Based on the set of labour market and pension system indicators, we propose a Pension Rights Gap Index that measures the distance to full pension rights scenario, taking into account wage levels and duration of employment as well as generosity and income redistribution mechanisms within pension systems.
J88|The Effect of Violence on Birth Outcomes: Evidence from Homicides in Rural Brazil|This paper uses microdata from Brazilian vital statistics natality and mortality data between 2000 and 2010 to estimate the impact of in-utero exposure to local violence -measured by homicide rates- on birth outcomes. Focusing on small communities, where it is more plausible that local homicide rates reflect actual exposure to violence, the analysis shows that exposure to violence during pregnancy leads to deterioration in birth outcomes: one extra homicide during the first trimester of pregnancy increases the probability of low birthweight by around 6 percent. Results are particularly pronounced among children of poorly educated mothers, implying that violence compounds the disadvantage that these children already suffer as a result of their households' lower socioeconomic status.
J88|Fiscal Effects of Minimum Wages: An Analysis for Germany| Against the background of the current discussion of statutory minimum wages in Germany, this paper analyzes the potential employment and fiscal effects of such a policy. Based on estimated labor demand elasticities obtained from a structural labor demand model, the empirical results imply that minimum wages in Germany will be associated with significant employment losses among marginal and low- and semi-skilled full-time workers. Even though minimum wages will lead to increased public revenues from income taxes and social security benefits, they will result in a significant fiscal burden, due to increased unemployment benefits and decreased revenues from corporate taxes.
