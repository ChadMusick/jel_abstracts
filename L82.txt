L82|Ratings, reviews, recommendations and the consumption of cultural goods|In this short paper, we elaborate on the importance of ratings, reviews and recommendations (short, 3R systems) for the consumption of cultural goods. Our aim is to provide a non-technical perspective on the issue informed by the existing literature on the topic.
L82|Media's Role in the Making of a Democrat: Evidence from East Germany|This paper explores the causal influence of media content on voting behavior. We exploit a natural experiment involving access to West German TV within the German Democratic Republic. Focusing on federal and state election outcomes in the post-reunification decade (i.e., a time at which TV content was harmonized), we find that municipalities that had access to Western TV broadcasts before reunification have lower vote shares for left-wing and right-wing extremist parties. With regard to potential channels, we provide evidence based on survey data that GDR citizens with access to West German TV were less loyal to the socialist regime, less hostile toward foreigners, and exhibited higher levels of social capital. Our findings thus support the notion that access to free media influences political attitudes and facilitates the consolidation of democracy.

L82|The Logic of Fear: Populism and Media Coverage of Immigrant Crimes|"We study how news coverage of immigrant criminality impacted municipality-level votes in the November 2009 ""minaret ban"" referendum in Switzerland. The campaign, successfully led by the populist Swiss People's Party, played aggressively on fears of Muslim immigration and linked Islam with terrorism and violence. We combine an exhaustive violent crime detection dataset with detailed information on crime coverage from 12 newspapers. The data allow us to quantify the extent of pre-vote media bias in the coverage of migrant criminality. We then estimate a theory-based voting equation in the cross-section of municipalities. Exploiting random variations in crime occurrences, we find a first-order, positive effect of news coverage on political support for the minaret ban. Counterfactual simulations show that, under a law forbidding newspapers to disclose a perpetrator's nationality, the vote in favor of the ban would have decreased by 5 percentage points (from 57.6% to 52.6%)."
L82|Paywalls and the demand for online news|The digitisation of society has posed a challenge to news outlets. Seeking advertising revenues and facing competition for the attention of their readers, many news outlets entered the digital era with unrestricted access to their online content. More recently, news outlets have sought to restrict the amount of content available for free. We quantify the impact of introducing a paywall on the demand for news in Norway. The short-run average impact of a paywall is negative and between 3 and 4%, in the long run the effect increases to between 9 and 11%. We find heterogeneity in the response to paywalls. The largest news outlet within its market experiences larger effects than the other news outlets. After introducing a paywall, the largest news outlets face a long-run reduction in demand between 13 and 15%, as compared to the others who experience a decrease of between 8 and 11%. The timing of introducing a paywall does not seem to affect the demand response very much.
L82|Persuasion on Networks|We analyze persuasion in a model, in which each receiver (of many) might buy a direct access to the sender's signal or to rely on her network connections to get the same information. For the sender, a more biased signal increases the impact per subscriber (direct receiver), yet diminishes the willingness of agents to become subscribers. Contrary to the naive intuition, the optimal propaganda might target peripheral, rather than centrally located agents, and is at its maximum level when the probability that information flows between agents is either zero, or nearly one, but not in-between. The density of the network has a non-monotonic effect on the optimal level of propaganda as well.
L82|Media Attention and Strategic Timing in Politics: Evidence from U.S. Presidential Executive Orders|Do politicians tend to adopt unpopular policies when the media and the public are distracted by other events? We examine this question by analyzing the timing of the signing of executive orders (EOs) by U.S. presidents over the past four decades. We ï¬ nd robust evidence that EOs are more likely to be signed on the eve of days when the news are dominated by other important stories that can crowd out coverage of EOs. Crucially, this relationship only holds in periods of divided government when unilateral presidential actions are more likely to be criticized by a hostile Congress. The eï¬?ect is driven by EOs that are more likely to make the news and to attract negative publicity, particularly those on topics on which president and Congress disagree. Finally, the timing of EOs appears to be related to predictable news but not to unpredictable ones, which suggests it results from a deliberate and forward-looking PR strategy.
L82|Digital Piracy under a Graduated Response Policy|Graduated response policies (e.g., three-strikes laws) are often adopted to deter repeated criminal activity. In 2009 France passed the Hadopi three-strikes law targeting digital piracy. We model the individual intertemporal decision to engage in illegal activity before and after receiving each strike and, contingent on this decision, the level of illegal content acquisition (piracy) within each stage. We find that monitoring efforts typically believed to deter criminal activity can have unintended results. For example, an increase in the probability of detection can increase piracy. An increase in the punishment is the only policy that unambiguously deters illegal activity.

L82|Linking content and technology: On the geography of innovation networks in the Bergen media cluster|This paper deals with the geography of innovation networks and analyses combinatorial knowledge dynamics from a single cluster perspective. Addressing firms in the media cluster in Bergen, Norway, we examine how and from where companies acquire and combine different types of knowledge for their innovation activities. The empirical analysis, which is based on structured interviews with 22 media companies, identifies two main types of cluster firms: media content providers that rely heavily on symbolic knowledge and media technology providers that draw mostly on synthetic knowledge. Even though they draw on different knowledge bases, the two types of firms are strongly interlinked in their innovation activities and source knowledge from each other. Furthermore, we find that synthetic firms constitute a gateway to the regional R&D system and that the region acts as key arena for the combination of dissimilar knowledge bases.

L82|Busy doing nothing: why politicians implement inefficient policies|Abstract A substantial body of literature suggests that politicians are blocked from implementing efficient reforms that solve substantial problems because of special interest groups or budget constraints. Despite the existing mechanisms that block potentially efficient reforms, real-world data show that a large number of new programs and policies are implemented every year in developed countries. These policies are often selective and considered to be fairly inefficient by ex post evaluation, and they tend to be small in size and scope. With this background, this paper studies the reasons why a rational politician would implement an inefficient public policy that is intended to obfuscate the difficulties in achieving reforms. The paper uses a simple competence signaling model that suggests that if an effective reform is impossible, engaging in strategic obfuscation through an inefficient program increases the probability of winning a re-election compared to doing nothing at all. This is because an inefficient reform does not lead voters to believe that the politician is incompetent, which a lack of action risks doing. Intentional inefficiency aiming to obfuscate the difficulty of efficient reforms can therefore complement the previous theories’ explanations of political failure.
L82|Do Tax Incentives Affect Business Location and Economic Development? Evidence from State Film Incentives|"I estimate the impacts of recently-popular U.S. state film incentives on filming location, film industry employment, wages, and establishments, and spillover impacts on related industries. I compile a detailed database of incentives, matching this with TV series and feature film data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and Studio System, and establishment and employment data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages and Country Business Patterns. I compare these outcomes in states before and after they adopt incentives, relative to similar states that did not adopt incentives over the same time period (a panel difference-in-differences). I find that TV series filming increases by 6.3 to 55.4% (at most 1.50 additional TV series) after incentive adoption. However, there is no meaningful effect on feature films, and employment, wages, and establishments in the film industry and in related industries. These results show that the ability for tax incentives to affect business location decisions and economic development is mixed, suggesting that even with aggressive incentives, and ""footloose"" filming, incentives can have little impact."
L82|Does the Internet cause polarization? -Panel survey in Japan-|There is concern that the Internet causes ideological polarization through selective exposure and the echo chamber effect. This paper examines the effect of social media on polarization by applying a difference-in-difference approach to panel data of 50 thousand respondents in Japan. Japan is good case for this research because other factors affecting polarization like huge wealth gap and massive immigration are not serious issue, thus it offers quasi natural experimental situation to test the effect of the Internet. The results show that people who started using social media during the research period (targets) were no more polarized than people who did not (controls). There was a tendency for younger and politically moderate people to be less polarized. The only case in which the Internet increased polarization was for already radical people who started using Twitter. However, since radical people represent only 20% of the population and there was no effect for Facebook or blogs, the overall effect of the Internet was moderation, not polarization.
L82|The Effects of Internet Book Piracy: Case of Comics|In this study, the effects of internet book piracy in the case of the Japanese comic book market were examined using direct measurement of product level piracy ratio and a massive deletion project as a natural experiment. Total effect of the piracy is negative to the legitimate sales, but panel regression and difference-in-difference analysis consistently indicated that the effect of piracy is heterogeneous: piracy decreased the legitimate sales of ongoing comics, whereas increased the legitimate sales of completed comics. The latter result is interpreted as follows: piracy reminds consumers of past comics and stimulates sales in that market.
L82|Does fake news affect voting behaviour?|Over the last decade, the erosion of trust in public institutions and traditional media sources have been proceeding in parallel. As recent developments in media consumption have led to a proliferation of politically charged online misinformation, it is no wonder that many have been questioning whether the spread of fake news has affected the results of recent elections, contributing to the growth of populist party platforms. In this work, we aim to quantify this impact by focusing on the causal effect of the spread of misinformation over electoral outcomes in the 2018 Italian General elections. We exploit the presence of Italian and German linguistic groups in the Trento and Bolzano/Bozen autonomous provinces as an exogenous source of variation, assigning individuals into distinct filter bubbles each differently exposed to misinformation. To do so, we introduce a novel index based on text mining techniques to measure populism. Using this approach, we analyse the social media content of each party and their leaders over the course of the electoral campaign for the 2013 and 2018 elections. We then collect electoral and socio-demographic data from the region and, after constructing a proxy for exposition to misinformation, we measure the change in populist vote across the two groups in-between the two general elections, using a combination of difference-in-difference and two-stagesleast- squares inference methods. Our results indicate that misinformation had a negligible and non-significant effect on populist vote in Trentino and South Tyrol during the Italian 2018 general elections.
L82|Tweet Sixteen and Pregnant: Missing Links in the Causal Chain from Reality TV to Fertility|We examine the relationship between social media activity, such as Google searches and tweets, related to teen pregnancy and the airing of the MTV program 16 and Pregnant. In contrast to Kearney and Levine's (2015) claim of a positive relationship, we find that the association is statistically insignificant or negative, when the analysis includes periods when new episodes of the program were not being broadcast. The results are also sensitive to using the total number of tweets, which were growing exponentially, as weights. Our results cast substantial doubt on social media as a link in the causal chain between reality television and fertility.
L82|Trends in the Diffusion of Misinformation on Social Media|In recent years, there has been widespread concern that misinformation on social media is damaging societies and democratic institutions. In response, social media platforms have announced actions to limit the spread of false content. We measure trends in the diffusion of content from 569 fake news websites and 9,540 fake news stories on Facebook and Twitter between January 2015 and July 2018. User interactions with false content rose steadily on both Facebook and Twitter through the end of 2016. Since then, however, interactions with false content have fallen sharply on Facebook while continuing to rise on Twitter, with the ratio of Facebook engagements to Twitter shares decreasing by 60 percent. In comparison, interactions with other news, business, or culture sites have followed similar trends on both platforms. Our results suggest that the relative magnitude of the misinformation problem on Facebook has declined since its peak.

I find that TV series filming increases by 6.3 to 55.4% (0.67 to 1.50 additional TV series) after incentive adoption. However, there is no meaningful effect on feature films, and employment, wages, and establishments in the film industry and in related industries. These results show that the ability for tax incentives to affect business location decisions and economic development is mixed, suggesting that even with aggressive incentives, and ""footloose"" filming, incentives can have little impact."
L82|Homophily in Social Media and News Polarization| We study how media bias is affected by the structure of social networks on social media. We consider an ad-financed media firm which chooses the ideological location of its news and targets consumers who can share the news with their followers on an online social media. After studying how a targeted consumerâ€™s incentive to share the news is shaped by the network structure of her followers, we study the firmâ€™s strategy to maximize the breadth of news sharing and find that when the mean (respectively, the variance) of followersâ€™ ideological locations is a convex (respectively, concave) function of a direct consumerâ€™s location, the media firm is likely to produce polarized news. The analysis of the case in which consumers are uniformly distributed reveals that news polarization is more likely to occur as the degree of homophily increases. We also find that media competition makes polarization more likely.
L82|Optimal persuasion with an application to media censorship|A sender designs a signal about the state of the world to persuade a receiver. Under standard assumptions, an optimal signal reveals the states below a cutoff and pools the states above the cutoff. This result holds in continuous and discrete environments. The optimal signal is less informative if the sender is more biased and if the receiver is easier to persuade. We apply our results to the problem of media censorship by a government.
L82|The Relationship Between The Star System And The Popular Culture And Turkey?S ?Superstar? Ajda Pekkan|Mass communication and mass media that bring new dimensions to communication among people affect the individual?s accordingly the masses level of knowledge, manner and attitude. According to Mills, mass media is the mirror of modern life of society. Mass media guides the society?s potential of motivation by selling image and data; with the data they disseminate mass media can give information about other societies and cultures? standard of living, relations of individuals and consumption areas of them (Quotation by Aziz, 1982, s. 48-50).While making sense of external reality, human beings starts out from his existing life and as the means of justification he uses his own popular culture icons (like actors, pop singers and etc.). But still he can?t change the external reality and it makes the icons meaningful unconsciously. This show the differences between mass culture and popular culture (Aydogan,2004, s.37).Popular culture is a consumption culture. While creating something popular, the existing popularity is used. Popular sport, sportsman, singers, ideas, manners, magazine heroes?something popular is covered and packed and consumers take part in the process making something popular by taking it (Erdogan, 1999, s.3). A material is sold directly. There is an indirect marketing through media.Stars can be called popular as they present sustainability, permanency. Stars are related with cultural industry with their trends, looks and novelty.Scanning model is a research method which aims to describe the situation existing in the past and today as it is (Karasar, 1995, s.77). This research is sample of scanning model. The research contains popular culture, connection of the stars, function of stars at creating and dissembling the popular culture and analyzing Ajda Pekkan who is the superstar of Turkey.During the research, related publishing ?n Turkish and English about image, icon, consumption, popular culture, development of star system are scanned. Super star Ajda Pekkan?s life is analyzed to discover the relation between popular culture and star system. Ajda Pekkan joined a contest to become the cover girl of ?Ses Magazine? in 1963 and chosen the first, then she started her professional career. So for this research all the news about her are scanned at this magazine to see the duration of her becoming a star.?Popular culture? and ?star? terms give essential clues about the cultural, economic, social features of society so the results of this research may be illuminating for this field.
L82|?We Want the World and We Want It Now?: Jim Morrison as ?Guiding Spirit? of the Youth Counterculture|As he achieved growing recognition and fame as a singer-songwriter and lead vocalist of the rock band The Doors, Jim Morrison came to embody, in the assessment of his bandmate Ray Manzarek, the spirit of ?hippie counterculture rebellion? during the second half of the decade of the 1960s. In part that is because, with his revolutionary spirit and personal views pertaining to radical potentialities, Morrison began to serve as an impressive icon of the generation gap that existed between young people who hoped to change the world and older individuals, including conventional authority figures, who seemed set in their ways. Accordingly, this presentation examines Morrison?s status as a desirable leader of the youth counterculture in the United States during the 1960s. It demonstrates how Morrison?s outspoken views, bohemian lifestyle, rebellious personality, unpredictable performing style, experiences with psychedelic drugs and alcohol, extensive literary knowledge (which ranged from the works of Beat poets and writers to French existentialist philosophers), and intentional attempts to spark riots effectively combined to position him as an appealing 'guiding spirit' and source of solidarity to countless members of the youth counterculture of his day. It further demonstrates the substantial personal toll this cultural status took on Morrison as his career progressed toward the early 1970s, when he endeavored to take his métier in new directions yet found himself trapped in a celebrity persona he no longer wished to call his own, even though it was very much of his own making.
L82|A mailshot in the dark? The impact of the UK government's lea fet on the 2016 EU referendum|In this paper I explore the causal effect of exposure to the UK government’s mailshot on vote preference in the 2016 EU referendum. I find that exposure caused a drop in the probability of voting leave by 3 percentage points. The effect is stronger in individuals who were exposed to few other sources of referendum information. For instance, females and the risk averse were even less likely to vote leave after exposure. The effect was also larger for Conservative party supporters who consumed many other sources of information. The evidence is consistent with voters being liable to persuasion. On the mechanism, I show that exposed individuals experiencea “persuasion-through-knowledge” effect, which changes beliefs on topics of contention.
L82|EDITED DEMOCRACY: Media Manipulation and the News Coverage of Presidential Debates|Political debates provide voters with a unique opportunity to learn about which candidates best represent their interests. They are complex campaign events that are followed by intensive media analysis and commentary. Despite growing evidence about their impact on voter behavior, little is known about their interrelated role with subsequent news coverage. This paper investigates the impact of an episode of manipulated TV coverage of a major presidential debate on the 1989 Brazilian presidential election. First, we present evidence from an online experiment that the coverage affects the audienceâ€™s evaluation of candidates differently then the actual debate. We then take advantage of a unique natural experiment regarding the geographical distribution of broadcaster-specific TV signal and the timing of election events in order to disentangle the effect of the coverage from the debate itself. By exploring both survey and actual election data, we find that the left-wing candidate lost 1.9âˆ’8.6 p.p. in vote share due to unfavorable coverage by the dominant TV network in Brazil. We also provide direct evidence that the mechanism works through a change in votersâ€™ perception of who won the debate. Together, our set of results show how dominant media groups can distort the information generated by presidential debates through its subsequent news coverage, thus hindering the role of debates in informing voters.
L82|The Production of Information in an Online World: Is Copy Right?|This paper documents the extent of copying and estimates the returns to originality in online news production. We build a unique dataset combining all the online content produced by French news media (newspaper, television, radio, pure online media, and a news agency) during the year 2013 with new micro audience data. We develop a topic detection algorithm that identifies each news event, we trace the timeline of each story and study news propagation. We unravel new evidence on online news production. First, we show that one quarter of the news stories are reproduced online in less than 4 minutes. Second, we find that only 32:6% of the online content is original. Third, we show that reputation effects partly counterbalance the negative impact of plagiarism on newsgathering incentives. By using media-level daily audience and article-level social media statistics (Facebook and Twitter shares), we find that original content represents between 54 and 62% of online news consumption. Reputation mechanisms actually appear to solve about 30 to 40% of the copyright violation problem.
L82|The media coverage of wealth and inheritance taxation in Germany|Based on the political economy of the media perspective, this paper explores the media coverage of wealth and inheritance taxation over the early 21st century (2000 to 2018) based on a large-scale corpus of seven German daily and weekly newspapers. Germany is a useful case study, being one of the most unequal countries in the Eurozone area in terms of wealth inequality. Drawing on text mining methods and corpus linguistics, it shows that wealth and inheritance taxation is a relatively infrequent topic over the entire period, with the exception of a few intense months of increased reporting. On the occasions that the media do report on the topic of wealth and inheritance taxation, it is mainly covered in terms of a political debate. This debate centres on the politics of a possible reform process and the connected difficulties of finding compromise between different actors, rather than focussing on the potential economic impact. Furthermore, this paper explores the power of agents (both on the organisational and individual level) as the primary definers of social reality. It shows that market-liberal and conservative organisations and economists dominate the news over social-democratic and left-wing ones. Overall, the findings indicate a hostile news coverage concerning the introduction of wealth taxation and the increase of inheritance tax.
L82|Can Partisan News Shift Political Preference and Voting Behavior? An Experimental Evidence from Taiwan's General Elections 2016|We conduct a field experiment to investigate the elects of partisan news on the 2016 Taiwan Presidential and Legislative Elections. Sub- jects are divided into four groups: rightist (KMT), leftist (DPP), new third-party and control, and provided with distinct partisan news ar- ticles. To ensure readership of assigned newspapers, subjects join multiple experimental sessions in which they are asked to solve quiz questions about the news articles and rewarded according to their quiz scores. We measure the elects of partisan news by comparing the reported vote choices in the 2016 Elections with subjects' initial political preferences. We find that the leftist news articles have signif- icantly increased the support for the DPP candidate Tsai by reinforc- ing the existing preferences. The articles about the third-parties have changed subjects' voting intentions to support the new party GSD. We also find that the estimated baseline and reinforcement treatment elects are driven by undecided subjects or swing voters.
L82|Vaccine Hesitancy and Fake News: Quasi-experimental Evidence from Italy|The spread of fake news and misinformation on social media is blamed to be one of the main causes of vaccine hesitancy, one of the ten threats to global health according to World Health Organization. This paper studies the effect of diffusion of fake news on immunization rates in Italy by exploiting a quasi-experiment occurred in 2012, when the Court of Rimini officially recognized a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism and awarded injury compensation. To this end, we exploit virality of fake news following the 2012 Italian Courtâ€™s ruling along with the intensity in the exposure to non-traditional media driven by regional infrastructural differences in Internet broadband coverage. Using a Difference-in-Difference (DiD) regression on regional panel data, we show that the spread of fake news caused a drop in children immunization rates for all types of vaccines.
L82|Does music quality matter for audience voters in a music contest?|"There are numerous studies analyzing factors of success in media-broadcasted artistic contests, especially music competitions. However, one factor that is generally neglected in the literature is the quality of the artistic performances (i.e. ""music quality""). In this paper, we approach this research gap by developing two novel concepts of music quality and by employing unique measures during the empirical analysis of a popular German music television contest in order to analyze how different dimensions of the music and performance quality influences the final voting results. We use the complete historical voting dataset of the music contest from its inception in 2005 until its last broadcast in 2015, collecting 2,816 observations in total. First, we define dimensions of ""objective quality"" according to insights from musicological research/literature. Second, we conceptualize dimensions of ""subjective quality"" because music preferences may be subjective and are not necessarily based on how experts' define ""good"" music. We measure these subjective dimensions in an experimental setting with students from two German universities. Our analysis shows that different quality dimensions affect the outcome of voting results in different ways and not all quality dimensions reveal themselves as significant. In general, subjective quality dimensions turn out to be more relevant than objective ones. The differentiated results of our analysis support the value of our approach to deconstruct quality into different dimensions and test them individually."
L82|Stars in social media: New light through old windows?|We review the economics of superstars, originally developed for stars in traditional media, and discuss whether they are applicable for the (allegedly) novel phenomenon of stars in social media (influencer, micro-celebrities). Moreover, we analyse potentially new factors for creating social media superstardom that may be special to the nature of social media. Our overall result is that the economics of superstars, like the role of talent, market concentration effects, MacDonald-style and Adler-style effects, remain applicable and relevant for social media stars. In line with this assessment, we find that several (allegedly) new star factors in social media, like user-generated content, prosumption, disappearance of gatekeepers and authenticity, turn out to be only partly applicable or just slightly different to traditional concepts. However, algorithm management and upload strategies represent novel success factors relevant for social media superstardom that are not captured by traditional superstar theories.
L82|The new media economics of video-on-demand markets: Lessons for competition policy (updated version)|"The markets for audiovisual content are subject to dynamic change. Where once ""traditional"" (free-to-air, cable, satellite) television was dominating, i.e. linear audiovisual media services, markets display nowadays strong growth of different types of video-on-demand (VoD), i.e. nonlinear audiovisual media services, including both Paid-for VoD like Amazon Prime and Netflix and Advertised-financed VoD like YouTube. Competition policy decisions in such dynamic markets are always particularly challenging. The German competition authority was presented such a challenge when, at the beginning of the 2010s, German television providers sought to enter online VoD markets with the help of cooperative platforms. We review the antitrust concerns that were raised back then in an ex post analysis. In doing so, we first discuss the dynamic development of the German VoD markets during the last decade. In the second part of this paper, we derive four aspects, in which the previous antitrust analysis cannot be upheld from today's perspective. First, relevant implications of modern platform economics were neglected. Second, some inconsistencies in the assessment of the two projects appear to be inappropriate. Third, the emerging competitive pressure of international VoD providers was strongly underestimated. Fourth, the question of market power in online advertising markets looks very different at the end of the decade."
L82|Happily ever after? Vertical and horizontal mergers in the U.S. media industry|This paper provides an economic analysis of recent vertical and horizontal mergers in the U.S. industry for audiovisual media content, including the AT&T-Time Warner and the Disney-Fox mergers. Using a theory-driven approach, we examine economic effects of these types of mergers on market competition, focusing on digital media content distribution. In doing so, we address three research questions: (i) Is the current development of analyzing industry with its recent merger activity concerning? (ii) Would vertical or horizontal integration be more preferable for overall welfare and competition in this industry? (iii) What are implications for antitrust policy? We conclude from our analysis that in the already highly horizontally concentrated U.S. market for audiovisual content the process of further vertical integration creates concerns from a competition policy perspective. Moreover, even though horizontal concentration on some of the market stages may be anticompetitive as well, vertical integration is likely to be more harmful. As a consequence, we recommend a stricter approach to vertical merger control in this industry, as well as a more active abuse control against already vertically-integrated media companies.
L82|How does online streaming affect antitrust remedies to centralized marketing? The case of European football broadcasting rights|The collective sale of football broadcasting rights constitutes a cartel, which, in the European Union, is only allowed if it complies with a number of conditions and obligations, inter alia, partial unbundling and the no-single-buyer rule. These regulations were defined with traditional TV-markets in mind. However, the landscape of audiovisual broadcasting is quickly changing with online streaming services gaining popularity and relevance. This also alters the effects of the conditions and obligations for the centralized marketing arrangements. Partial unbundling may lead to increasing instead of decreasing prices for consumers. Moreover, the combination of partial unbundling and the no-single-buyer rule forces consumers into multiple subscriptions to several streaming services, which increases transaction costs. Consequently, competition authorities need to rethink the conditions and obligations they impose on centralized marketing arrangements in football. We recommend restricting the exclusivity of (live-)broadcasting rights and mandate third-party access to program guide information to redesign the remedies.
L82|Success factors of academic journals in the digital age|Digitalisation has opened up new opportunities for the dissemination of information. That is why many academic journals have started introducing online services since the early 1990s. Previous studies suggest that online availability and free access to articles are positively connected to the number of citations. However, little is known about the relative impact of the introduction of online services at the journal level and what provides a long-term competitive advantage in times of digital change. Based on panel data from SSCI-listed management journals from 1989 to 2016, we examine which journals have pioneered the digital field, to what extent first-mover advantages can be identified, and which journal characteristics are associated with citation-based performance indicators. Our results show that lower-ranked journals were the first to introduce digital services and were beneficiaries of the digital age. Furthermore, we find a significant connection between the international composition of author teams and performance indicators. Our analysis of the relationship between online availability as well as open access and performance contradicts previous studies as we find that significant correlations diminish when adequately controlling for journal-level effects.

An Analysis Based on the OCLC Worldcat|This article evaluates tendencies and trends of the global academic publishing industry, vital for any reasonable long-term publication strategy planning in research. Such analyses are made possible today by the OCLC Worldcat. Our multivariate attempt, combining Worldcat global library circulation figures of publisher companies with results from earlier publisher ranking studies, is based on factor analysis of 32 variables, and our promax factor analytical model establishes that there are eight factors of global publisher impact, explaining almost 86% of total variance: 1. overall global standing of the company 2. company as a factor on the market 3. company impact on the global political and economic debate 4. successfully distributing best-sellers 5. impact on the scholarly community 6. successfully distributing production to more than 50 global Worldcat libraries 7. output during the last 5 years 8. outstanding academic quality Of the 51 companies with complete data under investigation here, the following companies are classified in the upper half: Oxford University Press; Springer; Cambridge University Press; Routledge; World Bank; Princeton University Press; Elsevier; CRC Press; University of Chicago Press; University of California Press; Palgrave Macmillan; MIT Press; Yale University Press; University of North Carolina Press; De Gruyter; Wiley-Blackwell; Kluwer Academic Publishers; University of Pennsylvania Press; Johns Hopkins University Press; Brill; Nova Science Publishers; University of Illinois Press; Duke University Press; University of Washington Press; and Edward Elgar. Scientists, wanting to get global audiences, are well advised to publish with those companies; and journal editors, wanting to get a global distribution for their journals, are equally well advised to cooperate with them.
L82|Slanted images: Measuring nonverbal media bias|I build a dataset of over one million images used on the front page of websites around the 2016 election period. I then use machine-learning tools to detect the faces of politicians across the images and measure the nonverbal emotional content expressed by each politician. Combining this with data on the partisan composition of each website’s users, I show that websites portray politicians that align with the partisan preferences of their users with more positive emotions. I also find that nonverbal coverage by Republican-leaning websites was not consistent over the 2016 election, but became more favorable towards Donald Trump after he clinched the Republican nomination.
L82|Netflix and the Demand for Cinema Tickets - An Analysis for 19 European Countries|Netflix, as a potential competitor to the cinema industry, was introduced in various European markets between 2012 and 2014. We use movie ticket sales from 2000 to 2016 for 19 European countries to estimate a causal effect of Netflix entering these markets. We find that Netflix has a positive effect on ticket sales. Thus, the Netflix experience can complement the cinema experience. However, preliminary descriptive statistics show, that this effect reverse starting 2016, when Netflix released more high quality and localized content. It is likely, that this development will continue to a trend, and movie tickets sales will decrease further.
L82|Associating Facebook Measurable Activities with Personality Traits: A Fuzzy Sets Approach|In this study we identify potential associations between people’s personality (utilizing the popular Big Five personality model) and measurable Facebook activities such as number of likes received, number of posts, number of comments on posts. Extant literature suggests that personality can be manifested through different features of the Facebook profiles but under an implicit assumption that those users may belong in a single psychographic group. However, it has been shown that people may share characteristics, common acts and behaviors of more than one psychographic group. In this study we aim to address limitations of previous studies, by adopting a fuzzy set approach which is capable to handle users’ membership in multiple psychographic groups. Furthermore, fsQCA offers equifinality, which means that research can end up to the same outcome, beginning from different initial combinations of data. The work presented here provides empirical evidence concerning the association between Facebook activities and users' personalities in a novel way indicating the significance of this relationship and providing alternative combinations that lead to the same output. Furthermore, it paves the ground towards predicting social platforms' measurements, other than Facebook, relying on users' personalities, using the same technique but on different fields of study and social media platforms.
L82|Purchase, Pirate, Publicize: Private-network Music Sharing And Market Album Sales|I quantify the effects of private-network music sharing on aggregate album sales in the BitTorrent era using a panel of US sales and private-network downloads for 2,109 albums during 2008. Exogenous shocks to the network's sharing constraints address the simultaneity problem. In theory, private-network activity could crowd out sales by building aggregate file sharing capacity or increase sales through word of mouth. I find evidence that private-network sharing results in decreased album sales for top-tier artists, though the economic impact is quite modest. However, private-network activity seems to help mid-tier artists. The results are consistent with claims that word of mouth is stronger for lesser-known artists and that digital sales are more vulnerable to increases in file sharing capacity. I discuss policy implications and alternatives to costly legal efforts to shut down private file sharing networks.
L82|Communicating positive actions about climate change in French Canada: Experimenting and evaluating an innovative Web media|This study is part of a larger research project related to the recent creation of the first French Canadian Web media dedicated to promoting action to fight climate change (CC). This media, called ?unpointcinq? (onepointfive), primarily targets adults of the French province of Quebec who are generally interested in the subject of CC, but find it either too complex or far from their personal concerns. It disseminates various contents about the province?s diverse initiatives ? individual, community-based, governmental, etc. ? regarding the fight against CC. The originality of this media relates to its positive tone. Information about CC often presents fear-inducing messages that stress its negative consequences, using an apocalyptic rhetoric (Benjamin et al., 2016; Spence & Pidgeon, 2010). However, research in environmental psychology and environmental communication show that negative framing can be ineffective for engaging and mobilizing publics around CC issues (Jang, 2013; Cox & Depoe, 2013), encouraging researchers and practitioners to test other communication strategies, including different types of positive frames. This mixed-methods research is divided in two parts. First, before the Web media was launched, we conducted a segmentation study using a quantitative questionnaire sent to 1200 Quebeckers, assessing attitudes and behaviours regarding CC, but also perceived relevance and interest towards different themes and frames potentially covered by ?unpointcinq?. This study allowed us to identify priority segments to target, as well as the most efficient frames to use in the media. In the second qualitative phase, we conducted five semi-directed focus groups within the first four months of the media being launched. A total of 40 participants from the segments most receptive to the media evaluated its first contents. These interviews were conducted in the spirit of a living lab and in an iterative manner, where participants and researchers both made recommendations to the editorial and production team to better frame the information. In this present conference, we propose to present the most salient results of the two phases of this ongoing research project.
L82|The Differentiated Effect of Advertising on Readership: Evidence from a Two-Sided Market Approach|In this paper, we empirically analyze the French print media market by modeling the existence of a reciprocal effect between the size of the readership and the amount of advertising. For this two-sided platform, we measure the cross-effects of advertising on the readership and periodical popularity on advertising. By estimating a structural model of simultaneous demand equations, we quantify some crucial elements in designing pricing and product-differentiating strategies. We measure the impact of advertising on reader demand and find in the data that it has opposite effects depending on whether the publication presents informational or entertaining content. By taking into account the market interactions, we compute price and advertising elasticities. Our results show that advertisers targeting a specific category of the audience would choose its corresponding periodicals and would trade off the size of the readership for these periodicals and the advertising insert price changes. Also, advertising campaigns aimed at reaching a broader spectrum of the population should focus on popular titles and on titles for which demand is inelastic to ensure a more consistent impact of the campaign. Finally, for magazines with low price demand elasticity on the readers’ side, editors’ revenues could be improved by increasing prices. These combined effects should allow a publisher to generate positive margins from both sides of the market, for certain content categories.
L82|Special Interest Groups versus Voters and the Political Economics of Attention|Asymmetric information between voters and legislative representatives poses a major challenge to the functioning of representative democracy. We examine whether representatives are more likely to serve long-term campaign donors instead of constituents during times of low media attention to politics. Combining data on campaign finance donations made by individuals and special interest groups with information on their preferences for particular bills, we construct novel measures of electoral and organized interests pressure that representatives face with regard to specific legislative votes. In our analysis based on 490 roll calls between 2005 and 2014 in the US House of Representatives, we find strong evidence that representatives are more likely to vote with special interests and against constituency interests when the two are in conflict. Importantly, the latter effect is significantly larger when there is less attention on politics. Thereby, we draw on exogenous newsworthy shock events that crowd out news on the legislative process, but are themselves not related to it. The opportunistic behavior seems not to be mediated by short-term scheduling of sensitive votes right after distracting events.
L82|Coups, Regime Transition, and the Dynamics of Press Freedom|This paper explores the dynamics of press freedom around events that threaten or oust the incumbent regime of a country. While democracies on average grant the press more freedom, our theoretical starting point is that democracies and autocracies may have similar incentives to protect the power of the governing regime. A priori it is, nevertheless, not clear whether democracies or autocracies react more harshly – by silencing or controlling the media – to an attempt to overthrow the government. We estimate the dynamics of press freedom around both failed and successful coups and find that although press freedom is quite stable, successful coups lead to a substantial reduction in press freedom. This is, however, only the case when the coup is directed against a democratically elected government.​
L82|Eine Analyse des Einflusses von Netflix und Filesharing auf die Kinoindustrie|Seit dem Jahr 2012 erfolgte in mehreren europäischen Ländern nach und nach die Einführung des Video-on-Demand Anbieters Netflix. Parallel dazu gingen diese Länder durch die Verabschiedung verschiedener Gesetze verschärft gegen illegales Filesharing vor. Auf Grundlage der jährlichen Daten von acht europäischen Ländern im Zeitraum von 2000 bis 2015 und unter der Verwendung einer Difference in Differences Analyse ermittelt diese Arbeit einen signifikanten und positiven Effekt der Einführung von Netflix auf die Kinonachfrage. Das Vorgehen der Länder gegen Filesharing weist keinen signifikanten Einfluss auf.
L82|The economics of social media stars: An empirical investigation of stardom, popularity, and success on YouTube|The economic literature on the superstar phenomenon provides empirical evidence on different types of stars, above all athletes and musicians. A new and, to our best knowledge, unexplored area of this star theory arouse with the development of social media markets. In this paper, we analyse a unique sample of 200 YouTube stars out of four different video categories to address the research gap. By employing econometric methods from panel data analysis, we contribute to answering the following research questions: (i) Are the classic theoretical concepts of popularity and superstardom by Rosen, MacDonald and Adler applicable? (ii) Can social media stars actively influence their popularity by employing special upload strategies? We find empirical evidence that former success positively and significantly influences the current success of social media stars, as theoretically presumed by MacDonald. Furthermore, the results support Adler's assumptions that the most popular stars snowball into superstardom due to higher growth rates. Finally, our investigation shows that social media stars can actively influence their popularity with distinctive upload strategies and market behaviour.
L82|Conquering the box office: Factors influencing success of international movies in Russia|This paper empirically examines various factors influencing box office success of international movies in Russia between 2012 and 2016. Three groups of success factors are distinguished: distribution related (e.g. budget, franchise), brand and star effects (e.g. top actors or directors), and information sources (e.g. critics and audience rating). We extend the literature by applying novel concepts such as Google-hits as indicator for electronic word of mouth. Moreover, we add novel region-specific variables like seasonality, time span between the world and local release, attendance of international stars at Russian movie premieres and title adaptation into the Russian language. The results indicate that budget, franchise, electronic word of mouth through the internet and audience ratings exert a significantly positive influence on Russian box office success. Whereas, we find no evidence of star effects in our sample and significantly negative effects for international critics, and, interestingly, the adaption of movie titles
L82|Modern industrial organization theory of media markets and competition policy implications|This paper outlines the modern industrial organization theory of media markets including competition policy implications. After recapturing fundamentals of industrial organization theory in a non-technical way, the state of the art of (i) modern platform economics, (ii) the economics of the so-called sharing economy, and (iii) the economics of data-based business models and data-driven markets is summarized in a detailed way and illustrated by modern media examples.
L82|The new media economics of video-on-demand markets: Lessons for competition policy|"The markets for audiovisual content are subject to dynamic change. Where once ""traditional"" (free-to-air, cable, satellite) television was dominating, i.e. linear audiovisual media services, markets display nowadays strong growth of different types of video-on-demand (VoD), i.e. nonlinear audiovisual media services, including both Paid-for VoD like Amazon Prime and Netflix and Advertised-financed VoD like YouTube. Competition policy decisions in such dynamic markets are always particularly challenging. The German competition authority was presented such a challenge when, at the beginning of the 2010s, German television providers sought to enter online VoD markets with the help of cooperative platforms. We review the antitrust concerns that were raised back then in an ex post analysis. In doing so, we first discuss the dynamic development of the German VoD markets during the last decade. In the second part of this paper, we derive four aspects, in which the previous antitrust analysis cannot be upheld from today's perspective. First, relevant implications of modern platform economics were neglected. Second, some inconsistencies in the assessment of the two projects appear to be inappropriate. Third, the emerging competitive pressure of international VoD providers was strongly underestimated. Fourth, the question of market power in online advertising markets looks very different at the end of the decade."
L82|Competition policy reform in Europe and Germany - Institutional change in the light of digitization|The ubiquitous process of digitization changes economic competition on markets in several ways and leads to the emergence of new business models. The increasing roles of digital platforms as well as data-driven markets represent two relevant examples. These developments challenge competition policy, which must consider the special economic characteristics of digital goods and markets. In Germany, national competition law was amended in 2017 in order to accommodate for digitization-driven changes in the economy and plans for further changes are already discussed. We review this institutional change from an economics perspective and argue that most of the reform's elements point into the right direction. However, some upcoming challenges may have been overlooked so far. Furthermore, we discuss whether European competition policy should follow the paragon of the German reform and amend its institutional framework accordingly. We find scope for reform particularly regarding data-driven markets, whereas platform economics appear to be already well-established.
L82|Media, fake news, and debunking|We construct a modified Hotelling‐type model of two media providers, each of whom can issue fake and/or real news and each of whom can invest in the debunking of their rival’s fake news. The model assumes that consumers have an innate preference for one provider or the other and value real news. However, that valuation varies according to their bias favouring one provider or the other. We demonstrate a unique subgame perfect Nash equilibrium in which only one firm issues fake news and we show, in this setting, that increased polarisation of consumers (represented by a wider distribution) increases the prevalence of both fake news and debunking expenditures and is welfare‐reducing. We also show, inter alia, that a stronger preference by consumers for their preferred provider lowers both fake news and debunking. Finally, we compare monopoly and duopoly market structures in terms of ‘fake news’ provision and show that a public news provider can be welfare‐improving.
L82|Identifying the effect of persuasion| We set up an econometric model of persuasion and study identification of key parameters under various scenarios of data availability. We find that a commonly used measure of persuasion does not estimate the persuasion rate of any population in general. We provide formal identification results, recommend several new parameters to estimate, and discuss their interpretation. We revisit two strands of the empirical literature on persuasion to show that the persuasive effect is highly heterogeneous and studies based on binary instruments provide limited information about the average persuasion rate in a heterogeneous population.
L82|Optimal Dynamic Allocation of Attention|"We consider a decision maker (DM) who, before taking an action, seeks information by allocating her limited attention dynamically over different news sources that are biased toward alternative actions. Endogenous choice of information generates rich dynamics: the chosen news source either reinforces or weakens the prior, shaping subsequent attention choices, belief updating, and the final action. The DM adopts a learning strategy biased toward the current belief when the belief is extreme and against that belief when it is moderate. Applied to consumption of news media, observed behavior exhibits an ""echo-chamber"" effect for partisan voters and a novel ""anti-echo-chamber"" effect for moderates."
L82|Multidimensional media slant: complementarities in news reporting by US newspapers|Are editors’ choices of front page news based on the potential complementarities between the news items? This paper studies front page choices made by editors of major newspapers in the US. I document that newspapers front pages are biased to certain combinations of news on top of biased to certain news. To identify my measures of bias, I exploit the variation in news relevance across different topics and days. To measure the news relevance I use lead news choices of other US mass media. As a consequence, my measures of bias are relative to the overall media bias. I also provide a reader-maximization model for front page decisions that I use to interpret the empirical biases of the newspaper as preferences of its population of target readers. From my estimation, I recover maps of complementarities among pairs of topics for each of the major US newspapers. I fi nd that complementarities between news contribute in a large portion to the probability that news on a topic appears in the front page.
L82|War of the Waves: Radio and Resistance during World War II|Can counter-propaganda by a foreign democratic country help to overthrow an authoritarian military regime? And if so, what are the mechanisms through which this happens? We analyze these questions in the context of the Nazi-fascist occupation of Italy during WWII. We study the effect of BBC radio counter-propaganda (Radio Londra) on the intensity of internal resistance to the Nazi-fascist regime. Using variation in monthly sunspots activities affecting the sky-wave propagation of BBC broadcasting towards Italy, we show that BBC radio had a strong impact on political violence. We provide further evidence to prove that BBC radio played an important role in coordinating resistance activities, but had no lasting role in motivating the population against the fascist regime.
L82|Communications Technology and Terrorism|By facilitating the flow of information in society, communications technology (CT; e.g., newspapers, radio, television, the internet) can help terrorists to (i) spread their message, (ii) recruit followers, and (iii) coordinate among group members. However, CT also facilitates monitoring and arresting terrorists. This paper formulates the hypothesis that a society’s level of CT is systematically related to terrorism. We introduce a simple theoretical framework, suggesting that terrorism first becomes more attractive with a rise in CT, but then decreases, following an inverted U-shape. Accessing data for 199 countries from 1970-2014, we find evidence for these predictions: Terrorism peaks at intermediate ranges of CT and corresponding magnitudes are sizeable. Our estimations control for a range of potentially confounding factors, as well as country- and year-fixed effects. Results are consistent throughout a battery of robustness checks and placebo regressions. Finally, we find no evidence of a potential reporting bias explaining our findings.
L82|Sunlight Disinfects? Free Media in Weak Democracies|Free media may not favor political accountability when other democratic institutions are weak, and may even bring undesirable unintended consequences. We propose a simple model in which politicians running for office may engage in coercion to obtain votes. A media scandal that exposes these candidates increases their coercion effort to offset the negative popularity shock.This may result in the tainted politicians actually increasing their vote share. We provide empirical evidence from one recent episode in the political history of Colombia, the `parapolitics' scandal featuring politicians colluding with illegal armed paramilitary groups to obtain votes.We show that colluding candidates not only get more votes than their clean competitors, but also concentrate them in areas where coercion is more likely (namely, areas with more paramilitary presence, less state presence, and more judicial inefficiency). Harder to reconcile with other explanations and as a direct test of the effects of media exposure, we compare tainted candidates exposed before elections to those exposed after. We find that those exposed before elections get as many votes as those exposed once elected, but their electoral support is more strongly concentrated in places where coercion is more likely. Our results highlight the complementarity between different dimensions of democratic institutions.
L82|Effects of Copyrights on Science - Evidence from the US Book Republication Program|Copyrights for books, news, and other types of media are a critical mechanism to encourage creativity and innovation. Yet economic analyses continue to be rare, partly due to a lack of experimental variation in modern copyright laws. This paper exploits a change in copyright laws as a result of World War II to examine the effects of copyrights on science. In 1943, the US Book Republication Program (BRP) granted US publishers temporary licenses to republish the exact content of German-owned science books. Using new data on citations, we find that this program triggered a large increase in citations to German-owned science books. This increase was driven by a significant reduction in access costs: Each 10 percent decline in the price of BRP book was associated with a 43 percent increase in citations. To investigate the mechanism by which lower book prices influence science, we collect data on library holdings across the United States. We find that lower prices helped to distribute BRP books across US libraries, including less affluent institutions. Analyses of the locations of citing authors further indicate that citations increased most for locations that gained access to BRP books. Results are confirmed by two alternative measures of scientific output: new PhDs and US patents that use knowledge in BRP books.
L82|Electoral cycle bias in the media coverage of corruption news|We investigate the existence of an ‘electoral cycle bias’ in the timing of media coverage of news with high political salience. In particular, we analyze how the electoral cycles at the regional level influence the coverage of news about corruption scandals in the Italian Regional Health Systems by two important national newspapers having opposite ideology, La Repubblica (left-wing oriented) and Il Giornale (right-wing oriented). Our findings show that Il Giornalesignificantly increases the number of articles about corruption scandals involving left-wing politicians since eight weeks before the elections, while it reduces the number of those about episodes of corruption without any political connection. On the contrary, La Repubblica increases the number of articles about episodes involving right-wing politicians only between four to eight weeks before the elections and it decreases those about no political episodes just the week right before them.
L82|Upward Price Pressure in Two-Sided Markets: Incorporating Feedback Effects|In two-sided markets it is important to consider feedback effects following a merger, i.e. how a price change on one side of the market affects the price change on the other side of the market. Affeldt et al. (2013) introduced the Upward Pricing Pressure (UPP) for two-sided markets, and we extend their approach to take into account such feedback effects. We then discuss the implications of our results for the assessment of two-sided mergers.
L82|Gains from digitization: Evidence from gift-giving in music|In this paper, we focus on recorded music gifts during the holiday season and estimate the reduction in deadweight loss due to the transition from physical CD gift-giving to digital music gift-giving with gift cards. Based on our survey data, we find that music CD gifts generate an average deadweight loss between 15% and 38% of the price. According to our estimates of gift music album sales which are based on U.S. data, the welfare gains from digitization, in terms of eliminated deadweight loss as a percentage of total spending on music albums, were between 5% and 13% during the week when digital sales peak in 2014.
L82|Pouvoirs économiques privés et ordre concurrentiel : Une application à l’économie numérique|This paper analyses how competition law and economics tackles the issue of private economic power. Through a historical approach based on the evolutions of the economic thoughts and courts decisional practices, we stress a tension between recommendations based on a definition of the competitive order as a guarantee of access to market or of pluralism, and normative prescriptions based the consumer welfare maximisation, as the competition law enforcement unique criterion. We illustrate this debates with examples provided by digital markets and we open the discussion to the media sector.
L82|“Free” Internet Content: Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and the Sources of Economic Growth|The Internet has evolved from Web 1.0, with static web pages and limited interactivity, to Web 2.0, with dynamic content that relies on user engagement. This change increased production costs significantly, but the price charged for Internet content has generally remained the same: zero. Because no transaction records the “purchase” of this content, its value is not reflected in measured growth and productivity. To capture the contribution of the “free” Internet, we model the provision of “free” content as a barter transaction between the content users and the content creators, and we value this transaction at production cost. When we incorporate this implicit transaction into U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), productivity, and household accounts, we find that including “free” content raises estimates of growth, but not nearly enough to reverse the recent slowdown.
L82|Pouvoirs économiques privés et ordre concurentiel. Une application à l'économie numérique|Il s’agit d’interroger la façon dont l’économie du droit de la concurrence se saisit de la question des pouvoirs économiques privés. Au travers d’une analyse historique, les prescriptions de la science économique et les pratiques décisionnelles américaine et européenne sont interrogées. Nous mettons en évidence une tension entre les recommandations qui découlent d’une défense de l’ordre concurrentiel conçu comme une garantie d’accès au marché et de pluralisme, et celles qui assignent à ce dernier le seul et unique objectif de la maximisation du bien-être du consommateur. Nous illustrons notre propos par une analyse de ces enjeux pour les marchés numériques et par une application au secteur des médias.
L82|Coups, Regime Transition, and the Dynamics of Press Freedom|This paper explores the dynamics of press freedom around events that threaten or oust the incumbent regime of a country. While democracies on average grant the press more freedom, our theoretical starting point is that democracies and autocracies may have similar incentives to protect the power of the governing regime. A priori it is, nevertheless, not clear whether democracies or autocracies react more harshly – by silencing or controlling the media – to an attempt to overthrow the government. We estimate the dynamics of press freedom around both failed and successful coups and find that although press freedom is quite stable, successful coups lead to a substantial reduction in press freedom. This is, however, only the case when the coup is directed against a democratically elected government.
L82|Pre-release leaks as one-time incentives for switching to unauthorised sources of cultural content|Pre-release leaks of cultural content incentivise consumers to look for unauthorised sources. I find that such events may induce some television viewers to switch to unauthorised sources to gain access even to content that had not been leaked. To demonstrate that this is the case, I use a unique dataset on a sample of TV shows aired around the time of a pre-release leak of a very popular TV show (Game of Thrones). The results of a difference-in-differences analysis indicate that the leaked TV show lost viewership for both the leaked episodes and those that followed. Moreover, the event also had negative effects for other TV shows that may share an audience with the leaked show. Finally, my results for the shows with a shared audience are corroborated by evidence of an increase in Google searches for phrases including the show names and the words “watch online”, after the leak. I argue that the one-time incentive to use unauthorised sources caused some viewers to engage in unauthorised consumption even of shows not affected directly by the leak. These conclusions are consistent with the existence of one-time costs of switching channels of content acquisition.
L82|Identifying the Effect of Persuasion|We set up an econometric model of persuasion and study identification of key parameters under various scenarios of data availability. We find that a commonly used measure of persuasion does not estimate the persuasion rate of any population in general. We provide formal identification results, recommend several new parameters to estimate, and discuss their interpretation. Further, we propose efficient estimators of the two central parameters. We revisit two strands of the empirical literature on persuasion to show that the persuasive effect is highly heterogeneous and studies based on binary instruments provide limited information about the average persuasion rate in a heterogeneous population.
L82|Platforms, Promotion, and Product Discovery: Evidence from Spotify Playlists|Digitization has vastly increased the amount of new music produced and available directly to consumers. While this has levelled the playing field between already-prominent and new artists, creators may now be dependent on platform decisions about which songs and artist to promote. With Spotify emerging as a major interactive streaming platform, this paper explores the effect of Spotify’s playlists on both the promotion of songs and the discovery of music by new artists, using four approaches. First, we examine songs’ streaming volumes before and after their addition to, and removal from, major global playlists. Second, we compare streaming volumes for songs just on, and just off, algorithmic top 50 playlists. Third, we make use of cross-country differences in inclusion on New Music Friday lists, using song fixed effects to explain differences in streaming. Fourth, we develop an instrumental variables approach to explaining cross-country New Music Friday rank differentials based on home bias. Being added to Today’s Top Hits, a list with 18.5 million followers during the sample period, raises streams by almost 20 million and is worth between $116,000 and $163,000. Inclusion on New Music Friday lists substantially raises the probability of song success, including for new artists.
L82|News media and crime perceptions: Evidence from a natural experiment|In democracies, voters rely on media outlets to learn about politically salient issues. This raises an important question: how strongly can media affect public perceptions? This paper uses a natural experiment – the staggered introduction of the Digital TV signal in Italy – to measure the effect of media persuasion on the perceptions individuals hold. We focus on crime perceptions and, combining channel-specific viewership and content data, we show that the reduced exposure to channels characterized by high levels of crime reporting decreases individual concerns about crime. The effect is driven by individuals aged 50 and over, who turn out to be more exposed to television while using other sources of information less frequently. Finally, we provide evidence about the effect of the digital introduction on public policies closely related to crime perceptions and on voting behaviour.
L82|The Effect of Media Coverage on Mass Shootings|Can media coverage of shooters encourage future mass shootings? We explore the link between the day-to-day prime time television news coverage of shootings on ABC World News Tonight and subsequent mass shootings in the US from January 1, 2013 to June 23, 2016. To circumvent latent endogeneity concerns, we employ an instrumental variable strategy: worldwide disaster deaths provide an exogenous variation that systematically crowds out shooting-related coverage. Our findings consistently suggest a positive and statistically significant effect of coverage on the number of subsequent shootings, lasting for 4-10 days. At its mean, news coverage is suggested to cause approximately three mass shootings in the following week, which would explain 55 percent of all mass shootings in our sample. Results are qualitatively consistent when using (i) additional keywords to capture shooting-related news coverage, (ii) alternative definitions of mass shootings, (iii) the number of injured or killed people as the dependent variable, and (iv) an alternative, longer data source for mass shootings from 2006-2016.
L82|Special Interest Groups Versus Voters and the Political Economics of Attention|Asymmetric information between voters and legislative representatives poses a major challenge to the functioning of representative democracy. We examine whether representatives are more likely to serve long-term campaign donors instead of constituents during times of low media attention to politics. Combining data on campaign finance donations made by individuals and special interest groups with information on their preferences for particular bills, we construct novel measures of electoral and organized interests pressure that representatives face with regard to specific legislative votes.

Importantly, the latter effect is significantly larger when there is less attention on politics. Thereby, we draw on exogenous newsworthy shock events that crowd out news on the legislative process, but are themselves not related to it. The opportunistic behavior seems not to be mediated by short-term scheduling of sensitive votes right after distracting events.
L82|I Read the News Today, Oh Boy: The Effect of Crime News Coverage on Crime Perception and Trust|Crime perception has increased in Peru in recent years, as in other developing and developed countries, in spite of the reduction in crime victimization figures. Our hypothesis is that the news industry is in part responsible for such developments. Using a novel database of written news, we identify short-term deviations from the long-term trend in the coverage of crime news at the province level and estimate the effect of news media on crime perception. We measure coverage as a function of the area an article occupies in cm2. Peruvians are great consumers of written news. For instance, Trome, a Peruvian gazette, is the most read Spanish-language newspaper in the world. We find that a spike of negative crime news increases people's perception about the probability of being a crime victim. We find the opposite for positive crime news. However, the effect per cm2 of negative news is more than three times larger than the effect of positive news in absolute value, signaling a potential asymmetry in the revision of people's expectations. We show that these changes in perception are smaller for recent crime victims than for non-victims and that women's perception is less sensitive to positive crime news. We also explore how these perception changes are transmitted to the political landscape and how individuals distribute accountability and reward between different political institutions.
L82|Information Gatekeeping and Media Bias|We develop a model to study the political economy implications of information gatekeeping, i.e., a policy of granting access only to friendly media outlets and denying access to critical ones. While an incumbent prefers positive bias, granting access improves her re-election probability only if coverage is sufficiently credible in the eyes of the public. Information gatekeeping can induce a quid pro quo relationship: media provides coverage with positive bias in exchange of future access, thereby affecting electoral outcomes in favor of incompetent incumbents. The degree of access media enjoy increases with competence of incumbents over those issues under public focus.
L82|Creators’ Income Situation in the Digital Age|The digital transformation imposes both opportunities and risks for creativity and for creative employment, with implications for trends in income levels and the distribution of income. First, we consider skill-biased technological change as a determinant of income and labor market outcomes in the arts. Arguably, the IT revolution has changed the demand for certain skills, with creative occupations being more in demand than general employment. Second, we consider declines in the costs of generating new works and artistic experimentation due to digital technologies, and their effect on the barriers to entry in labor markets. Third, we touch upon the rise of online contract labor in certain creative professions as a determinant of income. Here, online platforms can change creators’ access to work opportunities and it may alter the way income is distributed. We find that wage trends for creative workers in the digital age outperform general trends in the population: based on various data sources and various ways to identify creators, we see creators losing less or even gaining a better income position in relative terms. From a policy perspective, results do not lend support to the idea that creators’ income situation has systematically worsened with the rise of the internet and its intermediaries. Evidence on changing distributions of income is ambiguous as trends differ from one country to the next.
L82|Are (More) Economic News Good for the Economy ? Case on Indonesian Sub-nationals|The online media has not only capture news at the national level but also deliver news on specific regions, either the province(s) or local governments. A focus on delivering more local economic news, may also align to trend of decentralization policies, triggered especially after period of post-1998 and the adoption of sub-national election (Morrell, 2005). Previous studies mostly explored of how economic news may affect election outcome (Holbrook, 2004), but not on the effect to related economic outcome. We use news data from four large media online, as follows: Kompas, Okezone, Republika, Sindonews, and Tribunnews, over the year of 2010 up to 2015. The data of economic news category, as it focused on news at the province and local level, are specific news classified in 13 categories. Based on fixed-effect panel regression, our preliminary finding indicates of how economic news may positively affected economic outcome – referring to per capita GRDP (Gross Regional Domestic Product). By category ofecoonomic news, news on investments and on tourism tat have positive effect on province per capita GRDP. Meanwhile, on the effect of political event, we only found a significant effect of province election in the case of election year 2012. For these provinces with election year in 2012, more economic news instead associated with lower province per capita GRDP.
L82|Effects of Copyrights on Science - Evidence from the US Book Republication Program|Copyrights for books, news, and other types of media are a critical mechanism to encourage creativity and innovation. Yet economic analyses continue to be rare, partly due to a lack of experimental variation in modern copyright laws. This paper exploits a change in copyright laws as a result of World War II to examine the effects of copyrights on science. In 1943, the US Book Republication Program (BRP) granted US publishers temporary licenses to republish the exact content of German-owned science books. Using new data on citations, we find that this program triggered a large increase in citations to German-owned science books. This increase was driven by a significant reduction in access costs: Each 10 percent decline in the price of BRP book was associated with a 43 percent increase in citations. To investigate the mechanism by which lower book prices influence science, we collect data on library holdings across the United States. We find that lower prices helped to distribute BRP books across US libraries, including less affluent institutions. Analyses of the locations of citing authors further indicate that citations increased most for locations that gained access to BRP books. Results are confirmed by two alternative measures of scientific output: new PhDs and US patents that use knowledge in BRP books.
L82|Platforms, Promotion, and Product Discovery: Evidence from Spotify Playlists|Digitization has vastly increased the amount of new music produced and, because of streaming, has raised the number of songs available directly to consumers. While enhanced availability has levelled the playing eld between already-prominent and new artists, creators may now be highly dependent on platform decisions about which songs and artist to promote. With Spotify emerging as dominant major interactive music streaming platform, this paper explores the e ect of Spotify's playlists inclusion decisions on both the promotion of songs and the discovery of music by new artists. We employ four empirical strategies for measuring the impact of playlists on song success. First, we examine songs' streaming volumes before and after their addition to, and removal from, major global playlists. Second, we compare streaming volumes for songs just on, and just o , algorithmic top 50 playlists. Third, we make use of cross-country di erences in inclusion on New Music Friday lists, using song xed e ects, to explain di erences in streaming. Fourth, we develop an instrumental variables approach to explaining cross-country New Music Friday rank di erentials based on home bias. We find large and signi cant e ects: being added to Today's Top Hits, a list with 18.5 million followers during the sample period, raises streams by almost 20 million and is worth between $116,000 and $163,000. Inclusion on New Music Friday lists substantially raises the probability of song success, including for new artists.
L82|A Cautionary Tale of Evaluating Identifying Assumptions: Did Reality TV Really Cause a Decline in Teenage Childbearing?|Evaluating policy changes that occur everywhere at the same time is difficult because of the lack of a clear counterfactual. Hoping to address this problem, researchers often proxy for differential exposure using some observed characteristic in the pre-treatment period. As a cautionary tale of how difficult identification is in such settings, we re-examine the results of an influential paper by Melissa Kearney and Phillip Levine, who found that the MTV program 16 and Pregnant had a substantial impact on teen birth rates. In what amounts to a difference-in-differences approach, they use the pre-treatment levels of MTV viewership across media markets as an instrument. We show that controlling for differential time trends in birth rates by a market’s pre-treatment racial/ethnic composition or unemployment rate causes Kearney and Levine’s results to disappear, invalidating the parallel trends assumption necessary for a causal interpretation. Extending the pre-treatment period and estimating placebo tests, we find evidence of an “effect” long before 16 and Pregnant started broadcasting. Our results highlight the difficulty of drawing causal inferences from national point-in-time policy changes.
L82|The distribution of article quality and inefficiencies in the market for scientific journals| We build an oligopoly model of the market of scientific journals that allows us to relate the (in-)efficiency of this market to the exogenous distribution of article quality. Journal quality is endogenously determined by the submission choices of scientists. The efficiency of any stable equilibrium depends crucially on the exogenous distribution of article quality, especially on the fatness of the upper tail. For the empirically plausible Pareto distribution the market is inefficient even in the limit as the number of publishers tends to infinity.
L82|Mediating Effect of Attitude on Awareness toward the Addiction Behaviour of Pokémon Go Players in Malaysia|"""Objective – This study looks at the addiction behaviour of Pokémon Go players in Malaysia. Its purpose is to identify the addiction behaviour of Pokémon Go players in terms of their awareness and attitude. Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), the objectives of the study are (1) to identify the level of awareness, attitude and addiction behaviour of Pokémon Go players in Malaysia; (2) to determine the relationships among addiction behaviour, awareness, and attitude of Pokémon Go players; and (3) to investigate the mediating effect of attitude on awareness toward the addiction behaviour of Pokémon Go players. Methodology – This study employs the quantitative research design using a self-administered survey questionnaire for data collection. A total of 270 respondents are identified from selected places in the Klang Valley. Findings – The study finds that the addiction behaviour of Pokémon Go players are significantly related to awareness and attitude. In addition, attitude partially mediates the relationship between awareness and addiction behaviour on Pokémon Go players. Novelty – The level of Pokémon Go addiction behaviour is low. Therefore, it posits that the addiction behaviour of Pokémon Go is neither chronic nor a threatening phenomenon in Malaysia. """
L82|Factors Determining Pokémon Go Addiction in Malaysia |"""Objective – This study focuses on factors determining Pokémon Go addiction behaviour among players in Malaysia. Using the Personal Construct Theory (PCT), the relationship between perception of Pokémon Go players and their addiction behaviour toward the game is examined. The objectives of this study are (1) to identify the levels of perception and addiction behaviour of the Pokémon Go players in Malaysia; (2) to determine the relationship between perception and addiction behaviour of the Pokémon Go players; and (3) to investigate the moderating effects of age, gender and ethnicity on the relationship between perception and addiction behaviour of the Pokémon Go players. Methodology/Technique – The study employs the quantitative research design. The data are collected from 270 respondents using a self-administered questionnaire. Findings – The results show that even though the addiction behaviour of Pokémon Go players is low, the perception of Pokémon Go players towards the game is positive. Therefore, both addiction behaviour and perception are positively related. Age and gender are found to be moderate in the relationship between perception and addiction behaviour. With these results, the assumptions of PCT hold true. Novelty – The present study examines the relationship between perception of Pokémon Go players and their addiction behaviour toward the game. This research can provide insights regarding mobile gaming having similar features as the Pokémon Go"""
L82|Incentives for Quality in Friendly and Hostile Informational Environments|We develop a model of costly quality provision under biased disclosure. We define as friendly an environment in which the disclosure probability increases with quality, and as hostile an environment in which the opposite holds. Hostile environments produce a positive externality among sellers and potentially multiple equilibria. In contrast, friendly environments always yield a unique equilibrium. We establish that the environment that maximizes quality generates signals contradicting buyers' expectations. Hence, hostility produces greater incentives for quality than friendliness when costs are low and monitoring resources high.
L82|Media visibility and social tolerance: Evidence from USA|"I study the impact of media visibility of people of colour on the rate of hate crimes motivated by race or ethnicity in the United States. To do so, I construct a novel measure of state-level media visibility of people of colour between 2007 and 2013. Comparing state-level variation in the hate crime rate with a measure of the one-year lagged state-level variation in media visibility, I find that an increase in media visibility reduces the number of hate crimes. The effect is not larger in states that used to be pro-slavery, but larger in states that are more prone to spontaneous emotional outbursts of hate. The result, which is robust to several checks, is in the line with the argument that ""visibility matters."""
L82|Regional Innovation Systems and Global Flows of Knowledge|The literature on regional innovation systems emphasizes the role of the region as locus for interactive learning and knowledge exchange, stressing the importance of (geographical) proximity for innovation (Asheim and Gertler 2005). Even though the importance of extra-regional knowledge is widely acknowledged (Trippl et al. 2015), there has been only little emphasis on the particular role and the nature of global knowledge flows. The aim of this chapter is to explore the differentiated nature of global knowledge flows in regional innovation systems. We provide an overview of the different ways firms can gain access to global knowledge sources. Identified knowledge sourcing channels include international R&D collaborations, foreign direct investments, personally embedded relationships, international mobility of skilled labour, virtual communities and online platforms, and the participation in temporary clusters such as fairs, exhibitions, and conferences (Maskell et al. 2006, Aslesen and Sardo 2016). Depending on regional innovation system preconditions, firms use and combine different knowledge sourcing channels to access global knowledge. Firms in organisationally thick and diversified regional innovation systems have a geographical advantage in accessing knowledge globally, but even firms in peripheral areas can exchange knowledge worldwide, due to improved means of transport and communication at distance. Furthermore, not only multinational companies that are dominated by analytical or synthetic knowledge bases, but even small and medium sized enterprises in symbolic industries are often deeply involved in global knowledge sourcing activities. We illustrate our arguments with interview data collected among New Media firms in southern Sweden and in the Oslo Region in Norway.
L82|A Friend Who Was Supposed to Lose: How Donald Trump Was Portrayed in the Russian Media?|Donald Trump and his team have often been accused of having close ties to Russia and Russians expressed much greater support for Trump than residents of other countries. This article provides the first systematic analysis of Russian media coverage of Trump's activities during and after the election campaign. It concludes, on the basis of a sentiment analysis of relevant articles and network agendas of 500 Russian magazines and 250 leading federal newspapers, that Trump's media portrayal was not necessarily positive. During the election, Trump was portrayed by the Russian media not as Russia's favorite candidate, but as Hillary Clinton's opponent and a critic of U.S. recent policies. Only for a short period after Trump's victory in the elections, did the Russian media represent him as a friend of Russia, since there was hope that the new president would lift political and economic sanctions. Trump's policies failed to meet the expectations of the Russian people, and from the beginning of 2017, media coverage of Trump has become critical, hopes for lifting of political sanctions have weakened, and public opinion about the U.S. president has turned negative
L82|Can Television Reduce Xenophobia? - The Case of East Germany|Can television have a mitigating e?ect on xenophobia? To examine this question, we exploit the fact that individuals in some areas of East Germany – due to their geographic location – could not receive West German television until 1989. We conjecture that individuals who received West German television were exposed more frequently to foreigners and thus have developed less xenophobia than people who were not exposed to those programs. Our results show that regions that could receive West German television were less likely to vote for right-wing parties during the national elections from 1998 to 2013. Only recently, the same regions were also more likely to vote for left-wing parties. Moreover, while counties that hosted more foreigners in 1989 were also more likely to vote for right-wing parties in most elections, we find counties that recently hosted more foreign visitors showed less xenophobia, which is in line with intergroup contact theory.
L82|Terrorism and the Media: The Effect of US Television Coverage on Al-Qaeda Attacks|Can media coverage of a terrorist organization encourage their execution of further attacks? This paper analyzes the day-to-day news coverage of Al-Qaeda on US television since 9/11 and the group's terrorist strikes. To isolate causality, I use disaster deaths worldwide as an exogenous variation that crowds out Al-Qaeda coverage in an instrumental variable framework. The results suggest a positive and statistically powerful effect of CNN, NBC, CBS, and Fox News coverage on subsequent Al-Qaeda attacks. This result is robust to a battery of alternative estimations, extensions, and placebo regressions. One minute of Al-Qaeda coverage in a 30-minute news segment causes approximately one attack in the upcoming week, equivalent to 4.9 casualties, on average.
L82|Hollywoodâ€™s Wage Structure and Discrimination|The labour market for actors remains mostly unexplored. In this paper, we start by analysing how Hollywood wages have changed over time. We then proceed to examine the determinants of wages. One of our key findings is that there are substantial wage differences among male and female actors in Hollywood. A Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition suggests that 45% of the differences in the gender-wage gap can be attributed to discrimination.
L82|Competition for attention in the digital age: The case of single releases in the recorded music industry|In markets with long tails and thousands of products, like recorded music, consumers cannot possibly be aware of every product. We analyze how record labels use single releases as a strategic instrument to attract consumer attention in a competitive environment. In particular, we study how the advent of digitization has changed firm strategy. In accordance with predictions from a simple theoretical model, we show that record labels release more singles with shorter intervals in between when facing greater competitive pressure. We show that this effect is stronger in the digital age. With individual songs becoming readily available (forced unbundling), the attention generation motive becomes predominant and single releases more closely resemble a form of advertising.
L82|The market for scoops: a dynamic approach|Abstract We present a dynamic model of competition in the media industry in which behavioral media outlets compete for the publication of scoops, and both the publication of scoops and their veracity determine an outlet’s future audience. We study the dynamics of the audiences of outlets and how those dynamics relate to two issues: how harsh a society is with the publication of false stories, and how similar media outlets are in their editorial standards for quality. For the case of a duopoly, we show that there is only one stable stationary state. In that equilibrium, the two outlets coexist and which one leads the market (the low-standard outlet or the high-standard outlet) depends on a combination of the two issues mentioned above. We then use numerical simulations to analyze the general case with more than two outlets. The numerical results corroborate most of the analytical insights gained for the duopoly case. We also use numerical simulations to draw up predictions on the number of outlets that will survive in the industry in the long run.
L82|An Economic Analysis of Cultural Consumption|Cultural consumptions can foster economic development and human wellbeing thank to several positive externalities linked to growth of human capital and capabilities of complex interactions. Demand for cultural goods exhibit several special features, like rational addiction related to past consumption and the link with human capital and the mixed role of final good and investment good. Using micro data from an Istat survey with 50.000 cases I estimate an econometric model for the demand of main cultural goods that show several complementarities among them. As expected schooling exhibit correlation while time consuming activities like television viewing and Internet surfing has showed mixed results. The overlapping among different cultural consumptions appears to be fairly low. If we take concert, theatre and museum in the last 12 months only 4,8 % participated at least once in all three activities, a not so high threshold of cultural consumption compared with 45% of the population over 15 that consume at least one of them. Contrary to many beliefs the heavy consumer does not play a pivotal role in many cultural goods. People attending more than 7 times per year in each of concert, theatre or museum represent a share of total tickets ranging from 28% to 33%. That result could be important to address public policies to increase cultural consumption more toward casual consumer.
L82|The Valuation of Moral Rights: A Field Experiment|U.S. intellectual property law is firmly rooted in utilitarian principles. Copyright law is viewed as a means to give proper monetary incentives to authors for their creative effort. Many European copyright systems pursue additional goals: Authors have the right to be named as author, to control alterations and to retract their work in case their artistic beliefs have changed. Protecting these “moral rights” might be justified by the preferences of typical authors. We present the first field experiment on moral rights revealing the true valuation of these rights by over 200 authors from 24 countries. A majority of authors are not willing to trade moral rights in the first place. They demand substantial prices in case they decide to trade. The differences between authors from the U.S. and Europe are small. These results call into question whether moral rights protection should differ across the Atlantic and whether a purely profit-based theory of copyright law is sufficient to capture the complex relationship between human behavior and creativity.
L82|Does Vertical Integration Enhance Non-Price Efficiency? Evidence from the Movie Theater Industry|This paper examines how integration between distribution and exhibition in the movie theater industry affects non-price efficiency. We find evidence that integrated theaters may be more efficient than independent ones at picking movies to screen and allocating seats across them. To explain our finding, we provide a model showing that the efficiency increases with a theater chain size, while the effect of vertical integration itself is ambiguous. Comparing efficiency across chains suggests that the effect of vertical integration per se is insignificant, and observed efficiency gains can be attributed to the large size of integrated theater chains
L82|Sequential Supply Decision and Market Efficiency: Theory and Evidence|In a homogeneous goods market, due to the lack of the preemption effect, each firmï¿½s demand is likely to be proportional to its share of total output. Firms are inclined to supply more to increase their market shares, but should also consider the potential cost from excess supply. Thus, firms should make strategic decisions on how much to supply. We study this topic by considering an oligopoly market in which firms make decisions sequentially under a fixed price. We first provide a theoretical model and find the conditions under which either an efficient supply or oversupply occurs. Our model proposes two practical ways to evaluate the efficiency of a market, specifically regarding excess supply, that do not require information about market demand. Using these, we evaluate the efficiency of the Korean movie theater industry. Our empirical findings indicate oversupply of seating capacity in that industry.
L82|Competition and Retailer Product Choice: Evidence from the Movie Theater Market|In this paper, we empirically study the effect of entry on an incumbent theater's decision on seat allocation across movies as well as movie variety. We find that when confronting a new competitor an independent theater always reallocates seats from a handful of the most popular movies to the less popular ones. A chain theater also does so in the case of entry of a rival chain's theater. When the new theater belongs to the same chain, it decreases the number of seats allocated to the most popular movies even more. In contrast, if the new theater is independently owned, a chain theater reallocates in the other direction. Given the observation that theaters' screening schedules overlap less in less popular movies, our findings suggest that whereas an independent theater always differentiates itself from a new competitor, a chain theater's response to entry depends on the ownership of the new competitor. Although the overall impact of entry on an incumbent theater's movie variety is not significant, movie differentiation by theaters leads to an increase in movie variety in the local market, promoting the positive agglomeration effect
L82|Will Ad Blocking Break the Internet?|Ad blockers allow Internet users to obtain information without generating ad revenue for site owners; and by 2016 they were used by roughly a quarter of site visitors. Given the ad-supported nature of much of the web, ad blocking poses a threat to site revenue and, if revenue losses undermine investment, a possible threat to consumers' access to appealing content. Using unique, proprietary, and site-specific data on the share of site visitors using ad blockers at a few thousand sites, along with Alexa traffic data, we explore the impact of ad blocker usage on site quality, as inferred from traffic ranks, 2013-2016. We find that each additional percentage point of site visitors using ad blockers raises (worsens) its traffic rank by about 0.6 percent over a 35 month period, with stronger effects at initially worse-ranked sites. We provide additional evidence of causality by showing that the relationship between traffic trends and eventual ad blocking does not predate ad blocking. Plausible instruments for ad blocking also deliver consistent results. Effects of ad blocking on revenue are compounded by the fact that ad blocking reduces visits, while also generating less revenue from remaining visitors employing ad blockers. We conclude that ad blocking poses a substantial threat to the ad-supported web.
L82|Advertising Spending and Media Bias: Evidence from News Coverage of Car Safety Recalls|Do news media bias content in favor of advertisers? We examine the relationship between advertising by auto manufacturers in U.S. newspapers and news coverage of car safety recalls. This context allows us to separate the influence of advertisers, who prefer less coverage, from that of readers, who demand more. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we find that newspapers provide less coverage of recalls by their advertisers, especially the more severe ones. Competition for readers from other newspapers mitigates bias, while competition for advertising by online platforms exacerbates it. Finally, we present suggestive evidence that lower coverage increases auto fatalities.
L82|Net effects of Net Neutrality: The case of Amazon’s Twitch.tv| Net neutrality encourages content provision but also creates congestion externalities from the increase in data traffic. I study the consequences of net neutrality in Twitch.tv, a popular internet platform, by estimating a two-sided market model that considers the interactions between content provision, its consumption and congestion. The platform is non-neutral because it gives preference to the most popular content providers by compressing their data, which makes them accessible to more consumers. I use the estimated preferences and technological parameters to study the counterfactual where net neutrality is imposed in the platform. Consumer welfare would drop 3 percent. The platform would need to significantly increase its investment in its physical infrastructure to compensate consumers for the drop. The drop will be underestimated if congestion is ignored. Content provision does not increase but its quality drops.
L82|Online Social Networks: Approval by Design| Online social networks (OSN) influence the transmission of information in society. This paper analyzes how a profit-motivated OSN designs the instant feedback options, such as â€œlikesâ€ or up-votes and down-votes or disapprovals, that it aggregates into user ratings, and how these design choices affect social and economic outcomes. The OSN seeks to maximize advertising revenues via maximal engagement. We compare OSN designs that allow users to only up-vote other users' content contributions or â€œpostsâ€ against OSN designs that allow both up and down votes. Users care about what others think of them. The feedback system mediates what users with imperfect private signals learn about each others' contributions and about each other. The OSN design affects both the expected social approval gains from engaging as a contributor and the value to users from engaging as viewers of others' content. Up and down votes improve viewers information but removing the down-vote option can raise user willingness to contribute content by reducing the threat of unambiguous disapproval. We investigate a full set of OSN designs in a range of social contexts.
L82|Corruption and Media Concentration: A Panel Data Analysis|My master thesis studies the relationship between media concentration and corruption based on a panel data analysis, with a panel dataset which provides information about 29 countries over a span of 19 years. Based on a cross-section analysis Djankov, McLiesh, Nenova and Shleifer (2003, JLE) which focused on the relationship between corruption and media state-ownership, I enhance their results thanks to panel data fixed effects, to control for more unobservable effects, and several robustness checks. As Djankov et al did, we focus on two specific media markets: television (TV) and daily newspapers. Thanks to new data from the book “Who Owns the World‟s Media?” (Noam, 2016), I broaden the spectrum of their article to focus on the correlations between corruption and all types of media concentration (public, private and the industry). I confine their previous results: a positive correlation is found only for public TV with large shares of the market. In fact, I find a negative correlation between public TV shares and corruption for lower levels of state-ownership, especially in the case of developed countries. Contrary to daily newspapers, this result remains after many robustness checks. I provide evidence that low-levels of state-ownership limit concentration of private media, reducing the risk of media capture. Indeed, competition within the private sector is found to be negatively correlated with corruption. Finally, I find weak evidence for a positive correlation between corruption and media industry concentration in only two cases: when considering all types of media and when considering TV alone.
L82|Market Definition of Platform Markets|Platform markets are characterized by the existence of indirect network effects that connect two or more market sides through a platform that internalizes these feedback effects. Conventional instruments of market definitions which consider price levels cannot easily applied in case of two-sided platform competition, as price structure of those markets are non-neutral. Instead of using prices, we use time series of quantities and simple correlation analysis to evaluate the substitutional relationship within two-sided media markets. As a benchmark model, we simulate a Cournot duopoly on order to calculate correlation coefficients for varying degrees of product differentiation and indirect network effects.
L82|Mass media and attitudes to inequality|We aim to investigate which is the potential of various mass media to influence individualsâ€™ attitude to inequality. A theoretical model is proposed to formalize how preferences towards redistribution are formed. It is then tested empirically by using the data from the EuropeanSocial Survey offering information on the time people spend watching TV and using internet. Massmedia are assumed to affect the value people attach to equality, and in particular equality ofopportunity, which is reflected in their attitude towards income redistribution. This process is modeled by using the ordered probit technique and the conditional mixed process estimator. Moreover, by estimating the dose-response function, we highlight that the relation between exposure to mass media and attitudes to inequality is non-linear. We also test the impact of various media market and personal characteristics and point out some cross-country differences is the way attitudesto inequality are shaped
L82|Контрактация и квазирынок как форма взаимодействия государства и медиа в российских регионах. Contracting and quasi-market as a form of interrelations between state and media in russian regions|Масс-медиа являются не только отраслью народного хозяйства, но и социальным институтом. Однако коммерческая логика медиакомпаний, стремящихся к максимизации прибыли и рейтингов, приводит к «недораспространению» общественно значимой информации. В данной статье изучается, как общественная функция медиа реализуется через контрактные отношения между государством и масс-медиа в российских регионах. Участие в контрактации коммерческих медиакомпаний позволяет говорить о существовании квазирынка, когда выполнение функций общественного сектора осуществляется через рыночные механизмы. На примере информационных контрактов (N = 5 209), заключенных между государственными заказчиками и медиакомпаниями в 2011–2014 гг. в 12 субъектах РФ, методами статистического и сетевого анализа изучается специфика такого квазирынка. В отличие от «классических» моделей квазирынков, описанных в литературе, российские региональные медиарынки обнаруживают ряд особенностей, среди них: неспособность конечного потребителя (аудитории) влиять на распределение контрактов между масс-медиа, проблематичность оценки эффективности выполнения контрактов, распределение контрактов в зависимости от лояльных отношений с госзаказчиком, региональное неравенство и трансформация роли журналиста в обществе. Mass media are not only sector of the economy but also important social institute. However, commercial logic of media companies leads to «under representation» of socially significant topics. Contractual relationship between state and regional media are investigated in this article. Research sample includes informational contracts (N = 5209), signed between state clients and media companies in 2011–2014 in 12 Russian regions. Involvement of commercial media into such contracting relations let us suggest the existence of quasi-market. Within this quasi-market functions of public sector are performed by market mechanism. However, in comparison to «traditional» models of quasi-markets, described in the literature, some peculiarities were revealed in Russian regional media markets. Among them: end users’ failure to influence on the distribution of the contracts between mass media; difficulties to assess effectivity of contracts’ performance; distribution of contracts depending on the loyal relations with state clients; regional inequalities and transformation of the journalists’ role in the society.
L82|Father Figure in Turkish Cinema|In terms of field of research, communication has a wide data source. Various topics ranging from communication between individuals to mass communication can be studied. One of the rich sources of data in this field is the cinema, which bears the features of the seventh art through its products and massively popularizes its message and constitutes one of the important branches of the entertainment industry. In this study, the representation codes of the concept of fatherhood which is supposed to be a milestone of manhood and an indicator of the establishment of manhood for every man, that exist within Turkish cinema will have been analyzed. With reference to what the basic elements that reproduce the fatherhood in Turkish cinema are, the main cause of this study is to explore how the types of the representation of fatherhood occur within the sample movies. This study, moreover, seeks for an answer about what kind of a relationship exists between the father figure within the cultural structure of Turkish society and the representations of fatherhood that are presented in Turkish cinema.
L82|Soap Opera, Fertility and Inequality: Can we build some relationship?|There is a growing literature linking fertility and development. In certain contexts, fertility may become an important mechanism to enhance intergenerational propagation of socioeconomic inequalities. In this paper, we sought to explore the evidence provided by Ferrara, Chong, and Duryea (2012) that soap operas had a significant impact on women's fertility and used the variation of the time of the entry of the Globo Network in different areas to test whether the impact generated on fertility had some repercussion in the evolution of income inequality in Brazil.
L82|Media Competition, Information Provision and Political Participation: Evidence from French Local Newspapers and Elections, 1944-2014|This paper investigates the impact of increased media competition on the quantity and quality of news provided and, ultimately, on political participation. Drawing upon existing literature on vertical product differentiation, I explore the conditions under which an increase in the number of newspapers can decrease both the quantity and quality of news provided. I build a new county-level panel dataset of local newspaper presence, newspapers' newsrooms, costs and revenues and political turnout in France, from 1944 to 2014. I estimate the effect of newspaper entry by comparing counties that experience entry to similar counties in the same years that do not. Both sets of counties exhibit similar trends prior to newspaper entry, but those with entry experience substantial declines in the average number of journalists (business-stealing effect). An increased number of newspapers is also associated with fewer articles and less hard news provision. These effects are stronger in counties with more homogeneous populations, as predicted by my simple theoretical framework, whereas there is little impact in counties with more heterogeneous populations. Newspaper entry, and the associated decline in information provision, is ultimately found to decrease voter turnout at local elections.
L82|Semantic metadata in the publishing industry – technological achievements and economic implications|Abstract This paper discusses the adoption of new data management practices, known as Linked Data, by publishing companies from a strategic management perspective. It investigates the role of semantic metadata in the creation and exploitation of so called Linked Data ecosystems and discusses organizational effects on business and value creation processes stimulated by the technology. The theoretical assumptions are complemented by two case studies that provide insights how publishing companies use Linked Data technologies to diversify their business, strategically position themselves within emerging business ecosystems and adapt to the affordances of advanced data management practices. The analysis reveals that despite of differences in the adoption strategy both publishing companies have identified Linked Data technologies as the core of their innovation strategy having a profound impact on existing business practices and new strategies of value creation.
L82|Review of information systems research for media industry–recent advances, challenges, and introduction of information systems research in the media industry|Abstract Global media reports clearly show a tremendous increase in spending on Information Technology (IT) and Information Systems (IS) in the media sector. Two main trends are currently visible. First, as stated in McKinsey & Company’s Global Media Report, consumers continuously shift from spending on traditional media products towards rapidly-increasing spending on digital services and media products – consumer patterns have rapidly changed. Second, as stated in Gartner’s reports about the media industry, spending on IT services in the media industry increases gradually, and as a whole, the media industry is the third-largest spender on IT, after banking/finance and manufacturing. Third, as reported by both authors in their works, several facets of the media industry have undergone extreme changes, including business models, declining revenue, content models, management, economics and public funding. The aim of this study is to investigate research work related to IS in the media industry, in particular in the management and economic areas. To conduct this study, we investigated a large corpus of studies that have been contributed to IS research within the Association for Information Systems (AIS) within the past decades. We utilised advanced text mining methods to identify contributions and thematic areas. Our results clearly indicate that there is a significant downward trend of research works dealing with media industry aspects. This trend was a surprise to us, as it contradicts the emergence of new digital technologies which became key drivers in the media industry after 2009. We conclude this article by giving research directions, illustrating the opportunities and importance of investigating media industries within the context of IS, and introducing the research field of Information Systems in the eMedia Industry.
L82|Es gibt weiterhin ökonomische Argumente für einen öffentlichen Rundfunk<BR>[Economic Reasons for Public Broadcasting Persist in the Digital Age]|Zusammenfassung Die Finanzierung des öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunks in Deutschland steht in der Kritik. Vielfach wird bezweifelt, dass eine öffentliche Finanzierung von Rundfunkanstalten aus ordnungspolitischer Perspektive noch gerechtfertigt werden kann. Die Autoren argumentieren, dass es trotz technologischer Veränderungen weiterhin ökonomisch fundierte Gründe für eine öffentliche Finanzierung von Rundfunkinhalten gibt. Grundlage der Argumentation sind die positiven externen Effekte des Rundfunks.
L82|Rundfunkfinanzierung: von Gebühren und Beiträgen jetzt zur Indexierung?<BR>[Funding Strategies for German Public Broadcasting]|Zusammenfassung Die vor vier Jahren eingeführte Reform der Rundfunkfinanzierung kommt nicht aus den Schlagzeilen. Vermutlich auch durch die Kritik am neuen Gebührenmodell motiviert bringen die öffentlich-rechtlichen Sender neue Formen der Rundfunkfinanzierung ins Gespräch. Hanno Beck und Andrea Beyer diskutieren die Möglichkeiten einer Reform der Rundfunkfinanzierung unter ökonomischen Gesichtspunkten.
L82|Do People Avoid Morally Relevant Information? Evidence from the Refugee Crisis|Combining click data from a Swedish newspaper and administrative data on asylum seekers in Sweden, I examine whether a larger presence of refugees in a municipality induces people to avoid news that may encourage welcoming the newcomers. Exploiting the unexpected inflow of refugees to Sweden during 2015 and their exogenous allocation across Swedish municipalities, I find that people living in municipalities where the relative number of refugees has been larger read fewer articles about asylum seekers. I then identify articles that may raise feelings of compassion towards the refugees. The decrease in information acquisition is 36 larger for such empathic articles.
L82|Can Television Reduce Xenophobia? The Case of East Germany|Can television have a mitigating effect on xenophobia? To examine this question, we exploit the fact that individuals in some areas of East Germany – due to their geographic location – could not receive West German television until 1989. We conjecture that individuals who received West German television were exposed more frequently to foreigners and thus have developed less xenophobia than people who were not exposed to those programs. Our results show that regions that could receive West German television were less likely to vote for right-wing parties during the national elections from 1998 to 2013. Only recently, the same regions were also more likely to vote for left-wing parties. Moreover, while counties that hosted more foreigners in 1989 were also more likely to vote for right-wing parties in most elections, we find counties that recently hosted more foreign visitors showed less xenophobia, which is in line with intergroup contact theory.
L82|Loss aversion, upset preference, and sports television viewing audience size|A growing body of research examines the effect of loss aversion (LA) on consumers' decisions to watch or attend sporting events. Much of this research focuses on live game attendance. In contrast to the predictions of uncertainty of outcome hypothesis (UOH), loss-averse consumers prefer watching either potential upsets, or dominant performances by strong favorites, to events with uncertain outcomes. We test for LA vs. UOH effects in television viewing audience data for free over-the-air broadcasts of 304 Spanish football matches from 2008/09 to 2015/16. This setting generates substantial variation home team win probabilities because of the presence of two dominant teams (Real Madrid CF and FC Barcelona). The results support the importance of LA/upset preferences: audience size for matches when home teams are large underdogs and when heavily favored are larger than for matches with uncertain outcomes, even when controlling for observable and unobservable factors affecting the number of viewers.
L82|Vertical Foreclosure with Product Choice and Allocation: Evidence from the Movie Industry|We investigate a vertically integrated theater's contract and screen allocation decisions in the movie industry characterized by quality unpredictability, price uni- formity, and revenue-sharing contracts. Based on a simple theoretical model that describes the decisions of theaters and movie distributors, we derive two mecha- nisms of foreclosure behaviors: selection and allocation foreclosure. Our empirical results suggest that integrated theaters not only impose a higher quality standard for movies from independent distributors at contracts but also screen their aliated movies more even after contract. Vertically integrated theaters' favoritism toward its aliated movies are more pronounced at company-owned theaters than franchised theaters. Further, we also nd integrated theaters' favorable treats for their rival movies compared to independent movies as well as non-linearity of the foreclosure e ects across movie quality and seasonality.
L82|Homing choice and platform pricing strategy|We compare a discriminatory pricing regime with a non-discriminatory regime in a competitive bottleneck model where content providers endogenously sort into single or multi-homers. We find that consumer prices rise when the share of single-homers increases in the non-discriminatory case, while they stay constant in the discriminatory pricing regime. A discriminatory pricing regime leads to higher platform profits than the non-discriminatory regime when the share of single-homers are relatively high. When the share of single-homers is relatively high (low), the discriminatory pricing regime leads to higher (lower) consumer surplus and social welfare when compared with the non-discriminatory regime.
L82|Follow The Money: Piracy and Online Advertising|"Online copyright enforcement, in the form of either direct action against the supply- side (via website shutdowns) or the demand-side (via individual lawsuits against users), has not been very effective in reducing piracy. Regulators have therefore put forward the so called “follow the money"" approach. Because the main source of revenue for infringing websites often comes from online advertising, the idea is that cutting access to advertisers could lower the financial incentives for website owners. In this paper, we aim to provide systematic evidence on the effectiveness of such a policy. We collect data on the advertising services associated with a large number of piracy websites and corresponding set of legitimate \placebo"" websites before and after the _rst steps of a self-regulatory effort in the European Union went in place. Preliminary results suggest that advertising services indeed reduce their activities on piracy websites, however only those that are most likely to be directly affected by the regulation. We further provide evidence that some advertising services that did not cater to the piracy market before, start to do so { perhaps as a strategic response."
L82|The value of public service broadcasting in Japan: The life satisfaction approach|Evaluation of amenities and benefits of public service broadcasting is crucially important with the accelerated convergence of broadcasting and telecommunications and the increasing heterogeneities of media use by individuals. With the use of the microdata provided from a survey carried out by Japanese public service broadcaster, we attempted to elucidate the effect of viewing public service broadcasting on individual well-being using the life satisfaction approach in quantitative, monetized terms. Crucial findings of our analysis include that viewing frequency of public service broadcasting is negatively associated with life satisfaction, even after successfully addressing the endogenous nature of television viewing. It is also found that the detrimental effect of viewing public service broadcasting has a considerable monetary impact. In the sense of studying the demand side, our exploration of the value of conventional viewing of public service broadcasts will provide a valuable comparative benchmark future research in this domain.
L82|Sind Wettbewerbe im Profisport Rattenrennen?|Eine Reihe von Autoren - vor allem im deutschsprachigen - Raum begründet die Notwendigkeit regulatorischer Eingriffe in Profisportmärkte damit, dass der Wettbewerb auf diesen Märkten systematisch versage. Als wesentliche Ursache für Wettbewerbsprobleme innerhalb dieser Ligen oder Meisterschaften gilt dem-nach das Auftreten eines ruinösen Wettbewerbs in Form von Rattenrennen à la Akerlof. Der vorliegende Beitrag untersucht die Frage, ob Rattenrennenmodelle eine geeignete Erklärung des ökonomischen Wettbewerbs in einer Sportliga darstellen und legt regulatorische Implikationen dar.
L82|Smart Fitness: Ökonomische Effekte einer Digitalisierung der Selbstvermessung|Smart Fitness bezeichnet die digitale Erfassung individualisierter Fitness- und Lifestyledaten mit Hilfe von Wearables, Smartwatches, Apps und anderen Instrumenten. Die so generierten Daten sind für eine Reihe von Akteure wie Sportartikelhersteller, Pharmaunternehmen, Arbeitgeber sowie insbesondere auch Krankenversicherungen ökonomisch interessant. Wegen der hohen Aktualität sowohl des gesellschaftlichen Trends zur Selbstvermessung und -optimierung als auch der Verwendung personalisierter Daten im Zuge der Digitalisierung handelt es sich um ein dynamisch wachsendes und sich entwickelndes Gebiet, welches aber bisher kaum aus einer ökonomischen Perspektive untersucht wurde. In dem vorliegenden Beitrag wenden wir die ökonomische Theorie personalisierter Daten auf das Phänomen Smart Fitness an und leiten mögliche Effekte her, insbesondere auch für die Konsumentenwohlfahrt. Außerdem präsentieren wir eine nicht-repräsentative empirische Studie, welche einen ersten Einblick ermöglicht und dabei helfen kann, die empirisch relevanten Theorierichtungen zu identifizieren. Dabei stellen wir Bereiche heraus, in denen eher positive Wohlfahrtswirkungen zu erwarten sind, aber betonen auch solche, wo Wohlfahrtsgefahren lauern und daher Regulierungsrechtfertigungen bestehen. Letzteres gilt insbesondere, wenn personalisierte Fitness- und Lebensstildaten für die Individualisierung von Krankenversicherungstarifen oder Karriereentscheidungen durch Arbeitgeber verwendet werden.
L82|Does popularity matter in a TV song competition? Evidence from a national music contest|There is a considerable amount of literature analyzing factors of success in music contests, in particular those where the audience votes for the winner. However, one factor that is highlighted by the economic theory of stardom is generally neglected in the literature. In this paper, we tackle this research gap by focusing on a national music contest in Germany and investigating how popularity of the participating artists influences the final voting results. We employ two different concepts of popularity. First, we collected data regarding the artist's former success (MacDonald-popularity) using music charts data. Second, we proxy the media presence of the artists (Adler-popularity) using hits in traditional and new media. In our analysis, we find empirical evidence that the artist's ex-ante popularity positively affects the outcome of voting results. Interestingly, media presence matters more than former success. Furthermore, displaying the characteristics of a one-hit won-der harms success in the contest.
L82|Die Medienökonomik personalisierter Daten und der Facebook-Fall|Im Internet erfreut sich ein Geschäftsmodell erheblicher Beliebtheit, bei welchem den Nut-zern Dienstleistungen oder Inhalte (in traditionellen Geldeinheiten) unentgeltlich zur Verfügung gestellt werden und stattdessen die auf dem Wege der Nutzung durch die Nutzer (bewusst oder unbewusst) bereitgestellten persönlichen Daten profitabel verwertet werden, sei es für gezielte Werbung, die Personalisierung und Individualisierung von Produkten und Dienstleistungen oder für datenbasierte Preisdiskriminierung. Im Kontext dieser innovativen Unternehmensstrategien können beim Vorliegen von Marktmacht auch neuartige Formen des Missbrauchs dieser Marktmacht zu Lasten der Nutzer auftreten. So geht beispielsweise derzeit das Bundeskartellamt dem Verdacht nach, dass der dominierende Anbieter von Soziale-Medien-Dienstleistungen, Facebook, seine Marktmacht missbrauche, indem er den Nutzern zu weit reichende Nutzungsrechte an persönlichen Daten abverlangt. Der vorliegende Beitrag nimmt diesen aktuellen Fall zum Anlass, die neuere ökonomische Forschung zur Rolle personalisierter Daten auf Onlinemärkten fallbezogen zusammenzufassen und exemplarisch auf Facebook anzuwenden. Dabei werden mögliche Missbrauchsstrategien auf ihre Plausibilität untersucht. Dabei wird deutlich, dass auch auf Märkten bzw. Plattformseiten, auf denen kein Geld im Sinne der gesetzlichen Währung fließt, dennoch Ausbeutungsmissbrauch möglich und vorstellbar ist. Dies wäre auch im Falle Facebook denkbar, wobei hierzu ohne eine empirische Analyse interner Daten (welche den Autoren nicht vorliegen) keine endgültige Aussage möglich ist.
L82|Wettbewerbsregeln für das Digitale Zeitalter - Die Ökonomik personalisierter Daten, Verbraucherschutz und die 9. GWB-Novelle|Die Digitalisierung der Wirtschaftsbeziehungen stellt die Wettbewerbspolitik vor erhebliche Herausforderungen. Um diesen zu begegnen, soll das Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen (GWB) mit Hilfe der 9. Novelle fit gemacht werden für das digitale Zeitalter. Der vorliegende Beitrag gibt eine Übersicht über die wesentlichen Änderungen der deutschen Wettbewerbsregeln und diskutiert ausgewählte, die digitale Ökonomie betreffende Änderungen vor dem Hintergrund des aktuellen Standes der Wirtschaftstheorie. Dabei wird deutlich, dass die 9. Novelle in einigen Bereichen eine Verbesserung der Wettbewerbspolitik in digitalisierten Märkten ermöglicht, in anderen Bereichen jedoch zu kurz greift. Schließlich werden drei Bereiche des andauernden Digitalisierungsprozesses skizziert, von denen zu erwarten ist, dass sie die Wettbewerbspolitik in den nächsten Jahren vor neue Herausforderungen stellen werden.
L82|Four cases in sports competition policy: Baseball, judo, football, and motor racing|Practices and conducts in professional and even amateur sports can be subject to competition laws as soon as commercial activities are involved. From an economic perspective, this implies that both directly commercial activities like the sale of broadcasting/media rights and indirectly commercial activities like defining and enforcing the rules of the games can be hit by competition policy interventions. Setting and enforcing the rules of the game is an activity with commercial effects because it influences attractiveness and marketability of the sports in question. After discussing fundamental issues, this contributions reviews selected landmark cases in sports competition policy from an economic perspective. This includes the U.S. baseball antitrust exemption, access rules to Judo tournaments, sale systems of media rights in European football as well as a unique combination of long-run exclusivity contracts, skewed allocation of common revenues, and special influences on rule-setting by some competitors in Formula One motor racing. Eventually, the areas of state aid to football clubs and mergers in Danish football are sketched.
L82|Does Wikipedia matter? The effect of Wikipedia on tourist choices|We document a causal influence of online user-generated information on realworld economic outcomes. In particular, we conduct a randomized field experiment to test whether additional information on Wikipedia about cities affects tourists' choices of overnight visits. Our treatment of adding information to Wikipedia increases overnight visits by 9% during the tourist season. The impact comes mostly from improving the shorter and incomplete pages in Wikipedia.
L82|Strategic microscheduling of movies|We investigate how competition in product niches affects the timing of product release for experience goods using data on motion pictures in the United States. Additionally, we attempt to estimate the ultimate gain of this timing. We identify product niches that movies occupy along three different product dimensions: common actor, director, and genre. We estimate the drivers for a motion picture´s weekly sales based on the variation in the level of competition in these particular niches over the movie’s run in cinema. We start by showing that release dates of motion pictures are more likely to be rescheduled when there is more competition during the initially proposed release week. Next, we find that competition from movies by the same director or within the same movie genre decreases motion picture’s box office revenue most. Finally, we compare a movie’s actual sales to estimated sales at the originally planned release date. Rescheduled movies generate about $5.4 million more revenue as they would have at their originally proposed release date.
L82|Networks, Markets, and Inequality|The interaction between community and markets remains a central theme in the social sciences. The empirical evidence is rich: in some instances, markets strengthen social ties, while in others they undermine them. The impact of markets on inequality and welfare also varies widely. This paper develops a model where individuals in a social network choose whether to participate in their network and whether to participate in the market. We show that individual behavior is defined by the q-core of the network and the key to understanding the conflicting evidence is whether the market and the network are complements or substitutes.
L82|Geographic Dispersion of Economic Shocks: Evidence from the Fracking Revolution|We track the geographic and temporal propagation of local economic shocks from new oil and gas production generated by hydrofracturing. Each million dollars of new production produces $80,000 in wage income and $132,000 in royalty and business income within a county. Within 100 miles, one million dollars of new production generates $257,000 in wages and $286,000 in royalty and business income. Roughly two-thirds of the wage income increase persists for two years. Assuming no general equilibrium effects, new extraction increased aggregate US employment by as many as 640,000, and decreased the unemployment rate by 0.43 during the Great Recession.
L82|Why Does China Allow Freer Social Media? Protests versus Surveillance and Propaganda|In this paper, we document basic facts regarding public debates about controversial political issues on Chinese social media. Our documentation is based on a dataset of 13.2 billion blog posts published on Sina Weibo--the most prominent Chinese microblogging platform--during the 2009-2013 period. Our primary finding is that a shockingly large number of posts on highly sensitive topics were published and circulated on social media. For instance, we find millions of posts discussing protests, and these posts are informative in predicting the occurrence of specific events. We find an even larger number of posts with explicit corruption allegations, and that these posts predict future corruption charges of specific individuals. Our findings challenge a popular view that an authoritarian regime would relentlessly censor or even ban social media. Instead, the interaction of an authoritarian government with social media seems more complex.
L82|Identification of and Correction for Publication Bias|Some empirical results are more likely to be published than others. Selective publication leads to biased estimates and distorted inference. We propose two approaches for identifying the conditional probability of publication as a function of a study's results, the first based on systematic replication studies and the second on meta-studies. For known conditional publication probabilities, we propose bias-corrected estimators and confidence sets. We apply our methods to recent replication studies in experimental economics and psychology, and to a meta-study on the effect of the minimum wage. When replication and meta-study data are available, we find similar results from both.
L82|Spreading Lies|The recent increase in partisan media has generated interest in what drives media outlets to become more partisan. I develop a model where a media outlet can report news with a partisan slant and the news then spread by word of mouth in a population of agents with heterogeneous preferences. The level of slant has an impact on whether the agents find the news credible and on their incentives to pass the news to others. The analysis elucidates how partisanship of media can be driven by political polarisation of the public and by the tendency of people to interact with people with similar political views. Extensions of the model shed light on the influences of social media and the fact that people with different political views tend to trust different media outlets.
L82|Political legacies of Italian entertainment TV|To what extent are the media to blame for the rise of populist political leaders? Andrea Tesei and colleagues explore the impact of the light entertainment served up by Silvio Berlusconi's commercial TV network, Mediaset, on his later electoral success.
L82|The Political Legacy of Entertainment TV|We study the political impact of commercial television in Italy exploiting the staggered introduction of Berlusconi's private TV network, Mediaset, in the early 1980s. We find that individuals with early access to Mediaset all-entertainment content were more likely to vote for Berlusconi's party in 1994, when he first ran for office. The effect persists for five elections and is driven by heavy TV viewers, namely the very young and the elderly. Regarding possible mechanisms, we find that individuals exposed to entertainment TV as children were less cognitively sophisticated and civic-minded as adults, and ultimately more vulnerable to Berlusconi's populist rhetoric.
L82|Can Television Reduce Xenophobia? The Case of East Germany|Can television have a mitigating effect on xenophobia? To examine this question, we exploit the fact that individuals in some areas of East Germany - due to their geographic location - could not receive West German television until 1989. We conjecture that individuals who received West German television were exposed more frequently to foreigners and thus have developed less xenophobia than people who were not exposed to those programs. Our results show that regions that could receive West German television were less likely to vote for rightwing parties during the national elections from 1994 to 2017. Only recently, the same regions were also more likely to vote for left-wing parties. Moreover, while counties that hosted more foreigners in 1989 were more probable to vote for right-wing parties in most elections, we find that counties that recently hosted more foreign visitors showed less xenophobia, which is in line with intergroup contact theory.
L82|Ad Networks and Consumer Tracking|We study the role of ad networks in the online advertising market. Our baseline model considers two publishers that can outsource the sale of their ad inventories to an ad network, in a market where consumers and advertisers multi-home. The ad network increases total advertising revenue by tracking consumers across outlets and reduces competition between publishers by centralizing the sale of ads. Consequently, outsourcing to the ad network is beneficial to the publishers, but may penalize the advertisers. We show that the ad network’s ability to track consumers may either expand or reduce the provision of ads, depending on consumers’ prefer-ences for the publishers and how advertisers use tracking information. Specifically, tracking is more likely to expand (resp. reduce) the provision of ads when consumers’ preferences for the publishers are positively (resp. negatively) correlated. Tracking is also more likely to expand (resp. reduce) the provision of ads when advertisers use tracking information to cap the fre-quency of impressions (resp. target specific consumers). Furthermore, we study the implications of consumers’ choice to block tracking. Generally, blocking generates a negative impact on the advertising industry, by making the allocation of ads less effective. Blocking also entails an externality on consumers, which is negative when tracking reduces the provision of ads. Given these conditions, regulatory restrictions on tracking may reduce consumer surplus as well as advertising revenue. These findings contrast with the presumption that regulation should make it easier for consumers to avoid tracking. We propose further extensions, including competing ad networks, more than two publishers and networks that do not sell ads, but only tracking information to the advertisers.
L82|Cautionary tales: Celebrities, the news media, and participation in tax amnesties|This study investigates whether press coverage on celebrities with tax issues affects the behavior of other tax payers. We compile an original data set for Germany, including regional information on the amount of tax payers using amnesty regulations to voluntarily disclose taxes they have evaded. The data set also includes counts of news reports published by 6 national and 54 local newspapers that address celebrity tax evaders who were publicly tried between January 2010 and June 2016. We find a strong correlation between the amount of self-denunciations and the news coverage. To identify the causal effect, we use exogenous variation in the reporting, resulting from disasters and terrorist attacks that coincide with the celebrity trials. Instrumental variable estimates suggest that an increase in news coverage by the amount of an average trial raises participation in the tax amnesty program by approximately 22.5%. This finding helps to better understand the effectiveness of tax amnesties, and it illustrates the economic implications of publicly trying famous personalities.
L82|Mediated Terrorism: US News and Al-Qaeda Attacks|This paper presents an empirical test for the hypothesis that US news coverage of al-Qaeda causes al-Qaeda attacks. To isolate causality, disaster deaths worldwide provide an instrumental variable crowding out al-Qaeda coverage. Studying daily al-Qaeda coverage by CNN, NBC, CBS, and Fox News, as well as the NYT and the WaPo, results consistently produce a positive and statistically significant effect. At its mean, al-Qaeda coverage is suggested to cause 1.2-2.3 al-Qaeda attacks (equivalent to 5.8-10.9 deaths) in the upcoming week. Results are remarkably consistent across media outlets and it appears unlikely that attacks are simply delayed when coverage is low.
L82|Deutsche Elektroindustrie trotzt unsicherem weltwirtschaftlichem Umfeld – Chancen durch Digitalisierung|Vor dem Hintergrund einer gedämpften weltwirtschaftlichen Entwicklung war die konjunkturelle Entwicklung in der deutschen Elektroindustrie 2016 tendenziell nur leicht aufwärts gerichtet. Das Brexit-Votum oder die weltweit zunehmende Antiglobalisierungsrhetorik sind nur einige Gründe dafür, dass sich die sehr exportorientierten Unternehmen der Elektroindustrie mit einer weiter zunehmenden wirtschaftlichen und politischen Unsicherheit konfrontiert sehen.
L82|Media Capture through Favor Exchange|We uncover the full circle of favors leading to media capture in Hungary. We first document favors from politicians to the media. Exploiting changes in government and media ownership, we show that under right-wing---but not left-wing---governments, state-owned firms heavily tilted advertising to connected newspapers and billboards, relative to the advertising composition of private firms or circulation shares. We then document two forms of media bias as return favors. We show that the connected newspaper had lower corruption coverage than the opposition newspaper before, but not after, a public breakdown in its relationship to the politician which also lead to the termination of advertising favors. And we show that billboard companies, after they became right-connected, selectively hosted the political campaigns of the right-wing party. Using a structural model we infer the welfare cost of advertising misallocation to be a third of the advertising budget, and estimate that each dollar spent on media capture cost 1.9 dollars to taxpayers. Our results suggest that the mechanism underlying media capture was a misallocation-inducing relational contract.
L82|The Production of Information in an Online World: Is Copy Right?|This paper documents the extent of copying and estimates the returns to originality in online news production. We build a unique dataset combining all the online content produced by the universe of news media (newspaper, television, radio, pure online media, and a news agency) in France during the year 2013 with new micro audience data. We develop a topic detection algorithm that identifies each news event, trace the timeline of each story and study news propagation. We show that one quarter of the news stories are reproduced online in less than 4 minutes. High reactivity comes with verbatim copying. We find that only 32.6% of the online content is original. The negative impact of copying on newsgathering incentives might however be counterbalanced by reputation effects. By using media-level daily audience and article-level Facebook shares, we show that original content represents 57.8% of online news consumption. Reputation mechanisms actually appear to solve about 40% of the copyright violation problem.
L82|Media Competition, Information Provision and Political Participation: Evidence from French Local Newspapers and Elections, 1944-2014|This paper investigates the impact of increased media competition on the quantity and quality of news provided and, ultimately, on political participation. Drawing upon existing literature on vertical product differentiation, I explore the conditions under which an increase in the number of newspapers can decrease both the quantity and quality of news provided. I build a new county-level panel dataset of local newspaper presence, newspapers' newsrooms, costs and revenues and political turnout in France, from 1944 to 2014. I estimate the effect of newspaper entry by comparing counties that experience entry to similar counties in the same years that do not. Both sets of counties exhibit similar trends prior to newspaper entry, but those with entry experience substantial declines in the average number of journalists (business-stealing effect). An increased number of newspapers is also associated with fewer articles and less hard news provision. These effects are stronger in counties with more homogeneous populations, as predicted by my simple theoretical framework, whereas there is little impact in counties with more heterogeneous populations. Newspaper entry, and the associated decline in information provision, is ultimately found to decrease voter turnout at local elections.
L82|Advertising Spending and Media Bias: Evidence from News Coverage of Car Safety Recalls|Do news media bias content in favor of advertisers? We examine the relationship between advertising by auto manufacturers in U.S. newspapers and news coverage of car safety recalls. This context allows us to separate the influence of advertisers, who prefer less coverage, from that of readers, who demand more. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we find that newspapers provide less coverage of recalls by their advertisers, especially the more severe ones. Competition for readers from other newspapers mitigates bias, while competition for advertising by online platforms exacerbates it. Finally, we present suggestive evidence that lower coverage increases auto fatalities.
L82|Buyer Group and Buyer Power When Sellers Compete|We study how the formation of a buyer group affects buyer power when sellers compete and buyers operate in separate markets. Previous research (Inderst and Shaffer, 2007, and Dana, 2012) has considered a buyer group that can commit to an exclusive purchase and has found that the formation of a buyer group strictly increases buyer power unless buyers have identical preferences. In contrast, we assume that no commitment to exclusive purchases is possible. We find that the formation of a buyer group has no effect if each seller's cost function is concave. If it is strictly convex, the buyer group strictly reduces the buyers'total payoff as long as the Pareto-dominant equilibrium for sellers is played when a buyer group is formed.
L82|Measuring technical efficiency and marginal costs in the performing arts: the case of the municipal theatres of Warsaw|Abstract The aim of this paper is to bring new contributions to the analysis of efficiency and productivity in the performing arts. Firstly, we consider how the behaviour of a performing arts company can be analysed using multi-output production technology, given that these companies offer different products in terms of quantity and quality. Secondly, and to the best of our knowledge for the first time in the literature, we propose a procedure to measure the marginal costs associated with the production of performing arts firms. Moreover, this procedure can be applied to any other cultural sector successfully. To achieve our goals, we estimate a stochastic input distance function for a panel data set of 19 public municipal theatres in Warsaw over the period 2000–2012. Additionally, we calculate the technical efficiency indices for these theatres and characterize some determinants of their efficiency, paying special attention to the effect of public grants. Our findings suggest that, at the sample mean, these municipal theatres in Warsaw could have used 7% less inputs to achieve the same level of outputs. At the same time, the presence of public grants improves efficiency and, so, contributes to extending innovation and diversity. The marginal cost of a new performance is around 7149 PLN, and introducing a new title costs up to 3.33 times more than one which stages one title already established in the repertoire. And, as already highlighted in other researches, we also confirm the presence of the cost disease and the positive effect of public subsidies on efficiency and quality in the performing arts.
L82|Information Gatekeeping and Media Bias|We develop a model to study the political economy implications of information gatekeeping, i.e., a policy of granting access only to friendly media outlets and denying access to critical ones. While an incumbent prefers positive bias, granting access improves her re-election probability only if coverage is sufficiently credible in the eyes of the public. Information gatekeeping can induce a quid pro quo relationship: media provides coverage with positive bias in exchange of future access, thereby affecting electoral outcomes in favor of incompetent incumbents. The degree of access media enjoy increases with competence of incumbents over those issues under public focus.
L82|Bias in Cable News: Persuasion and Polarization|We measure the persuasive effects of slanted news and tastes for like-minded news, exploiting cable channel positions as exogenous shifters of cable news viewership. Channel positions do not correlate with demographics that predict viewership and voting, nor with local satellite viewership. We estimate that Fox News increases Republican vote shares by 0.3 points among viewers induced into watching 2.5 additional minutes per week by variation in position. We then estimate a model of voters who select into watching slanted news, and whose ideologies evolve as a result. We use the model to assess the growth over time of Fox News influence, to quantitatively assess media-driven polarization, and to simulate alternative ideological slanting of news channels.
L82|Graduated response policies to digital piracy: Do they increase box office revenues of movies?|This study investigates the impact of six countries’ graduated response policies to digital piracy—sometimes referred to as ‘three-strike’ policies—on film-level theatrical box office revenues. Applying a quasi-three-way effects difference-in-difference model, no compelling evidence of increasing revenues is observed in any of the markets considered. This finding brings into question the efficacy of graduated response laws if one of the primary objectives is to increase sales in legitimate markets.
L82|Learning via sequential market entry: Evidence from international releases of U.S. movies|Most U.S. movies are not distributed simultaneously to all of their foreign markets and many do not recoup the costs of market entry. In theory, sequential entry allows distributors to learn about their movies' quality from performance in successive markets. I find empirical evidence consistent with recent trade models of learning about export profitability: a one-standard-deviation increase in the update to expected box-office revenues from the previous round is associated with an increase in the probability of entry to a given market of approximately 20%. This effect is robust to controls for other potential determinants of entry, including extended gravity, seasonality of demand, academy award nominations, and competition from local and imported pictures.
L82|Strategic decision-making in Hollywood release gaps|Hollywood blockbusters are usually released in the U.S. before other foreign markets. The release gaps have declined significantly over time and varied greatly across countries. While movie piracy has been suggested as an important determinant for the release gap decision of distributors, theory and evidence suggest that there are other important determinants. In this paper, we use a discrete choice release gap decision game model to disentangle the impacts of the i) release gap effect, which includes factors that provide incentives for a distributor to shorten the release gap; ii) word-of-mouth effect, which provides incentives for a distributor to lengthen the release gap; and iii) competition effect, which accounts for the incentives blockbusters have to avoid each other. We obtain box office and release gap data from the private industry source Boxofficemojo.com. We provide results on the economically significant impact of these three factors on distributors' release gap decisions and box office revenue.
L82|An Analysis of Revenues at the Comédie française, 1680-1793|I study the business practices of the Comédie française, the main theater in Paris, between 1680 and 1793. The theater was an actors’ partnership and operated within a (contested) oligopoly. Newly available data provide revenues by price category for over 32,000 performances. Attendance varied considerably from one performance to the next. Total revenues increased in the second half of the 18th century as demand for entertainment in Paris boomed. The increase came in part from box rentals (by performance or by season). Pricing practices changed over time, as premium pricing for high-demand events made way for premium pricing on specific weekdays, and ultimately constant pricing. The repertory consisted of proven classics to which successful novelties were added. As demand grew, the theater provided more variety and more novelty.
L82|Copyright Infringement in the Market for Digital Images|Digital technologies for sharing creative goods create new opportunities for copyright infringement and challenge established enforcement methods. We establish several important facts about the nature of copyright infringement and efforts to settle past infringing use in the market for digital images. Infringement in this, and many other markets, is often uninformed: users may be unaware that their use infringes, and may lack information about the price of a license. The uninformed nature of infringement implies that price may not be the primary factor in the decision to settle past use; in contrast, non-price factors may significantly affect settlement outcomes.
L82|Effects of Deregulation and Consolidation of the Broadcast Television Industry|This paper exploits deregulation in the 1990s to estimate viewership and revenue effects of consolidation in broadcast television, then finds cost effects that explain the ownership structure given viewership and revenue effects. Results suggest that consolidation greatly increased profitability in an industry with otherwise declining profitability. Groups with broader national coverage attract more advertising per station. Joint ownership of two stations within a market and network ownership both allow for significant cost savings. There is some evidence that within-market consolidation allows stations to achieve local market power. However, both within-market and across-market consolidation appear to have boosted viewership, on net.
L82|Market-Based Lobbying: Evidence from Advertising Spending in Italy|We analyze a novel lobbying channel: firms shifting spending toward a politician's business in the hope of securing favorable regulation. We examine the evolution of advertising spending in Italy during 1993-2009, a period in which Berlusconi was in power three separate times, while maintaining control of Italy's major private television network, Mediaset. We document a significant pro-Mediaset bias in the allocation of advertising during Berlusconi's political tenure, especially for companies in more regulated sectors. We estimate that Mediaset profits increased by one billion euros during this period and that regulated firms anticipated sizeable returns, stressing the economic importance of this channel.

L82|The Long-Term Effects of the Printing Press in Sub-Saharan Africa|This article investigates the long-term consequences of the printing press in the nineteenth century sub-Saharan Africa on social capital nowadays. Protestant missionaries were the first to import the printing press and to allow the indigenous population to use it. We build a new geocoded dataset locating Protestant missions in 1903. This dataset includes, for each mission station, the geographic location and its characteristics, as well as the printing-, educational-, and health-related investments undertaken by the mission. We show that, within regions close to missions, proximity to a printing press is associated with higher newspaper readership, trust, education, and political participation.
L82|Intermediaries in Two-Sided Markets: An Empirical Analysis of the US Cable Television Industry|Local television stations are platforms in a two-sided market connecting advertisers and viewers. This paper explicitly examines the effect that important intermediaries (such as cable, telephone, and satellite distributors) may have on a platform's pricing behavior in a two-sided market. I find that stations raise their fees to cable distributors because stations prefer that viewers access their content through satellite distributors with whom they do not compete in the local advertising market, and that station mergers lower stations' fees to distributors by partially internalizing a pricing externality that results from the mandatory bundling of local content. (JEL C78, D12, G34, L11, L82, M37)
L82|Character Endorsements and Electoral Competition|When an elite-controlled media strategically endorses candidates in order to promote its own ideological agenda, office-seeking parties may completely pander to the media, under moderate ideological conflict between voters and the elite. Larger ideological conflict leads to polarization—parties either become media darlings or run populist campaigns. The welfare effects are: (i) delegation by the media owner to a more moderate editor is Pareto improving, (ii) the median voter is never better off delegating voting rights to the informed elite, (iii ) a majority of voters may be better off if the informed media did not exist. (JEL D72, D83, L82)
L82|"Either or Both Competition: A ""Two-Sided"" Theory of Advertising with Overlapping Viewerships"|In media markets, consumers spread their attention to several outlets, increasingly so as consumption migrates online. The traditional framework for competition among media outlets rules out this behavior by assumption. We propose a new model that allows consumers to choose multiple outlets and use it to study the effects on advertising levels and the impact of entry and mergers. We identify novel forces which reflect outlets' incentives to control the composition of their customer base. We link consumer preferences and advertising technologies to market outcomes. The model can explain several empirical regularities that are difficult to reconcile with existing models.
L82|News Aggregators and Competition among Newspapers on the Internet|"This paper studies how news aggregators affect the quality choices of newspapers competing on the Internet. To provide a micro-foundation for the role of the aggregator, we build a model of multiple issues where newspapers choose their quality on each issue. Our model captures well the main trade-off between the ""business-stealing"" effect and the ""readership-expansion"" effect. We find that the aggregator increases the quality only if the readership-expansion effect is large enough relative to the business-stealing effect. Using a condition obtained from empirical results, we find that the aggregator increases the quality and social welfare, but affects newspapers' profits ambiguously."
L82|Net Neutrality: A Fast Lane to Understanding the Trade-Offs|"The last decade has seen a strident public debate about the principle of ""net neutrality."" The economic literature has focused on two definitions of net neutrality. The most basic definition of net neutrality is to prohibit payments from content providers to internet service providers; this situation we refer to as a one-sided pricing model, in contrast with a two-sided pricing model in which such payments are permitted. Net neutrality may also be defined as prohibiting prioritization of traffic, with or without compensation. The research program then is to explore how a net neutrality rule would alter the distribution of rents and the efficiency of outcomes. After describing the features of the modern internet and introducing the key players, (internet service providers, content providers, and customers), we summarize insights from some models of the treatment of internet traffic, framing issues in terms of the positive economic factors at work. Our survey provides little support for the bold and simplistic claims of the most vociferous supporters and detractors of net neutrality. The economic consequences of such policies depend crucially on the precise policy choice and how it is implemented. The consequences further depend on how long-run economic trade-offs play out; for some of them, there is relevant experience in other industries to draw upon, but for others there is no experience and no consensus forecast."
L82|Media Coverage, Public Perceptions, and Consumer Behavior: Insights from New Food Technologies|The media often play the role of translating new science to consumers. We discuss the recent literature that has examined the supply and demand factors that affect media coverage of new food technologies and the impact on public perceptions and consumer behavior toward food that utilizes these technologies. We start with a discussion of the ways in which the media influence public perceptions and consumer behavior related to foods made with new technologies. We then discuss the incentives of news media and the potential sources of biases in their reporting. We review empirical studies that have examined media reporting of new agricultural and food technologies, especially biotechnology, in terms of both their agenda setting and framing effects and the social amplification of risk. We synthesize the findings of studies that have examined the influence of media coverage on public attitudes and consumer behavior. We conclude and discuss avenues for future research.
L82|Surprise Me If You Can: The Influence Of Newspaper Endorsements In U.S. Presidential Elections|"Using the daily trade of futures from the prediction markets site Intrade, we pin down the effect of printed newspapers endorsements (announcement of an explicit support for a political candidate) on the candidates' likelihood of winning. It is established that unexpected endorsements have a large impact on voters' behavior. However, we show that this effect is only true when the endorsement is a coherent one: if a newspaper that praises conservative (liberal) policies endorses a candidate with liberal (conservative) ideas, the endorsement does not impact the candidate's probability of winning, as it is regarded as incoherent. Our measure for coherence comes from Gentzkow and Shapiro (2005), but we also use Ansolabehere and Snyder (2004)'s \propensity to endorse Democrats"" to show that a surprise endorsement has a large and potentially tipping effect in a tied contest<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
L82|Fixed Costs and the Product Market Treatment of Preference Minorities|It is well documented that, in the presence of substantial fixed costs, markets offer preference majorities more variety than preference minorities. This fact alone, however, does not demonstrate the market outcome is in any way biased against preference minorities. In this paper, we clarify the sense in which the market outcome may in fact be biased against preference minorities, and we provide some conditions for such bias to occur. We then estimate the degree of bias in a particular industry using an empirical model of entry into radio broadcasting with two types of listeners, a preference majority and a minority, and the two types of stations targeting those respective listeners. Listening model estimates are used to infer fixed costs, which can then be used to find optimal station configurations as well as the welfare weights on different groups that rationalize the current configuration. The ensuing estimates reveal welfare weights that are 2-3 times higher for whites than blacks, and 1.5-2 times higher for non-Hispanic than Hispanic, listeners. The difference between the black and Hispanic results arises from the different patterns of importing and exporting: Hispanics listen to non-Hispanic-targeted stations more than blacks listen to white-targeted stations; and whites listen to black-targeted stations more than non-Hispanics listen to Spanish-language stations. Researchers and policy makers might add product markets to labor markets and other contexts that warrant attention for disparate treatment of minorities.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L82|Optimal product variety in radio markets|A vast theoretical literature shows that inefficient market structures may arise in free entry equilibria. The inefficiency may manifest itself in the number, variety, or quality of products. Previous empirical work demonstrated that excessive entry may obtain in local radio markets. Our paper extends that literature by relaxing the assumption that stations are symmetric, allowing instead for endogenous station differentiation along both horizontal and vertical dimensions. Importantly, we allow station quality to be an unobserved station characteristic. We compute the optimal market structures in local radio markets and find that, in most broadcasting formats, a social planner who takes into account the welfare of market participants (stations and advertisers) would eliminate 50%-60% of the stations observed in equilibrium. In 80%-95% of markets that have high quality stations in the observed equilibrium, welfare could be unambiguously improved by converting one such station into low quality broadcasting. In contrast, it is never unambiguously welfare-enhancing to convert an observed low quality station into a high quality one. This suggests local over-provision of quality in the observed equilibrium, in addition to the finding of excessive entry.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L82|La réponse graduée de l’Hadopi a-t-elle eu des effets sur le piratage de musique et de films ?. Une étude empirique des pratiques de consommation en ligne|This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Hadopi (a French antipiracy agency) in reducing piracy of music and movies, and in promoting legal consumption.?We conjecture that Hadopi may have three potential effects, namely informational or educational effects (i.e. better awareness of Internet users about illicit practices)?; deterrent effects (i.e. increased monitoring of illegal distribution channels)?; and incentive effects (i.e. promotion of legal channels).?Using survey data from a representative sample of French Internet users, we find that Hadopi had differentiated impacts on music and films and series consumption patterns.?Our results show evidence of deterrent and information effects in the case of music while information and incentive effects tend to be more prevalent in the case of films and series.

L82|Media, Demonstrations, and Public Good Delivery: Evidence from World Bank Projects during Natural Disasters|Media can affect governments and public policy by promoting anti-government demonstrations. Under media pressure, a multitasking government might reallocate effort across tasks, rather than increase the total aggregate, resulting in ambiguous welfare effects. In this paper, I test such a hypothesis using a database of World Bank project indicators, which measures government performance in implementing capital projects. Disasters offer an ideal case study because citizens and the government can differ particularly in their preferences between public capital (reconstruction) and consumption (relief). Therefore, at times of disasters, media might be especially effective in shaping public policy by promoting anti-government demonstrations. Joining capital project indicators with data on disasters, media, and demonstrations,I present the following: (1) within-state variation in floods and media activity for Indian states; (2) within-country variation in disasters and media freedom for 135 countries; (3) a case study using anecdotal and archival evidence on flood response in Ghana, Togo, and Ivory Coast in 2007/2008. In all cases, media activity during disasters is associated with lower capital project performance, higher relief/anti-poverty efforts, and more anti-government demonstrations.
L82|Internet and Voting in the Web 2.0 Era: Evidence from a Local Broadband Policy|This article analyzes the impact of a local broadband expansion policy on electoral turnout and party vote share. We exploit a unique policy intervention involving staged broadband infrastructure installation across rural municipalities in the Province of Trento (Italy), thus generating a source of exogenous (spatial and temporal) variation in the provision of advanced broadband technology (ADSL2+). Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we find positive effects of broadband availability on overall electoral turnout at national parliamentary elections. Party vote share analysis shows significant shifts across the ideological spectrum. These shifts, however, are likely transitory rather than persistent. Placebo estimations support a causal interpretation of our results. We provide further evidence that broadband availability is linked to actual adoption in that the broadband policy increased overall Internet and broadband take-up among private households.
L82|The Welfare Effects of Vertical Integration in Multichannel Television Markets|We investigate the welfare effects of vertical integration of regional sports networks (RSNs) with programming distributors in U.S. multichannel television markets. Vertical integration can enhance efficiency by reducing double marginalization and increasing carriage of channels, but can also harm welfare due to foreclosure and incentives to raise rivals' costs. We estimate a structural model of viewership, subscription, distributor pricing, and affiliate fee bargaining using a rich data set on the U.S. cable and satellite television industry (2000â€“2010). We use these estimates to analyze the impact of simulated vertical mergers and divestitures of RSNs on competition and welfare, and examine the efficacy of regulatory policies introduced by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to address competition concerns in this industry.
L82|Social Media and Corruption|Does new media promote accountability in nondemocratic countries, where offline media is often suppressed? We show that blog posts, which exposed corruption in Russian state-controlled companies, had a negative causal impact on their market returns. For identification, we exploit the precise timing of blog posts by looking at within-day results with company-day fixed effects. Furthermore, we show that the posts are ultimately associated with higher management turnover and less minority shareholder conflicts. Taken together, our results suggest that social media can discipline corruption even in a country with limited political competition and heavily censored traditional media.
L82|Information and Crime Perceptions: Evidence from a Natural Experiment|This paper investigates the influence of media on the beliefs and perceptions individuals hold, with a focus on crime perceptions. We study the case of Italy, where the majority of television channels have been under the influence of the former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi for more than a decade. First, we document that these channels systematically over represent crime news compared to others. We then test if individuals revise their perceptions about crime when exposure to news programs broadcast by a specific group of partisan channels is reduced. In order to identify the causal effect we exploit a natural experiment in the Italian television market where the staggered introduction of the digital TV signal led to a drastic drop in the viewing shares of the channels above. Combining unique data on each channelâ€™s crime news coverage and prime-time viewing shares, we find that reduced exposure to crime related news decreased concerns about crime, an effect that is mainly driven by older individuals who, on average, watch more television and use alternative sources of information (such as Internet, radio and newspapers) less frequently. Finally, we show that this change in crime perceptions is likely to have important implications for voting behaviour.
L82|Looking into the Profile of Music Audiences|The main aims of this chapter are to identify different groups of music consumers and to analyse the relation between the observed diversity of musical consumption and the socio-economic characteristics of the audiences. This information is essential for producersâ€™ and cultural practitionersâ€™ as well as for public agencies for the purpose of encouraging cultural consumption and the promotion of certain types of music. Using cluster analysis with the 2011 Survey on Spanish Habits and Cultural Practices (SHCP-2011), we have identified 12 distinct clusters of music listeners and obtained a detailed classification of music consumers. As expected, education and age are the main determinants of music consumption. Hence, education and childhood exposure to music could prove to be important instruments for improving music demand especially if they are focused on personal enjoyment and satisfaction rather than on the more formal aspects of music.
L82|The Impact of Consumer Multi-homing on Advertising Markets and Media Competition|We develop a model of advertising markets in an environment where consumers may switch (or “multi-home”) across publishers. Consumer switching generates inefficiency in the process of matching advertisers to consumers, because advertisers may not reach some consumers and may impress others too many times. We find that when advertisers are heterogeneous in their valuations for reaching consumers, the switching-induced inefficiency leads lower-value advertisers to advertise on a limited set of publishers, reducing the effective demand for advertising and thus depressing prices. As the share of switching consumers expands (e.g., when consumers adopt the internet for news or increase their use of aggregators), ad prices fall. We demonstrate that increased switching creates an incentive for publishers to invest in quality as well as extend the number of unique users, because larger publishers are favored by advertisers seeking broader “reach” (more unique users) while avoiding inefficient duplication.
L82|Media Systems, Politics and Press Freedom: Perspectives on Contemporary Russia and Nigeria|The political system in any society is a major determinant of the nature of its media system. The policies of political leaders are key factors to ensuring the establishment and implementation of laws which promote the freedom of the press. This can be said of the Russian federation and Nigeria two prominent countries in Europe and Africa which have witnessed several political and media transitions over the years. From autocratic and repressive communist and military regimes respectively; Russia and Nigeria currently operate democratic models of governance with constitutions providing for the freedom of expression and of the press. Old habits seem to die hard as censorship and cases of assaults on journalists occur frequently contrary to global expectations of a free Russian and Nigerian press in the twenty-first century. Analysis of statistical data from two internationally respected media bodies; Reporters without Borders and Freedom House reveal that press freedom in Nigeria has improved in recent years amidst current setbacks from current religious and political crisis. Russia’s press freedom index is still poor with an uncertain future. Being a measure of national development and international reputation; the Russian and Nigerian governments need to implement laws and policies which promote the freedom of the press.
L82|Measuring media bias in China|Major advances in research on media bias have been achieved in recent years. However, methods used in the literature are primarily applied to American media and usually dependent on the two-party system. This paper attempts to detect and quantify the principal difference, or ‘media bias’, of Chinese media. We extract a document-term matrix from articles on the Eighteenth Party Congress in November 2012 from 21 Chinese newspapers from seven provinces, as well as the People's Daily. With this matrix, hierarchical clustering is subsequently used to divide newspapers into two groups. Using the dendrogram and intergroup dissimilarities, we can construct an index to indicate the direction and the magnitude of media bias. In our sample, newspapers from Zhejiang and Guangdong constitute one group, and the rest constitute the other group. The principal difference of Chinese media is reflected in two dimensions: central/local and political/economic.
L82|Mass media effects on non-governmental organizations|Globalization has raised concerns that multinational firms develop commercial activities at the expense of the environment or human rights, especially in developing countries. As firms' practices are not fully observable by stakeholders, NGOs have applied pressure on firms by organizing information campaigns. This paper studies how media coverage affects how effective NGOs are in monitoring firms. We make use of large media shocks, generated by big sports events, that crowd out media coverage of firms' practices in event host and participant countries, and increase coverage of sponsors. We find NGOs to respond consistently. NGOs are more likely to disseminate critical coverage of firms sponsoring sports events, and are less likely to spotlight firms' practices in the event host and participant countries. We also find that NGOs take advantage of sports events to increase their impact on sponsors, since campaigns about sponsors trigger a significant negative reaction in the stock market.
L82|Selling customer information to competing firms|We consider a data broker that holds precise information about customer preferences. The data broker can sell this data set either exclusively to one of two differentiated competing firms, or to both of them. If a downstream firm obtains the data set, it can practice personalized pricing, else it has to offer a uniform price to customers. The first-best allocation can be achieved when data are sold non exclusively, but this never arises in equilibrium. The data broker instead sells the data set exclusively either to the high quality firm or to the low quality firm rival, according to their quality-adjusted cost differential. This leads to inefficient allocations.
L82|Paying positive to go negative: Advertisers׳ competition and media reports|This paper analyzes a two-sided market for news where two rival advertisers may pay a media outlet to conceal negative information about the quality of their own product (paying positive to avoid negative) and/or to disclose negative information about the quality of their competitor׳s product (paying positive to go negative). We show that competition in the product market does not necessarily prevent the emergence of commercial media bias. Whether or not competing advertisers end up having negative consequences on news accuracy ultimately depends on the extent of correlation in the quality of their products; the lower the correlation, the higher the expected accuracy of the media outlet׳s reports. These findings provide a rationale to explain the observed differences in the extent of commercial media bias across seemingly similar industries or products, within the same media market. The results are robust to the presence of multiple media outlets and to asymmetries between the advertisers. Overall, the paper provides theoretical insights for media regulators and for the empirical literature examining the link between advertising and news contents.
L82|Even the losers get lucky sometimes: New products and the evolution of music quality since Napster|Using comprehensive digital sales data by time and vintage on the US, Canada, and 15 European countries, we infer the evolution of music vintage quality, finding that vintage service flow has increased since 2000. We explain the result with unpredictability of music quality at the time of investment along with growing releases. Evidence shows (a) products with modest prospects at release, – from artists on independent labels and from new artists, – occupy a growing share of the top products; and (b) despite growth in the number of products, sales are growing more concentrated.
L82|Sales displacement and streaming music: Evidence from YouTube|In this paper I exploit the removal of Warner Music content from YouTube in January 2009, and its restoration in October 2009, as a plausible natural experiment to investigate the impact of online content availability on album sales. I find that this blackout on YouTube had both statistically and economically significant positive effects on Warner albums, which are quickly moderated as top-selling albums are dropped from the sample. Results also show that albums that have a very successful debut face more displacement from YouTube videos, while the effect on lower debuting albums may be moderated by a promotional effect.
L82|Digital music consumption on the Internet: Evidence from clickstream data|We use clickstream data on a panel of more than 16,500 European consumers to analyze the relationship between different online music consumption channels. In particular, we revisit the question of sales displacement in the digital era, and analyze how licensed online music streaming affects digital music purchasing behavior. Our results show no evidence of digital music sales displacement by unlicensed downloading and present, for some countries in our sample, a rather small but positive elasticity of up to 0.04 between these two channels. We also find a positive relationship between the use of licensed streaming websites and licensed websites selling digital music, suggesting a stimulating effect of music streaming on digital music sales. Our results present important cross country differences in these effects, with elasticities ranging between 0.09 and 0.01. Finally, we find heterogeneous effects according to individuals’ profiles. For both unlicensed downloading and licensed streaming alike, our results suggest that consumers with higher interest in music view these channels as complements to licensed digital purchases to a larger extent.
L82|On the “uniform pricing puzzle” in recorded music|This paper proposes a possible explanation for uniform pricing in the recorded music industry, based on a pooling equilibrium across different quality types. We show that an ex ante ability to invest in the probability of success – which we identify with record companies’ artists and repertoire (A&R) expenditures – makes such a pooling equilibrium more likely.
L82|Bundling, à la carte pricing and vertical bargaining in a two-sided model|We develop a two-sided market model with an upstream–downstream structure. More specifically, the platform consists of two rival upstream firms and a downstream monopolist. Each upstream firm negotiates the input price (license fee) with the downstream monopolist and also chooses the amount of advertising that is embedded in the good it sells to the downstream monopolist. The downstream monopolist can offer the two goods either on an à la carte basis or as a bundle. We use this model to understand the incentives to bundle and the welfare properties of bundling in a two-sided market framework. We also contribute to the ongoing debate on à la carte pricing in the TV industry, where the two upstream firms can be viewed as two rival TV networks and the downstream monopolist as a cable operator. We show that an à la carte regulation will raise consumer surplus and downstream profit, while it will decrease the profits of the upstream TV networks.
L82|Inter-firm price coordination in a two-sided market|In many two-sided markets we observe that there is a common distributor on one side of the market. One example is the TV industry, where TV channels choose advertising prices to maximize own profit and typically delegate determination of viewer prices to independent distributors. We show that in such a market structure the stronger the competition between the TV channels, the greater will joint profits in the TV industry be. We also show that joint profits may be higher if the wholesale contract between each TV channel and the distributor consists of a simple fixed fee rather than a two-part tariff.
L82|The importance of suspense and surprise in entertainment demand: Evidence from Wimbledon|This paper empirically examines how suspense and surprise affect the demand for entertainment. We use a tennis tournament, the Wimbledon Championships, as a natural laboratory. This setting allows us to both operationalize suspense and surprise by using the audience's beliefs regarding the outcome of the match and observe the demand for live entertainment using TV audience figures. Our match fixed effects estimates of 8563 minute-by-minute observations from 80 men's singles matches between 2009 and 2014 show that both suspense and surprise are drivers of media entertainment demand. In general, surprise seems to be more important in this regard than suspense, and both factors matter more during a match's later moments. We discuss important implications for the design of entertainment content to maximize entertainment demand.
L82|Media, institutions, and government action: Prevention vs. palliation in the time of cholera|This paper studies how media and the quality of institutions affect government action taken before and after a natural disaster. Provided that more media activity is focused on post-disaster action, we show that more media activity and better democratic institutions both contribute positively to the palliative effort after the disaster, although corruption has a negative effect that decreases as media activity increases. On the preventive effort, however, media and democracy both have a negative effect, as does corruption. We provide empirical evidence based on major cholera epidemics and other natural disasters around the world, which largely support these hypotheses.
L82|Article 101 TFEU and market integration|Market integration is an objective of Article 101 TFEU. As a result, agreements aimed at partitioning national markets are in principle restrictive of competition by object. The case law on this point has been consistent since Consten-Grundig. Making sense of it, however, remains a challenge. The purpose of this piece is to show, first, how the methodological approach followed by the Court of Justice changes when market integration considerations are at stake. Secondly, it explains why and when restrictions on cross-border trade have been found not to restrict competition by object within the meaning of Article 101(1) TFEU. An agreement aimed at partitioning national markets is not as such contrary to Article 101(1) TFEU if the analysis of the counterfactual reveals that it does not restrict inter-brand and/or intra-brand competition that would have existed in its absence. It is possible to think of three scenarios in this regard: (i) an agreement may be objectively necessary to achieve the aims sought by the parties; (ii) a clause may be objectively necessary for an agreement and (iii) competition is precluded by the underlying regulatory context (as is the case, in particular, when the exercise of intellectual property rights is at stake).

L82|Persuasion of a Privately Informed Receiver|We study persuasion mechanisms in linear environments. A receiver has a private type and chooses between two actions. A sender designs a persuasion mechanism or an experiment to disclose information about a payoff‐relevant state. A persuasion mechanism conditions information disclosure on the receiver's report about his type, whereas an experiment discloses information independent of the receiver's type. We establish the equivalence of implementation by persuasion mechanisms and by experiments, and characterize optimal persuasion mechanisms.
L82|The Flip Classroom Learning on Design Student’s Performance: An Analysis|"""Objective – The objective of this research paper is to examine whether flipped learning would improve the performance of the 3rd year undergraduate design students compared to the traditional classroom learning. Methodology/Technique – The performance of the students was assessed based on the parameters: communication skills, understanding of the concepts, teamwork, critical thinking, sharing the data, exploration of concepts, creative outcomes and engaging the problems. Students were provided different tools, case studies, video presentations and foundational concepts. The experimentation was conducted before and after implementation of flipped classroom. Findings – The study revealed that final marks were gradually increased and nearly 80% students were satisfied with this way of learning. It was also observed that 82% students improved the communication skills, improved the critical thinking and helps to solve problems by themselves and started exploring new concepts. The study also focuses on the challenges on the adaptation of flipped learning among students and teachers. Novelty – The use of the flipped classroom is one of the most emerging new media technology in the university."""
L82|Social Media and Politics in Indonesia|Does social media have the potential to influence the political process more in certain countries? How do political actors and citizens use social media to participate in the political process? This paper analyzes these questions in the context of contemporary Indonesia, a country with a young democracy and a vibrant emerging economy. First, the relationships between traditional and social media and politics are discussed. Then, the current situation in Indonesia’s traditional media industry and how it may have helped drive the popularity of social media in Indonesia is analyzed. Finally, the paper discusses social media in today’s Indonesia and provides examples of how political actors and citizens use social media in the political process.
L82|Tweeting for Power: Social Media and Political Campaigning in Indonesia|Social media provides political actors, opinion makers, and the electorate with the opportunity to bypass traditional media and engage in direct exchange of political information. This article explores how political candidates in the 2014 legislative election in Indonesia used social media during their political campaign. Exploiting a unique hand-collected data set, the study sheds light on personal characteristics that have explanatory power for political candidates’ choice to engage over social media. It also provides insight into the content of politicians’ messages and drivers for different types of content. The findings suggest that social media is used by a relatively large percentage of politicians in Indonesia and that they use social media platforms such as Twitter to engage with their electorate on several topics related to their campaign during election periods.
L82|What drives the geographies of creative industries? From literature review to research agenda|The objective of this review paper is twofold: First, to review and synthesize the literature on the geographies of creative industries embedded in modern paradigms of economic geography; secondly, to reflect upon and identify a promising research agenda on the drivers of the geographical patterns of creative industries. Several deficiencies of current research are identified in this paper, and based on these deficiencies, we suggest some promising avenues for future research. In particular, we develop a comprehensive framework that goes beyond the analysis of individual drivers of the geographies of creative industries.
L82|The Information Industry: Measuring Russia By International Standards|Structural changes influenced by ICT are having an impact on production processes and the release of products in the information and communication technology (ICT) sphere and content (on the level of individual enterprises) and are resulting in the pursuit of new approaches to socio-economic development, to increase the competitiveness of the country and to participate in the international division of labour. In order to identify development priorities and prospects in the information industry we therefore need a clear understanding of what the information industry is, what its boundaries are, what forms of economic activity make up this economic segment, and which products form the corresponding market. This working paper summarizes the results of a study to ‘measure’ the information industry as a segment of the economy producing goods and services linked to ICT and content. Methodological approaches are proposed to establish the ‘Information industry’ definitions based on the Russian Classification of Economic Activities (OKVED) and the Russian Classification of Products by Economic Activities (OKPD) in line with international standards and recommendations by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Key indicators of the development of the information industry are also tentatively calculated for Russia and compared with countries abroad. The content of this paper is based on research results commissioned by the Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation and the outcome of evaluations and testing at a round table on the subject ‘IT industry: problems of classification and application’ round table (2014) and a session of the statistics section of the Central House of Scientists at the Russian Academy of Sciences on the subject of ‘Developing the “Information industry” and “IT industry” definitions based on the OKVED2 and OKPD2’ (http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/rosstat/sec/tez-abdr.doc). The paper was also supported by the Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) and the subsidy granted to the HSE by the Government of the Russian Federation for the implementation of the Global Competitiveness Program.
L82|The Retailers’ Marketing Strategy: Adapting to the fast-evolving environment|Retail and modern commerce have been one of the interesting themes that I have addressed in the last years, in various articles and studies. It is relevant to mention that in 2005, under the coordination and guidance of Professor Theodor Purcarea, I worked with my colleagues at the Romanian-American University in the research group TOEMM, whose purpose was studying the retail market in Romania, which was at the beginning of its development at that time. Research carried out and the satisfaction of the obtained results determined me to continue my scientific work, but not limited to this area. If in previous papers or studies, found in connection with the retail market, I mainly wrote about quantitative aspects, such as those related to geographical expansion and concentration of modern commerce in Romania, in this article I will address some theoretical aspects of the retailers’ marketing strategy, opening the perspectives for what could be an interesting research, involving the analysis of some of the major supply chains on the Romanian market.
L82|The Property Economics and the Benchmark Culture of Common Sense: On Markets for Ideas, Ideals, and Ideologies|The very word “culture”, as well as its twin, “civilization”, is one of the richest with respect to both significations and assorted definitions. Common in defining culture is to observe both its immaterial and material dimensions, meaning both the sharing and bonding values and ideas, on one hand, and the artefacts embodying them and resources involved in their making, on the other. There is a multiple relation between the world of ideas, which is disciplined by logical soundness, and the world of things, which is disciplined by property rights. And the interplay of ideas / ideals / ideologies and property rights is a critical one. The capacity of a culture to deliver peace and prosperity heavily depends on the measure in which public space is impregnated with the logic of private property, the mark of common sense. A condensed view of the Romanian realities will round up the principled argument.
L82|Does Reality TV Induce Real Effects? On the Questionable Association Between 16 and Pregnant and Teenage Childbearing|We reassess recent and widely reported evidence that the MTV program 16 and Pregnant played a major role in reducing teen birth rates in the U.S. since it began broadcasting in 2009 (Kearney and Levine, American Economic Review 2015). We find Kearney and Levine's identification strategy to be problematic. Through a series of placebo and other tests, we show that the exclusion restriction of their instrumental variables approach is not valid and find that the assumption of common trends in birth rates between low and high MTV-watching areas is not met. We also reassess Kearney and Levine's evidence from social media and show that it is fragile and highly sensitive to the choice of included periods and to the use of weights. We conclude that Kearney and Levine's results are uninformative about the effect of 16 and Pregnant on teen birth rates.
L82|Does Reality TV Induce Real Effects? A Response to Jaeger, Joyce, and Kaestner (2016)|"This paper presents a response to Jaeger, Joyce, and Kaestner's (JJK) recent critique (IZA Discussion Paper No. 10317) of our 2015 paper ""Media Influences on Social Outcomes: The Impact of MTV's 16 and Pregnant on Teen Childbearing."" In terms of replication, those authors are able to confirm every result in our paper. In terms of reassessment, the substance of their critique rests on the claim that the parallel trends assumption, necessary to attribute causation to our findings, is not satisfied. We present three main responses: (1) there is no evidence of a parallel trends assumption violation during our sample window of 2005 through 2010; (2) the finding of a false placebo test result during one particular earlier window of time does not invalidate the finding of a discrete break in trend at the time of the show's introduction; (3) the results of our analysis are robust to virtually all alternative econometric specifications and sample windows that JJK consider. We conclude that this critique does not pose a serious threat to the interpretation of our 2015 findings. We maintain the position that our earlier paper is informative about the causal effect of 16 and Pregnant on teen birth rates."
L82|Television, Cognitive Ability, and High School Completion|We exploit supply-driven heterogeneity in the expansion of cable television across Norwegian municipalities to identify developmental effects of commercial television exposure during childhood. We find that higher exposure to commercial television reduces cognitive ability and high school graduation rates for boys. The effects appear to be driven by consumption of light television entertainment crowding out more cognitively stimulating activities. Point estimates suggest that the effects are most negative for boys from more educated families. We find no effect on high school completion for girls, pointing to the growth of noneducational media as a factor in the widening educational gender gap.
L82|The effect of the internet on voting behavior|The internet has transformed the way in which voters access and receive political information, such that it has circumvented the filtering of information previously undertaken by editorial offices. Consequently, consumers have had to learn how to filter relevant information themselves. The introduction phase of the internet coincided with a decreasing voter turnout, possibly due to “information overload” or less-focused political information. However, the subsequent rise of social media may help reverse the negative effect on turnout. But this poses challenges for regulatory policy. Understanding the internet’s effects on the consumption of information is also relevant for how voters view labor policies.
L82|Does the long tail really favor small publishers?|Abstract A growing body of literature is devoted to testing the reality of the “long-tail” phenomenon. This literature is mostly, if not exclusively, focused on the impact of Internet on the distribution of sales by product. However, the long tail also raises the issue of a possible change in the usual market structure of cultural industries: an oligopoly with a competitive fringe. To our knowledge, no paper addresses the following question: If the long-tail effect does exist, is it of more benefit to small or dominant publishers? The aim of this paper was to address this issue in the context of the French publishing industry. Our main findings are as follows: (1) the market concentration of the French book industry is lower online than offline and (2) the difference in concentration between the two channels of distribution tended to widen over the period 2004–2010. Strategies adopted by leading publishers on the Web do not allow them to maintain the market share obtained with bricks-and-mortar retailers. Furthermore, we show that the market share lost by dominant firms is captured by small publishers online and by medium-sized publishers in conventional stores.
L82|Are creators for or against to Fair Use?|We carried out survey analysis to approximately one thousand Japanese creators whether they were for or against the introduction of Fair Use to Japan, and found that nearly 70% of creators supported the introduction of Fair Use. This result was maintained no matter how we categorized creators like professionals vs amateur, employee vs independent, creator genres(movie, graphic, game, novel etc). In other words, the fact that creators were for the Fair Use was robust independent from the various characteristics of creators. The government councils, which are usually against the Fair Use, does not represents creators' opinion.
