Q52|Cows, cash and climate: Low stocking rates, high-performing cows, emissions and profitability across New Zealand farms|Using the New Zealand Monitor Farm Data (NZMFD), this paper explores the cost-effectiveness of two mitigation options to reduce biological greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on farms: reducing stocking rate (SR; the number of cows per effective hectare of dairy land); and increasing animal performance (AP; measured by production of milk solids (MS) per cow). These mitigation options have been defined as “no cost” because, if applied together, they could reduce the carbon footprint of farms while also maintaining or even improving profits (de Klein & Dynes, 2017). We evaluate the effect of these mitigation options on three main variables: milk profitability of the farm (cash operating surplus (COS)/ton of MS produced); emissions intensity (ton CO2eq/ton of MS produced); and the value of emissions (COS/ton CO2eq). The paper has two main findings: high-AP farms show significantly lower emissions intensities and higher milk profitability; and higher SRs on farms are significantly associated with lower emissions intensities while not being significantly associated with milk profitability or negatively associated with profit per hectare. These results imply that higher levels of AP reduce the GHG intensity of the farm and increase profit – a “no-cost” option – but unless either the SR or the area under dairy farming fall, an increase in AP will lead to an increase in absolute emissions. However, our results cast doubt on the idea that reducing SR is a no-cost way to achieve absolute emission reductions. The two options do seem to constitute a no-cost outcome when combined, but potentially the same mitigation could be achieved with lower loss of profit by reducing the area of dairy land while maintaining high SRs and increasing the performance of the animals.
Q52|Greening monetary policy|Central banks look at climate related risks at the financial stability side. Should they also take carbon intensity of assets into account at the monetary policy side? After reviewing the central bank mandate, the paper proposes a tilting approach to steer the Eurosystem's asset and collateral framework towards low carbon assets. We find that a modest tilting approach could reduce carbon emissions in the Eurosystem's corporate and bank bond portfolio by over 40 per cent. It could also lower the cost of capital of low carbon companies in comparison with high carbon companies by 4 basis points. Our findings suggest that such a low carbon allocation can be done without undue interference with the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Price stability, the primary objective, is, and should remain, the priority of the Eurosystem.
Q52|Does Access to Health Care Mitigate Environmental Damages?|Differential access to health care is commonly cited as a source of heterogeneity in environmental health damages, yet little causal evidence exists to support such claims. We address this deficit in two settings by testing whether the negative impacts of ambient temperature exposure on mortality were mitigated by (1) access to primary care through the Community Health Center program, and (2) access to hospital care through the desegregation of Southern hospitals. The results demonstrate that increased access to health care can drive heterogeneity in environmental damages when the mode of care is sufficiently relevant to the damages suffered.
Q52|Greening monetary policy|Central banks have already started to look at climate-related risks in the context of financial stability. Should they also take the carbon intensity of assets into account in the context of monetary policy? The guiding principle in the implementation of monetary policy has been ‘market neutrality’, whereby the central bank buys a proportion of the market portfolio of available corporate and bank bonds (in addition to government bonds). But this implies a carbon bias, because capital-intensive companies tend to be more carbon intensive. The author first reviews the legal mandate of the Eurosystem. While the primary objective is price stability, the Treaty on European Union allows the greening of monetary policy as a secondary objective. He proposes a tilting approach to steer or tilt the allocation of the Eurosystem’s assets and collateral towards low-carbon sectors, which would reduce the cost of capital for these sectors relative to high-carbon sectors. This allocation policy must be designed so it does not affect the effective implementation of monetary policy. The working of the tilting approach is calibrated with data on European corporate and bank bonds. We find that a modest tilting approach could reduce carbon emissions in the corporate and bank bond portfolio by 44 per cent and lower the cost of capital of low carbon companies by 4 basis points. Our findings also suggest that such a low carbon allocation can be done without undue interference with the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Price stability, the primary objective, is, and should remain, the priority of the Eurosystem.
Q52|Cooking that Kills : Cleaner Energy, Indoor Air Pollution, and Health|Cooking with dirty fuel is known to be one of the biggest sources of indoor air pollution in developing countries. I estimate the health impact of indoor air pollution using a nationwide fuel-switching program, the largest household energy transition project ever attempted in the developing world, affecting more than 50 million homes in Indonesia. This program focused on replacing a dirty cooking fuel, kerosene, with cleaner cooking fuel, liquid petroleum gas (LPG). I use a difference-in-differences design with time-varying program intensities to capture the dynamic increase in the households' access to LPG. A 10-percentage-point increase in the program intensity &- measured by the number of free initial LPG packages distributed &- reduces infant mortality rate by 3.3 percentage points, or 1.2 infants per 1,000 live births annually. This study highlights the fact that adopting cleaner energy can have a substantial health impact beyond what is currently known.
Q52|CO2-Bepreisung im Wärme- und Verkehrssektor: Erweiterung des Emissionshandels löst aktuelles Klimaschutzproblem nicht|Gegenwärtig sind die verschiedenen Energieträger in Deutschland unterschiedlich stark mit Abgaben und Umlagen belastet. Um die energie- und klimapolitischen Ziele der Bundesregierung zu erreichen, müssen fossile Heiz- und Kraftstoffe stärker bepreist werden (Kemfert et al. 2019; Dertinger und Schill 2019, SRU 2019). Zugleich herrscht in der energiepolitischen Debatte Uneinigkeit über die die Ausgestaltung einer CO2-Bepreisung. Eine Möglichkeit besteht darin, den EU-Emissionshandels (EUETS) auf die bislang nicht abgedeckten Sektoren Verkehr und Wärme europaweit, für eine Gruppe von EU-Mitgliedstaaten oder national auszuweiten. Eine weitere Option ist ein separates nationales Emissionshandelssystem für diese Sektoren einzuführen und eine dritte die Besteuerung zu reformieren, indem eine CO2-basierte Komponente in der Energiesteuer eingeführt wird. Der Sachverständigenrat zur Begutachtung der gesamtwirtschaftlichen Entwicklung (SVR) empfiehlt, den EU-ETS europaweit bis zum Jahr 2030 auf die Sektoren Verkehr und Gebäude auszuweiten sowie einen nationalen Emissionshandel oder eine CO2-Steuer als Übergangslösung zu etablieren (SVR 2019). Auch der Wissenschaftliche Beirat des Bundesministeriums für Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi) spricht sich dafür aus, den Zertifikatehandel auszuweiten: Die Preiskorridore für die verschiedenen Sektoren sollen sich zunächst unterscheiden und mittelfristig in einem einheitlichen europäischen Emissionsmarkt zusammengeführt werden (BMWi 2019). Mit folgendem Beitrag werden unterschiedliche Optionen für eine CO2-Bepreisung beschrieben und bewertet. Dabei werden neben der ökonomischen Perspektive (statische und dynamische Effizienz sowie ökologische Effektivität) auch die juristische und politische Durchsetzbarkeit berücksichtigt.
Q52|How Effective Was the UK Carbon Tax? — A Machine Learning Approach to Policy Evaluation|Carbon taxes are commonly seen as a rational policy response to climate change, but little is known about their performance from an ex-post perspective. This paper analyzes the emissions and cost impacts of the UK CPS, a carbon tax levied on all fossil-fired power plants. To overcome the problem of a missing control group, we propose a novel approach for policy evaluation which leverages economic theory and machine learning techniques for counterfactual prediction. Our results indicate that in the period 2013-2016 the CPS lowered emissions by 6.2 percent at an average cost of € 18 per ton. We find substantial temporal heterogeneity in tax-induced impacts which stems from variation in relative fuel prices. An important implication for climate policy is that a higher carbon tax does not necessarily lead to higher emissions reductions or higher costs.
Q52|Taxe carbone, le retour, à quelles conditions ?|La perspective d’une reprise de la hausse de la fiscalité carbone française, suspendue en décembre 2018, s’est précisée à l’occasion du « grand débat national » et plusieurs propositions d’amélioration du dispositif existant ont été avancées dans le débat public, visant en particulier sa dimension sociale. Nous proposons à notre tour dans cet article une nouvelle fiscalité carbone, dénommée « contribution climat anti-pauvreté énergétique », que nous inscrivons dans son cadre écologique, social, juridique et politique. Nous commençons par formuler, à la lumière des trois échecs successifs de 2001, 2010 et 2018, quatre critères de réussite d’une fiscalité carbone : son efficacité écologique, sa justice sociale, sa conformité juridique et enfin son acceptabilité politique. Nous détaillons ensuite pour chaque critère les modalités que nous envisageons afin d’assurer la réussite de notre proposition. Répondant notamment aux revendications de justice sociale et d’équité fiscale du mouvement des « gilets jaunes », la fiscalité carbone que nous proposons permettrait à 50% des ménages français de recevoir plus qu’ils ne paient, les recettes additionnelles dégagées permettant de réduire considérablement la précarité énergétique qui touche des millions de Français.
Q52|Geographic environmental Kuznets curves: The optimal growth linear-quadratic case|We solve a linear-quadratic model of a spatio-temporal economy using a polluting one-input technology. Space is continuous and heterogenous: locations di er in productivity, nature self-cleaning technology and environmental awareness. The unique link between locations is transboundary pollution which is modelled as a PDE di usion equation. The spatio-temporal functional is quadratic in local consumption and linear in pollution. Using a dynamic programming method adapted to our in nite dimensional setting, we solve the associated optimal pollution. We show that optimal emissions will decrease at given location if and only if local productivity is larger than a threshold which depends both on the local pollution absorption capacity and environmental awareness. Furthermore, we numerically explore the relationship between the spatial optimal distributions of production and (asymptotic) pollution in order to uncover possible (geographic) Environmental Kuznets Curve cases.
Q52|Environmental tax reform and income distribution with imperfect heterogeneous labour markets|This paper investigates the distributional and efficiency consequences of an environmental tax reform that distributes the revenue from a green tax according to varying labour tax rates. We build a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous workers, imperfect labour markets (search and match), and pollution consumption externalities. Preferences are non-homothetic (Stone–Geary utility) to take into account the potential regressivity of green taxes (the polluting good is assumed to be a necessary good). If the reform appears regressive, the gains from the double dividend can achieve Pareto improvement, using a redistributive non-linear income tax if the redistribution is not too great initially. Increasing progressivity influences the unemployment rate and can moderate the trade-off between equity and efficiency. We finally provide numerical illustrations for France and conduct sensitivity analysis.
Q52|Decarbonization And Energy Policy Instruments In The Eu: Does Carbon Pricing Prevail?|The issue of instrument choice is vital for climate policy. Carbon pricing is used next to a range of traditional energy taxes and renewable energy policies such as feed-in tariffs and minimal renewable generation targets. Several countries introduced carbon taxes alongside existing energy taxes such as excise duties on vehicle fuels. Since 2005, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) has attached a direct price to the GHG emissions of ETS companies. The combination of multiple instruments and explicit and indirect carbon price signals created a complex and frequently changing institutional landscape that blurs the contribution of each policy instrument. Can the decarbonization of the European economy be attributed to carbon price instruments or to renewable energy policies together with other fiscal instruments? This paper clarifies the relative impact of explicit carbon price instruments (carbon taxes and EU ETS) compared to other instruments, namely renewable energy policies and indirect carbon price signals (general energy taxes). The methodology is based on the calculation of the implicit carbon price in existing fiscal systems. On the basis of panel data for 30 European countries 1995–2016, several fixed-effect regression estimations were performed. The results indicate a greater but decreasing impact of price instruments on carbon intensity compared to renewable energy policies and a greater but decreasing relative impact of indirect price signals compared to explicit ones.
Q52|Low Emission Zones for Better Health: Evidence from German Hospitals|This paper studies health effects from restricting the access of high-emission vehicles to innercities by implementing Low Emission Zones. For identification, we exploit variation in the timing and the spatial distribution of the introduction of new Low Emission Zones across cities in Germany. We use detailed hospitalization data combined with geo-coded information on the coverage of Low Emission Zones. We find that Low Emission Zones significantly reduce levels of air pollution in urban areas and that these improvements in air quality translate into population health benefits. The number of diagnoses related to air pollution is significantly reduced for hospitals located within or in close proximity to a Low Emission Zone after it becomes effective. The results are mainly driven by reductions in chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
Q52|The pricing of green bonds: are financial institutions special?|The financial system plays a major role in the transition to a low-carbon economy. We investigate this issue analysing the recent developments and challenges in the bond and debt markets. First, we study the pricing of green bonds at issuance. We find a premium when green bonds are issued by supranational institutions and corporates while there is no effect for financial institutions. We also document an effect for external review and repeated access to this market. Second, we investigate lending decisions by banks issuing green bonds. Our results show that these lenders reduce their funding towards more polluting segments of the economy but limited to the amount of loans they granted as lead bank in the deal. This evidence may explain why we do not find a green premium for financial issuers. Yet it also suggests that the banking system may play a much larger role in channelling funds towards low-carbon activities, and thus reducing the environmental risks also for the financial system.
Q52|Burden of Inspection Costs and Effectiveness of Environmental Regulations|Using a laboratory experimental approach, this study examines the effect of institutional changes in the responsibility for paying inspection costs for environmental regulations on the behavior of polluters and authorities. In particular, we compare two schemes: one is that authorities always bear the inspection cost and the other is that polluters bear the cost in a given situation. We find that polluters comply with regulations more frequently in the latter than the former scheme, while the inspection behavior of authorities does not change significantly. Moreover, the cost-bearing change in the scheme induces income redistribution between polluters and authorities (pollutees or society). In addition, we introduce uncertainty about the occurrence of environmental damage, and find that the frequency of inspection is greater in the latter than the former scheme. Because both inspection and compliance costs increase, total payoff may decrease by the partial shift of responsibility for inspection cost from authorities to polluters.
Q52|Improving Abatement Levels and Welfare by Coarse Correlation in an Environmental Game|Coarse correlated equilibria (CCE, Moulin and Vial, 1978) can be used to substantially improve upon the Nash equilibrium solution of the well-analysed abatement game (Barrett, 1994). We show this by computing successively the CCE with the largest total utility, the one with the highest possible abatement levels and finally, the one with maximal abatement level while maintaining at least the level of utility from the Nash outcome.
Q52|Identifying barriers to adoption of “no-cost” greenhouse gas mitigation practices in pastoral systems|New Zealand scientists have suggested that multiple pastoral farming practices could reduce on-farm biological greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while maintaining (and in some circumstances even increasing) farm profits (e.g. de Klein and Dynes, 2017). However, these win–win practices (which we define as “no-cost” mitigation practices) are reported to be under-adopted in New Zealand (Reisinger et al. 2018). The focus of this paper is to identify barriers affecting the adoption or expansion of no-cost mitigation practices by farmers in New Zealand. We define and categorize barriers to adoption using a typology of barriers developed by Jaffe (2017). This typology provides a comprehensive list and precise/accurate description of multiple barriers that might be present in farming contexts. First, we confront the typology with empirical evidence in the literature studying the barriers to the adoptions of technologies and practices in the context of pastoral farming. Although the evidence on perceptions and adoption of GHG emissions mitigation options in New Zealand is very limited, several of the barriers in Jaffe’s typology have been evidenced by researchers as affecting the decisions to adopt different innovative technologies and practices on farms. To complement the literature review and, more importantly, focus on no-cost GHG mitigation practices, we conducted interviews with 14 farmers in different regions of the country. In these conversations we discussed different managerial and practical implications of five different no-cost farming practices, with the aim of identifying barriers that affect their adoption or expansion. We describe in the paper more than 40 quotes obtained from farmers, from which we identified the occurrence of 16 different barriers. Among these, the “Unsureness about practicality”, “risk and uncertainty” and “complex interactions” barriers showed as the most frequent barriers identified as causing under-adoption of the evaluated practices. In addition, different types of perceived costs (financial barriers), such as “modelling mismatch” and “learning and adjustment”, have been pointed out as a limitation for adoption (which are captured by barriers category “arguably efficient” in Jaffe’s typology). We also found that in some cases non-financial barriers seem to be interconnected – in especial the case when the interactions’ complexity increases the riskiness of the outcome (the “risk and uncertainty” barrier) and makes it difficult to see whether the mitigation option is practical (a barrier of “unsureness about practicality”).
Q52|Bringing Satellite-Based Air Quality Estimates Down to Earth|"We use state-of-the-art, satellite-based PM2.5 estimates to assess the extent to which the EPA's existing, monitor-based measurements over- or under-estimate true exposure to PM2.5 pollution. Treating satellite-based estimates as truth implies a substantial number of ""policy errors""—over-regulating areas that comply with air quality standards and under-regulating other areas that appear to violate standards. We investigate the health implications of these apparent errors and highlight the importance of accounting for prediction error in satellite-based estimates. Uncertainty in ""policy errors"" increases substantially when we account for these underlying prediction errors."
Q52|Do Pollution Markets Harm Low Income and Minority Communities? Ranking Emissions Distributions Generated by California's RECLAIM Program|We compare the spatial distribution of emissions from Southern California’s pollution-trading program with that of a counterfactual command-and-control policy. We develop a normatively significant metric with which to rank the various distributions in a manner consistent with an explicit well-behaved preference structure. Results suggest trading benefited all demographic groups and generated a more equitable overall distribution of emissions even after controlling for its lower aggregate emissions. Upper-income and white demographics had more desirable distributions relative to low-income and some minority groups under the RECLAIM trading program, however, and population shifts over time may have undermined anticipated gains for African Americans.
Q52|Unemployment, Labor Mobility, and Climate Policy|We develop a computable general equilibrium model of the United States economy to study the unemployment effects of climate policy and the importance of cross-sectoral labor mobility. We consider two alternate extreme assumptions about labor mobility: either perfect mobility, as is assumed in much previous work, or perfect immobility. The effect of a $35 per ton carbon tax on aggregate unemployment is small and similar across the two labor mobility assumptions (0.2–0.3 percentage points). The effect on unemployment in fossil fuel sectors is much larger under the immobility assumption – a 30 percentage-point increase in the coal sector – suggesting that models omitting labor mobility frictions may greatly under-predict sectoral unemployment effects. Returning carbon tax revenue through labor tax cuts can dampen or even reverse negative impacts on unemployment, while command-and-control policies yield larger unemployment effects.
Q52|Addressing Climate Change through Price and Non-Price Interventions|Recognizing the importance of the second-best nature of economies, the Stern-Stiglitz report on carbon pricing departed from the recommendation of a single carbon price for all uses at all places and times. This paper provides some of the analytics behind these recommendations. First, I analyze the circumstances in which distributional concerns make desirable a tax or regulation inducing significant reductions in carbon usage in a carbon-intensive sector for which consumers are disproportionately rich. Such policies allow lower carbon prices elsewhere without exceeding carbon emission targets. The cost of the resulting production inefficiency may, under the identified circumstances, be less than the distributional benefits. The paper considers the circumstances in which such differential policies may be best implemented through regulation vs. differential pricing, as well as differential effects on political economy and norm setting. Second, I consider the effect of carbon price trajectories on induced innovation, providing general conditions under which the optimal carbon path should, at least eventually, be falling over time. Finally, I revisit the price-versus-quantity debate and highlight important aspects of the dynamic nature of the problem.
Q52|Jobs and Environmental Regulation|Political debates around environmental regulation often center around the effect of policy on jobs. Opponents decry the “job-killing” EPA and proponents point to “green jobs” as a positive policy outcome. And beyond the political debates, Congress requires the EPA to evaluate “potential losses or shifts of employment” that regulations under the Clean Air Act may cause. Yet there is a sharp disconnect between the political importance of the jobs question and the limited research on job effects of policy and general skepticism in the academic literature about the importance of those job effects for the costs and benefits of environmental regulation. In this paper, we discuss how the existing research on jobs and environmental regulations often falls short in evaluating these questions and consider recent new work that has attempted to address these problems. We provide an intuitive discussion of key questions for how job effects should enter into economic analysis of regulations. And, using an economic model from Hafstead, Williams, and Chen (2018), we evaluate a range of environmental regulations in both the short and long-run to develop a set of key stylized facts related to jobs and environmental regulations and to identify the key questions that current models can’t yet answer well.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q52|Can Pigou at the Polls Stop Us Melting the Poles?|Surveys show majority U.S. support for a carbon tax. Yet none has been adopted. Why? We study two failed carbon tax initiatives in Washington State in 2016 and 2018. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we show that Washington's real-world campaigns reduced support by 20 percentage points. Resistance to higher energy prices explains opposition to these policies in the average precinct, while ideology explains 90% of the variation in votes across precincts. Conservatives preferred the 2016 revenue-neutral policy, while liberals preferred the 2018 green-spending policy. Yet we forecast both initiatives would fail in other states, demonstrating that surveys are overly optimistic.
Q52|The Importance of Source-Side Effects for the Incidence of Single Sector Technology Mandates and Vintage Differentiated Regulation|Understanding the distribution of regulatory costs is key to evaluating whether a rulemaking exacerbates or ameliorates preexisting economic disparities and is of stated interest to many stakeholders and policy makers. Previous studies on the incidence of command-and-control environmental regulations have predominantly focused on the distribution of costs through final goods prices (the use side). However, the impact of regulations on household income (the source side) can be of first-order importance in determining the overall incidence. Using a detailed computable general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy we study the incidence of single-sector technology mandates across a broad set of industrial sectors. We find the use-side incidence is notably regressive but the source-side effects are progressive on average and tend to dominate the overall incidence of costs. This occurs as a significant share of regulatory costs is passed on through lower returns to capital and natural resources, which predominantly affects upper-income households, while indexed transfer payments partially shields the purchasing power of low-income households from increases in output prices. However, when the regulated sector predominantly produces final goods with inelastic demand and low trade exposure (e.g., utility services) we find that the use-side incidence can dominate leading to regressive distribution of regulatory costs. Finally, we find that the common practice of vintage differentiation, whereby only new sources of pollution are covered, can cause a significantly more regressive distribution of costs, all else equal.
Q52|Navigating pathways to reform water policies in agriculture|This report offers a guide on potential reform pathways towards sustainable agriculture water use, based on a thorough review of selected past water and agriculture reforms and extensive consultation with policy experts. A theory of change is developed that emphasises the importance of flexibility in the timing and design of reform processes to achieve practical and effective policy changes. Governments should prepare future reforms, via continued research, education, and governance efforts, to help take advantage of reform opportunities when the timing is right. Five necessary conditions are identified for a successful reform process: (i) support evidence-based problem definition, objective setting and evaluations; (ii) ensure that governance and institutions are aligned with the policy change; (iii) engage stakeholders strategically and build trust; (iv) rebalance economic incentives to mitigate short run economic losses; and (v) define an adjustable smart reform sequencing that provides flexibility in the long run. These conditions are found to be necessary to implement four challenging policy changes: charging water use in agriculture; removing subsidies that negatively impact water resources, regulating groundwater use and addressing nonpoint source pollution. But the relative effort that governments need to devote to fulfilling each of the five conditions will vary depending on the policy change.
Q52|Bio-economy and the sustainability of the agriculture and food system: Opportunities and policy challenges|The bio-economy is gaining increasing prominence in the policy debate, with several countries developing bio-economy strategies to decouple economic growth from dependence on fossil fuel, as well a pathway to supporting some of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement. This report analyses the opportunities and policy challenges facing the bio-economy in transitioning to a more sustainable agro-food system. It provides an overview of national bio-economy- strategies based on a literature review and information provided by governments in response to a questionnaire.
Q52|The impacts of pollution control policies on the pollution in small open economies|We examine the effects of tax policies on pollution in a small open economy. There are two pollution causes: consumption activities of households and production activities of rms. In this setup, we examine how tax policies affect pollution and the small open economy. Considering that pollution control policies are undertaken only for temporary periods in countries, we mainly focus on duration of governments' pollution control poli- cies; that is, permanent and temporary policies. The main nding is that the government in the small open economy need to tackle pollution problems from a long-term perspective in order to decrease the level of pollution.
Q52|Climate Change Mitigation Through Market-based instruments in Large Asian Emitters|Climate change is responsibility of the economic system like households, firms, and governments that produces Greenhouse Gases (GHG). This paper aims to analyze effectiveness and efficiency of climate change mitigation policies for Japan, China and India that are large Asian emitters through market-based instruments. GTAP-E model is used to analyze the impact of carbon tax policy using their global commitments to reduce carbon emissions. The result shows that carbon tax is best alternative choice for Japan, China, and India to reduce CO2 emissions as a climate change mitigation. The carbon tax provides that in a GDP increase of 0,44% in Japan. But in China and India find that reducing CO2 emission causes GDP is decline around 0,82% for China and 1,98 for India. Thus, all regions can get emission target by cost-effectively and each welfare loss can be compensated by carbon tax revenues. However, carbon tax is not one way fits to climate change mitigation.
Q52|The Environmental Kuznets Curve in ASEAN: The Case of Carbon Emissions|Over the past two decades, researchers have sought to establish empirical evidence for an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) for carbon dioxide (CO2), with varied results. This study builds on that research to re-evaluate whether the EKC exists for CO2 emissions, using an improved dataset and the enhanced econometric technique Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) estimator. The aims determine how various factors like economic growth, and energy use influence CO2 emissions. The CO2 emission rate is the dependent variable and the independent variables of the model include the lagged dependent variable, GDP per capita (constant 2010 US$), and energy use. We find that EKC is based on economic growth for ASEAN countries, and increased energy use actually increase CO2 emissions
Q52|The Implication of B20 Policy on Environment|This paper investigates the impact of B20 policy, with the aims to reduce fossil oil import and increase production of biofuel, on environment impact. General Trade Analysis Project on Energy and Environment (GTAP E) model is using to analyze its impact. the result shows that reduction of 20 percent on import oil gives positive impact on reduction of carbon dioxode emission. While paddy rice, forestry, vegan fruit and agriculture gives negative impact on commodity market price, and natural resources gives positive impacts.
Q52|The Impact of Carbon Tax on GDP and Environment|This study aims to examine the impact of imposing carbon taxes as an effort to reduce the effects of greenhouse gases. By using GTAP-E, this study found that the imposition of a vehicle carbon tax of 5 percent resulted in a reduction in the GDP rate of 0.01 percent and effectively reduced the level of carbon dioxide emissions by 0.06 percent.
Q52|Modeling and forecasting carbon dioxide emissions in China using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models|This research uses annual time series data on CO2 emissions in China from 1960 to 2017, to model and forecast CO2 using the Box – Jenkins ARIMA approach. Diagnostic tests indicate that China CO2 emission data is I (2). The study presents the ARIMA (1, 2, 1) model. The diagnostic tests further imply that the presented best model is stable and hence acceptable for predicting carbon dioxide emissions in China. The results of the study reveal that CO2 emissions in China are likely to increase and thereby exposing China to a plethora of climate change related challenges. 4 main policy prescriptions have been put forward for consideration by the Chinese government.
Q52|Examining eco-efficiency convergence of European Industries.The existence of technological spillovers within a metafrontier framework|European policies regarding global warming have been outspread the last few decades with many initiatives for industrial production process. In this paper we model eco-efficiency performance under a meta-frontier framework for 14 industries from the manufacturing sector from 27 European countries over the 1995-2011 period. The utilization of NOx, SOx, CO2, CH4, N2O, CO, NMVOC and NH3 as undesirable outputs and GVA as the desirable represent the impact of of economic activities on the environment. In the first stage, we estimate eco-efficiency using the conventional Directional Distance Function (DDF) as well as the non-radial DDF approach. In the second stage of analysis, we investigate the existence of conditional and unconditional convergence according to several methodologies. Our eco-efficiency estimates provide a distinct behavior for energy intensive European industries. Moreover, a decline occurs for the majority of them. In addition, our results using distributional dynamics approach and the recent approach of Philips and Sul (2007) supports the non-convergence hypothesis and the creation of distinct clubs. Finally, the establishment of a catch up index indicate an increase in a speed of convergence.
Q52|Neutral carbon tax and environmental targets in Brazil|We evaluate the effects of a carbon tax in the Brazilian economy using an input-output framework. First, we consider the impacts of a carbon tax of US$ 10 and US$ 50/metric ton of CO2 equivalent. As usual, the adoption of the carbon tax generates adverse effects on GDP, wages and jobs in the short term, but reduces emissions and generates new government revenues, especially in the case of the greater tax. Second, we consider a broader tax system reform. In this reform, we replace distortionary taxes by a tax on value added. To compensate for the loss of government revenue, we assume a carbon tax with equivalent revenue. We find that the net effect is a GDP increase of 0.47%, the creation of 533 thousand jobs and reduction of 1.6 million tons of CO2 emissions. Both scenarios exempt exports and levy imports to correct adverse effects on the countryâ€™s competitiveness.
Q52|China shock: environmental impacts in Brazil|We study whether the â€œChina shockâ€ , defined as Chinaâ€™s rapid emergence in global markets, caused environmental impacts in Brazilian municipalities, since previous evidence points to effects on real wages and formal sector employment over the period of 2000 to 2010. Building on recent theoretical developments, we implement a shift-share strategy to explore variation in economic specialization between municipalities and find that Chinaâ€™s direct influence on deforestation of the Amazon and Cerrado was on average insignificant, which is supported by the literature. On the other hand, Chinaâ€™s demand for commodities seems to have increased pollution-related mortality of children in mining municipalities, a result obtained by comparing it to mortality caused by other factors. However, we show that this is most likely explained by a municipalityâ€™s degree of specialization in mining activities rather than its exposure to trade with China. We conclude that the environmental impacts of the China shock on Brazilian municipalities were small, if not negligible.
Q52|Retour de la taxe carbone : les options en présence|Le « grand débat national », décidé et organisé par le pouvoir exécutif, va connaître son épilogue dans les prochaines semaines. Engendré par la révolte des « gilets jaunes » contre l’iniquité fiscale, il était logique qu’il suscite une réflexion sur la réforme de la fiscalité carbone, suspendue en décembre 2018, qui se trouve au point d’intersection exact entre les deux thèmes les plus débattus en ligne par les Français : « la transition écologique » et « la fiscalité et les dépenses publiques ». Nous ajoutons aujourd’hui une dimension supplémentaire à ce débat en proposant d’instituer pour 2020 une contribution climat anti-précarité énergétique. C’est l’occasion d’éclairer pour les citoyens et les décideurs certaines des options de réforme en présence, avant, éventuellement, de trancher. Le Tableau 1 présente les caractéristiques des quatre propositions les plus abouties et détaillées présentées ces dernières semaines, dont la nôtre (il en existe bien d’autres).
Q52|Taxe carbone, le retour, à quelles conditions ?|La perspective d’une reprise de la hausse de la fiscalité carbone française, suspendue en décembre 2018, s’est précisée à l’occasion du « grand débat national » et plusieurs propositions d’amélioration du dispositif existant ont été avancées dans le débat public, visant en particulier sa dimension sociale.

Répondant notamment aux revendications de justice sociale et d’équité fiscale du mouvement des « gilets jaunes », la fiscalité carbone que nous proposons permettrait à 50% des ménages français de recevoir plus qu’ils ne paient, les recettes additionnelles dégagées permettant de réduire considérablement la précarité énergétique qui touche des millions de Français.
Q52|Discretionary Exemptions from Environmental Regulation: Flexibility for Good or for Ill|"We develop a model of firm and regulator behavior to examine theoretically the use and consequences of discretionary exemptions (also known as variances, waivers, or exceptions) in environmental regulation. Many environmental protection laws, such as the Clean Water Act, impose limits on harmful activities yet include ""safety valve"" provisions giving the regulator discretion to grant full or partial exemptions that provide permanent or temporary relief from these limits. This discretion begets flexibility over the stringency of environmental protection laws. Our model places a profit-maximizing discharger of pollution under the purview of a fully informed regulator who may seek to maximize social welfare by imposing limits. We show that when a regulation does not otherwise allow flexibility, an exemption that relaxes the limit for firms with high abatement costs can improve social welfare by reducing the costs of achieving the given level of environmental quality. We further demonstrate that if the effectiveness of abatement technology improves over time, a temporary exemption can increase social welfare by adjusting allowable pollution in response to these dynamic conditions. We also show that if the labor market is sticky, exemptions can benefit workers. Driven by an unequally weighted social welfare function, the regulator may use exemptions to meet redistributive ends. However, these beneficial impacts of exemptions rely on a fully informed and benevolent regulator; otherwise, the discretionary nature of exemptions leaves them open to abuse. A regulator who is captured by industry, focused only on her own jurisdiction or answerable only to a set of elites, can abuse exemptions in ways that reduce social welfare, such as allowing inefficiently high pollution or inducing a cost-ineffective pattern of abatement."
Q52|Financing conditions and toxic emissions|Exploiting heterogeneity in U.S. firms' exposure to an unconventional monetary policy shock that reduced debt financing costs, I identify the impact of financing conditions on firms' toxic emissions. I find robust evidence that lower financing costs reduce toxic emissions and boost investments in emission reduction activities, especially capital-intensive pollution control activities. The effect is stronger for firms in noncompliance with environmental regulation. Examining the ability of regaining regulatory compliance by implementing pollution control activities I find that only capital-intensive activities help firms regaining compliance. These findings underscore the impact of firms' financing conditions for emissions and the environment.
Q52|Implementing result-based agri-environmental payments by means of modelling|From a theoretical point of view, result-based agri-environmental payments are clearly preferable to action-based payments. However, they suffer from two major practical disadvantages: costs of measuring the results and payment uncertainty for the participating farmers. In this paper, we propose an alternative design to overcome these two disadvantages by means of modelling (instead of measuring) the results. We describe the concept of model-informed result-based agri-environmental payments (MIRBAP), including a hypothetical example of payments for the protection and enhancement of soil functions. We offer a comprehensive discussion of the relative advantages and disadvantages of MIRBAP, showing that it not only unites most of the advantages of result-based and action-based schemes, but also adds two new advantages: the potential to address trade-offs among multiple policy objectives and management for long-term environmental effects. We argue that MIRBAP would be a valuable addition to the agri-environmental policy toolbox and a reflection of recent advancements in agri-environmental modelling.
Q52|Environmental innovation and firm profitability: An analysis with respect to firm size|This paper investigates the effect of environmental innovations on firm profitability with respect to differences between small and medium-sized (SME) and large (LE) enterprises. Using data from the Mannheim Innovation Panel (MIP) 2015, results show that, in general, SME benefit more from environmental innovations than LE. This effect is particularly strong for resource efficiency-improving innovations induced by regulation. These environmental innovations are significantly related to an increase in profits of SME, whilst related to a decrease in profits of LE. A robustness check with data from the MIP 2009, however, does not confirm this result as the effect for LE is insignificant and differences between the two groups cannot be found in this survey wave. A reason why negative effects for LE are observed in the MIP 2015 - but not in the MIP 2009 - might be that most LE had already exploited the potentials of environmental innovations when they were surveyed in the MIP 2015. This is supported by evidence suggesting that size-related differences in the MIP 2015 are driven by a negative relationship between LE's profits and environmental innovations related to externalities that were reduced by innovations in periods before.
Q52|Environmental Risks between Conceptualization and Action|Changes in the contemporary world materialized in particular through population growth and mobility, urbanization, and economic expansion also result in an increased exposure of people and assets to extreme events and impose, implicitly, adequate management of induced risks. The occurrence of natural and anthropogenic risk phenomena, known as hazards, puts a heavy tribute on disaster-sensitive human communities regardless of their level of development. The magnitude of the disasters and their increasing frequency and severity imply the need for their approach by the entire world community and for global action. Knowledge of risks becomes a sine qua condition in carrying out impact studies, risk prevention plans, spatial planning plans, and, in general, a condition for effective management of natural resources or sustainable development projects.
Q52|An Advantage of Emission Intensity Regulation for Emission Cap Regulation in a Near-Zero Emission Industry|We revisit command-and-control regulations and compare their efficiencies, in particular, an emission cap regulation that restricts total emissions and an emission intensity regulation that restricts emissions per unit of output under emission equivalence. We find that in both the most stringent target case, when the target emission level is close to zero, and the weakest target case, when the target emission level is close to business as usual, emission intensity yields greater welfare, although the same may not be true in moderate target cases.
Q52|The impact of oil prices on CO2 emissions in China: A Wavelet coherence approach|This paper observes the possible co-movements of oil price and CO2 emissions in China by following wavelet coherence and wavelet partial coherence analyses to be able to depict short-run and long-run co-movements at both low and high frequencies. To this end, this research might provide the current literature with the output of potential short run and long run, structural, changes in CO2 emissions upon a shock (a change) in oil prices in China together with the control variables of World oil prices, fossil energy consumption, and renewables consumption, and, urban population in China. Therefore, this research aims at determining wavelet coherencies between the variables and phase differences to exhibit the leading variable in potential co-movements. By following the time domain and frequency domain analyses of this research, one may claim that the oil prices in China has considerable negative impact on CO2 emissions at high frequencies for the periods 1960-2014 and 1971-2014 in China. Besides, one may underline as well other important output of the research exploring that the urban population and CO2 emissions have positive associations, move together for the period 1960-2014 in China. Eventually, this paper might suggest that authorities follow demand side management policies considering energy demand behavior at both shorter cycles and longer cycles to diminish the CO2 emissions in China.
Q52|Analysing Carbon Pass-Through Rate Mechanism in the Electricity Sector: Evidence from Greece|In this study, we shed light into the carbon pass-through rate mechanism to wholesale prices in the Greek electric market. For this reason, we utilize a rich micro-level panel, including hourly data for 23 power plants spanning the period January 2014 to December 2017. In order to study the pass-through of emissions costs to wholesale electricity prices, we used an instrumental variable methodology. Our findings survived several robustness checks, accounting for logged linear and non-linear econometric specifications. Moreover, they are in alignment with the relevant recent literature, indicating the existence of an almost complete pass-through rate mechanism. This means that electricity firms almost fully internalize the cost of CO2 permits, incurring important policy implications to policy makers and government officials.
Q52|Climate Friendly Goods and Technology Trade: Climate Mitigation Strategy of India|This study focuses on India’s climate change mitigation strategy through trade and how India gradually moves forward towards the goal of sustainable development path. The paper highlights trade performances of climate friendly goods and technology (CFGT) in India during 2002-20017 and suggests possible solution through trade channels that might mitigate climate change through disseminating and exchanging the low carbon and clean technologies, which improve energy efficiency and minimizes environmental impacts. The products associated with clean technologies which have relatively less adverse impact on the environment. This paper attempts to realize India’s CFGT export and import, and quantify trade opportunities of CFGT in India. With these it also identifies constrains and helps to widen capacity and strengthen its capability in the advancement of capturing new opportunities in production and trade in CFGT. India should adopt few policies to improve and raise CFGT production while trade ensures availability of technologies
Q52|Revenue and efficiency in pollution permit allocation mechanisms|The most contentious design issue within pollution markets is the choice of initial allocation mechanism. Within this debate, auctions have become the predominant method of initial permit allocation. Although auctions provide potential gainsâ€”such as revenue generation, allocative efficiency and clear price discoveryâ€”these benefits are rarely fully realized due to firms submitting non-truthful bids. We propose a mechanism that can improve on existing auctions. In our design the regulator determines the supply (up to an upper bound) once all bids have been submitted. This simple and applicable design incites truthful revelation of firmsâ€™ private abatement costs, maximizes revenue, and allocates the permits efficiently. This design is relevant to all existing permit auctions including those in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), and the California Cap-and-Trade Program.
Q52|Analyse nachhaltigen Verhaltens und Maßnahmen zu dessen Begünstigung|Die vorliegende Forschungsarbeit setzt sich mit nachhaltigem Verhalten in Bezug auf die Nutzung von Kaffeebehältern an der HBRS auseinander. Anlass dafür ist, dass Pappbecher aufgrund einer Plastikbeschichtung nur schwer recycelbar sind und somit die Umwelt erheblich beeinträchtigen. In diesem Zusammenhang nahmen 204 Studierende an einer Online-Befragung teil. Den Ergebnissen zufolge kommen derzeit vor allem Einweg-Pappbecher zum Einsatz. Zur Modifizierung dieses umweltschädlichen Verhaltens bedarf es an geeigneten Interventionsstrategien. Basierend auf den Ergebnissen sind Maßnahmen zu implementieren, die dem Defizit an Handlungswissen und dem hohen Aufwand entgegenwirken, welcher mit der Verwendung eigens mitgebrachter Becher und den vorhandenen Porzellantassen assoziiert wird. Nach Sicherstellung der ökologischen Vorteile und finanziellen Umsetzbarkeit sollte das bestehende Pfandsystem um praktischere Becher sowie flexible Rückgabemöglichkeiten erweitert werden. Unterstützend ist eine Belohnung in Form von Freigetränken oder einem geringen finanziellen Rabatt sinnvoll, um den automatischen Verbrauch von Pappbechern zu unterbinden.
Q52|Environmental Regulation and Green Skills: An Empirical Exploration|This paper provides new evidence on the workplace skills most relevant in the transition toward environmentally sustainable economies. Using a novel data-driven methodology, we identify two main sets of green skills, namely, engineering skills for the design and production of technology, and managerial skills for implementing and monitoring environmental organizational practices. Exploiting exogenous geographical variation in regulatory stringency, we also evaluate the effect of environmental regulation on the demand of green skills for a panel of US metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas over the period 2006–14. The main finding is that while these changes in environmental regulation have no impact on overall employment, they create significant, if modest, gaps in the demand for some green skills, especially those related to technical and engineering work tasks.
Q52|Climate policies and skill-biased employment dynamics : evidence from EU countries|The political acceptability of climate policies is undermined by job-killing arguments, especially for the least-skilled workers. However, evidence for distributional impacts for different workers remains scant. We examine the associations between climate policies, proxied by energy prices and a stringency index, and workforce skills for 14 European countries and 15 industrial sectors over the period of 1995-2011. We find that, while the long-term decline in employment in most carbon-intensive sectors is unrelated to policy stringency, climate policies have been skill biased against manual workers and have favoured technicians and professionals. This skill bias is confirmed using a shift-share instrumental variable estimator
Q52|On the Effects of Linking Voluntary Cap-and-Trade Systems for CO2 Emissions|Linkage of cap-and-trade systems is typically advocated by economists on a general analogy with the beneficial linking of free-trade areas and on the specific grounds that linkage will ensure cost effectiveness among the linked jurisdictions. An appropriate and widely accepted specification for the damages of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions within a relatively short (say 5-10 year) period is that marginal damages for each jurisdiction are constant (although they can differ among jurisdictions). With this defensible assumption, the analysis is significantly clarified and yields simple closed-form expressions for all CO2 permit prices. Some implications for linked and unlinked voluntary CO2 cap-and-trade systems are derived and discussed.
Q52|Optimal timing of harzardous waste clean-up under an environmental bond an a strict liability rule|Inadequate site clean-up and restoration by resource extraction firms leave a toxic legacy which must be dealt with by governments. This study compares the impacts of an environmental bond and a strict liability rule on a firm's incentives for cleaning up hazardous waste during resource extraction and upon termination. The firm's problem is modelled as a stochastic optimal control problem that results in a system of Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equations. The model is applied to a typical copper mine in Canada. The resource price is modelled as a stochastic differential equation, which is calibrated to copper futures prices using a Kalman filtering approach. A numerical solution is implemented to determine the optimal abatement and extraction rates as well as the critical levels of copper prices that would motivate a firm to clean up the accumulated waste under each policy. The paper demonstrates that an environmental bond provides stronger waste abatement incentives, implying that the waste is more likely to be cleaned up under the bond than the liability. The strict liability rule imposes sunk costs on a firm upon termination which would motivate it to remain inactive as a way to escape clean-up costs. However, the environmental bond raises funds ex ante for future clean-up costs and thus encourages site restoration.
Q52|Climate games: Who's on first? What's on second?|We study three different climate change games and compare with the outcome of choices by a Social Planner. In a dynamic setting, two players choose levels of carbon emissions. Rising atmospheric carbon stocks increase average global temperature which damages player utilities. Temperature is modeled as a stochastic differential equation. We contrast the results of a Stackelberg game with a game in which both players as leaders (a Leader-Leader or Trumpian game). We also examine a game, called an Interleaved game, where there is a significant time interval between player decisions. One or both players may be better off in these alternative games compared to the Stackelberg game, depending on state variables. We conclude that it is important to consider alternate game structures in examining strategic interactions in pollution games. We also demonstrate that the Stackelberg game is the limit of the Interleaved game as the time between decisions goes to zero.
Q52|Strategic interactions and uncertainty in decisions to curb greenhouse gas emissions|"This paper examines the strategic interactions of two large regions making choices about greenhouse gas emissions in the face of rising global temperatures. Optimal decisions are modelled in a fully dynamic, closed loop Stackelberg pollution game. Global average temperature is modelled as a mean reverting stochastic process. A numerical solution of a coupled system of HJB equations is implemented. We explore the impact of temperature volatility and regional asymmetries on emissions, contrasting the outcomes from the Stackelberg game with the choices made by a social planner. When players are identical, a classic tragedy of the commons is demonstrated in which players in the game choose higher carbon emissions and have lower utility as compared to the outcome with a social planner. Over certain values of state variables, the tragedy of the commons is shown to be exacerbated by increased temperature volatility and regional asymmetries in climate damages. Asymmetries in environmental preferences can, under certain conditions, result in a green paradox whereby green sentiments in one region cause the other region to increase emissions. Interestingly, we also found that a contrary ""green bandwagon"" effect is possible. At high levels of the carbon stock, green preferences in one region can cause the other region to reduce emissions."
Q52|Circular economy measures to keep plastics and their value in the economy, avoid waste and reduce marine litter|"We live in the plastic age (the ""plasticene""), producing over 300 million tonnes (mt) of plastic every year globally, 5-15 mt of which flow into already polluted oceans. Plastic remains a key material in the global economy, but low rates of collection, reuse and recycling, emissions of microplastic from product wear and tear, and often insufficient disposal measures are leading to far-reaching environmental, health, social and economic impacts. The costs of inaction are unacceptably high. Globally there is a growing recognition of the need to address marine litter and rethink our approach to plastics and plastic packaging within the economy. Measures that enable a transition to a circular economy can avoid waste and reduce marine litter, and contribute to keeping plastics and their value in the economy."
Q52|EU-Energieeffizienzpolitik: Wie eine kostengünstigere Dekarbonisierung gelingen könnte|"Auf EU-Ebene nehmen neue Gesetzesvorschläge für eine ""saubere Energiepolitik"" Form an. Es wird aktuell über die verstärkte Reduzierung von CO2-Emissionen sowie EU-weite Energieverbrauchsziele und daraus abzuleitende, nationale Energieeffizienzziele und -maßnahmen bis 2030 diskutiert. Doch was passiert, wenn die Zielvorgaben widersprüchlich werden und sich gegenseitig untergraben? Ein restriktives Energieverbrauchsziel kann zum großen Hindernis für die Erreichung des energie- und klimapolitischen Oberziels einer kostengünstigen Dekarbonisierung des Energiesystems werden. In den EU ETS Sektoren können falsch designte wirtschaftspolitische Instrumente zur Steigerung der Energieeffizienz eine möglichst kostengünstige Dekarbonisierung verhindern. In Sektoren außerhalb des EU ETS können Energieeffizienzziele und entsprechende wirtschaftspolitische Maßnahmen aber einen sinnvollen Beitrag leisten. Instrumente zur Steigerung der Energieeffizienz sollten darauf abzielen die technische Energieeffizienz zu verbessern. Vor diesem Hintergrund muss die Konzeption von Zielgrößen und Instrumenten verbessert werden. Die bisher verwendeten makroökonomischen Kennzahlen 'Energieeffizienz' beziehungsweise 'Energieintensität' sind als einfache politische Ziele ungenügend und verleiten zu falschen Schlüssen bezüglich des Erfolgs der eingesetzten wirtschaftspolitischen Instrumente. Die Kennzahlen müssen entscheidend verbessert werden zum Beispiel durch Berücksichtigung von Faktoren wie Konjunktur und Wirtschaftswachstum, dem Anteil von Erneuerbaren Energien oder dem von energieintensiven und weniger energieintensiven Branchen. Auch eine bessere Datenbasis ist vonnöten."
Q52|EU energy efficiency policy: How a more cost-efficient decarbonization could succeed|"At EU level, new proposed legislation for a clean-energy policy is being adopted. New policies are currently being discussed regarding the increased reduction of CO2 emissions, as well as EU-wide energy consumption targets for the year 2030 and national energy efficiency targets and measures to be derived from them. But what happens when the proposed objectives contradict and undermine each other? A restrictive energy consumption target can become a major obstacle to achieving the overall energy and climate-policy objective of cost-effective decarbonization of the energy system. Economic policy instruments for increasing energy efficiency in the EU ETS sectors can make it more difficult to achieve decarbonization at minimal cost. Energy efficiency targets and the corresponding economic policy measures can however make a worth-while contribution in sectors not included in the EU ETS. Instruments for increasing energy efficiency should aim at improving technical energy efficiency. With that in mind, the conception of quantitative targets and tools must be improved. The macroeconomic indicators for ""energy efficiency"" and ""energy intensity"" used thus far are unsatisfactory as simple political objectives and lead to wrong conclusions regarding the success of the economic policy instruments being used. The indicators must be decisively improved, for example, by considering factors such as business cycle and economic growth, as well as the proportion of renewable energy or of energy-intensive and less energy-intensive sectors. Furthermore, a better database is necessary."
Q52|Financial constraints and corporate environmental responsibility|This paper analyzes the effect of financial constraints on firms' corporate social responsibility. Exploiting heterogeneity in firms' exposure to a monetary policy shock in the U.S., which reduced financial constraints for some firms, I find that firms increase their environmental responsibility. I use facility-level data to account for unobservable time-varying influences on pollution and find that toxic emissions decrease when parent companies are more exposed to the monetary policy shock. I further find that these facilities are also more likely to implement pollution abatement activities. Examining within-parent company heterogeneity I find that pollution abatement investments center on facilities at greater risk of facing additional costs due to environmental regulation. The findings are consistent with the idea that a reduction in financial constraints reduces pollution as it allows firms to implement pollution abatement measures.
Q52|Environmental Pollution Policy of Small Businesses in Nigeria and Ghana: Extent and Impact|This study provides a comprehensive assessment of firmsâ€™ operation and environmental protection polices in Nigeria and Ghana, where there has been a rising industrial growth amidst low regulatory and institutional frameworks. We analyze the extents to which firmsâ€™ adoption of environmental protection policies affect their performances. We use firm-level data of 842 firms (447 for Nigeria and 395 for Ghana) distributed across different regions of both countries for our descriptive and econometric estimations. We find, among other things, that firmsâ€™ adoption of internal policies on environmental protection is dismally low in both Nigeria (32 percent) and Ghana (17 percent), with policies focused on reducing solid (38 percent, Nigeria; and 35 percent, Ghana), gaseous (22 percent, Nigeria; and 44 percent, Ghana), and liquid (24 percent, Nigeria; and 14 percent, Ghana) pollution. Training appears to be an important intervention that can help improve firmsâ€™ adoption of such policies. We also found that firmsâ€™ adoption and implementation of environmental protection policies significantly improve their performance.

Q52|But What Does it Mean? Competition between Products Carrying Alternative Green Labels when Consumers are Active Acquirers of Information|Programs that certify the environmental (or other social) attributes of firms are common.But the proliferation of labeling schemes makes it difficult for consumers to know what each one mean – what level of `greenness' does a particular label imply? We provide the first model in which consumers can expend effort to learn what labels mean. The relationship between information acquisition costs, firm pricing decisions, the market shares obtained by alternatively-labeled goods and a brown `backstop' good, and total environmental impact prove complex.Consumer informedness can have perverse implications. In plausible cases a reduction in the cost of information damages environmental outcomes. Our results challenge the presumption that provision of environmental information to the public is necessarily good for welfare or the environment.
Q52|Decoupling of C02 Emissions and GDP: A Time-Varying Cointegration Approach|The relationship between CO2 emissions, the main gas responsible for global warming, and economic growth is among the most studied themes of environmental economics. Reducing overall emissions while keeping a high pace of economic development is at the heart of the notion of sustainable development. Economists refer to the case when emissions increase (resp. decrease) less rapidly than the pace of economic growth as relative (resp. absolute) decoupling. This requires the empirical analysis of the emissions-GDP relationship. The study of this relationship has special importance for developed countries, since they have been historically the main contributors of the global warming. Unlike the bulk of the literature, in this paper we allow the income elasticity of emissions – a critical metrics for the study of decoupling – to vary over time. The reason is that the elasticity might change through the time due to the factors affecting the drivers of the CO2 emissions. We use a time-varying coefficients cointegration approach to investigate the CO2 emissions-GDP relationship for 12 Western European countries over a long period ranging from 1861 to 2015. The main finding is that the income elasticities of CO2 emissions are found to be positive in all investigated countries. In addition, we find evidence in favor of relative decoupling – emissions increasing more slowly than GDP – in 8 out of the 12 European countries. The remaining 4 cases the income elasticity of CO2 emissions are in excess of unity. In nearly half of cases the analysis confirms a statistically significant time-varying pattern for the income elasticities.
Q52|The Impact of Economic Growth on CO2 Emissions in Azerbaijan|This paper examines the relationship between the economic growth and CO2 emissions in Azerbaijan.A cointegration analysis is conducted over the period 1992-2013. For getting more robust results, Johansen, ARDLBT, DOLS, FMOLS and CCR methods to explore cointegration and estimate longrun coefficients are employed. We use cubic, quadratic and linear specifications and conclude that the last one is an adequate representation for the impact of the economic growth on CO2 emissions in Azerbaijan. The results from the different cointegration methods are consistent with each other and show that the economic growth has positive and significant impact on the emissions in the long-run implying that the EKC hypothesis does not hold for Azerbaijan. Moreover, we find that any short-run disequilibrium can be corrected towards the long-run equilibrium path within less than one year. The paper concludes that increasing the energy efficiency can be considered as a relevant environmental policy in order to reduce the carbon emissions.
Q52|Shadow price of CO2 emissions in Indian thermal power sector|Abstract This paper estimates production efficiency and shadow prices of CO2 emissions for coal-fired thermal power plants in India. It employs a unique sample of 56 power plants for 2000–2013 acquired primarily by invoking the Right to Information Act 2005. It estimates parametric quadratic directional output distance function using linear programming approach. We find that CO2 intensity of electricity generation could be reduced by about 16 and 23% if the power plants were made to operate efficiently. The estimated average shadow prices of US$ 14.54 and 18.68 for a ton of CO2 emission, depending upon a plant’s strategies for enhancing electricity and reducing CO2 emissions, reflect that the prevailing Clean Energy Cess of US$ 6.15 on a ton of coal or US$ 3.81 on a ton of CO2 emissions is not enough to induce the required emission mitigation. Significant variation in the estimates of shadow prices across the thermal power plants calls for use of economic instruments to reduce the emissions.

Q52|Decentralized Environmental Regulations and Plant-Level Productivity|Using a unique plant-level dataset we examine total factor productivity (TFP) growth and its components, related to efficiency change and technical change. The data we use is from Sweden and for their pulp and paper industry, which is heavily regulated due to its historically large contribution to air and water pollution. Our paper contributes to the broader empirical literature on the Porter Hypothesis, which posits a positive relationship between environmental regulation and “green” TFP growth of firms. Our exercise is innovative as Sweden has a unique regulatory structure where the manufacturing plants have to comply with plant-specific regulatory standards stipulated at the national level, as well as decentralized local supervision and enforcement. Our key findings are: (1) prudential regulation limits expansion of plants with high initial pollution; (2) regulation, however, is not conducive to plants’ “green” technical change, which provides evidence against the recast version of the Porter Hypothesis; (3) decentralized command-and-control regulation is prone to regulatory bias, entailing politically motivated discriminatory treatment of plants with otherwise equal characteristics.
Q52|Distributional Impacts of Climate Mitigation Policies - a Meta-Analysis|Understanding the distributional impacts of market-based climate policies is crucial to design economically efficient climate change mitigation policies that are socially acceptable and avoid adverse impacts on the poor. Empirical studies that examine the distributional impacts of carbon pricing and fossil fuel subsidy reforms in different countries arrive at ambiguous results. To systematically determine the sources of variation between these outcomes, we apply an ordered probit meta-analysis framework. Based on a comprehensive, systematic and transparent screening of the literature, our sample comprises 53 empirical studies containing 183 effects in 39 countries. Results indicate a significantly increased likelihood of progressive distributional outcomes for studies on lower income countries and transport sector policies. The same applies to study designs that consider indirect effects, behavioral adjustments of consumers or lifetime income proxies. Future research on different types of revenue recycling schemes and lower income countries would further contribute to the literature.
Q52|Cobb-Douglas preferences and pollution in a bilateral oligopoly market|In this note, we introduce pollution and examine its effects in a finite bilateral oligopoly model where agents have asymmetric Cobb-Douglas preferences. We define two strategic equilibria: the Stackelberg-Cournot equilibrium with pollution (SCEP) and the Cournot equilibrium with pollution (CEP). While the supplied quantities of the polluting and the non-polluting good depend on the preferences of all economic agents in the case of symmetric preferences, we show that when preferences are asymmetric, i) at both equilibria, each polluter’s equilibrium supply depends only on the non-polluters’ preferences for the non-polluting good; ii) at the CEP and the SCEP, the elasticity of the polluters emissions is greater when nonpolluters preferences for the non-polluting good increase, compared to an increase in their own preferences for this good; iii) firm’s emissions’elasticity decreases with the market power if their marginal cost is lower than their competitor.
Q52|Real Effects of Climate Policy: Financial Constraints and Spillovers|We document that localized policies designed to mitigate climate risk can lead to regulatory arbitrage by firms, resulting in unintended consequences. Using detailed plant level data, we investigate the impact of the most extensive regional climate policy in the United States, the California cap-and-trade program, on corporate real activities such as greenhouse gas emissions and plant ownership. We show that industrial plants governed by the policy reduce emissions in California when the parent company is financially constrained, but that these firms internally reallocate their emissions to plants located in other states. Similarly, constrained firms are more likely to reduce ownership in Californian plants and increase ownership in plants outside California. In contrast, unconstrained firms generally do not adjust plant emissions and ownership either in California or in other states. Overall, firms do not reduce their total emissions when part of their assets are affected by the regulation, but in fact increase them if financially constrained. The results document real spillover effects stemming from resource reallocations by constrained firms to avoid regulatory costs, undermining the effectiveness of localized policies. Our study has important implications for the current debate on global climate policy agreements.
Q52|The Dynamics of Energy Intensity Convergence in the EU-28 Countries|This paper examines the dynamics of the energy intensity convergence in the EU-28 countries using panel data for the period from 1990 to 2016. We use Phillips and Sul’s (PS) (2007) approach to test for the energy intensity convergence and identify convergence clusters. In addition to the EU-28 members, EU-15 and the new EU members joined after 2004 are analysed as distinct groups for the periods 1990–2016, 1990–2004 and 2005–2016. Our results show convergence amongst the EU countries during the full and two subsample periods considered. However, the convergence takes place within clusters and there is no evidence of all members converging to a single club. Indeed, after the expansion of the EU, and depending on the decoupling of energy intensity levels amongst EU countries, convergence became more common and diverse. The study also makes policy recommendations based on the empirical findings.
Q52|Inequality in Carbon Intensity in EU-28: Analysis Based on Club Convergence|This study examines the convergence properties of CO2 intensity in EU-28 countries, using panel data for the period 1990 to 2016. We use Phillips and Sul’s (2007) approach to test for CO2 intensity convergence and identify convergence clubs. In addition to the EU-28 members, we analyze the EU-15, and the new EU members (EU-new) that joined after 2004, as distinct groups for the periods 1990–2016, 1990–2004, and 2005–2016. Our results show no convergence to a single group among the EU countries during the full and two subsample periods. However, the convergence takes place within five to seven clubs for the EU-28 and within three to five clubs for the EU-15 and EU-new. There is no evidence of all members converging to a single club in either group or the three sub-periods examined. This study highlights the need for adopting new strategies considering club properties and for sustainable growth, which meets the EU-28 environmental regulation standards.
Q52|Bank Liquidity, Credit Supply, and the Environment|We evaluate the impact of the credit conditions facing corporations on their emissions of toxic air pollutants. Exploiting cross-county, cross-time shale discoveries that generated liquidity windfalls at local bank branches, we construct measures of (1) the degree to which banks in non-shale counties, i.e., counties where shale was not discovered, receive liquidity shocks through their branches in shale counties and (2) the degree to which a corporation in a non-shale county has a relationship lender that receives liquidity shocks through its branches. From both the county- and firm-level analyses, we discover that positive shocks to credit conditions reduce corporate pollution.
Q52|The Economics of Renewable Energy Support|This paper uses theoretical and numerical economic equilibrium models to examine optimal renewable energy (RE) support policies for wind and solar resources in the presence of a carbon externality associated with the use of fossil fuels. We emphasize three main issues for policy design: the heterogeneity of intermittent natural resources, budget-neutral financing rules, and incentives for carbon mitigation. We find that differentiated subsidies for wind and solar, while being optimal, only yield negligible efficiency gains. Policies with smart financing of RE subsidies which either relax budget neutrality or use “polluter-pays-the-price” financing in the context of budget-neutral schemes can, however, approximate socially optimal outcomes. Our analysis suggests that optimally designed RE support policies do not necessarily have to be viewed as a costly second-best option when carbon pricing is unavailable.
Q52|The Intergenerational Incidence Of Green Tax Reform|We examine the lifetime incidence and intergenerational distributional effects of an economy-wide carbon tax swap using a numerical dynamic general equilibrium model with overlapping generations of the U.S. economy. We highlight various fundamental choices in policy design including (1) the level of the initial carbon tax, (2) the growth rate of the carbon tax trajectory of over time, and (3) alternative ways for revenue recycling. Without revenue recycling, we find that generations born before the tax is introduced experience smaller welfare losses, or even gain, relative to future generations. For sufficiently low growth rates of the tax trajectory, the impacts for distant future generations decrease over time. For future generations born after the introduction of the tax, the negative welfare impacts are the smallest (largest) when revenues are recycled through lowering pre-existing capital income taxes (through per-capita lump-sum rebates). For generations born before the tax is introduced, we find that lump-sum rebates favor very old generations and labor (capital) income tax recycling favors very young generations (generations of intermediate age).
Q52|Stranded Assets: How Policy Uncertainty affects Capital, Growth, and the Environment|Standard environmental economics prescribes policies which are optimal and implemented immediately. The paper argues that, in reality, environmental policy often deviates from the optimum and implementation is not deterministic but subject to major uncertainty and frequent change. We present a model with a stochastic policy process that affects investors’ decisions and the composition of capital. We assume that pollution is reduced by private green services and public abatement. The government subsidizes green services and taxes dirty capital albeit at a rate which may become random, causing unexpected capital write-offs. Tax jumps depend on environmental degradation and the share of green services. We show how policy uncertainty affects capital valuation and how it alters individual portfolios, green services, and economic growth.
Q52|Escaping Damocles' Sword: Endogenous Climate Shocks in a Growing Economy|Climate economics has been criticized for ignoring uncertainty, catastrophic changes, and tipping points (Stern 2016). The present paper addresses these issues. We consider multiple climate shocks which are recurring, random, uninsurable, and potentially large. The associated damages and the hazard rate are endogenously driven by the stock of greenhouse gases. We provide closed-form solutions for the optimal climate policy and the growth rate of the economy. The optimal path is characterized by a constant growth rate of consumption and of the capital stock until a shock arrives, triggering a downward jump in both variables. The mitigation policy consists of a simple and intuitive rule which requires spending a constant fraction of output on emissions abatement. In a quantitative assessment we show that under favorable conditions the abatement expenditure represents 0.5% of output, equivalent to $37 per ton carbon. Under less favorable conditions with respect to abatement technology and damages, coupled with a relative risk aversion which exceeds unity, the abatement propensity increases to 2.9%, equivalent to $212 per ton carbon, and it jumps to a striking 10% in the pessimistic scenario involving severe shocks and a possible crossing of a tipping point.
Q52|The impacts of energy prices on industrial foreign investment location: evidence from global firm level data|This paper analyzes the role of energy prices in firms’ investment location decisions in the manufacturing sector. Building on the application of discrete choice theory to the firm location problem, we specify a conditional logit model linking bilateral foreign direct investment (FDI activity to relative energy prices. We then empirically test this link using a global dataset of M&A deals in the manufacturing sector covering 41 countries between 1995 and 2014, using econometric techniques adapted from the estimation of gravity models. The results suggest that upon deciding to invest, firms are attracted to regions that have lower energy prices. However, counterfactual simulations reveal that unilateral implementation of a $50/tCO2 carbon tax by various coalitions of countries is expected to have limited negative impact on the attractiveness of economies to foreign industrial investments. Hence, our results support the pollution haven effect, but find the magnitude is limited and could be addressed with targeted measures in the most energy intensive sectors.
Q52|Modelling Electric Vehicles as an Abatement Technology in a Hybrid CGE Model|We present a novel methodology to quantify the social costs and benefits (net social costs) of electric vehicles as an endogenous, demand-driven abatement technology in a general equilibrium framework. This new costing approach relates general equilibrium effects resulting from an increased market penetration of electric vehicles to the external environmental and health effects of the corresponding change in emissions. To this end, we develop a hybrid model combining a computable general equilibrium (CGE) with a discrete choice (DC) model that is capable of depicting an endogenous demand-driven uptake of alternative fuel vehicles. The discrete choice model of the consumer purchase decision between conventional, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles is directly integrated into the CGE model. This hybrid CGE-DC model features a detailed accounting of vehicle fleet development, including yearly numbers of vehicle purchases and cohort depreciation. It depicts nine households differentiated by the degree of urbanization and education, accounts for detailed consumer preferences for the purchase of a passenger vehicle and mode choice decisions. The hybrid CGE-DC model is additionally hard-linked to a bottom-up module for elektricity production by several technologies to provide input for an established impact pathway analysis to quantify the external costs relating to the changed composition of the vehicle fleet and technologies to generate electricity. We apply this methodology to Austria as an empirical example, considering current measures and trends for the uptake of electric vehicles into the vehicle fleet. In particular, we quantify the net social costs of additional measures to foster the introduction of electromobility that are part of the current policy discussion in Austria, and thus provide a blueprint for further application in different national contexts.
Q52|Climate policies and Skill-biased employment dynamics : evidence from EU countries|The political acceptability of climate policies is undermined by job-killing arguments, especially for the least-skilled workers. However, evidence for distributional impacts for different workers remains scant. We examine the associations between climate policies, proxied by energy prices and a stringency index, and workforce skills for 14 European countries and 15 industrial sectors over the period of 1995-2011. We find that, while the long-term decline in employment in most carbon-intensive sectors is unrelated to policy stringency, climate policies have been skill biased against manual workers and have favoured technicians and professionals. This skill bias is confirmed using a shift-share instrumental variable estimator
Q52|Geographic Environmental Kuznets Curves: The Optimal Growth Linear-Quadratic Case|We solve a linear-quadratic model of a spatio-temporal economy using a polluting one-input technology. Space is continuous and heterogenous: locations differ in productivity, nature self-cleaning technology and environmental awareness. The unique link between locations is transboundary pollution which is modelled as a PDE diffusion equation. The spatio-temporal functional is quadratic in local consumption and linear in pollution. Using a dynamic programming method adapted to our infinite dimensional setting, we solve the associated optimal control problem in closed-form and identify the asymptotic (optimal) spatial distribution of pollution. We show that optimal emissions will decrease at given location if and only if local productivity is larger than a threshold which depends both on the local pollution absorption capacity and environmental awareness. Furthermore, we numerically explore the relationship between the spatial optimal distributions of production and (asymptotic) pollution in order to uncover possible (geographic) Environmental Kuznets Curve cases.
Q52|Collective reputation with stochastic production and unknown willingness to pay for quality|Abstract In many cases, consumers cannot observe a single firm’s investment in environmental quality or safety, but only the average quality of the industry. The outcome of the investment is stochastic, since firms cannot control perfectly the technology or external factors that may affect production. In addition, firms do not know consumers’ valuation of quality. We characterize the solution of the firms’ investment game and show that the value of stopping investments when firms are already investing in quality can be negative when the free-riding incentives dominate. The existence of systematic uncertainty on the outcome of investment slows down investment in quality, compared to a situation without uncertainty. The uncertainty on consumers’ willingness to pay for quality can speed up or slow down investment. We also obtain the counterintuitive result that information acquisition may decrease the overall level of quality.
Q52|Risks associated with the decarbonisation of the Polish power sector|The Polish power sector currently stands at a crossroads, facing two alternative pathways. First, the decarbonisation pathway with radical CO2 emissions reduction, which involves a fast phase-down of coal. Second, the baseline pathway that abandons emission reduction targets, and involves a slow coal phase-down. Both pathways are associated with risks. The decarbonisation pathway requires large-scale investment in carbon-free technologies in the power sector that may crowd out investment in other sectors of the economy. Other risks associated with this pathway include the destabilisation of the power system, dependency on imported technologies and job losses in mining. The baseline pathway may involve the loss of international reputation, the waste of research and development (R&D) resources on coal technologies, and a growing dependency on imported coal. In this report we define the electricity mix associated with each pathway and compare their financial and macroeconomic costs using simulation models. We also perform a qualitative analysis of the risks that are not captured by the models. We argue that the decarbonisation pathway is unlikely to be significantly more costly than the alternative pathway of no reduction targets. Some socioeconomic risks of decarbonisation such as a potential fall in employment and increased dependency on imported technologies could be mitigated if the government communicates to firms and workers that the scale-down of coal sector is inexorable given the global commitment to combat climate change. However, it will be accompanied by a simultaneous scale-up of the sector related to carbon-free technologies.
Q52|The labour demand effects of residential building retrofits in Poland|This paper analyses the potential direct impact of intensifying residential energy retrofitting on the Polish labour market. We distinguish eight building classes, for which we quantify the labour intensity of improvements to building insulation and heating systems. We account for work performed by low-, medium- and high-skilled workers. We define the baseline scenario of maintaining the current rate of retrofitting and three scenarios of its acceleration (up to two times) and increased comprehensiveness. We estimate the resulting additional labour demand and changes to the unemployment rate at the country and NUTS2 region level. Our results show that the most ambitious scenario of increased energy retrofitting would see the creation of approx. 100,000 additional jobs nationwide per year, with the majority of this added demand concerning low-skilled persons. This effect is predominantly caused by energy retrofits to single-family buildings. The effect of building insulation retrofits on the labour demand is 3-4 times greater than the effect of heating and hot water system upgrades.
Q52|Impact of the Clean Air Act on Air Pollution and Infant Health: Evidence from South Korea|This paper examines the extent to which the 2005 Clean Air Act introduced in South Korea affected air pollution and infant health. To identify the causal effect, we exploit the time and geographical variations in the adoption of the Act between 2003 and 2006. During this period, the Clean Air Act indeed significantly reduced air pollutants. For example, the PM10 level was reduced by 9 percent. However, the Act's impact on infant mortality was not statistically significant.
Q52|Quasi-Experimental Methods in Environmental Economics: Opportunities and Challenges|This paper examines the application of quasi-experimental methods in environmental economics. We begin with two observations: i) standard quasi-experimental methods, first applied in other microeconomic fields, typically assume unit-level treatments that do not spill over across units; (ii) because public goods, such as environmental attributes, exhibit externalities, treatment of one unit often affects other units. To explore the implications of applying standard quasi-experimental methods to public good problems, we extend the potential outcomes framework to explicitly distinguish between unit-level source and the resulting group-level exposure of a public good. This new framework serves as a foundation for reviewing and interpreting key papers from the recent empirical literature. We formally demonstrate that two common quasi-experimental estimators of the marginal social benefit of a public good can be biased due to externality spillovers, even when the source of the public good itself is quasi-randomly assigned. We propose an unbiased estimator for the valuation of local public goods and discuss how it can be implemented in future studies. Finally, we consider how to preserve the advantages of the quasi-experimental approach when valuing global public goods, such as climate change mitigation, for which no control units are available.
Q52|Prices or Quantities Dominate Banking and Borrowing|The possibility of intertemporal banking and borrowing of tradeable permits is often viewed as tilting the various policy debates about optimal pollution control instruments toward favoring such time-flexible quantities. The present paper shows that this view is misleading, at least for the simplest dynamic extension of the original `prices vs. quantities' information structure. The model of this paper allows the firms to know and act upon the realization of uncertain future costs two full periods ahead of the regulators. For any given circumstance, the paper shows that either a fixed price or a fixed quantity is superior in expected welfare to time-flexible banking and borrowing. Furthermore, the standard original formula for the comparative advantage of prices over quantities contains sufficient information to completely characterize the regulatory role of intertemporal banking and borrowing. The logic and implications of these results are analyzed and discussed.
Q52|Bank Liquidity, Credit Supply, and the Environment|The paper evaluates the impact of the credit conditions facing corporations on their emissions of toxic air pollutants. Exploiting cross-county, cross-time shale discoveries that generated liquidity windfalls at local bank branches, it constructs measures of (1) the degree to which banks in non-shale counties, i.e., counties where shale was not discovered, receive liquidity shocks through their branches in shale counties and (2) the degree to which a corporation in a non-shale county has a relationship lender that receives liquidity shocks through its branches. From both the county- and firm-level analyses, the paper discovers that positive shocks to credit conditions reduce corporate pollution.
Q52|Environmental Policy, Full-Employment Models, and Employment: A Critical Analysis|This paper assesses the use of full-employment computable-general equilibrium (CGE) models to predict the labor-market effects of environmental policy. Specifically, it compares the predictions of a standard full-employment CGE model with those of a new search-CGE model with labor-search frictions and resulting unemployment (but that is otherwise identical to the full-employment model). The search-CGE captures key labor market details, including a distinction between the extensive margin of labor demand (the number of employees) and the intensive margin (the number of hours each employee works). We find that some key results are robust across the two models, such as the reallocation of labor across sectors in response to a carbon tax and the overall change in total labor demand. However, the full-employment model seriously overestimates the economy-wide net change in the number of jobs (by a factor of more than 2.5 for a carbon tax with revenues returned lump-sum to households, and by a factor of almost 3.5 when carbon tax revenues are used to reduce payroll taxes).
Q52|Firm-Level Financial Resources and Environmental Spills|Using novel US environmental spill data, we document a robust negative relationship between the number of spills a firm experiences in a given year and its contemporaneous and lagged (but not future) cash flow. In addition, studying two natural experiments, we find an increase (decrease) in spills following negative (positive) shocks to a firm's financial resources, both in absolute terms and relative to control firms. Overall, our results suggest that firms' financial resources play an important role in their ability to mitigate environmental risk.
Q52|Toxic Truth: Lead and Fertility|Using U.S county level data on lead in air for 1978-1988 and lead in topsoil in the 2000s, this paper examines the impact of lead exposure on a critical human function with societal implications – fertility. To provide causal estimates of the effect of lead on fertility, we use two sets of instruments: i) the interaction of the timing of implementation of Clean Air Act regulations and the 1944 Interstate Highway System Plan for the panel data and ii) the 1944 Interstate Highway System Plan for the cross sectional data. We find that reductions in airborne lead between 1978 and 1988 increased fertility rates and that higher lead in topsoil decreased fertility rates in the 2000s. The latter finding is particularly concerning, because it suggests that lead may continue to impair fertility today, both in the United States and in other countries that have significant amounts of lead in topsoil.
Q52|Livestreaming Pollution: A New Form of Public Disclosure and a Catalyst for Citizen Engagement?|Most environmental policy assumes the form of standards and enforcement. Scarce public budgets motivate the use of disclosure laws. This study explores a new form of pollution disclosure: real-time visual evidence of emissions provided on a free, public website. The paper tests whether the disclosure of visual evidence of emissions affects the nature and frequency of phone calls to the local air quality regulator. First, we test whether the presence of the camera affects the frequency of calls to the local air quality regulator about the facility monitored by the camera. Second, we test the relationship between the camera being active and the number of complaints about facilities other than the plant recorded by the camera. Our empirical results suggest that the camera did not affect the frequency of calls to the regulator about the monitored facility. However, the count of complaints pertaining to another prominent industrial polluter in the area, steel manufacturing plants, is positively associated with the camera being active. We propose two behavioral reasons for this finding: the prior knowledge hypothesis and affect heuristics. This study argues that visual evidence is a feasible approach to environmental oversight even during periods with diminished regulatory capacity.
Q52|Quasi-Experimental Methods in Environmental Economics: Opportunities and Challenges|This paper examines the application of quasi-experimental methods in environmental economics.

Finally, we consider how to preserve the advantages of the quasi-experimental approach when valuing global public goods, such as climate change mitigation, for which no control units are available.
Q52|Impacts of a carbon tax across US household income groups: What are the equity-efficiency trade-offs?|This paper assesses the impacts across U.S. household income groups of carbon taxes of various designs. We consider both the source-side impacts (reflecting how policies affect wage, capital, and transfer incomes) as well as the use-side impacts (reflecting how policies alter the prices of goods and services purchased by households). We apply an integrated general equilibrium framework with extended measures of the source- and use-side impacts that add up to the overall welfare impact. Our results indicate that the distributional impacts depend importantly on the nature of revenue-recycling and the treatment of transfer income. In the absence of targeted compensation to achieve distributional objectives, the use-side impacts tend to be regressive while the source-side impacts are progressive, and the progressive source-side impacts tend to offset fully the regressive use-side impacts. Both impacts are considerably larger when one employs the more comprehensive welfare measures introduced in this study. The efficiency costs of targeted compensation to achieve distributional objectives depend critically on the recycling method and compensation target. These costs are an order of magnitude higher when the remaining revenues after compensation are used for corporate income tax cuts, compared with costs when remaining revenues are used other ways. Efficiency costs also rise dramatically when targeted compensation extends beyond the lowest income quintiles.
Q52|Financing the Response to Climate Change: The Pricing and Ownership of U.S. Green Bonds|We study green bonds, which are bonds whose proceeds are used for environmentally sensitive purposes. After an overview of the U.S. corporate and municipal green bonds markets, we study pricing and ownership patterns using a simple framework that incorporates assets with nonpecuniary utility. As predicted, we find that green municipal bonds are issued at a premium to otherwise similar ordinary bonds. We also confirm that green bonds, particularly small or essentially riskless ones, are more closely held than ordinary bonds. These pricing and ownership effects are strongest for bonds that are externally certified as green.
Q52|Heterogeneous Environmental and Grid Benefits from Rooftop Solar and the Costs of Inefficient Siting Decisions|Federal and state policies in the U.S. subsidize electricity generation from 1.4 million rooftop solar arrays because of pollution avoidance benefits and grid congestion relief. Yet because these benefits vary across the U.S. according to solar irradiance, technologies of electricity generators, and grid characteristics, the value of these benefits, and, consequently, the optimal subsidy, are largely unknown. Policy, therefore, is unlikely to have induced efficient solar investments. This paper (1) provides the first systematic, theoretically consistent, and empirically valid estimates of pollution damages avoidable by solar capacity in each U.S. zip code, (2) relates these external benefits to subsidy levels in each U.S. state, and (3) estimates the share of these benefits that spillover to other states. It also measures the energy value of capacity across the U.S. and the value of transmission congestion relief in California. Environmental benefits are shown to vary considerably across the U.S., and to largely spillover to neighboring states. Subsidy levels are essentially uncorrelated with environmental benefits contributing to installed capacity that sacrifices approximately $1 billion per year in environmental benefits. Energy value is estimated to vary less than environmental benefits, while California rooftop solar is shown to generate no congestion relief.
Q52|An Applied General Equilibrium Model for the Analysis of Environmental Policy: SAGE v1.0 Technical Documentation|SAGE is an applied general equilibrium model of the United States economy developed for the analysis of environmental regulations and policies. It is an intertemporal model with perfect foresight, resolved at the sub-national level. Each of the nine regions in the model, representing the nine census divisions,has five households based on income quintiles. A single government agent levies taxes on labor earnings, capital earnings, production, and consumption. As with many applied general equilibrium models used for the analysis of U.S. environmental and energy policies, the baseline is calibrated to the Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook. The model is solved as mixed complementarity problem (MCP) using the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS).
Q52|Exploring the General Equilibrium Costs of Sector-Specific Environmental Regulations|The requisite scope of analysis to adequately estimate the social cost of environmental regulations has been subject to much discussion. The literature has demonstrated that engineering or partial equilibrium cost estimates likely underestimate the social cost of large-scale environmental regulations and environmental taxes. However, the conditions under which general equilibrium (GE) analysis adds value to welfare analysis for single-sector technology or performance standards, the predominant policy intervention in practice, remains an open question. Using a numerical computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, we investigate the GE effects of regulations across different sectors, abatement technologies, and regulatory designs. Our results show that even for small regulations the GE effects are significant, and that engineering estimates of compliance costs can substantially underestimate the social cost of single-sector environmental regulations. We find the downward bias from using engineering costs to approximate social costs depends on the input composition of abatement technologies and the regulated sector.
Q52|The joint impact of the European Union emissions trading system on carbon emissions and economic performance|This paper investigates the joint impact of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), Europe’s main climate change policy, on carbon emissions and economic performance of regulated companies. The impact on emissions is analysed using installation-level carbon emissions from national Polluting Emissions Registries from France, Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom complemented with data from the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR). The impact on firm performance is analysed using firm-level data for all countries covered by the EU ETS. A matching methodology exploiting installation-level inclusion criteria combined with difference-in-differences is used to estimate the policy’s causal impact on installations’ emissions and on firms’ revenue, assets, profits and employment. We find that the EU ETS has induced carbon emission reductions in the order of -10% between 2005 and 2012, but had no negative impact on the economic performance of regulated firms. These results demonstrate that concerns that the EU ETS would come at a cost in terms of competitiveness have been vastly overplayed. In fact, we even find that the EU ETS led to an increase in regulated firms’ revenues and fixed assets. We explore various explanations for these findings.
Q52|Economic assessment and valuations of environmental and health impacts caused by Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and its salts|Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is being used in fluoropolymer production, as surface treatment agents and for the manufacture of side-chain fluorinated polymers. However, there is evidence that PFOA and its salts have a number of hazardous properties that may cause harm to human health and the environment. This report evaluates existing economic assessments and valuations of impacts arising from PFOA and its salts.
Q52|Economic valuation in 1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) regulation|This paper gives an overview of economic assessments of the benefits of the control of 1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), an organic solvent, used in a number of sectors. Health risks associated with the manufacture of NMP include the risk of stillbirth and developmental retardation to pregnant workers, as well as a variety of chronic and acute effects, including respiratory effects.
Q52|Economic valuation in formaldehyde regulation|This paper gives an overview of economic assessments of the benefits of the control of formaldehyde and reflects on developments in its risk management and regulation. Formaldehyde is used in the manufacture of resins, as a disinfectant and fixative and as a preservative in consumer products. Formaldehyde exposure can be harmful to human health.
Q52|Impacts of Green Growth Policies on Labour Markets and Wage Income Distribution: A General Equilibrium Application to Climate and Energy Policies|This paper explores the consequences on the labour markets of structural changes induced by decarbonisation policies. These policies are likely going to have consequences on labour-income distribution given i) existing rigidities in the labour markets, and ii) their different impacts on sectors and on job categories. These policies are analysed in a general equilibrium modelling framework, which includes interlinkages between different sectors and regions as well as five different categories of workers.
Q52|Environmentally Adjusted Multifactor Productivity: Methodology and Empirical Results for OECD and G20 Countries|This paper extends the analytical framework for measuring multifactor productivity in order to account for environmental services. A growth accounting approach is used to decompose a pollution-adjusted measure of output growth into the contributions of labour, produced capital and natural capital. These indicators allow the sources of economic growth, and its long run sustainability, to be better assessed. Results presented here cover OECD and G20 countries for the 1990–2013 period, and account for the extraction of subsoil natural assets and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases. The main findings suggest that growth in OECD countries has been generated almost exclusively through productivity gains, while BRIICS countries have drawn largely on increased utilisation of factor inputs to generate additional growth. Regarding natural capital, in countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile, reliance on subsoil assets extraction has contributed to a significant share of income growth. Results also point to a shift towards more environmentally friendly production processes in many countries. In fact, most OECD countries have decreased their emissions over the last two decades, and these pollution abatement efforts result in an upward adjustment of their GDP growth rates, allowing for a more accurate assessment of their economic performance.
Q52|Does market structure trigger efficiency? Evidence for the USA before and after the financial crisis|This paper investigates the relationship between efficiency and market structure for a sample of industrial facilities dispersed among the USA states. In order to measure the relevant efficiency scores, we use a Data Development Analysis (DEA) allowing for the inclusion of desirable and undesirable (toxic chemical releases) outputs in the production function. In the next stage, we utilise the bootstrapped quantile regression methodology to uncover possible non-linear relationships between efficiency and competition at the mean and at various quantiles before and after the global financial crisis (2002 and 2012). In this way, we impose no functional form constraints on parameter values over the conditional distribution of the dependent variable (efficiency). At the same time, we estimate at which part of its conditional distribution function, the efficiency is located and draw substantial conclusions about the range of policy measures obtained. The empirical findings, indicate that the relationship between efficiency and market concentration did not remain unchanged in the aftermath of the economic crisis. The empirical results survived robustness checks under the inclusion of an alternative market concentration indicator (CR8).
Q52|Biodiversitatea patrimoniului natural montan. Provocările prezentului și perspective durabile de acțiune<BR>[Biodiversity of the natural mountains heritage – present challenges and sustainable perspectives]|Între zonele montane și biodiversitate există o legătură directă și indisolubilă: zonele montane reprezintă, poate, cel mai important izvor de eco-sisteme la nivel global, adevărate laboratoare științifice, de cercetare și cunoaștere a evoluției și distribuției speciilor și organismelor vii, a relațiilor dintre acestea, a adaptării lor la diferite medii și a influențelor hotărâtoare ale acțiunilor umane care au condus la actualele schimbări climatice. Munții funcționează ca adevărate refugii pentru speciile endemice afectate de acțiunile umane necontrolate, în timp ce pajiștile alpine sunt expuse pierderii practicilor tradiționale de pășunat. Regiunile montane, diverse și complexe, sunt elementele centrale ale politicilor de mediu și dezvoltare durabilă, problemele lor și dificultățile de adaptare la noile schimbări climatice necesitând măsuri adecvate, rapide și, mai ales, permanente (susținute continuu). Munții aparțin, de regulă, geografiei mediului, dar, deopotrivă, pot fi analizați și din perspectivă economică, socială, culturală etc., multidisciplinaritatea lor fiind recunoscută atât de mediul academic-universitar, cât și de factorii decizionali implicați în politicile de dezvoltare teritorială. Recent, Noua Geografie Economică (New Economic Geography) promovată intens pe plan global, consideră dezvoltarea economică și socială a regiunilor montane ca fiind una deosebit de importantă: zonele montane sunt surse importante de materii prime și materiale necesare producției și consumului de bază (agricultură, industrie, servicii), aspect ce afectează, în condițiile actuale, atât biodiversitatea, cât și nivelul de viață al comunităților locale. Perspectiva economică este deosebit de importantă atât la nivelul marilor grupuri de interese regionale, cât mai ales la nivel local, pentru comunitățile dependente direct și permanent de resursele și condițiile oferite de munte. Din ce în ce mai vizibil, impactul negativ al activităților economice asupra zonei montante, atât de înaltă cât și de joasă altitudine, trebuie să conducă spre o viziune comună și o abordare durabilă a stării biodiversității acesteia, deoarece, afectarea unui habitat poate atrage după sine distrugerea întregului echilibrul ecologic, și așa atât de fragil, în prezent. Pornind de la considerentele prezentate mai sus, articolul oferă o imagine generală asupra relației dintre biodiversitatea zonelor montane și implicațiile dezvoltării economice și sociale asupra acesteia, apelând, în principal, la surse documentare naționale și internaționale, la date și informații statistice, care vin să completeze imaginea globală a evoluției relației, în timp și spațiu.
Q52|Does market competition dampen environmental performance? Evidence from China|Research Summary: Departing from the extant literature, which assumes that firms pursue strong environmental performance as a differentiation strategy, we analyze the general relationship between firms’ competitive strategy and their response to heightened market competition. We find that, using a large sample of Chinese manufacturing firms between 2000 and 2005, intensified market competition has an overall negative impact on firms’ environmental performance. The negative impact is exacerbated in firms adopting a cost‐leadership strategy, but is attenuated in those adopting a differentiation strategy. The results emphasize the importance of including an examination of the particular competitive strategies chosen by firms in seeking to understand the impact of intensified market competition. Managerial Summary: Advocates of corporate social responsibility (CSR) have long argued for the differentiation role of CSR. However, managers may be misguided if the assumed benefits of differentiation critically depend on certain presumptions. In the Chinese context and focusing on the environmental dimension of CSR, our study finds a negative relationship between market competition and corporate environmental performance. It suggests that firms, to a large extent, cannot escape competition via environmental differentiation. Managers should therefore be cautious about the value of strategic investment in CSR as a viable competitive device.
Q52|A Cost-Effective and Environmentally Friendly Gaseous Waste Management|Dealing with radionuclides includes trapping the vapors and storing it for decay. However, these methods can involve considerable expense in infrastructure, manpower and monitoring. Legislation requires the presence of air filtration systems with detectors to monitor and control the release of radionuclides into the air in nuclear medicine centers. We describe a method for the treatment of gaseous waste that is economically feasible and environmentally friendly. This method complies with legislation and has the advantage of using the already existing resources in the radiopharmaceutical production facility.
Q52|The Impact of Energy Prices on Employment and Environmental Performance: Evidence from French Manufacturing Establishments|This paper evaluates the historical influence of energy prices on a series of measures of environmental and economic performance for a panel of French manufacturing establishments over the period 1997-2010. The focus on energy prices is motivated by the fact that changes in environmental and energy policies have been dominated by substantial reductions in discounts for large consumers, making the evaluation of each policy in isolation exceedingly difficult. To identify price effects, we construct a shift-share instrument that captures only the exogenous variation in establishment-specific energy prices. Our results highlight a trade-off between environmental and economic goals: although a 10 percent increase in energy prices brings about a 6 percent reduction in energy consumption and an 11 percent reduction in CO2 emissions, such an increase also has a modestly negative impact on employment (-2.6 percent) and very small impact on wages and productivity. The negative employment effects are mostly concentrated in energy-intensive and trade-exposed sectors. Simulating the effect of a carbon tax, we show that job losses for the most exposed sectors can be quite large. However, these effects are upper bounds and we show that they are significantly mitigated in multi-establishment firms by labor reallocation across establishments.
Q52|Finance and the Misallocation of Scientific, Engineering and Mathematical Talent|The US financial sector has become a magnet for the brightest graduates in the science, technology, engineering and mathematical fields (STEM). We provide quantitative bases for this well-known fact and illustrate its consequences for the productivity growth in other sectors over the period 1980-2014. First, we find that the share of STEM talents grew significantly faster in finance than in other key STEM sectors such as high-tech, and this divergent pattern has been more evident for STEM than for general skills and more pronounced for investment banking. Second, this trend did not reverse after the Great Recession, and a persistent wage premium is found for STEM graduates working in finance and especially in typical financial jobs at the top of the wage distribution. Third, the brain drain of STEM talents into finance has been associated with a cumulative loss of labor productivity growth of 6.6% in the manufacturing sectors. Our results suggest that increasing the number of STEM graduates may not be enough to reignite sluggish economic growth without making their employment in finance more costly.

Q52|Clearing the Fog: The Predictive Power of Weather for Employment Reports and their Asset Price Responses|This paper exploits vast granular data – with over one million county-month observations – to estimate a dynamic panel data model of weather’s local employment effects. The fitted county model is then aggregated and used to generate in-sample and rolling out-of-sample (“nowcast”) estimates of the weather effect on national monthly employment. These nowcasts, which use only employment and weather data available prior to a given employment report, are significantly predictive not only of the surprise component of employment reports but also of stock and bond market returns on the days of employment reports.
Q52|Poverty and Distributional Effects of a Carbon Tax in Mexico|Mexico recently declared ambitious goals in reducing domestic CO2 emissions and introduced a carbon tax in 2014. Although negative effects on household welfare and related poverty measures are widely discussed as possible consequences, empirical evidence is missing. We try to fill this gap by simulating an input-output model coupled with household survey data to examine the welfare effects of different carbon tax rates over the income distribution. The currently effective tax rate is small and has negligible effects on household welfare. Higher simulated tax rates, maintaining the current tax base, show a slight progressivity but welfare losses remain moderate. Welfare losses, regressivity and poverty rise more with widening the tax base towards natural gas and other greenhouse gases (CH4, N2O) mainly through food price increases. For a complete analysis of the policy, we simulate a redistribution of calculated tax revenues and find that the resulting effects become highly progressive, also for high rates, wider tax bases and even in the absence of perfect targeting of social welfare programs.
Q52|Un modèle d'accident unilatéral: incertitude non-radicale et estimations différenciées|Cet article reconsidère le modèle d'accident unilatéral standard en univers probabiliste (hors incertitude radicale). Contrairement à ce dernier, les agents (porteur de préjudice et victime) forment des estimations différentes sur la distribution de probabilité d’accident et l'évaluation des dommages. En conséquence, le coût social d'un accident varie suivant le type de responsabilité civile (invariable dans le modèle standard). La correspondance entre les régimes de la responsabilité sans faute et la règle de la négligence n'existe plus sauf dans l’hypothèse où le pollueur estime les coûts des dommages à un niveau supérieur à celui de la victime.
Q52|Identifying Phosphorus Hot Spots: A spatial analysis of the phosphorus balance as a result of manure application| In this paper, we analyze the phosphorus balance as a result of manure application on the parish level for Denmark and investigate its local geographic distribution. For our analysis, we determine phosphorus loads for the five main animal groups and the phosphorus demand of the fifteen major crop categories. To identify statistical significant local patterns of phosphorus over- and undersupply we apply Getis-Ord Gi* hot spot analysis. Our results show that there is a large variability in the phosphorus balance within Denmark. Statistically significant hot spots appear mainly along the west coast, while cold spots are predominantly present on southern and eastern coasts towards the Baltic Sea. The proximity of oversupply areas to water bodies and other environmental sensitive areas reinforces the need for further phosphorus regulation. These findings show the importance of a spatial targeted regulation, which allows different levels of phosphorus application depending on local economic and environmental circumstances, e.g., distance to an environmental sensitive region.
Q52|Do Clean Development Mechanism projects generate local employment? Testing for sectoral effects across Brazilian municipalities| Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) investments have the two-fold objective of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to sustainable development. But while the contribution to mitigation has been analysed extensively in the literature, the impact on development has barely been quantified empirically. This paper intends to address this latter gap by investigating the impact of different types of CDM investments on local employment generation. A dynamic panel regression model for the period 2004-2014 across Brazilian municipalities supports that some CDM projects have not only stimulated job creation beyond the renewable energy sector, but also had a contractive effect in some economic sectors. We find moreover a clear difference by project type: For waste handling and methane avoidance projects, overall employment increases while no such effect emerges for hydro projects. However, these job effects are mainly transitory, i.e. in the first or second year after the project's registration; the expansion effect can be explained as a result of local employment demands generated during the project's construction and operation phases. The lack of durability or the temporary effects in employment of these projects might question the contribution of their benefits to local sustainable development.
Q52|Spatial assessment of construction waste generated by residential buildings in rural areas|The management of construction waste it is at an early stage in urban areas and lacking in rural areas where this fraction is frequently uncontrolled disposed on public lands. Despite the fact some items of construction waste are considered inert for the environment (soil, concrete) it also contains hazardous items (paint additives, cans, and containers) or recyclables (plastics, metals, wood). Potential recovery of this waste stream is high if it is properly managed. The paper estimates the potential amounts of waste resulted from residential constructions across rural municipalities of Neamț County between 2002 and 2010. These statistical values are calculated at commune level (rural territorial administrative unit) in order to outline the disparities between various geographical areas using thematic cartography. This approach is correlated with demographic features in order to reflect such spatial patterns. The map of population density within built-up areas reveals where the construction sector is emerging at the county scale. Field observations highlight the existence of illegal disposal practices of construction waste in the proximity of settlements or water bodies. This waste stream should receive proper attention in following years in order to achieve recycling and recovery targets imposed by EU regulations.
Q52|Sulphur Abatement Globally in Maritime Shipping|In 2016, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) decided on global regulations to reduce sulphur emissions to air from maritime shipping starting 2020. The regulation implies that ships can continue to use residual fuels with a high sulphur content, such as heavy fuel oil (HFO), if they employ scrubbers to desulphurise the exhaust gases. Alternatively, they can use fuels with less than 0.5% sulphur, such as desulphurised HFO, distillates (diesel) or liquefied natural gas (LNG). The options of lighter fuels and desulphurisation entail costs, including higher energy consumption at refineries, and the present study identifies and compares compliance options as a function of ship type and operational patterns. The results indicate distillates as an attractive option for smaller vessels, while scrubbers will be an attractive option for larger vessels. For all vessels, apart from the largest fuel consumers, residual fuels desulphurised to less than 0.5 % sulphur are also a competing abatement option. Moreover, we analyse the interaction between global SOX reductions and CO2 (and fuel consumption), and the results indicate that the higher fuel cost for distillates will motivate shippers to lower speeds, which will offset the increased CO2 emissions at the refineries. Scrubbers, in contrast, will raise speeds and CO2 emissions.
Q52|Design of climate tax on food consumption|This study examines appropriate design of climate taxes on consumption of food by constructing a simple theoretical model and exemplify the results on climate taxes on consumption of tomatoes and beef in Sweden. The theoretical results showed that i) existing taxes on greenhouse gases (GHG) should be considered to avoid double taxation, ii) taxes need to be differentiated between GHG (carbon dioxide, CO2, methane, CH4, and nitrous oxide, N2O, in present study) because of their different climate impact, and iii) suggested tax levels on GHG in the literature rest on quite different approaches to climate management. The calculations of climate taxes on tomatoes and beef in Sweden indicated considerable differences in the tax level depending on calculation method. The commonly applied suggestion of taxing carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) and disregard existing taxes on GHG emission results in a tax that is five times the appropriate tax for tomatoes and 2.5 times that for beef. The price increases on consumption of food due to a climate tax can thus show large variation depending on tax calculation method.
Q52|Costs of traffic accidents with ungulates in Sweden|Traffic accidents with ungulates pose a serious problem in many countries, and there is a need for predicting accidents and costs at a large scale for an efficient management of the accidents. Based on the assumption that traffic accidents are determined by traffic volume and ungulate population sizes, this study provides a relatively simple method for calculating and predicting costs of current and future traffic accidents with roe deer, wild boar, and moose in Sweden. A logistic population model is assumed for all ungulates, and econometric methods are used for predicting vehicle accidents with panel data on traffic accidents, traffic load, bags, hunting licenses, and landscape characteristics for each county and year during 2003-2015. The calculated total discounted cost of traffic accidents over a period of 15 years is relatively stable around 1300 million SEK per year in present value (which corresponds to 0.03% of gross domestic product in 2015), but the allocation of costs among ungulates differs. Costs of vehicle accidents with moose account for the largest share of the cost (44%), but accidents with wild boar show the most rapid increase over a 15 year period because of the estimated relatively high intrinsic growth rate and the recent establishment of this animal in several counties. The predicted costs are, however, sensitive to the assumption of future hunting pressure and traffic volume.
Q52|Instrument Choice and Stranded Assets in the Transition to Clean Capital|To mitigate climate change, some governments opt for instruments focused on investment, like performance standards or feebates, instead of carbon prices. We compare these policies in a Ramsey model with clean and polluting capital, irreversible investment and a climate constraint. Alternative instruments imply different transitions to the same balanced growth path. The optimal carbon price minimizes the discounted social cost of the transition to clean capital, but imposes immediate private costs that disproportionately affect the current owners of polluting capital, in particular in the form of stranded assets. A phased-in carbon price can avoid stranded assets but still result in a drop of income for the owners of polluting capital when it is implemented. Second-best standards or feebates on new investment lead to higher total costs but avoid stranded assets, preserve the revenues of vested interests, and smooth abatement costs over individuals and time. These results suggest a trade-off between political feasibility and cost-effectiveness of environmental policies.
Q52|The value of a healthy home: Lead paint remediation and housing values|The presence of lead paint significantly impairs cognitive and behavioral development, yet little is known about the value to households of avoiding this residence-specific environmental health risk. In this paper, we estimate the benefits of lead-paint remediation on housing prices. Using data on all homes that applied to a HUD-funded program in Charlotte, North Carolina, we adopt a difference-in-differences estimator that compares values among remediated properties with those for which an inspection does not identify a lead paint hazard. Results indicate large returns for public and private investment in remediation with each $1 spent on lead remediation generating $2.60 in benefits as well as a reduction in residential turnover.
Q52|Why does emissions trading under the EU ETS not affect firms' competitiveness? Empirical findings from the literature|Environmental policies may have important consequences for firms' competitiveness or profitability. However, the empirical literature shows that hardly any statistically significant effects on firms can be detected for the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). On the basis of existing literature, we focus on potential explanations for why the empirical literature finds hardly any significant competitiveness effects on firms, least not during the first two phases of the scheme (2005-2012). We also reason why the third phase (2013-2020) could reveal similar results. We show that the main explanations for this finding are a large over-allocation of emissions ertificates leading to a price drop and the ability of firms to pass costs onto consumers in some sectors. Cost pass-through, in turn, partly generated windfall profits. In addition, the relatively low importance of energy costs indicated by their average share in the budgets of most manufacturing industries may limit the impact of the EU ETS. Finally, small but significant stimulating effects on innovation have been found so far. These different aspects may explain why the empirical literature does not find significant effects from the EU ETS on firms' competitiveness.
Q52|Incumbents' Asymmetric Responses to Environmentally Friendly Entrants in the Automotive Industry|The influence of innovative entrants on incumbents is considered important for technological change. We analyze this influence for the global transition towards alternative technology vehicles (ATVs). Our results indicate that entrants' ATV-related knowledge accumulation stimulates average incumbent's ATV-related research. Regarding global entrants, incumbents with higher ATV patent stocks increased patenting stronger; supporting previous literature on competitive reactions to entry. Responding to domestic entrants, however, incumbents with low ATV patent stocks increased whereas incumbents with high stocks decreased patenting; suggesting that advanced incumbents outsource research or overtake entrants. Further, certain characteristics and not merely the quantity of entrants drive incumbents' responses.
Q52|Market Power in Emission Permit Markets: Theory and Evidence from the EU ETS|Abstract A well-known result about market power in emission permit markets is that efficiency can be achieved by full free allocation to the dominant firm. I show that this result breaks down when taking the interaction between input and output markets into account, even if the dominant firm perceives market power in the permit market alone. I then examine the empirical evidence for price manipulation by the ten largest electricity firms during phase I of the EU ETS. I find that some firms’ excess allowance holdings are consistent with strategic price manipulation, and that they cannot be explained by price speculation or by precautionary purchases to insure against uncertain future emissions. My results suggest that market power is likely to be an empirically relevant concern during the early years of emission permit markets.
Q52|Environmental regulations and allocative efficiency: application to coal-to-gas substitution in the U.S. electricity sector|Abstract The environmental economics literature has for a long time been occupied with the relationships between environmental regulations, technical efficiency, and productivity growth. This paper extends this discussion by taking up environmental regulations’ implications for allocative efficiency. It establishes a model framework that allows disentangling managerial and regulatory induced allocative efficiencies, and utilizes Data Envelopment Analysis to a sample of 67 coal-to-gas substituting power plants observed from 2002 to 2008 to calculate Nerlovian profit efficiencies and their technical and allocative efficiency components. The empirical results illustrate that failing to control for environmental regulations leads to overestimation of managerial allocative efficiencies by ignoring compliance costs. Marginal abatement cost estimates that are in line with allowance prices for NOx and SO2 are further obtained.
Q52|Trade Liberalization, Transboundary Pollution, and Market Size|This paper uses a monopolistic competitive framework to study the impact of trade liberalization on local and global emissions. We focus on the interplay of asymmetric emission taxes and the home market effect and show how a large-market advantage can counterbalance a high emission tax, so that trade liberalization leads firms to move to the large high-tax economy. Global emissions decrease when trade is liberalized in this case. We then simulate the model with endogenous taxes. The larger country, which has the advantage of the home market effect, will be able to set a higher Nash emission tax than its smaller trade partner yet still maintain its manufacturing base. As a result, a pollution haven will typically not arise in this case as trade is liberalized. However, global emissions increase as a result of international tax competition, which underscores the importance of international cooperation as trade becomes freer.
Q52|Cleaning up the air for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games: Empirical study on China's thermal power sector|This study examines the effects of air pollution control within the thermal power sector during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games (BOG08). Using data on pollution control equipment and energy intensity, we investigate for significant differences in their levels between provinces under the regional control policy for BOG08 and other provinces. The results suggest that the energy intensity of thermal power plants improved in 2007 and 2008 in provinces designated as areas requiring coordinated air pollution control for the Olympic Games. On the other hand, we found weaker statistical evidence for treatment effects on pollution control equipment.
Q52|Quel Systeme Incitatif Realiste Pour La Politique De Reduction Des Dechets Menagers ? Enseignements Tires De La Litterature Economique Et Du Cas Français / What Workable Incentive Scheme For The Reducing Kerbside Waste Policy? Lessons Drawn From The Economic Literature And French Cities Experience|Reducing the volume of kerbside waste has become a vital goal for many cities in the world. Since the pricing of communal waste services is often inefficient, economic literature promotes an incentive scheme, which most frequently consist in a unit pricing, “pay as you throw” system. Based on empirical studies, advanced economic works and the French experience, the paper explains why this approach is fairly limited. Unit pricing faces practical difficulties and does not fit to collective housing. Whether households’ motivation is utilitarian or value oriented, the analysis of their behaviour shows that, a too large extension of the inducement part of the price, might bring about significant inconveniences. Finally, a small incentive part is to be favoured. It may seem unsatisfactory and contradictory to the very principle of incentive pricing, but the paper underlines it is not so. Nevertheless, an incentive scheme for households must also use other inducing mechanisms. The deposit refund system is the prominent one; it basically aims at the same goals as unit pricing, but avoids its troubles. NOTICE: the paper is in French
Q52|Handle with Care: The Local Air Pollution Costs of Coal Storage|Burning coal is known to have environmental costs; this paper quantities the local environmental costs of transporting and storing coal at U.S. power plants for the sample period 2002-2012. We first demonstrate that a 10% increase in coal stockpiles (number of deliveries) results in a 0.07% (0.16%) increase in the average concentration of fine particulates (PM2.5) for locations up to 25 miles away from, and downwind from, plants. We next assess the impacts of PM2.5 on average adult and infant mortality rates using coal stockpiles and deliveries as instruments for PM2.5. Our findings within this instrumental variables framework indicate that a 10% increase in PM2.5 leads to a 1.1% (6.6%) increase in average adult (infant) mortality rates; these causal estimates are similar in magnitude to the epidemiological estimates used by the USEPA in their regulatory impact analyses. Our estimated increase in mortality rates implies local environmental costs of $183 ($203) per ton of coal stockpiled (delivered); to put this in perspective, the average power plant paid roughly $48 per ton for coal during our sample period. These sizable but highly localized environmental costs of coal transportation and storage disproportionately impact the economically disadvantaged communities living near coal-fired power plants.
Q52|Who Bears the Economic Costs of Environmental Regulations?|Public economics has a well-developed literature on tax incidence – the ultimate burdens from tax policy. This literature is used here to describe not only the distributional effects of environmental taxes or subsidies but also the likely incidence of non-tax regulations, energy efficiency standards, or other environmental mandates. Recent papers find that mandates can be more regressive than carbon taxes. We also describe how the distributional effects of such policies can be altered by various market conditions such as limited factor mobility, trade exposure, evasion, corruption, or imperfect competition. Finally, we review data on carbon-intensity of production and exports around the world in order to describe implications for effects of possible carbon taxation on countries with different levels of income per capita.
Q52|Is Pollution Value-Maximizing? The DuPont Case|DuPont, one of the most respectable U.S. companies, caused environmental damage that ended up costing the company around a billion dollars. By using internal company documents disclosed in trials we rule out the possibilities that this bad outcome was due to ignorance, an unexpected realization, or a problem of bad governance. The documents rather suggest that the harmful pollution was a rational decision: under reasonable probabilities of detection, polluting was ex-ante optimal from the company's perspective, albeit a very harmful decision from a societal perspective. We then examine why different mechanisms of control - legal liability, regulation, and reputation - all failed to deter socially harmful behavior. One common reason for the failures of deterrence mechanisms is that the company controls most of the information and its release. We then sketch potential ways to mitigate this problem.
Q52|Technology and the Effectiveness of Regulatory Programs Over Time: Vehicle Emissions and Smog Checks with a Changing Fleet|Personal automobile emissions are a major source of urban air pollution. Many U.S. states control emissions through mandated vehicle inspections and repairs. But there is little empirical evidence directly linking mandated inspections, maintenance, and local air pollution levels. To test for a link, we estimate the contemporaneous effect of inspections on local air quality. We use day-to-day, within-county variation in the number of vehicles repaired and recertified after failing an initial emissions inspection, with individual-level data from 1998–2012 from California’s inspection program. Additional re-inspections of pre-1985 model year vehicles reduce local carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter levels, while re-inspections of newer vehicles with more modern engine technology have no economically significant effect on air pollution. This suggests emissions inspections have become less effective at reducing local air pollution as more high-polluting vehicles from the 1970s and 1980s leave the road, and provides an example of how the social efficiency of programs can change under improving technologies. We also estimate the importance of station quality, using a metric devised for California’s new STAR certification program. We show re-inspections of older vehicles conducted by low quality inspection stations do not change air pollution, while inspections at high quality stations have a moderate effect on pollution concentrations, which suggests the potential for ineffective monitoring at low quality inspection stations. We find little effect on ambient ozone levels, regardless of station quality or vehicle age.
Q52|Horizontal Equity Effects in Energy Regulation|"Choices in energy regulation, particularly whether and how to price externalities, can have widely different distributional consequences both across and within income groups. Traditional welfare theory focuses largely on effects across income groups; such ""vertical equity"" concerns can typically be addressed by a progressive redistribution of emissions revenues. In this paper, we review alternative economic perspectives that give rise to equity concerns within income groups, or ""horizontal equity,"" and suggest operational measures. We then apply those measures to a stylized model of pollution regulation in the electricity sector. In addition, we look for ways to present the information behind those measures directly to stakeholders. We show how horizontal equity concerns might overshadow efficiency concerns in this context."

Q52|The Impacts of Environmental Regulation on the U.S. Economy|Concern regarding the economic impacts of environmental regulations has been part of the public dialogue since the beginning of the U.S. EPA. Even as large improvements in environmental quality occurred, government and academia began to examine the potential consequences of regulation for economic growth and productivity. In general, early studies found measurable but not severe effects on the overall national economy. While price increases due to regulatory requirements outweighed the stimulative effect of investments in pollution abatement, they nearly offset one another. However, these studies also highlighted potentially substantial effects on local labor markets due to the regional and industry concentration of plant closures. More recently, a substantial body of work examined industry-specific effects of environmental regulation on the productivity of pollution-intensive firms most likely to face pollution control costs, as well as on plant location and employment decisions within firms. Most econometric-based studies found relatively small or no effect on sector-specific productivity and employment, though firms were less likely to open plants in locations subject to more stringent regulation compared to other U.S. locations. In contrast, studies that used economy-wide models to explicitly account for sectoral linkages and intertemporal effects found substantial sector-specific effects due to environmental regulation, including in sectors that were not directly regulated. It is also possible to think about the overall impacts of environmental regulation on the economy through the lens of benefit-cost analysis. While this type of approach does not speak to how the costs of regulation are distributed across sectors, it has the advantage of explicitly weighing the benefits of environmental improvements against their costs. If benefits are greater than costs, then overall social welfare is improved. When conducting such exercises, it is important to anticipate the ways in which improvements in environmental quality may either directly improve the productivity of economic factors – such as through the increased productivity of outdoor workers – or change the composition of the economy as firms and households change their behavior. If individuals are healthier, for example, they may choose to reallocate their time between work and leisure. While introducing a role for pollution in production and household behavior can be challenging, studies that have partially accounted for this interconnection have found substantial impacts of improvements in environmental quality on the overall economy.
Q52|Environmental Regulation and Labor Demand: The Northern Spotted Owl|Environmental regulation can impact local labor markets, potentially reducing incomes and employment and inducing reallocation across sectors. The labor market consequences of environmental regulation are difficult to isolate because regulations frequently apply to large areas, such as the entire United States, and researchers cannot directly observe the counterfactual, in the absence of regulation. I claim that protection of the northern spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest in the 1990s led to an exogenous decline in labor demand in that region. I use this policy change to identify the local and regional impacts of endangered species regulation on employment and incomes in the timber industry. I estimate the local labor market impact of owl protection by comparing counties in the region with and without owl-protected areas. Depending on the choice of control areas and the inclusion of additional control factors, northern spotted owl protection plausibly led to a small loss of incomes and employment in the region.
Q52|Data Center Energy Efficiency Investments: Qualitative Evidence from Focus Groups and Interviews|The data center industry is one of the fastest growing energy users in the US. While the industry has improved its energy efficiency over the past decade, engineering analyses suggest that ample opportunities remain to reduce energy use that would save firms money. This study explores potential barriers to energy-efficiency investments in data centers. Given the scarcity of empirical data in this context, we conducted focus groups and interviews with data center managers to elicit information about potential barriers to investment and used content analysis to qualitatively evaluate the results. Split incentives between departments within companies and between colocation data centers and their tenants, uncertainty and imperfect information about the performance of new technologies, and tradeoffs with data center uptime were the most pervasive potential barriers discussed by participants. While these factors have moderately slowed investments in energy-saving technologies for many firms, only in the cases of uncertainty/imperfect information and split incentives are these barriers potentially indicative of market failures.
Q52|Retrospective Evaluation of the Costs Associated with the 2004 Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Surface Coating NESHAP|The extent to which ex-ante estimates of the costs of regulation differ from ex-post estimates is an empirical question of considerable interest to policymakers, regulated entities, and the public. This paper examines evidence on the actual costs of compliance with the 2004 Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Surface Coating NESHAP and then compares these estimates to the EPA’s ex-ante cost estimates to identify key drivers of any differences. This regulation is particularly interesting from a cost perspective because at the time of promulgation the EPA considered it to be economically significant (and it was therefore accompanied by an extensive cost analysis), under stood who was likely to be regulated under the NESHAP, and had identified several available technologies that could be used to reduce HAP emissions. Data on ex-post costs are gathered from a subset of the industry via survey and follow-up interview. We find that the EPA overestimated the cost of compliance for these plants and that overestimation was driven primarily by use of estimation methods that did not account for regulatory flexibilities such as the ability to utilize any effective HAPs control method. Thus, we find that differences between ex ante and ex post cost estimates for our sample of facilities are primarily driven by differences in the method of compliance rather than differences in the per-unit cost associated with a given compliance approach. In particular, the EPA expected facilities to install pollution abatement control technologies in their paint shops to reduce emissions of hazardous air pollutants, but instead these plants complied by reformulating their coatings.
Q52|On Refunding of Emission Taxes and Technology Diffusion|We analyze the impacts on technology diffusion of an emission tax refunded in proportion to output market share — a policy modeled after existing systems in Sweden and France — and compare to the diffusion of an abatement technology under a standard emission tax. The results indicate that refunding can speed up diffusion if firms do not strategically influence the size of the refund. If they do, it is ambiguous whether diffusion is slower or faster than under a nonrefunded emission tax. Moreover, it is ambiguous whether refunding continues over time to provide larger incentives for technological upgrades than a nonrefunded emission tax, since the effects of refunding dissipate as the industry becomes cleaner. The overall conclusion is that the effects of refunding on technology diffusion critically depends on the regulated industryÂ’s prior technological composition and its market structure.
Q52|The impact of energy taxes on the affordability of domestic energy|Energy affordability can be defined as a household’s ability to pay for necessary levels of energy use within normal spending patterns. This paper uses three indicators to measure energy affordability risk in 20 OECD countries. Energy affordability risk differs widely between countries. The countries with the highest GDP per capita tend to have the lowest levels of energy affordability risk. The paper then analyses how indicators of energy affordability change in response to a hypothetical tax reform that increases taxes on natural gas, heating oil and electricity in most countries analysed. Results show that, if combined with an income-tested cash transfer using one third of the change in revenue resulting from the tax reform, the reform generally improves energy affordability. If combined with a lump-sum transfer instead, results show that energy affordability increases only according to the most selective of the three indicators.
Q52|The environmental tax and subsidy reform in Mexico|In a bold policy effort, Mexico recently moved away from subsidies to transport fuels, increased tax rates on these fuels and introduced a carbon tax. This paper analyses these reforms using a broad set of criteria that consider the main practical dimensions of environmental policy design: environmental effectiveness, equity and distributional impacts, broader tax system impacts, macroeconomic effects, compliance and administration, policy process and consistency. The reforms significantly improve the extent to which the external costs of energy use are reflected in prices and increase government revenues, but, as price deregulation progresses further, more attention may need to be devoted to analysing and addressing the policies’ distributive effects. The analysis also highlights that ease of administration and collection are an important and desirable property of carbon taxes, especially in emerging market contexts.
Q52|Retrospective evaluation of chemical regulations|OECD countries rely on regulatory tools to manage potential risks from exposure to targeted chemicals. Ex-ante regulatory impact assessment has a long tradition in many OECD countries, with established analytical steps and oversight as well as opportunities for public engagement to hold governments accountable for conducting analysis before regulations are issued. But ex-ante analyses necessarily depend on unverifiable assumptions and models of how the world would look absent the regulation, and how responses to regulatory requirements will alter those conditions. In essence, ex-ante analyses are hypotheses of the effects of regulatory actions. Better ex-post regulatory evaluation would allow agencies and others to test those hypotheses against actual outcomes. This would not only inform decisions related to the cost-effectiveness of existing policy, but would provide feedback that would improve future ex-ante analyses and future policies. However, ex-post analysis also poses challenges, especially when it comes to chemical risks. Once a regulation is in place, it is not always obvious what the world would have looked like without it. Measuring opportunity costs is not easy, and measuring regulatory benefits is often harder. Furthermore, once a regulation is in place, neither regulators nor regulatory entities have strong incentives for examining its actual impact. As a result of these methodological and incentive challenges, while ex-post evaluation has a long tradition in other areas (particularly in programmes financed through the fiscal budget), it has received little attention (and even fewer resources) in the regulatory arena, despite government guidelines requiring it. This paper attempts to address these challenges to evaluating regulatory outcomes and learning from those evaluations. Drawing on experience in OECD countries, it reviews the practices used to understand the likely impacts of regulations aimed at reducing chemical risks both before and after they are issued. It examines why efforts at retrospective review have lagged behind prospective regulatory analysis, and offers recommendations for addressing methodological and incentive challenges to better evaluation.
Q52|Contaminación Ambiental por Basura ¿Cómo Eliminan los Hogares Nicaragüenses la Basura que Generan?<BR>[Environmental Pollution by Garbage How Do Nicaraguan Homes Eliminate the Garbage They Generate?]|This work tries to determine what are the damages and consequences that cause to throw rubbish to the field, vacant land, rivers, lakes and lagoons to the environment by the Nicaraguan homes. Through a proposed econometric model of the Ordinal Probit Multinomial type, it is estimated the probability of Nicaraguan households dumping garbage, for that the data of the Survey of Measurement of the Living Life Level 2014, made by the National Institute of Information Of Development INIDE. Through the hypothesis approach, it has been possible to contrast that Nicaraguan households throw garbage polluting the environment.
Q52|Agricultural impacts of the Great East Japan Earthquake - six years later|On March 11, 2011 the strongest ever recorded in Japan earthquake occurred, also known as the Great East Japan Earthquake, which triggered a powerful tsunami and caused a nuclear accident in one of the world biggest nuclear power stations - Fukushima Daichi. More than six years after the triple disaster the overall impacts on Japanese agri-food chains is far from being completely due to the scale of the disasters and the number of affected agents, the effects’ multiplicities, spillovers, and long time horizon, the constant evolution of the nuclear crisis, the lack of “full” information and models of analysis, etc. This paper presents updates on the impacts of the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan on country’s agriculture and food sector. First, disaster events and their effects is outlined. Second, impact on farms and agricultural resources is estimated. Third, impact on food industries is assessed. Next, extend of radioactive contamination of agri-food products is presented and effects on markets, consumers and international trade evaluated. Chapter summarises responses of different agents, assesses progress and challenges in post-disaster recovery and reconstruction, and withdraw lessons from the Japanese experiences.
Q52|Artificial nighttime lights and the “real” well-being of nations: ‘Measuring economic growth from outer space’ and welfare from right here on Earth|GDP remains too much of an imprecise measure of the standard of living. There is a need for either substitutes or complements. Nighttime lights are a reasonable indicator of the extent, scale, and intensity of socio-economic activities, but a poor measure of national welfare. However, if nighttime lights are understood to constitute externalities, then their effects can be used to adjust measured growth for welfare. Nighttime lights appear to exert sub-optimal positive externalities in developing countries, and supra-optimal negative externality in developed countries. This means that even if we assume equal growth rates in developing and developed countries, welfare is enhanced by increased nighttime lights in developing countries and reduced by increasing nighttime lights in developed countries.
Q52|Spatial assessment of construction waste generated by residential buildings in rural areas|The management of construction waste it is at an early stage in urban areas and lacking in rural areas where this fraction is frequently uncontrolled disposed on public lands. Despite the fact some items of construction waste are considered inert for the environment (soil, concrete) it also contains hazardous items (paint additives, cans, and containers) or recyclables (plastics, metals, wood). Potential recovery of this waste stream is high if it is properly managed. The paper estimates the potential amounts of waste resulted from residential constructions across rural municipalities of Neamț County between 2002 and 2010. These statistical values are calculated at commune level (rural territorial administrative unit) in order to outline the disparities between various geographical areas using thematic cartography. This approach is correlated with demographic features in order to reflect such spatial patterns. The map of population density within built-up areas reveals where the construction sector is emerging at the county scale. Field observations highlight the existence of illegal disposal practices of construction waste in the proximity of settlements or water bodies. This waste stream should receive proper attention in following years in order to achieve recycling and recovery targets imposed by EU regulations.
Q52|On the Conditional Effect of Fine Particulate Matter on Cancer Mortality: Case Study of OECD Countries|Given the adverse effects of air pollution on human health, a lot of studies have empirically investigated the causal effect of air pollution on health. However, no study has considered how fine particulate matter interacts with GDP per capita to affect cancer mortality. This study therefore uses data for 20 OECD countries to estimate the conditional effect of air pollution on cancer mortality. To this end, a fixed effect panel regression model which takes both country and time fixed effects into consideration is estimated. The conditional causal effect of fine particulate matter was found to be negative 0.22 and significant at 1% level.
Q52|Sustainability level of Bulgarian agriculture|This paper presents a holistic approach for assessing agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria based on its economic, social and ecological aspects on sectoral macro-level. It is based on official statistical and other information as well as on expert evaluation. Our study has found that the Bulgarian agriculture on macro-level has good sustainability. Some of the sustainability aspects have higher levels (e.g. the economic aspect) while others (social and environmental) are inferior. Study results could help in focusing the political efforts, so that the agrarian sustainability, in its social and ecological aspect, could be increased. However, a further research is needed to evaluate the level of sustainability at micro-level, so that the major issues and problem areas are addressed accordingly.
Q52|Environmental sustainability of Bulgarian agricultural Farms – assessment, state, factors|The issue of assessment of diverse aspects of sustainability of agricultural farms is among the most topical in the last decades. In Bulgaria there are no comprehensive studies on environmental sustainability of farms in general or different types. This article applies a holistic framework for assessing environmental sustainability of Bulgarian farms. Initially the multiprinciple, multictiteria and mulriindicator framework for assessing environmental sustainability of farm in the country is outlined. After that a level of environmental sustainability of Bulgarian farms is evaluated in general and of farms different juridical type, size, production specialization, and ecological and administrative location. Sustainability assessment is based on a first large-scale survey on environmental aspects of sustainability of agricultural farms in the country carried out in 2016. Third, relations between environmental and socio-economic and integral sustainability of Bulgarian farms are specified. Finally, factors for improving environmental and overall sustainability of agricultural farms in the country are identified. Our study has found out that environmental sustainability of Bulgarian farms is at a good level. Nevertheless due to an inferior level of governance and economic sustainability the integral sustainability of Bulgarian farms is lower and the improvement of the latter two is critical for maintaining overall sustainability of Bulgarian farms at current stage of development.
Q52|Public debt, pollution and environmental taxes: Nash and Stackelberg equilibria|Public debt accumulation and pollution result to disutility while time path must be sustainable. Policy weapons available to the government with regard to public debt is the generation of primary surpluses to sustain public debt while concerning pollution environmental taxation is expected to reduce emissions. In this paper, we address these factors in a simple dynamic game in order to find ways at which the notions of public debt, pollution, and taxation are interrelated. The starting point of the model is the identity of current account as the equation of motion of public debt, while public debt is considering as a stock and the stress of the regulator is to raise the nation’s primary surplus. Nash and Stackelberg differential game solutions are used to explore the strategic interactions. In the Nash equilibrium establishment of cyclical strategies, during the game between the polluters in one hand and the government on the other, requires that the discount rate of the polluters must be greater than government’s discount rate. That is the polluters must be more impatient than the government. In the case of hierarchical setting, the analytical expressions of the strategic variables and the steady state value of public debt stock are provided. Furthermore, we found the analytical expressions of the value functions, making, therefore, the policy implications an easy task. Finally, we found the conditions under which the conflict is more intensive, in the two cases of equilibrium, according to the shadow price of the environmental damages.
Q52|Social Cohesion and Carbon Emissions|This paper demonstrates that population diversity and its adverse effect on social cohesion have a robust, causal, positive effect on the carbon emissions of sufficiently rich economies. An examination of geocoded data on emissions from fossil fuels reveals that such results holds at a subnational level as well. The documented effect of diversity operates through its impact on mistrust and on heterogeneity in preferences, which suggests a social dimension that must be contemplated when setting a strategy to curb human’s carbon footprint.
Q52|Emission Cap Commitment versus Emission Intensity Commitment as Self-Regulation|We compare emission cap commitment that restricts total emissions and emission intensity commitment that restricts emissions per unit of output as measures of self-regulation. The monopolist chooses either emission cap commitment or emission intensity commitment and sets the target level under the constraint that the resulting emissions do not exceed the upper limit. We find that profit-maximizing firms choose emission cap commitment, although emission intensity commitment always yields greater consumer surplus. It is ambiguous whether emission intensity commitment or emission cap commitment yields greater welfare. We present two cases in which emission intensity commitment yields greater welfare. One is the most stringent target case (the target emission level is close to zero), and the other is the weakest target case (the target emission level is close to business-as-usual). Our result suggests that the incentive for adopting emission cap commitment is too large for profit-maximizing firms, and thus, governments should encourage the adoption of emission intensity commitment, especially to achieve a zero-emission society efficiently.
Q52|When starting with the most expensive option makes sense: Optimal timing, cost and sectoral allocation of abatement investment|This paper finds that it is optimal to start a long-term emission-reduction strategy with significant short-term abatement investment, even if the optimal carbon price starts low and grows progressively over time. Moreover, optimal marginal abatement investment costs differ across sectors of the economy. It may be preferable to spend $25 to avoid the marginal ton of carbon in a sector where abatement capital is expensive, such as public transportation, or in a sector with large abatement potential, such as the power sector, than $15 for the marginal ton in a sector with lower cost or lower abatement potential. The reason, distinct from learning spillovers, is that reducing greenhouse gas emissions requires investment in long-lived abatement capital such as clean power plants or public transport infrastructure. The value of abatement investment comes from avoided emissions, but also from the value of abatement capital in the future. The optimal levelized cost of conserved carbon can thus be higher than the optimal carbon price. It is higher in sectors with higher investment needs: those where abatement capital is more expensive or sectors with larger abatement potential. We compare our approach to the traditional abatement-cost-curve model and discuss implications for policy design.
Q52|Does competition prevent industrial pollution? Evidence from a panel threshold model|The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of competition on industrial toxic pollution by using, for the first time, a panel threshold model which allows evaluations of the main drivers of toxic releases under two different market regimes. The empirical analysis is based on a micro‐level panel dataset over the five‐year period 1987–2012. We show that this relationship is statistically significant and robust above and below the threshold, even after accounting for alternative specifications of market concentration. Specifically, we unmask an inverted V‐shaped relationship between market concentration and industrial pollution. We argue that the increasing non‐parametric regression line up to a certain concentration (threshold) level indicates a negative effect on facilities' emissions levels, whereas a decreasing line indicates a positive effect. This relationship provides new insights into environmental policy design towards abatement of industrial releases and sustainability. Finally, our empirical model remains robust under different specifications properly accounted for possible endogeneity.
Q52|Analysis of the impact of the use or non-use of neonicotinoids in agriculture|"Neonicotinoids are a class of chemical insecticides derived from nicotine. Like nicotine, neonicotinoids act on certain types of receptors in nerve synapses. They are much more toxic to invertebrates, such as insects, than to mammals and birds. The popularity of neonicotinoids for pest control is their water solubility, which allows them to be applied to the soil and taken over by the plants. The present paper will present, analyse and evaluate the impact of the use of these insecticides in the agriculture of Romania. In the first phase of the study, we will present the overall situation of the main cultures for which these neonicotinoids are used, by qualitative and quantitative analysis of data from local, national, European and international databases. In the second phase the effect and effort of the use or non-use of these insecticides in agriculture will be estimated. Thus, the difference in production will be determined in an untreated and treated one, and we will see the value of the neonicotinoids in production, on the other hand, the less positive effects of the use of these types of insecticides, namely pollution, or what they call some ""ecological disaster"", but also its effect on apiculture and implicitly on bees. This study will be pertinent and objective, without favoring or disfavoring any person or institution in these two areas."
Q52|The employment impact of private and public actions for energy efficiency: Evidence from European industries|This paper aims at investigating the main effects on EU employment dynamics related to private and public actions for energy efficiency. The econometric analysis relies on a sector-based panel dataset for 15 EU countries over the time span 1995–2009. The empirical analysis shows that after accounting for the role played by sectoral output growth, investment and innovation activities, sectoral energy efficiency gains display a negative effect on employment growth, in particular in energy intensive industries. On the contrary, we find that public actions towards energy efficiency may produce positive effects on employment dynamics. In particular, the higher incidence of taxation on energy costs, the effort towards energy efficiency gains realized in the public sector industries and the implementation of a comprehensive policy mix for energy efficiency at the country level, are factors positively influencing employment growth. This evidence highlights the complexity of the nexus between energy efficiency and employment dynamics, suggesting that superior employment performances can be achieved when complementarity effects between productivity enhancing activities and energy efficiency actions are realized.
Q52|Finance and the Misallocation of Scientific, Engineering and Mathematical Talent|The US financial sector has become a magnet for the brightest graduates in the science, technology, engineering and mathematical fields (STEM). We provide quantitative bases for this well-known fact and illustrate its consequences for the productivity growth in other sectors over the period 1980-2014. First, we find that the share of STEM talents grew significantly faster in finance than in other key STEM sectors such as high-tech, and this divergent pattern has been more evident for STEM than for general skills and more pronounced for investment banking. Second, this trend did not reverse after the Great Recession, and a persistent wage premium is found for STEM graduates working in finance and especially in typical financial jobs at the top of the wage distribution. Third, the brain drain of STEM talents into finance has been associated with a cumulative loss of labor productivity growth of 6.6% in the manufacturing sectors. Our results suggest that increasing the number of STEM graduates may not be enough to reignite sluggish economic growth without making their employment in finance more costly.
Q52|Effectiveness, earmarking and labeling: testing the acceptability of carbon taxes with survey data|Abstract This paper analyzes the drivers of carbon taxes acceptability with survey data and a randomized labeling treatment. Based on a sample of more than 300 individuals, it assesses the effect on acceptability of specific policy designs and individuals’ perceptions of carbon taxes advantages and disadvantages. We find that the lack of perception of primary and ancillary benefits is one of the main barriers to the acceptability of carbon taxes. In addition, policy design matters for acceptability and in particular earmarking fiscal revenues for environmental purposes can lead to larger support. We also find an effect of labeling, comparing the wording “climate contribution” with “carbon tax”. We argue that proper policy design coupled with effective communication on the effects of carbon taxes may lead to a substantial improvement in acceptability.
Q52|Measures, Drivers and Effects of Green Employment : evidence from US local Labor Markets, 2006-2014|This paper explores the nature and the key empirical regularities of green employment in US local labor markets between 2006 and 2014. We construct a new measure of green employment based on the task content of occupations. Descriptive analysis reveals the following: 1. the share of green employment oscillates between 2 and 3 percent, and its trend is strongly pro-cyclical; 2. green jobs yield a 4 percent wage premium; 3. despite moderate catching-up across areas, green jobs remain more geo- graphically concentrated than similar non-green jobs; and 4. the top green areas are mostly high-tech. As regards the drivers, changes in environ- mental regulation are a secondary force compared to the local endowment of green knowledge and resilience in the face of the great recession. To assess the impact of moving to greener activities, we estimate that one additional green job is associated with 4.2 (2.4 in the crisis period) new jobs in non-tradable activities in the local economies.
Q52|Refunding Emissions Taxes: The Case For A Three-Part Policy|This paper examines theoretically whether by combining both output based refunding and abatement expenditures based refunding it is possible to limit the negative consequences that a pollution tax imply for a polluting industry. We show that this is indeed the case by using a three-part policy where emissions are subject to a fee and where output and abatement expenditures are subsidized. When the industry is homogenous, it is possible to replicate the standard emission tax outcome by inducing a polluting firm to choose the production and emission levels obtained under any emission tax, without departing from budget balance. By construction, any polluter earns strictly more than under the standard tax alone without rebate, making this proposal more acceptable to the industry. When firms are heterogenous, the refunding policy needed to replicate the standard emission tax outcome is personalized in the sense that at least the output subsidy should be type dependent and it is strictly prefered only from the industry's point of view to a standard environmental tax. We also explore the implications of uniform three-part refunding policies for a heterogenous industry.
Q52|Output and Pollution Abatement in a U.S. State Emission Function|This study models the relationship between emissions, output and pollution abatement, by defining an emission function in a manner that is consistent with the residual generation mechanism and firms’ optimizing behavior. The relationship is estimated by applying semiparametric estimation and threshold regression on U.S. state-level data from 1973-1994. The results provide a positive nonlinear relationship between emissions and output, rejecting an inverted-U type of relationship between the two (EKC). In the absence of abatement the relationship turns around, verifying the arguments in the literature, that abatement is one of the driving forces for an EKC to emerge.
Q52|Analisi socio-economica del territorio lucano in vent'anni di estrazione petrolifera: vantaggi e svantaggi|The study aims to examine the advantages and disadvantages of the petroleum extraction in Basilicata, as well as to analyze its impact on economy, environment and public health. The introductory part provides a brief overview of the theories of global and local sustainable development, with special attention given to the area of Val dâ€™Agri in Basilicata. The study then proceeds to examine various memoranda of understanding signed between the Region of Basilicata and the petroleum companies in question, in order to highlight which of the points included in these agreements have effectively been respected after twenty years of petroleum extraction. The research further focuses on the socio-economic impact of the extractive industry on the local resources from the 1990â€™s until today. It evaluates the damages caused by petroleum extraction to the environment, economy and public health, which have recently brought about a temporary closure of the extraction facilities. The research leads to the conclusion that the extractive industry has in fact weakened the local production systems and, as a consequence, led to a decrease in new investments in the area of Val dâ€™Agri and in the entire region, despite a threefold increase of the share of royalty payments in the local budget. It can be stated with certainty that the exploitation of the petroleum resources in Val dâ€™Agri, which had initially been perceived as a springboard for economic development of the entire region, has eventually proved to be the cause of an impoverishment of the area, having a negative impact on the food supply chain and impeding the development of tourism.
Q52|Joint Use of Liability and Regulation in Environmental Law|In this paper, we argue that the joint use of ex-ante regulation and ex-post liability rules is efficient when there are uncertainty surrounding causal investigations and regulatory myopia. As these conditions are generally met in environmental cases, we provide an explanation for the frequent coexistence of these two instruments to control activities that create a risk for the environment. Moreover, we suggest that a joint use of liability and regulation should more frequently be optimal at the European (Federal) level than at the Country (State) level.
Q52|Energiepolitische Unsicherheit verzögert Investitionen in Deutschland|Energieintensive und umsatzstarke Unternehmen stellen aufgrund der energiepolitischen Rahmenbedingungen Investitionen in Deutschland zurück. Dies betrifft zwar nur einen Teil der Unternehmen, zeigt jedoch, dass steigende Kosten und Unsicherheit über zukünftige energiepolitische Weichenstellungen Unternehmen in ihren Investitionsentscheidungen beeinflussen. Nur wenige Unternehmen planen darüber hinaus, aus Gründen der Energiepolitik verstärkt im Ausland zu investieren. Doch die aktuellen Regeln, die dieses sogenannte 'carbon leakage' verhindern sollen, sind befristet und drohen zuungunsten gerade energieintensiver Unternehmen verändert zu werden. Diese Unsicherheit und einseitige Belastungen, die nur national oder in Europa anfallen, bedrohen Innovationen und die notwendigen Investitionen, die deutsche und europäische Unternehmen für eine treibhausgasärmere und effizientere Produktion vornehmen müssen. Deshalb ist es für einen Erfolg der Energiewende unerlässlich, die Gesamtkosten durch effiziente Instrumente soweit wie möglich zu begrenzen und einseitige Belastungen zu vermeiden.
Q52|Herausforderungen in der Energie- und Klimapolitik|Die deutsche Klimapolitik agiert im Kontext weltweiter Vereinbarungen und europäischer Steuerungsinstrumente. Der bestehende Mix nationaler Instrumente und Ziele wirkt allerdings inkonsistent, was Zusatzkosten für die nationalen Akteure verursacht. Während im Wirkungsbereich des europäischen Emissionshandelssystems (EU-ETS) zusätzliche Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die allerdings keine über die im EU-ETS festgelegte Emissionsobergrenze hinausgehende Treibhausgasreduktion bewirken können, mangelt es in den Sektoren außerhalb des EU-ETS, namentlich im Verkehr und im Wärmebereich, an wirksamen Instrumenten. Der Klimaschutzplanprozess, den die Bundesregierung angestoßen hat, bietet die Chance, Ziele und Instrumente so anzupassen, dass Inkonsistenzen abgebaut werden und die deutsche Klimapolitik sowohl national als auch international an Akzeptanz gewinnt.
Q52|Der Energiesoli: Alternative Finanzierungsmodelle für die Energiewende|"Der Ausbau der Erneuerbaren Energien zur Stromerzeugung wird in Deutschland durch die EEG-Umlage gefördert. Die Umlage belastet alle Stromverbraucher, unab-hängig davon, ob sie erneuerbar oder fossil erzeugten Strom nutzen. Auch die zu-nehmenden Netzausbaukosten werden auf die Stromverbraucher umgelegt, so dass grüner Strom im Vergleich zu fossilen Energieträgern relativ teuer wird und Projekte zur Sektorkopplung unattraktiv werden. Deshalb gibt es verschiedene Reformkon-zepte, die eine Begrenzung der Belastung der Stromverbraucher, eine Verbesserung der Effizienz und eine andere Verteilung der Belastung zum Ziel haben. Im Hinblick auf all diese Kriterien überzeugt das Konzept einer Haushaltsfinanzierung am ehes-ten, zumal es der herausragenden politischen Bedeutung des Vorhabens entspricht. Durch einen Aufschlag auf die Einkommen- und Körperschaftsteuer (""Energiesoli"") könnte die Finanzierung der notwendigen Haushaltsmittel erfolgen und die EEG-Umlage dafür entfallen. Steuerzahler mit hohen Erträgen und geringem Stromver-brauch würden dadurch höher belastet. Für einkommensschwache Haushalte und Unternehmen mit hoher Stromintensität würde die Belastung sinken."
Q52|Using a Free Permit Rule to Forecast the Marginal Abatement Cost of Proposed Climate Policy|This paper develops a method for forecasting the marginal abatement cost (MAC) of climate policy using three features of the failed Waxman-Markey bill. First, the MAC is revealed by the price of traded permits. Second, the permit price is estimated using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) comparing stock returns of firms on either side of the policy's free permit cutoff rule. Third, because Waxman-Markey was never implemented, I extend the RDD approach to incorporate prediction market prices which normalize estimates by policy realization probabilities. A final bounding analysis recovers a MAC range of $5 to $19 per ton CO2e.
Q52|Emission taxation, green innovations and inverted-U aggregate R&D efforts in a linear state oligopoly game|We revisit the well known differential Cournot game with polluting emissions dating back to Benchekroun and Long (1998), proposing a version of the model in which environmental taxation is levied on emissions rather than the environmental damage. This allows to attain strong time consistency under open-loop information, and yields two main results which can be summarized as follows: (i) to attain a fully green technology in steady state, the regulator may equivalently adopt an appropriate tax rate (for any given number of firms) or regulate market access (for any given tax rate); (ii) if the environmental damage depends on emissions only (i.e., not on industry output) then the aggregate green R&D effort takes an inverted-U shape, in accordance with Aghion et al. (2005), and the industry structure maximising aggregate green innovation also minimises individual and aggregate emissions.
Q52|The Intricacy of Adapting to Climate Change: Flood Protection as a Local Public Goods Game|We study adaptation to climate change in a federalist setting. To protect themselves against an increase in flood risk, regional governments choose among adaptation measures that vary with respect to their costs, the level of protection they offer, and the presence and nature of spillovers to neighboring regions. The central government can provide co-funding in response to specific proposals. If it has to deduce the vulnerability of regions by their actions, the resulting adaptation measures are too costly from a social point of view. The results show that adaptation cannot be expected to be efficient without specifically designed incentive schemes.
Q52|Is Pollution Value-Maximizing? The DuPont Case|DuPont, one of the most respectable U.S. companies, caused environmental damage that ended up costing the company around a billion dollars. By using internal company documents disclosed in trials we rule out the possibilities that this bad outcome was due to ignorance, an unexpected realization, or a problem of bad governance. The documents rather suggest that the polluting was a rational decision: under reasonable probabilities of detection, polluting was ex-ante optimal from the company’s perspective, even if the cost of preventing pollution was lower than the cost of the health damages produced. We then examine why different mechanisms of control – legal liability, regulation, and reputation – all failed to deter a behavior that was inefficient from a social point of view. One common reason for the failures of deterrence mechanisms is that the company controls most of the information and its release. We then sketch potential ways to mitigate this problem.
Q52|Welfare and Redistribution in Residential Electricity Markets with Solar Power|An increasing number of households installing solar panels raises two challenges for regulators: network financing and vertical equity. We propose an optimal tariff design for policymakers to incentivise solar panel adoptions, while guaranteeing the sustainability and equitable distribution of network costs. We estimate structural models of energy demand and solar panel adoption, using a unique matched dataset on energy consumption, income, wealth, solar panel installations, and building characteristics for 135,000 households in the Canton of Bern (Switzerland) in 2008-2013. Our counterfactuals recommend the optimal solar panel installation cost subsidies and optimal tariffs to achieve various solar energy targets.
Q52|Investissements publics nécessaires – Le rôle potentiel des banques publiques|The role of public banks in financing necessary investment should be discussed with reference to a causal system linking public and private expenditure in sequential time. The text starts by presenting a simple variant of such a model and uses it to interpret the causes of the recent financial crisis. The evidence shows that the latter was not caused by public debt but by the fast accumulation of private debt. The facts observed can be interpreted within a simple causality structure where public expenditure plays a causal role in driving economic activity. The model is then used to discuss the role of public banks, introducing the distinction between the creation of primary incomes, or new wealth, and the recycling of past savings, or circulation of wealth already accumulated. The role of public banks is generally discussed only with reference to the circuit of primary incomes, in which banks play only a non-monetary financial intermediary role. The text illustrates a proposal showing that public banks could be used also in their monetary financial intermediary role to create new wealth at European level. Alternatively, one can look at the role of public banks in recycling existing savings for public policy purposes, on which some references are given to the recent literature. The case of investment for climate change mitigation is taken as an example to show that, in the absence of other incentives, the level of environmental investment will be limited to that portion of the necessary investment that the market considers profitable, i.e. it would not be sufficient to reduce the climate change risk. If the necessary investment in environment is to be realized without reducing other necessary public investments, public banks should engage also in monetary financial intermediary’s activities aimed at creating new wealth. The text concludes by examining briefly the main logical consequences of the analysis developed.
Q52|Climate Protection and a New Operator: The Eastern German Lignite Industry Is Changing|According to the German federal government’s climate protection targets, there will be a continuous reduction of lignite-based electricity well before 2030. Simulations show that the currently authorized lignite mines in eastern Germany would not be fully depleted if the climate protection targets for 2030 were complied with. This makes planning for new mines or the expansion of existing ones superfluous. For the planning security of all the actors involved, policy makers should bindingly exclude permits for additional surface mines. In terms of the follow-up costs of lignite mining, the issue is whether or not the companies’ provisions are high enough and insolvency-proof. In this context, the new ownership structures in the eastern German lignite industry, after Vattenfall’s sale of its lignite division to Czech Energeticky a Prumyslovy Holding (EPH), have become a matter of importance. Simulations show that only under optimistic assumptions, the current provisions of 1.5 billion euros for the Lusatian lignite region are sufficient to cover recultivation costs. However, alternative scenarios show significant shortfalls. For this reason, policy makers should work toward independent, transparent cost estimates. Additional measures should be considered as required, such as the creation of a public sector fund to permanently protect the general public against being forced to take on the costs of recultivation. This is also animportant theme for the government’s new Commission on Growth, Structural Change, and Regional Development (Kommission Wachstum, Strukturwandel und Regionalentwicklung). Individual federal states also have key roles to play in the creation of a dependable roadmap for a coal phase-out. For example, the government of Brandenburg is now in the process of revising its energy strategy for 2030 (Energiestrategie 2030).
Q52|Klimaschutz und Betreiberwechsel: die ostdeutsche Braunkohlewirtschaft im Wandel|According to the German federal government’s climate protection targets, there will be a gradual “lights out” for lignite-based electricity well before 2030. Simulations show that the currently authorized strip mines in eastern Germany would not be depleted of coal if the climate protection targets for 2030 were complied with. This makes planning for new mines or the expansion of existing ones superfluous. For the planning security of all the actors involved, policy makers should stop granting permits for additional surface mines. In terms of the follow-up costs of lignite mining, the issue is whether or not the companies’ reserves are high enough and immune to insolvency as well. Vattenfall, a major power company that also serves Germany, sold its lignite divi-sion to Czech Energeticky a Prumyslovy Holding (EPH) last fall. Given this context, the new ownership structures in the eastern German lignite industry have become a matter of importance. Based on the calculations in the simulation and optimistic assumptions, the current reserves of 1.5 billion euros for the Lusatia region are sufficient to cover recultivation costs. However, alternative scenarios show significant shortfalls. For this reason, policy makers should work toward independent, transparent cost estimates. Additional measures should be considered as required, such as the creation of a public sector fund to permanently protect the population against being forced to takeon the costs of recultivation. This is also an important theme for the government’s new Commission on Growth, Structural Change, and Regional Development (Kommission Wachstum, Strukturwandel und Regionalentwicklung). Individual federal states also have key roles to play in the creation of a dependable roadmap. For example, the government of Brandenburg is now in the process of revising its energy strategy for 2030 (Energiestrategie 2030). Den Klimaschutzzielen der Bundesregierung zufolge muss dieBraunkohleverstromung in Deutschland bereits deutlich vor demJahr 2030 kontinuierlich abnehmen. Simulationen zeigen, dass diebereits genehmigten Tagebaufelder in den ostdeutschen Revierenbei einer Einhaltung der Klimaschutzziele bis 2030 nicht vollständigausgekohlt würden. Pläne für neue bzw. zu erweiterndeTagebaufelder erübrigen sich somit. Um Planungssicherheit für alleAkteure herzustellen, sollte die Politik die Genehmigung weitererTagebaufelder daher verbindlich ausschließen.In Hinblick auf die Folgekosten des Braunkohlebergbaus stelltsich die Frage, ob die Unternehmensrückstellungen hoch genugund insolvenzfest sind. In diesem Zusammenhang sind nach demKauf der Braunkohlesparte von Vattenfall durch die tschechischeEnergeticky a Prumyslovy Holding (EPH) auch die neuen Eigentümerstrukturenin der ostdeutschen Braunkohlewirtschaft vonBedeutung. Simulationsrechnungen zufolge könnten die derzeitigenRückstellungen von 1,5 Milliarden Euro für das LausitzerRevier unter optimistischen Annahmen zur Deckung der Rekultivierungskostenausreichen, in anderen Szenarien könnte es jedoch zudeutlichen Fehlbeträgen kommen. Die Politik sollte daher auf unabhängigeund transparente Kostenschätzungen hinwirken.Bei Bedarf könnten weitere Maßnahmen erfolgen wie etwa dieSchaffung eines öffentlich-rechtlichen Fonds, um die Allgemeinheitdauerhaft vor der ungewollten Übernahme von Rekultivierungslastenzu schützen. Dies ist auch ein wichtiges Thema für die neueKommission „Wachstum, Strukturwandel und Regionalentwicklung“der Bundesregierung. Bei der Erstellung eines verlässlichenFahrplans für den Kohleausstieg kommt zudem einzelnen Bundesländerneine wichtige Rolle zu, derzeit beispielsweise der LandesregierungBrandenburg bei der Überarbeitung ihrer Energiestrategie2030.
Q52|Climate Changes in Africa: Does Economic Growth Matter? A Semi-parametric Approach|This study attempts to further examine the impacts of income on carbon emissions in the African continent through investigation of the existence of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). Within the stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence and technology framework, this is the first study in Africa to explore the income-carbon emissions nexus; using panel data together with a semi-parametric panel fixed effects regression. Our data set refers to a panel of 54 countries in Africa; spanning the period 1990-2014. Our results show evidence in contrast to the EKC hypothesis. Our findings shed new light on the income - CO2 emissions nexus and supports implementation of certain policies.
Q52|Green Taxation on Competitiveness: The Effect of the ISP Tax on the Portuguese Retail Sector of Road Fuels|There hasn’t been much clarity on the issue regarding the effects of green taxation on competitiveness as researchers use different conceptual and methodological parameters in defending their arguments. In this sense, and given that most studies provide mixed results, we aim to contribute to the clarification of the issue with the analysis of a specific case-study. Through the effect of the ISP tax on the competitiveness of the Portuguese retail sector of road fuels we intend to demonstrate that the microeconomic approach is more enlightening than the meso/macroeconomic one, and that the effect of environmental policy on competitiveness will depend on the characteristics of the firms and of the markets to which they sell. Our findings come close to the Porter hypothesis.
Q52|International environmental agreements with ancillary benefits: Repeated games analysis|Both ancillary and primary benefits, generated by climate change mitigation, are indispensable key factors to implement the full participation in international environmental agreement (IEA). This paper presents a new IEA model with ancillary benefits, using a repeated game with the linear and quadratic emission abatement cost functions of each country. This study also investigates the effect of ancillary benefits on the condition for full participation in IEA. Ancillary benefits function as a complementary device of punishment scheme for IEA. Our main results show that ancillary benefits can facilitate full participation in IEA, thus suggesting that they should be considered in climate change negotiations.
Q52|Equitably slicing the pie: Water policy and allocation|Non-point source pollution is deteriorating water quality throughout the world. New Zealand is addressing this issue by regulating land-based nutrient losses, with debates over how to allocate limits across a heterogeneous landscape. We develop a spatially explicit economic land use model to investigate efficiency and equity issues from seven approaches to allocate nutrient discharges across two New Zealand watersheds. We find that the preferred allocation differs across land use, land characteristics, and regulation stringency; and that there is no universal ‘best’ allocation option. Therefore, decision-makers should focus on, at least, efficiency and equity, and on how to compensate those most affected.
Q52|Revisiting Pesticide Taxation Schemes|The risks caused by pesticide use for human health and nature are one of the major challenges for agricultural policies. Despite their high potential to contribute to better policies, economic instruments such as pesticide taxes are rarely used in the current policy mix. In this essay, we combine current discussion on pesticide policies in European countries with new insights from recent economic research to provide an outline for better pesticide policies to policy makers and stakeholders. We show that differentiated taxation schemes have a high potential to reduce risks caused by pesticide use and that the targeted re-distribution of tax revenues in the agricultural sector is crucial to create leverage effects on pesticide use and to increase the acceptability of pesticide taxes.
Q52|The Carbon Footprint of European Households and Income Distribution|This paper calculates the carbon footprint of private consumption in the EU27 by five groups of household income, using a fully fledged macroeconomic input-output model covering 59 industries and five groups of household income for the EU27. Due to macroeconomic feedback mechanisms, this methodology – besides induced intermediate demand – also quantifies: (i) private consumption induced in the other household groups, (ii) impacts on other endogenous final demand components, and (iii) negative feedback effects due to output price effects of household demand. The carbon footprint is calculated separately for the consumption vector of each of the five income groups. The simulation results yield a non-linear income elasticity of direct and indirect emissions at each income level: the value of the direct footprint income elasticity decreases from 1.32 (first quintile) to 0.69 (fourth quintile). The value of the indirect footprint income elasticity is always below unity and decreases from 0.89 to 0.62. The results in general reveal a relative decoupling effect: the share of the top income group in income (45%) is much larger than its share in the carbon footprint (37%) and vice versa for the bottom income group (6% in income and 8% in footprint).
Q52|The cost of endangered species protection: Evidence from auctions for natural resources|This paper examines the effect that endangered species regulation has on natural resource development. Specifically, we use data from competitive auctions to estimate the effect that land-use regulation protecting endangered caribou in the Canadian province of Alberta has on the price producers pay for the right to extract oil. We exploit a regression discontinuity design to evaluate how prices differ along regulation boundaries that constrain resource development. The auction format and the regulation discontinuity allow us to measure the total cost of the regulation. We find that producers pay 24% less on average for oil leases that are regulated and that the total net present value cost of the regulation exceeds $1.15 billion for leases sold between 2003 and 2012, all of which is borne by the government. In spite of these costs, the populations of endangered caribou remain in widespread decline.
Q52|Interactions between Market Reform and a Carbon Price in Chinas Power Sector|The electricity sector accounts for a large share of China's carbon dioxide emissions and of the economy-wide abatement potential. China's planned national emissions trading scheme would include electricity generation, as nearly all emissions trading schemes do. The critical difference is that in most existing carbon pricing systems the power sector operates with competitive markets and cost-based pricing, while the Chinese power industry still uses a highly regulated dispatch and pricing system. Together these limitations mean that the effect of a carbon price on China is limited in terms of the impact on operational decisions for existing power stations and in terms of the effects on investment decisions. We explore the channels of interaction between electricity market reform and carbon pricing in China, and provide quantitative estimates of the effects and interactions on electricity sector emissions. A probabilistic discrete choice model is used to simulate the behavior of investors in the power sector. The analysis indicates that market reform can help reduce emissions intensity, but to meet China's 2030 targets for non-fossil fuel generation a low to moderate carbon price is also necessary; conversely, a carbon price will only be effective with market reform that provides flexibility in dispatch. Using our simplified quantitative analysis, the carbon price required for the same share of non-fossil fuel generation would be about twice as high without market reform. Combining market reform and a carbon price could achieve significant rates of decarbonization and is likely to be the most effective and most feasibly policy package to cut emissions from China's power sector.
Q52|Optimum Growth and Carbon Policies with Lags in the Climate System|Abstract We study the optimal carbon tax in an economy in which climate change, stemming from polluting non-renewable resource, affects the economy’s growth potential. Our main contribution is to introduce and explore the natural time lag of the climate system between emissions and damages to capital accumulation in an endogenous growth setting. This allows us to investigate how optimal climate policy, and its interplay with climate dynamics, affect long-run growth and the transition of the economy towards it. Without pollution decay, a higher speed of emissions diffusion steepens the growth profile of the economy. With pollution decay, this leads to lower short-run but higher long-run economic growth during transition. Poor understanding of the emissions diffusion process leads to suboptimal carbon taxes, resource extraction and growth.
Q52|Sistemas de Alerta Temprana para Inundaciones: Análisis Comparativo de Tres Países Latinoamericanos|Los países de América Latina y el Caribe estan afectados por eventos climáticos extremos. En República Dominicana, Ecuador y Bolivia existe un incremento en el riesgo a sucesos extremos en general y a inundaciones en particular. El objetivo de este estudio es comparar los Sistemas de Alerta Temprana (SATs) para inundaciones, identificar los problemas, las lecciones aprendidas y a partir de ello hacer recomendaciones. Con este fin , se analizaron los indicadores relacionados a inundaciones y SATs. Desde septiembre de 2014 hasta julio de 2015, se realizaron 32 entrevistas estructuradas a los más destacados actores, de las principales instituciones, a nivel local y nacional. Encontramos que existen sistemas de monitoreo sólidos, y por ello, se ha trabajado en la mayoría de los casos fortaleciendo la parte técnica y de pronósticos para inundaciones. Sin embargo, en los tres países todavía existe una brecha entre el pronóstico técnico y la comunicación/respuesta de la comunidad. La diferencia entre un fenómeno natural y un desastre puede ser un Sistema de Alerta Temprana, que tome como eje central la participación de las comunidades y la coordinación con las autoridades. Es necesario fortalecer los SATs que existen localmente dando a las comunidades herramientas necesarias y coordinando los sistemas locales y nacionales para dar una alerta, reacción y acción oportunas.
Q52|How Much Energy Do Building Energy Codes Save? Evidence from California Houses|Regulations governing the energy efficiency of new buildings have become a cornerstone of US environmental policy. California enacted the first such codes in 1978 and has tightened them every few years since. I evaluate the resulting energy savings three ways: comparing energy used by houses constructed under different standards, controlling for building and occupant characteristics; examining how energy use varies with outdoor temperatures; and comparing energy used by houses of different vintages in California to that same difference in other states. All three approaches yield estimated energy savings significantly short of those projected when the regulations were enacted.

Q52|Targeting wetland restoration to cost-effectively reduce nitrogen loadings in the Gulf of Mexico| An estimated 50 percent of the nitrogen reaching the Gulf of Mexico is a byproduct of field crop production. Nitrogen entering the Gulf via the Mississippi River generates large algae blooms. At night, the algae absorb oxygen leaving oxygen concentrations levels unsuited to most aquatic life thus creating a ‘dead zone’ about the size of Massachusetts—though seasonal and annual variations in nitrogen inflows vary its size. United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) conservation programs have been credited with controlling, but not reducing, nitrogen inflows. That is, while corn production, the primary source of field nitrogen losses, has increased over the last two decades, nitrogen inflows to the Gulf have remained fairly constant. Much of the credit for controlling nitrogen loadings is given to the on-field nitrogen conservation practices funded through the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP), USDA’s largest conservation program. Two land retirement programs, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the Wetland Reserve Program (WRP), also reduce nitrogen inflows, primarily through nitrogen removal. Can land retirement programs be a cost-effective means of reducing nitrogen inflows? The objective of this research was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of reducing nitrogen loadings by restoring wetlands and to compare our results with prior estimates of the cost-effectiveness of encouraging the adoption of on-field nitrogen conservation practices. We used WRP contracts and other data to estimate a wetland cost function for each wetland region within our study area. With the cost functions and reasonable assumptions, we generated county-level estimates of the expected costs of restoring and preserving new wetlands. With adjusted R-squares of greater than 0.72, the functions are likely to have generated reasonable estimates. We generated estimates of the expected quantity of nitrogen a new wetland might remove by running 20-year simulations of a geographic information system (GIS) model, developed by Crompton et al., and data that include a variety of ecological and weather variables. Removal rates were generated for (hypothetical) new wetlands across the 100,671 grid points within our 183 million-acre study area. We then generate nitrogen-removal cost estimates at each GIS point by dividing the annualized wetland cost estimates by the estimated annual quantity of nitrogen a wetland is expected to remove. Results indicate that nitrogen removal costs range from $0.03 to $6.71 per pound. Half of these wetlands could remove nitrogen at less than $0.37 per pound. As one would expect, the most expensive areas to restore and preserve wetlands are in the areas with some of the highest corn yields hence highest-valued lands. But wetlands’ nitrogen removal rates (in pounds per wetland acre) in parts of these areas are also very high. As a result, some of the wetlands with relatively low nitrogen removal costs (in dollars per pound) lie in parts of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. Wetlands cannot be restored at all GIS points. There are no GIS data that identify exactly where wetlands have been converted. Applying some conservative assumptions, we calculated the probability that a wetland might be restored within a GIS grid point and the associated quantity of nitrogen the wetlands might remove. Our calculation of the probability that a wetland might be restored is based on the likelihood that a converted wetland lies in the area and the probability that the converted wetland might be restorable. The National Wetland Inventory data indicate that there are currently approximately 10 million wetland acres in our study area. Based on data from the USDA Economic Research Service, we calculated that there were about 34 million wetland acres in our study area in the 1780s. Together, these suggest that there are about 24 million prior-converted wetland acres in our study area—about one out of every 7.5 acres was a wetland. Because of land development, mixed land ownerships, and similar factors, it is not likely that all converted wetlands can readily be restored. Additionally, it is not likely that all landowners are willing to participate in a Federal wetland conservation program (unless program payments are much greater than the market value of the land-use change). To incorporate both of these constraints, we assume that only 5, 10, and 20 percent (or 1.2, 2.4, and 4.8 million) of the prior-existing wetland acres might be restored. These represent 0.65, 1.3, and 2.3 percent of the total acres in the study area. Each GIS point represents 247 acres so that the expected number of prior existing wetland acres in each GIS unit area is 1.5 (e.g., 1.5=247*0.0065), 3.0, and 6.0. The assumptions and estimates laid out above allow us to calculate the probable number of wetland acres that can be restored at each level of nitrogen removal cost. Additionally, we can calculate the total quantity of nitrogen that would be removed below each level of cost. Given that 5 percent of the prior existing wetlands might be restored (1.2 million acres), more than 25 percent (or 0.3 million acres) have nitrogen removal costs below $0.17 per pound and 50 percent (or 0.6 million) have removal costs of less than $0.38 per pound. Restoring wetlands with nitrogen removal costs of less than $0.17 ($0.38) would reduce agricultural nitrogen inflows to the Gulf by 4,530 (8,900) tons per year--about 3 (6) percent of the average quantity of agricultural nitrogen entering the Gulf. If we assume that 10 (20) percent of the prior-existing wetland acreage might be restored, then, applying the same calculations, agricultural nitrogen inflow to the Gulf can be reduced by 9,060 (18,120) tons at less than $0.17 per pound and 17,000 (34,000) tons at less than $0.34 per pound. In earlier work, Petrolia and Gowda (2006) compared the cost-effectiveness of land-use changes and on-field conservation practices to reduce agricultural nitrogen losses. Their result indicates that, within their study area, a 20-percent reduction in nitrogen losses through adoption of on-field practices, the plugging of tile drainage systems, and moving cropland to hay and pasture, the average per-pound cost of nitrogen abatement cost is about $0.78. It appears that wetland restoration can be a cost-effect what of reducing agricultural nitrogen losses. One should be careful about drawing hard conclusions. For example, the Petrolia and Gowda (2006) analysis focused on a small region. Had we focused on the same region, we may have found wetland restoration to be less cost-effect
Q52|Costs of Meeting Water Quality Goals under Climate Change in Urbanizing Watersheds: The Case of Difficult Run, Virginia| The Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) set by the EPA in 2010 mandates that the Chesapeake Bay watershed partner states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia, and District of Columbia) must significantly reduce their respective nutrient loadings (NL) draining into the Bay by 2025, where NL are defined as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) loadings. A key component of this reduction will be from non-point source pollution, defined as pollution that cannot be readily traced to a single source. Urban environments, due to large amounts of impervious surface, have been identified as a key non-point source contributor of NL into surrounding watersheds. Surges of NL, or NL “spikes”, into local water systems are more damaging than mean NL alone. Virginia’s Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP), which details how Virginia will meet the Bay TMDL’s NL goals, outlined the need to reduce urban NL. Mean NL and NL variability are expected to increase under climate change (CC). While there are many studies that outline cost-effective ways in which NL may be abated from urban environments, there are comparatively fewer studies that develop predictive frameworks for abating NL under CC. Thus, there is a lack of information regarding water quality policy and how effective it will be in controlling urban NL in the future. Policy makers and their advisors need to begin planning how to address this change. The urbanizing Difficult Run watershed in Fairfax County Virginia was chosen as a test-bed watershed for examining how CC may affect water quality policy in urban environments. There are multiple databases readily available for Difficult Run, and it is similar to many other urban sub-watersheds in Chesapeake Bay watershed. As often prescribed by the Chesapeake Bay Commission, EPA, Chesapeake Bay Program, and Virginia’s WIP, this study will utilize Best Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce NL stemming from the watershed. The NL focus is on Nitrogen. For the purpose of this study, urban BMPs are defined as a type of water pollution control that reduces nutrient export via a stormwater runoff control mechanism. Examples of relevant BMPs include, but are not limited to, bioretention practices, installing green roofs, cultivating urban forest management, restoring urban streams, and reducing shoreline erosion. This study uses mathematical programming to compare how the costs of achieving a given NL reduction will differ under differing climates. More specifically, the first objective is to compare the costs of achieving a given level of reduction in mean NL in the watershed based on historical conditions to those predicted under CC. The second objective is to evaluate effects of changes in variability of nutrient loadings under CC on the costs of achieving NL reductions. The first mathematical programming model is a cost minimization, linear programming model which minimizes the total cost of BMP placement subject to a user-defined reduction in mean NL. Constraints are placed on the number of BMPs that can be allocated to the watershed based on watershed characteristics. For example, the amount of stream buffers that can be installed is constrained by available stream frontage in the watershed. The second model is based on Qiu, Prato, and McCamley’s Safety-First model, which pulls its core construction from the Target Minimization of the Absolute Total Deviation (MOTAD) construction. The model contains two key parameters that can be adjusted by the user, the NL Target, and the probability of exceeding the Target. NL for the watershed were simulated using EPA’s Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) 5.1. Using historical data collected by three USGS water monitoring stations stationed in the watershed, NL were calibrated and validated to match historical NL for years 1971-1998. CC nutrient loading data were then simulated for years 2041-2068 where SWMM used input data generated from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) regional climate model (RCM) MM5I_cssm, which was modeled by Andrew Ross and Raymond Najjar of the Department of Meteorology at Penn State. Land constraints for the mathematical programming model were derived using a Geographic Information System (GIS). The data were compiled from sources including, but not limited to, Fairfax County Open GIS data base, USGS, ESRI, Virginia LIDAR, National Land Cover Database, and U.S. Soil Survey. Through analyzing these raster and vector data sets, geospatial information was derived regarding average slope percent, percent impervious surface, water table separation, and hydric soil grouping among others. The geospatial information was transferred into the mathematical programming models to limit the specific acreage for BMPs. Results Preliminary cost minimization results for N loading reduction show heavy favoritism for urban stream restoration, a commonly recommended and effective BMP. However, when taking into consideration the limited stream feet available for restoration due to Chesapeake Bay Protection Area land classifications, Low Impact Development (LID) practices become the principal BMPs chosen. Examples of LID include bioretention, bioswale, and permeable pavement. Percent N loading reductions were parametrically varied from zero to twenty-five percent in order to give policy makers additional information about the way in which costs behave for N loading abatement. From zero to roughly eighteen percent N loadings reduced, the costs rise in a linear fashion. From eighteen percent onward, the costs increase at an increasing rate forming a convex cost frontier. This behavior fits with most economic prediction where the marginal cost of pollution abatement is expected to increase at an increasing rate. Work is currently underway to evaluate the effects of climate change on costs of reducing mean NL and to evaluate costs of reducing NL under risk using the safety-first model. Preliminary results indicate that CC increases the variability of NL implying that costs of meeting water quality goals will be higher under CC when risk is considered. Discussion Potential Designing water quality policy that incorporates structural and land use change can no longer be based on historic conditions alone. CC is expected to alter many of the environmental variables which water quality and economic modelers utilize to construct policy recommendations. The public desires to improve water quality, yet resources to achieve goals are limited. Therefore, it is important that policy models incorporate the effects of CC, so water quality programs can be efficiently adapted to match these changing conditions.

Q52|Intra-firm diffusion of pollution prevention technology: the role of organizational structure| This paper empirically examines the extent to which organization characteristics promote the diffusion of pollution prevention technologies within a firm (parent company). We use panel data on more than 5000 facilities reporting to the Toxics Release Inventory over the period of 1991 to 2011 to examine the number of pollution prevention technologies adopted by a facility with respect to its size, previous experience in adoption, its distances to its sibling facilities and firm’s headquarter, and regional density. We use a two-part hurdle model to estimate the likelihood of adoption and the rate of adoption, while controlling for public and regulatory pressures that may have affected the adoption of pollution prevention technologies. We find that a facility that was located in the same city with its firm’s headquarter were more likely to adopt pollution prevention technologies. Past experience in adoption of pollution prevention technology and firm’s knowledge stock on pollution prevention technology increased both the likelihood and rate of adoption.
Q52|A Dynamic Model of Effects of Effects of Trade and Environmental Policies on Firms' Offshoring and Clean Technology Adoption Decisions| This paper develops a dynamic general equilibrium model to analyze the effects of changes in trade and environmental policies on firms' production location choices and clean technology adoptions to reduce emission. During this process, the equilibrium worker's wages and environmental quality of related countries are determined. In addition, this model is applied to the trade and production relocation issues between the United States and China over 1999-2013 to quantify the pollution haven effects and the total production offshoring directly and indirectly from the U.S. to China. Further, the long-run predictions on offshoring and emission levels in both countries and counterfactual policy analysis are discussed in this paper.
Q52|Decomposing Irrigation Water Use Changes in Equilibrium Models| This paper measures the importance of different drivers of change in irrigation water use regionally and globally. We followed Heckscher–Ohlin theory, Ricardian specific-factor model, and Melitz-type theories of trade to introduce a method for decomposing irrigated water use. We apply the decomposition method on the results of Liu et al. (2014) on the impacts of future irrigation shortfalls. We find that rain fed substitution (specific-factor impact) contributes to 62% of change in water use; substitution to non-crops (Heckscher–Ohlin impact) accounts for 16% of the change; and moving to farms with higher water productivity (Melitz impact) contributes to 7% of it, globally. The importance of drivers varies by region but usually these three drivers are the most important factors in adaptation to water shocks.
Q52|The effect of endangered species regulations on local employment: Evidence from the listing of the lesser prairie chicken| The U.S. Endangered Species Act is often criticized as pitting people against species by conserving habitat at the cost of jobs. Critics of current conservation policies argue that the protection of species is stripping landowners of their property rights and putting people in industries tied to resource extraction out of jobs. While changes in employment are important measures of the public costs of endangered species protection, relatively little is known about the labor market impacts of listing a species under the Endangered Species Act. We examine changes in employment associated with the lesser prairie chicken, an imperiled bird that was listed as threatened in May 2014. Using monthly county-level employment data and variation in potential prairie chicken habitat, we apply a difference-in-differences strategy to measure the employment impacts of the listing decision. We find evidence that employment declined after the listing by about 1% in counties with habitat relative to non-habitat areas. We also find that the impact is proportional to habitat, so counties with the most prairie-chicken habitat experienced the largest impacts on employment.

Q52|Undermined by Adverse Selection: Australia's Direct Action Abatement Subsidies| This paper examines economic challenges faced by Australia’s Direct Action abatement subsidy scheme. Introduced in 2014, the scheme operates by reverse auction, funding projects voluntarily proposed by the private sector. Because the government cannot know true project counterfactuals, the lowest auction bids are likely to often be non-additional “anyway” projects. The scheme is hence likely to exhibit a systematic skew toward low-quality abatement. The paper presents a model of the adverse selection problem and describes the early experience with Direct Action. A discussion of a way forward is also provided.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q52|Are China’s Climate Commitments in a Post-Paris Agreement Sufficiently Ambitious?| In international climate change negotiations, China’s role is an issue of perennial concern. In particular, the lack of quantitative, absolute emissions commitments from China has been the focus. In line with changing domestic and international contexts, China is recalibrating its stance and strategy. Its participation in international climate change negotiations has evolved from playing a peripheral role to gradually moving to the centre. This article examines China’s stance and role in international climate change negotiations from a historical perspective. In so doing, the article discusses the evolution of international climate negotiations and China’s stance in the lead-up to and at the Paris conference. With Paris behind us, the focus is now turning to the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The article discusses post-Paris issues in the international context and in particular in China’s context. These affect the post Paris negotiations and hold the key to achieving desired outcomes.
Q52|The Strategic Use of Abatement by a Polluting Monopoly|This paper evaluates the effects of the lack of regulatory commitment on emission tax applied by the regulator, abatement effort made by the monopoly and social welfare comparing two alternative policy games. The first game assumes that the regulator commits to an ex-ante level of the emission tax. In the second one, in a first stage the regulator and the monopolist simultaneously choose the emission tax and abatement respectively, and in a second stage the monopolist selects the output level. We find that the lack of commitment leads to lower taxation and abatement that yield larger emissions and, consequently, a larger steady-state pollution stock. Moreover, the increase of environmental damages because of the increase in the pollution stock more than compensates the increase in consumer surplus and the decrease in abatement costs resulting in a reduction of social welfare. Thus, our analysis indicates that the lack of commitment has a negative impact of welfare although this detrimental effect decreases with abatement costs.
