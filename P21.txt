P21|Corporate Ownership and Managerial Turnover in China and Eastern Europe: A Comparative Meta-Analysis|In this paper, we perform a meta-analysis of 736 estimates extracted from 31 previous studies to compare China and Eastern Europe from the viewpoint of the relationship between corporate ownership and managerial turnover. Our results strongly suggest the presence of asymmetric circumstances between the two: Namely, in Eastern Europe, private outside investors and large shareholders exert a positive influence on managerial discipline of the companies they invest in, and the government is also actively involved in the corporate governance of state-owned enterprises. In contrast, the Chinese government and the Communist Party of China have such significant control over companies as corporate owners that private shareholders only have limited influence over top management. In this sense, Chinese firms are more likely than their East European counterparts to face a greater problem in corporate governance.
P21|Gorbachev versus Deng: A Review of Chris Miller's 'The Struggle to Save the Soviet Economy'|Chris Miller’s book is a historian’s account of Mikhail Gorbachev’s efforts to save the Soviet economy. Miller focuses on the question of why Gorbachev did not follow Deng Xiaoping and did not manage to reform the economy. Miller argues that it was not for the lack of understanding (Gorbachev did invest in learning China’s approach to reform and did understand it well), nor for the lack of trying. In fact, Gorbachev did try to implement Deng’s agricultural and industrial enterprise reforms. However, Gorbachev’s reforms were blocked by powerful vested interests. An inability to tackle the agricultural and industrial lobbies eventually resulted in the bankruptcy and collapse of the Soviet Union. While I generally agree with the political economy argument, I discuss a number of alternative explanations. I also discuss sources of Gorbachev’s weak state capacity and offer an evaluation of Gorbachev’s and post-Gorbachev reform efforts and mistakes based on the political economy research carried out in the last twenty-five years.
P21|Some Issues on the Vietnam Economic Growth|"We first consider the question of the productivity of the economy of Vietnam at the macro level. With theoretical models and empirical data, we find out the Leontief production function, and its associated TFP (Total Factor Productivity). We show that the TFP is one of the main engines of Vietnam economic growth. However when we move to the micro level with the capital productivity of 2,835 State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), we discover there exists an over utilization of the physical capital and more importantly, diversion of the capital stock. This diversion may be due to a waste of capital stocks or to a special form of bribery we call ""hidden overhead"". To summarize, economic growth in Vietnam my be enhanced by investing in the founding components of TFP such as new technology, Human Capital, better organisational system, but also by fighting the bribery and the over utilization of the physical capital."
P21|The real value of China’s stock market|This paper shows that, counter to common perception, stock prices in China are strongly linked to firm fundamentals. Since the reforms of the early 2000s, stock prices are as informative about future profits as they are in the US. Although the market is segmented from international equity markets, Chinese investors price individual stock characteristics like other global investors: they pay up for size, growth, liquidity, and long shots, while they discount for systematic risk. Price informativeness is significantly correlated with corporate investment e ciency. For international investors, China's stock market offers high average returns and low correlation with other equity markets.

P21|The Soviet economy: the late 1930s in historical perspective|This paper is draft of the concluding chapter of The industrialisation of Soviet Russia,vol.7:The Soviet economyand the approach of war,1937– 1939, in preparation for publication by Palgrave Macmillan. We consider the development of the Soviet economy over the period of the series, that is, from the launching of the first five-year plan and the collectivisation of agriculture to the outbreak of the Second World War. We review, in turn, the pattern of forced industrialisation, the measurement and mismeasurement of economic progress, the extraordinary militarisation of a mobilised society and economy, the emergence of the Soviet Union as a global military power, and the scope for reforms within the economic system that Stalin created and ruled over.

P21|Ownership Concentration and Firm Performance in European Emerging Economies: A Meta-Analysis|This paper aims to perform a large-scale meta-analysis to examine the relationship between ownership concentration and firm performance in emerging economies of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. A meta-synthesis of 1517 estimates collected from 69 previous studies indicated the presence of a statistically significant and positive effect of ownership concentration on firm performance. The synthesized effect size, however, is only modest at best. A meta-regression analysis conducted to identify the factors underlying the small effect size revealed that differences in target industries, estimation periods, design of ownership variables, data sources, estimators, and choices of control variables could have had systematic and profound effects on the empirical results presented in previous studies. We have also noted that publication selection bias is strongly suspected in this research field, and that, due to the magnitude of this bias, existing studies cannot be expected to provide genuine evidence regarding the effect of ownership concentration on firm performance in European emerging economies. Further empirical studies are required to identify the true effect in this region.
P21|International Presence of the Japanese Study of Russian and East European Economies|In this article, I examine the oversea activities of Japanese researchers in the field of Russian and East European economic studies based on objective data and offer several suggestions for improving their presence in the international academic community. The presence of Japanese scholars of Russian and East European economies as measured by the number of relevant articles published in international journals is still marginal at best, despite their high participation rates in academic conferences abroad. This may partly be due to the fact that many Japanese researchers are not effectively utilizing available international resources. Furthermore, although many of the works produced by Japanese experts have important implications in the research field, only a handful of them are submitted to international journals. In this and many other respects, there is still much room for enhancing the international status of the Japanese study of Russian and East European economies.
P21|The Race Between Demand and Supply: Tinbergen's Pioneering Studies of Earnings Inequality|Understanding inequality and devising policies to alleviate it was a central focus of Jan Tinbergen's lifetime research. He was far ahead of his time in many aspects of his work. This essay places his work in the perspective of research on inequality in his time and now, focusing on his studies on the pricing of skills and the evolution of skill prices. In his most fundamental contribution, Tinbergen developed the modern framework for hedonic models as part of his agenda for integrating demand and supply for skills to study determination of earnings and its distribution and the design of effective policy. His lifetime emphasis on social planning caused some economists to ignore his fundamental work.
P21|Will China Collapse: A Review, Assessment And Outlook|Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, China's economic and political stabilities have been repeatedly called into question. In this paper, we review long-lasting debates as to whether or not China will collapse and explain why we believe China is not going to collapse economically or politically. Our main argument is that Chinese authorities have applied a gradual anti-crisis approach to reform since 1978. This approach means that the Chinese government has both pursued modest reform measures and reacted quickly to internal and external shocks. Structurally speaking, the party and Chinese central government's control over social resources represents an implicit guarantee against potential collapses. This paper then studies current risks of a sudden growth collapse in the form of a debt crisis, a housing bubble bust, and political disintegration, and lays forth why these events are not likely to happen and spark a major Chinese collapse in the near future. We also identify new instabilities in China's economic and political system and discuss how the current gradual anti-crisis approach to reform can be upgraded to deal with these problems.

It is necessary to design and implement successful strategies]|It is shown that in the success of catching-up development, an important role was played by special structures - general development agencies- that coordinated the activities of ministries and offices. The functions of such agencies are considered, the main tasks that the similar Russian Federal Development Agency (FDR) should solve, are described. The creation in late 2016 of the Department of Project Activities of the Government Office of the Russian Federation can be considered as the first stage of the creation of FDR. A number of further steps are proposed for its formation.
P21|Statistik und Organisation der NS-Kriegswirtschaft und der DDR-Planwirtschaft 1933-1949/50<BR>[Statistics and Organization of the NS-War Economy and the East-German Planned Economy 1933-1949/50]|Abstract: NS-War Economy 1933-1945 and Abstract: The Emergence of the Planned Economy in East-Germany 1945-1949/50 The major part deals with economic statistics as an instrument for warfare and war preparation. Firstly, the involvement of German Statistical Office (Statistisches Reichsamt) is described and analyzed: as soon as in 1934, plans emerged in the Office to conduct periodical industrial censuses as a means of a statistical information system to meet the demands of a planned or commanded economy for warfare. The comprehensive industrial census of 1936 became the main source for this purpose. Secondly, the statistical information is put forward. It was increasingly provided by mandatory reporting of private industrial firms and their organizations, which became instrumental in steering the German economy. Officially and privately organized economic statistics finally merged: during the war, the Ministry of Economics set up a statistical information system based on the collaboration between the German Statistical Office and the German Institute for Economic Research (Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung). In 1943, the responsible department of the Ministry of Economics was incorporated into the Planning Office (Planungsamt) of Speer´s Ministry for Armament. Within this centre of economic command economic statistics became an essential tool for running the German economy during the last years of the war. In a separate chapter, plans of the Ministry of Economics during the last months of the war are highlighted which aimed at designing an institutional framework for centralizing and centrally steering German empirical economic research and economic statistics after the war. Finally, the use of the NS-statistics after the war is touched upon, thus forming a bridging chapter to East-Germany setting up its planned economy. A separate case study deals with a report of the Statistical Office asked for by the Ministry of Economics in 1936 to estimate the assets of German Jews. Immediately after the war, the commands of Soviet Military Administration for Germany (SMAD) endeavoured to re-establish and increase production in the Soviet Zone of Occupation (SBZ). For short term economic planning, they required regular statistical reports from business firms. Not before 1948, however, did the Central Statistical Office (StZA) founded in the fall of 1945 succeed in standardizing and centralizing the statistics reported by business firms. The federal structure of the SBZ with its strong position of the independent statistical offices of the individual states was to blame for the delay. It was finally overcome when the StZA became a major department of the newly created German Economic Commission (DWK), the centralized governmental body of the SBZ. Right from the beginning, the StZA drew on economic statistics of NS-Germany to obtain a basis for steering and planning the East German economy. Above all in 1947/48, the original files of the Industrial Census of 1936 were rearranged and evaluated for the Two-Years-Plan of 1949/50, the first elaborate planning scheme of the GDR. Until then the insufficient statistical reporting system of East Germany had not allowed such a planning.
P21|Calcul socialiste et socialisme de marché<BR>[Socialist Calculation and Market Socialism]|"This paper focuses on the debate held in the twenties and thirties of the last century between libertarian economists and socialist economists, following the denial by the first ones of the feasibility of a socialist economy. This controversy is well known to specialists and has been widely commented. It seemed to me useful to initiate non-specialists in an original way: by having the controversy speaking by itself. We review the main contributions and summarise their arguments with, initially, the bare minimum of personal comments. Walrasian general equilibrium serves as a reference for the defenders of market socialism in the controversy. But the concept of competition behind this theory is very incomplete; it is purely passive. It follows that the market socialism which emanates from it is not really a MARKET socialism. It is lacking the competition which innovates. Markets for capital goods are also lacking in theses models. Our paper then turns to a new generation of socialist models involving this real competition. We review two models proposed by Bardhan and Roemer and then exhibit a personal model. This type of model is facing a modern criticism whose central concept is the ""soft budget constraint""."
P21|Actual Condition Of Vacant Houses And Vacancy Of The Condominium In Japanese Local Cities? Central Areas|In Japan, decline of the central urban area due to the suburbanization of various functions associated with the progress of motorization is posing to be a great challenge. In addition, in recent years, an increase in vacant houses has become an issue all over Japan due to population decrease and the aging population. There is also concern that the number of vacant houses will increase in central urban areas. In this research, we grasped the actual conditions of vacant houses and vacancy of the condominium in central urban areas of 35 local cities in Japan and analyzed location trends in the target 5 cities about vacant houses and 35 cities about vacancy of condominiums. We investigated the vacant houses and vacancy of condominiums in each central urban area and analyzed the location trend of vacant houses and vacancy of condominiums about the following points; ?Distance to station?, ?Road contact condition?, ?Floor area ratio designation?, ?Price? and ?age of a building?. We can mention to the tendency of vacant houses location is the house which is located far from station, have contact with narrow road, and have relatively small building area. About Vacancy of the condominium it is not related with a price but vacancy rate of condominium is high at the condominiums constructed in bubble economy period.
P21|Economic Growth in Transition Economies: Does investments matter?|Many countries from the beginning of transition period tried to find answer of Adam Smith fundamental question, ?how countries get rich??. Thus, main goals of all economic reforms, since 1989-1990 years until now in countries with transition economic for stimulation economic growth. All transition states have two way of development ?Shock Therapy? and ?Gradualism? for faster implementation free market based economic system.Countries that are characterized as transition economies, with the inefficient political or economical system investment will play a less prominent role in stimulating the economy than in the developed countries. Given these peculiarities, investments have lesser role in stimulation economic growth in countries with transition than macroeconomic policies, structural reforms, protection of property right.Countries? from the start of the transition period or from the time of became independent, economic policy focus on attracting investments for stimulation economic growth, but the height role of investment is not confirmed in examples of many countries, which indicates that the economic growth in countries of transition is not related to the number of invitations attracted by the country. Our research is developed based on Oleh Havrylyshyn, Ivailo Izvorski, Ron van Rooden study ?Recovery and Growth in Transition Economies 1990-97: A Stylized Regression Analysis?. IMF, 1998. Which include inflation rate, structural reform, share of government expenditure in GDP; investment; price liberalization index; competition index; exchange rate and privatization index as an independent variables, dependent variable is real economic growth (GDP). 31 countries as transition economic are selected based on World Economic Outlook, October 2000, IMF. Dates (1997-2014) used in econometric models came from different publications of IMF, EBRD and WB collected by author.Statistical characteristics of 12 models satisfy the necessary requirements for the evaluation, namely R2 are presented in 0.21 (minimum) and 0.43 (maximum) interval. Other statistics are also used for assessing the model: Akaike info criterion; Schwarz criterion; Hannan-Quinn Criter; Durban-Watson and F-statistics. In those models are analyzed different combination of independent variables.Panel model where the analyzed period is divided into two parts (1997-2004; 2004-2014), It is important to note that in these models all variables of investment are characterized by negative correlation with economic growth, statistical characteristics of models analyzed during the 2004-2014 data are considerably improved compared to the previous model.Inflation, governmental expenditures, price liberalization index, competition policy, exchange regime, investment has negative impact on economic growth, but structural reforms in important factor for stimulation economic growth rate in all models.
P21|American Radical Economists in Maoâ€™s China: From Hopes to Disillusionment|American radical economists in the 1960s perceived China under Maoism as an important experiment in creating a new society, aspects of which they hoped could serve as a model for the developing world. But the knowledge of â€˜actually existing Maoismâ€™ was very limited due to the mutual isolation between China and the US. This paper analyses the First Friendship Delegation of American Radical Political Economists (FFDARPE) to the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China in 1972, consisting mainly of Union for Radical Political Economics (URPE) members, which was the first visit of a group of American economists to China since 1949. Based on interviews with trip participants as well as archival and published material, this paper studies what we can learn about the engagement with Maoism by American radical economists from their dialogues with Chinese hosts, from their on-the-ground observations, and their reflection upon return. We show how the visitorsâ€™ own ideas conflicted and intersected with their perception of the Maoist practice on gender relations; workersâ€™ management and life in the communes. We also shed light on the diverging conceptions of the role for economic expertise between URPE and late Maoism. As the first in-depth study on the FFDARPE we provide rich empirical insights into an ice-breaking event in the larger process of normalization in the Sino- U.S relations, that ultimately led to the disillusionment of the Left with China.
P21|The “same bed, different dreams” of Vietnam and China: how (mis)trust could make or break it|The relationship between Vietnam and China could be captured in the Chinese expression of “同床异梦”,which means lying on the same bed but having different dreams. The two countries share certain culturaland political similarities but also diverge vastly in their national interests. This paper adds to the extantliterature on this topic by analyzing the element of trust/mistrust in their interactions in trade-investment,tourism, and defense-security. The analysis shows how the relationship is increasingly interdependent butis equally fragile due to the lack of trust on both sides. The mistrust or even distrust of Chinese subjectsrun deep within the Vietnamese mindset, from the skepticism of Chinese investment, Chinese tourists,discrimination against ethnic Chinese, to the caution against Chinese aggression in the South China Sea.The paper forecasts that, despite the deep-seated differences and occasional mistrust, going forward,neither side would risk damaging the status quo even when tensions peak.
P21|Aristotle vs. Plato: The distributive origins of the Cold War|Competing definitions of justice in Plato's Republic and Aristotle's Politics indicate the existence of two distinct economic systems with different normative priorities. The three-class society of the Platonic economy (guardians, auxiliaries, producers) gives rise to guardians who by virtue are expected to enforce output targets on producers directly or through auxiliaries. The three-class society of the Aristotelian economy (rich, middle, poor) facilitates the emergence of different ruling coalitions and compensates efficiency losses of vertical production processes with political gains derived from representative governance. In the Aristotelian economy, the middle class is better off than in the Platonic economy (auxiliaries), because a just society (polity) is achieved under its rule. I argue that the equilibrium solutions of the Platonic and Aristotelian systems provide the normative foundations for the distinction between plan and market.
P21|Is China Socialist?|"It has been 40 years since Deng Xiaoping broke dramatically with Maoist ideology and the Maoist variant of socialism. Since then, China has been transformed. Forty years ago, in 1978, China was unquestionably a socialist economy of the familiar and well-studied ""command economy"" variant, even though it was more decentralized and more loosely planned than its Soviet progenitor. Twenty years ago--that is, by the late 1990s--China had completely discarded this type of socialism and was moving decisively to a market economy. China today is quite different both from the command economy of 40 years ago, and from the ""Wild West Capitalism"" of 20 years ago. Throughout these enormous changes, China has always officially claimed to be socialist. Does the ""socialist"" label make sense when applied to China today?"
P21|Services policy reform and manufacturing employment: Evidence from transition economies|Policy reforms targeting the services sectors are a neglected dimension of the process of structural transformation and economic development. The effects of such reforms on employment across industries as a function of their use of services as intermediate inputs are theoretically ambiguous and remain largely understudied. This paper uses sector‐level data for 24 transition economies for the 1990–2012 period to assess the impacts of services policy reforms on downstream manufacturing employment. We find a negative effect of services reforms on manufacturing sector employment. This is mostly associated with the process of transition to a market‐based economy. Controlling for transition‐specific dynamics, the data suggest a neutral effect of progress towards adopting “best practice” policies for upstream services on employment in downstream manufacturing. Furthermore, in line with the extant literature, we confirm that services policy reforms enhance productivity of downstream manufacturing industries. Finally, we find that the negative effects on downstream employment are mitigated in countries with better economic governance and human capital.
P21|Capital flows and growth dynamics in Central and Eastern Europe|This paper assesses the importance of capital flows as measured by the current account balance for the growth dynamics of the EU countries from Central and Eastern Europe. Economic growth in these countries was on average relatively high before the global financial crisis but markedly lower after the crisis. Panel data econometrics using annual data for 1997â€“2015 points to the contemporaneous current account balance having a sizeable negative effect on annual GDP growth. Estimations using many control variables and instrumental variables suggest that the negative effect is mainly demand driven. Counterfactual simulations show that growth rates in all CEE countries would have been lower in the absence of capital flows, and this applies particularly to the countries with the most disadvantageous starting points.
P21|Post-Privatization Ownership And Firm Performance: A Large Meta-Analysis Of The Transition Literature|This paper aims to perform a large-scale meta-analysis of the relationship between post-privatization ownership and firm performance in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Baseline estimation of a meta-regression model that employs a total of 2,894 estimates drawn from 121 previous studies indicated the superior impact of foreign ownership on firm performance in comparison with state and domestic private entities. Furthermore, the estimation of an extended meta-regression model that explicitly controls for the idiosyncrasies of transition economies and privatization policies strongly suggested that differences between countries in location, privatization method, and speed of policy implementation strongly influence the link between postâ€ privatization ownership structure and firm performance. We also found that these factors not only cause a remarkable gap between countries in terms of ex post improvement in firm performance but also significantly affect the interrelationship between foreign investors, domestic outsider owners, and firm managers, and the relative superiority of various domestic outsiders. Conclusive evidence of the harm caused to ex post firm performance by voucher privatization is one of the most noteworthy empirical findings in this paper.
P21|Toothless Reforms? The Remarkable Stability of Female Labor Force Participation in a Top-Reforming Country|Low Female Labor Force Participation (FLFP) constitutes a foregone opportunity at both the macro and at the micro levels, potentially increasing the vulnerability of households and lowering the long-run development perspectives of a country. Most international organizations and national policy makers see low FLFP as a serious issue that needs to be addressed by adopting appropriate policies. We investigate the possible reasons of the remarkable stability of FLFP in a top-reforming upper-middle income country. Our goal is to in disentangle the different forces at work and to draw useful lessons for the design of participation-enhancing policies. Using data from a nationally representative Household Survey covering the period 2003-2015, we employ Blinder-Oaxaca (Blinder, 1973 and Oaxaca, 1973) type decomposition to decompose changes over time in FLFP levels into parts that are due to changes in observable factors versus changes in the strength of impact of these factors. This allows us to identify possible shifters of the FLFP rate and propose areas of special interest for policy making. We show that the stability of FLFP in Georgia during the period 2003-2013 is due to offsetting socio-economic changes taking place in the country, and that the increase in the last period covered by our dataset – 2013-2015 – can be attributed to the emergence of new labor opportunities for women. We conclude that, while useful, supply-side economic reforms are not sufficient to increase FLFP and need to be complemented by demand-side policies aiming at creating more and better work opportunities for women.
P21|Planning and opportunism|The paper analyzes the occurrence of opportunistic behaviour opportunities in the planning processes. The following types of planning are distinguished: self-planning, collective planning, planning on behalf (or by contract), and directive (or prescriptive) planning. It is shown that any type of it excluding self-planning generates incentives to opportunistic behavior. Within this framework, two popular approaches in the planning theory are analyzed: participative planning and communicative one; it is shown that they are open to opportunism too. Basing on this analysis, the spheres of economy where government planning can be more efficient than market coordination mechanism are outlined.
P21|Comparison of Chinese reform experience with other transition economies (in the example of Russia)|China and Russia were two most important communist countries of 20th century which decided to have transition towards a more liberal market economy. China followed a gradual reform strategy while Russia followed a rapid one. This paper analyses the reasons why China’s transition experience was much more successful when compared to Russia. Paper concludes that initial conditions of the economies, the strategies chosen and some external factors such as political situation played important role in the outcome of the reforms.
P21|Разработка стратегий социально-экономического развития: наука vs идеология<BR>[Designing the Strategies for Socio-Economic Development: Science vs. Ideology]|"Strategies for socio-economic development in ""catching-up"" countries are designed on the basis of ideologies dominated in the society and, as a rule, fail. Until recently, economic science could not offer an alternative basis for designing strategies, but over the past twenty years the situation has changed. Nevertheless, scientific results are still weakly demanded by society. In this paper, the conflict between economics and dominant ideology is explored. On the one hand, ideology restrains the development of scientific research, and on the other hand it is changing under their influence. However, these changes are very slow for a number of reasons, analyzed in the paper. Ideology is inevitably connected with the interests of economic agents. The old elite prevents the emergence of a new ideology, since new concepts reveal the mistakes of past projects. In addition, the implementation of new ideas may require institutional changes that weaken the power of existing high-ranking officials. Meanwhile, in modern societies there are no regular mechanisms providing such transformations, and the probability of rational volitional decisions, which confront the dominant ideology, is small."
P21|Други Канон И Маршалов План Као Модел Економске Политике<BR>[Other Canon and Marshall’s Plan as a Model of Economic Policy]|Serbian: Разматрају се основне карактеристике Маршаловог плана као типа економске политике. За разлику од политике саморегулишућег тржишта, која је заснована на (нео)либералној теорији и представљена Вашингтонским договором, политика маршаловског типа, активног уплива државе у привредне токове, заснована је на многовековној традицији и представљена Другим каноном. Обе врсте политика могу се историјски пратити до времена физиократа и меркантилиста, али у савременим условима потпуно адекватно могу да буду представљене плановима Моргентауа и Маршала, насталим за и примењеним у Немачкој после Другог светског рата. Моргентауов план одговара (нео)либералној политици и резултира деиндустриализацијом земље, док Маршалов план насупрот томе одговара политици Другог канона и резултира индустријализацијом земље. Из тих карактеристика следи да транзиционе земље за своје привреде треба да примене економску политику оваплоћену у Маршаловом плану. English: The paper considers the main characteristics of Marshall’s plan as an economic policy model. Unlike the self-regulating market policy, which is based on the neo-liberal policy and defined by the Washington Consensus, the Marshall-type policy, with its active state interference in economic processes, is based on the many centuries’ tradition and reflected in the Other Canon. Both policy types can be traced to the times of physiocrats and mercantilists, but in present circumstances they can be represented through Morgenthau Plan and Marshall Plan, originated after the World War Two and applied in Germany. Morgenthau’s Plan corresponds to the neoliberal policy and its consequence is the country deindustrialization, while Marshall’s Plan corresponds to the Other Canon policy and results in industrialization. Therefore, we deduce that transition countries need to apply the economic policy incorporated in Marshall Plan in order to develop their economies.
P21|Half-Forgotten Personalities of Economic Thought - O. R. Lange|O. R. Lange, a Polish economist, statistician, econometrician, sociologist, politician and diplomat was classified as a reformist Marxist. He became famous for studies on planning and socialist economies. Lange demonstrates and proves the possibility of the existence of an effective socialist system. He also analyzed capitalist economy, e.g., the issue of cyclical fluctuations and unemployment.
P21|Economic Crimes in the Shortage Economy|Rational agents react on the incentives in the market economy as well as in the centrally planned economy. Economic laws are persistent regardless the economic system. Legislative system changes the outcome of the game between economic agents and managers. Base on the original survey among former managers as well as on the legislative sources from the 1970?s and 1980?s the taxonomy of economic reactions on the shortage economy was made. We distinguish plan manipulation in order to ensure payment bonuses; bribery in order to gain the short-supplied inputs and reserves? creation for the purpose of the fulfilling the plan. It was shown, that if the rational agent wanted to obey the higher law, he was forced to ignore lower legislation.
P21|Adaptation assessment and analysis of economic growth since the market reform in China|China has experienced extraordinary institutional and socio-economic changes after 1978, and its deepening reform to market-oriented economy since 1990s was also recognized as one the most significant factors to drive China's rise in the contemporary world. Although many aspects of China's market reform have been extensively analysed in the literature, specific attention on the adaptation of economic growth to this reform has been relatively ignored. To fill this gap, this research adopts the extenics assessment method to assess this adaptation and applies the membership function coordination degree model to analyse the sustainability of such adaptation. In conclusion, China has demonstrated a significantly enhanced adaptation capacity at the expense of coordination, which requires to be further emphasised in its economic growth adaptation strategies.
P21|Neoliberalism, Urbanization and Change in Africa|"In the much of the popular media, the discourse around Africa has changed. Whereas stories of the ""coming anarchy"" or the ""hopeless continent"" abounded a little over a decade ago, it was, until the recent collapse in commodity prices, increasingly seen as the final global investment frontier, with rapid uptake of cellular technology and economic growth. Although much of this growth has been propelled by natural resources, the current conjuncture offers opportunities as well as challenges for African urban areas and raises questions about the role of cities in the continent's future development as they continue to become more deeply informalised. The response of many city authorities to the deepening informalisation of their economies has been to try to connect to the global economy in new ways, through the creation of new financial service, high-tech and elite residential areas. In this paper we explore these developments through the Foucaudian lens of heterotopia. These new developments attempt to erase their associations with the cities from which they originate in favour of new connections outwards. However the creation of these new enclaves is filled with socio-spatial contradictions, which make them unlikely to achieve their ostensible objectives."
P21|The Arab and Post-Communist Transitions: Similarities, Differences, and Common Lessons|At the onset of the mass protests in 2010–2011, many politicians and experts suggested that Arab countries could learn from the experiences of the post-communist transition of the early 1990s. However, the geopolitical, historical, and socio-economic context of the Arab transition was different in many respects from that of the former Soviet bloc countries 20 years earlier. These differences became even more obvious five years later, in early 2016, when most Arab transition attempts ended either in a new wave of authoritarianism, or protracted bloody conflicts. Nonetheless, there are some common lessons to be learnt from the history of both transitions. They concern interrelations between the political and economic transition, the role of institutional checks and balances and the rule of law, the speed of reforms, the dangers of ethnic and sectarian conflicts, and the role of external support.
P21|Dugoročne Posledice Ekonomskog Sloma Privrede Srbije Tokom 90-Ih Godina 20-Og Veka (Long Run Consequences Of Economic Collapse Of Serbian Economy During The Nineties Of The 20th Century)|U radu se istražuju uticaj ekonomskog kraha tokom 90 ih godina na nivo razvijenosti privrede Srbije u dugom roku. U tom cilju procenjena je dinamika potencijalnog BDP u periodu 1989-2015. godina i analiziran njegov odnos prema stvarnom BDP. Tokom 90-ih godina potencijalni BDP je opao za oko 40% što implicira da su u tom periodu dugoročno smanjene proizvodne mogućnosti privrede Srbije. Potencijalni BDP je tokom 90-ih godina opao prvenstveno usled obezvređivanja kapitala do koga je došlo zbog izrazito niskih investicija u periodu od skoro jedne decenije. Investicije su tokom 90-ih godina iznosile 12-14% BDP, dok su za održavanje kapitala na konstantnom nivou bile potrebne investicije od 17-18% BDP. Nizak nivo investicija, a time i pad potencijalnog BDP, najvećim delom je posledica sankcija koje su različitim intenzitetom trajale skoro jednu deceniju. Određeni ali znatno manji uticaj na pad potencijalnog BDP imale su greške u ekonomskoj politici i NATO bombardovanje. Nakon 2000. godine pad potencijalnog BDP se najpre znatno usporava, da bi u periodu 2004-2008 došlo do njegovog rasta čemu su doprinele relativno visoke investicije. U periodu 2008-2015. potencijalni BDP stagnira i približno je jednak nivou stvarnog BDP. Dobijeni rezultati ukazuju na to da je ekonomski krah tokom 90-ih godina najvažniji uzrok sadašnjeg nižeg nivoa razvijenosti Srbije u odnosu na druge zemlje Centralne Evrope, a ne reforme i ekonomske politike nakon 2000. godine. Približna jednakost potencijalnog i stvarnog BDP nakon 2007. godine implicira da se rast može generisati visokim investicijama, kojima bi se povećao potencijalni BDP, a ne ekspanzivnom fiskalnom i monetarnom politikom i povećanjem domaće tražnje.
P21|Foundations of the Soviet Command Economy, 1917 to 1941|In a command economy, centralized political priorities take precedence over market equilibrium, and government purchases cannot be refused. This chapter describes the antecedents, origins, evolution, and outcomes of the Soviet command economy from the Bolshevik Revolution to World War II. The Soviet command economy was built in two phases, 1917 to 1920, and 1928 onward, with a ‘breathing space’ between. The present account gives prominence to features of a command economy that, while missing from the first phase, were developed during the breathing space, and then helped to ensure the relative success of the second phase. These were features that assured secrecy, security, and the selection of economic officials for competence and party loyalty. Like any economy in the international system, the command economy had a comparative advantage: the production of economic and military power.
P21|Evaluating Transformation Process In Central Asian Turkic Republics In Terms Of Privatization And Economic Freedom On 25th Anniversary Of The Transition|“Transition economies” phrase , covering various countries as well as Caucasus and Central Asian Turkic Republics, was found its place in the literature by the 1980’s and this transformation process from the centrally planned economy to market economy was analyzed with economic and fiscal dimensions. Without any doubt, the transition process of these countries wouldn’t be easy and exhibits differences, especially for the Central Asian Turkic Republics, as they were governed under the command economy over many years. Related studies is put forward the increasing importance and future predictions within this scope. Two of the most economical and fiscal prosperity indicators of the transition economies are reconstruction of government and privatization implementations. In this context, after literature review analyzing the privatization implementations and the level of economic freedom indexes related to reconstruction of government by many dimensions under seminal international databases are crucial for that countries. With this study, after literature review , on the 25th year of the transition of Caucasus and Central Asian Turkic Republics, in 2016, reconstruction of government and privatization implementations are examined both in fiscal and economically and will be analyzed by many dimensions under seminal international databases . Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan are not only the prosperous countries in this respect but also have outstanding mining and underground resources. We also reach that the reform process of transition and the prosperity of economic indicators have not been strongly correlated.
P21|Comparing Chinese and Indian Banks and their Socialist versus Capitalist Reforms|Chinese and Indian banks have developed unique characteristics due to their distinctive reform paths and political regimes, yet they share attributes in common with banks of other emerging nations. After decades of reforms, banking systems in both countries remain relatively isolated and protected due to severe governmental interventions and strict policy directives. These limitations and drawbacks are in sharp contrast to China and India’s present economic status, trade openness, and growth trajectories. This article describes the current status, strengths and weaknesses of Chinese and Indian banks; compares their commonalities and differences side-by-side; and traces banking developments and financial reforms to their particular socialist vs. capitalist political roots. Currently financial reforms are advancing in both countries with an aim to stimulate economic growth, yet their banks are burdened with rising bad debt and nonperforming loans. These article further addresses challenges of these banks and their policy implications
P21|China's interregional capital mobility: A spatial econometric estimation|Free interregional mobility of capital refers to the efficiency of resource allocation. Using a general spatial autocorrelation model that extends the traditional Feldstein–Horioka (FH) test, we analyze Chinese provincial data for the periods before and after 1993, and show that the FH coefficients differ to those in the existing literature. During China's period of reform and opening up between 1979 and 1992, the FH coefficient is significantly negative or not statistically significant. However, for the period after 1994, the FH coefficient is significantly higher than that shown in prior studies. This study explains this phenomenon from the perspective of Chinese-style decentralization. The FH test is an indirect method of showing regional capital mobility. Therefore, we need some form of direct measurement. Thus, we use the rate of the proportional change in physical capital stock as a proxy variable to demonstrate capital mobility directly, and use it to analyze various factors affecting Chinese provincial capital mobility. When investigating these factors, and to establish a realistic foundation on which the spatial effects take place, we devise four spatial weight matrices from the perspectives of geographical features and economic characteristics. Lastly, in order to promote regional capital mobility in China, the Chinese central government needs to take urgent measures to change local governments' strong preferences for GDP under the pressure of political promotion.
P21|Religious origins of democracy & dictatorship|Weber considered the Protestant work ethic the foundation of modern capitalism. I extend Weber's theory by arguing that states with predominantly Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Muslim populations have had a stronger inclination toward underdevelopment and dictatorship than states with Protestant or Jewish majorities. This is the case because their respective religious collectives (monastery, tariqa) promote the hierarchical provision of common goods at the expense of market incentives. I define the aforementioned three religions as collectivist, in contrast to Protestantism and Judaism, which I define as individualist. I provide a historical overview that designates the Jewish kibbutz as the collective of democracy and the Eastern Orthodox monastery as the collective of dictatorship. Focusing on collectivist economies, I find that modernization, as a credible commitment to the improved future provision of public goods, occurs when the threat of a radical government is imminent and when the leader has high extraction of rents from the economy. The emergence of radical governments is more likely in collectivist than in individualist economies. Historical illustrations from collectivist economies include the Russian Revolution, the Islamic Revolution in Iran, and the postwar welfare state in Western Europe.

P21|Incentive contract or tenure reform? Understanding the transition of forest resources management in China|Purpose - – China’s government has been facing a trade-off in choosing between tenure reform and forest concessions to manage forest resources. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the government’s policy choices can be affected by environmental benefits and the economic value of forests. Design/methodology/approach - – We build a simple theoretical model and employ province-level data. Findings - – The results show that the government will allocate less forestland to local people if environmental concerns are more important and privatize less forest if the economic benefits from forest are higher. Social implications - – Therefore, the transformation of forest management policies reflects not only the government’s own preferences but also its gradual adjustment to the changing market and institutional environment. Originality/value - – The present paper provides a regulation approach that complements the growing literature on forest resource management.
P21|Decline and Growth in Transition Economies: A Meta-Analysis|Immediately after the collapse of socialism, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union fell into a serious economic crisis, after which they experienced a gradual recovery. Therefore, without exception, these countries followed a J-curved growth path. However, there were marked differences among them in the length and depth of the crisis and the speed of recovery. In this paper, we perform a comparative meta-analysis of the effect size and statistical significance of structural change, transformation policy, the legacy of socialism, inflation, and regional conflict in order to elucidate the mechanism that generated the J-shaped trajectory in transition economies. The meta-synthesis, which employs 3,279 estimates drawn from 123 previous studies, revealed that while the growth-enhancing effects of structural change and transformation policy were small yet significant, inflation and regional conflict had a highly significant and strongly negative effect on output. In addition, the legacy of socialism might exacerbate the decline in production in the early stages of transition. The meta-regression analysis that simultaneously controls for various research conditions and the assessment of publication selection bias provides supporting evidence for the results obtained from the meta-synthesis.

P21|Circumstances, Intents, Hardships and Risks when Transiting from a Production-Led Economy to one Focused on Consumer|Chinese economy has grown rapidly and substantially for decades, without facing a serious crisis or destabilization and without suffering a correction, but this doesnâ€™t mean that it has definitely avoided corrections. On the contrary, it might signify that a correction is possible anytime, risking to be the harsher the later it happens. Chinaâ€™s numerous achievements are undeniable, but some of the very mechanisms that have nourished its successes â€“ mainly the distorted price system (relying on controlled, low prices for labour, capital, energy, land, natural resources, national currency, zero pollution costs, etc.) â€“ are the ones which now hinder its further modernization and growth dynamism. Excessively forced to grow very fast, Chinese economy developed structural imbalances and economic bubbles in almost each of its systems. This paper looks at some of the most dangerous economic bubbles and their linkage, as well as at the challenges and risks posed by the Chinese economy transition from export-and-production-led growth, to consumption-driven development.
P21|Economic reforms and industrial policy in a panel of Chinese cities|Abstract We study the effect of place-based industrial policy on economic development, focusing on the establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZ) in China. We use data from a panel of Chinese (prefecture-level) cities from 1988 to 2010. Our difference-in-difference estimation exploits the variation in the establishment of SEZ across time and space. We find that the establishment of a state-level SEZ is associated with an increase in the level of GDP of about 20 %. This finding is confirmed with alternative specifications and in a sub-sample of inland provinces, where the selection of cities to host the zones was based on administrative criteria. The main channel is a positive effect on physical capital accumulation, although SEZ also have a positive effect on total factor productivity and human capital investments. We also investigate whether there are spillover effects of SEZ on neighboring regions or cities further away. We find positive and often significant spillover effects.

P21|Cuba's Agricultural Transition and Food Security in a Global Perspective|"This paper reviews the situation in the agricultural sector and food security in Cuba, and particularly the transformations that have (not) taken place since 1990. We compare the Cuban transition with transitions in other ""transition countries"" and show that Cuba does not easily fit into one of the transition patterns, and, in a way, has characteristics of ""a bit of everything"". To conclude, we discuss the (potential) effects of the recent policy changes and the new economic reforms that were announced."
P21|Learning Dynamics and Support for Economic Reforms: Why Good News Can Be Bad|Support for economic reforms has often shown puzzling dynamics: many reforms that began successfully lost public support. We show that learning dynamics can rationalize this paradox because the process of revealing reform outcomes is an example of sampling without replacement. We show that this concept challenges the conventional wisdom that one should begin by revealing reform winners. It may also lead to situations in which reforms that enjoy both ex ante and ex post majority support will still not come to completion. We use our framework to explain why gradual reforms worked well in China (where successes in Special Economic Zones facilitated further reform), whereas this was much less the case for Latin American and Central and Eastern European countries.
P21|Институты Догоняющего Развития<BR>[Institutions of Catching-up Development]|"It is shown that the institutional trajectories of catching-up development in successful countries contained similar interim institutions; this similarity is explained by common technological, institutional and cultural constraints that should be taken into account and to overcome. Corporatism, indicative planning, the presence of the ""main"" development agencies with broad powers, maintaining an undervalued exchange rate - due to these and a number of other mechanisms, countries of economic miracle were able to initiate and maintain rapid growth, despite low level of human capital, underdevelopment of civic culture, and market failures. Institutes of catching-up development contributed to the formation of collaborative relationships between the government, business and society. They softened the existed constraints, and they itself were gradually modified to ensure the transition to modern democracy with effective market economy. The analysis allows to outline а plan of institutional reform , taking into account the institutional particularities of Russia. The principles of the administrative reform are considered. The problem of the formation of a hybrid national planning system is formulated, which includes indicative planning and program budgeting. To finance the planned projects, it is offered a mix of public-private partnership and project financing. It is proposed to use the Japanese experience of stimulating temporary association of companies for the development of modernization projects. The principles of reforming of the state property governance, as well as education and science sectors are discussed."

P21|Half-Forgotten Personalities of Economic Thought - M. I. Tugan-Baranovsky|M. I. Tugan-Baranovsky was a Russian-Ukrainian economist, scientist, policy maker and journalist. He promoted the ideas of co-operativism. He tried to describe an eclectic synthesis of the marginal utility theory and the value theory of D. Ricardo and K. H. Marx. He is famous for the business cycle theory and he belongs among the best-known Russian economists.
P21|Half-Forgotten Personalities of Economic Thought - M. Kalecki|Michał Kalecki was an original Polish economist, who is ranked among unorthodox Marxists. He focused mainly on issues of macroeconomic dynamics. He created the dynamic theory of effective demand, in which he overtook the more familiar concept of J. M. Keynes. Kalecki influenced many diverse economists, including, e.g., the first generation of post-Keynesian economics.
P21|Analýza vývoje ekonomické kondice a efektivnosti privatizačního procesu bank v České republice<BR>[Analysis of the Development of the Economic Condition and Efficiency of the Privatization Process of Banks in the Czech Republic]|Banks which underwent the privatization process in the Czech Republic, i.e. Česká Spořitelna, a.s., Československá Obchodní Banka, a.s., Investiční a Poštovní Banka, a.s., Komerční Banka, a.s., Živnostenská Banka, a.s., have been very widely discussed by both professional and lay public from several perspectives. Namely, what the actual economic condition of these banks was on the date of completion of the privatization, as well as the transfer of graded loans, or rather lowperforming assets, which the state took over and reimbursed to the banks through consolidation institutions (hereinafter CI), and all this obviously in relation to the purchase price obtained within the scope of privatization. The aim of this article, within the possibilities stipulated by its scope, is: 1) To analyse the development of the banks' economic condition in the time interval of 1990-2010; 2) To identify factors that determine the volume of income from the sale of the state's investments in privatized banks; 3) To confirm or refute the hypothesis that the bank rescues before the completion of the privatization process were excessive; 4) To analyse the overall balance of the privatization process, or rather the efficiency of the sale of the banks; 5) To test the practical applicability of the economic theories connected to the issue in question. With regard to the above, the article is structured in the following manner. Firstly, literary research of articles on the theme of The Privatization Of Commercial Banking in reputable economic impact magazines is processed. This is followed by the actual economic analysis of the privatized banks in the Czech Republic, where economic parameters are examined in an interval of approximately 20 years - total assets, costs, revenue, profit, capital adequacy, etc. The conclusion firstly evaluates the development of the economic condition, then identifies factors that determine the volume of income from privatization, the excessiveness of the banks' rescue, the overall balance of the privatization process, and the practical applicability of the economic theories in question.

The author comes to the reasonable conclusion that these problems are due primarily to the incompleteness of the reforms. Reflections on the book by FI Khusainova lead to the conclusion that the prospect of a long-term effective development of not only the rail industry but also the entire Russian economy lies in the deepening of market reforms and the development of market institutions.
P21|Механизмы формирования стратегических приоритетов со- циально-экономического развития. The mechanisms of formation of strategic socio-economic priorities|Целью статьи является определение методов и способов выработки приоритетов социально-экономического развития, применяемых на федеральном уровне. Исходными данными для исследования явились документы стратегического планирования, а также указы, постановления и распоряжения органов исполнительной власти Российской Федерации и субъектов Российской Федерации, определяющие стратегические приоритеты социально-экономического развития в 20-летний период. На основе проведенного содержательного анализа нормативной правовой базы Российской Федерации определен термин «приоритеты социально-экономического развития» и аналогичные понятия, а также подходы к их формированию. Проведенный обзор приоритетов в составе документов стратегического планирования позволил провести типологизацию приоритетов социально-экономического развития Российской Федерации. Авторы определили механизм формирования приоритетов под воздействием основных эндогенных (внешнеэкономические, внешнеполитические, миграционные и пр.) и экзогенных (интересы бизнеса, населения, региональных властей) факторов, который может быть рекомендован для учета при подготовке документов стратегического планирования федерального уровня. The article is devoted to definition of methods and techniques to identify priorities of socio-economic development, applicable at the Federal level. The initial data for the study was strategic planning documents, as well as the decrees, resolutions and orders of the Executive authorities of the Russian Federation and of constituent entities of the Russian Federation, defining the strategic priorities of socio-economic development in the 20-year period. The article presents the defining the term ‘priorities of economic and development’ and the approaches to their formation, which are represented at Russia’s normative acts and other federal documents. The content analysis of priorities in the strategic planning documents has allowed drawing the typology of economic and social development priorities of the Russian Federation. The authors determined the mechanism of creating the priorities under the influence of main endogenous (foreign trade, foreign policy, macro, etc.) and exogenous (the interests of business, communities, regional authorities) factors which could be recommended for consideration at the strategy developing process at federal level.
P21|Are distortions good for development? Structural transformations and cotton in Uzbekistan|Agriculture is at the origin of all economic activities and thus obtains a notable position in growth theory. The contribution of primary sector to long-term economic development has given space to asymmetrical positions. In the current context of globalized markets and downsized states, Uzbekistan is incontestably an exceptional case-study, applying distortive measures to its economy, and to agricultural sector in particular, to actively shape its comparative advantages. With reference to the cotton sector taxation in Uzbekistan, this analysis proposes to shed light on the implications of the main theoretical arguments around distortions. It will investigate the Ã¬circular cumulative and interactive processÃ® produced and how it is being a driver of structural transformation, to exploit economies of scale and transfer capital investments for heavy industry, concluding that distortion can actually be instrumental for development.
P21|Relationship between past experience, social network participation and creative capacity: Vietnamese entrepreneurship survey|The notions of entrepreneurship and creativity in developed economies, despite having gained attention among researchers, remain embryonic in numerous emerging economies. Being focused on entrepreneurs in a typical transitional and emerging market economy, Vietnam, this paper aims to empirically explore the influence that past entrepreneurial efforts may exert on the perceptions of entrepreneurs about their own creativity performance. The study also seeks to understand how entrepreneurs social networks contribute to perceived creativity capacity by entrepreneurs who participate in those societies. The empirical research results suggest that entrepreneurs with business experience and active networking engagement are more likely to believe in their own creativity. This knowledge and insights in turn offer some implications for addressing the lack of radical creativity among Vietnamese entrepreneurs.
P21|Las cooperativas no agropecuarias y la transformación económica en Cuba: políticas, procesos y estrategias<BR>[Non-agricultural co-operatives and economy trasformation in Cuba: Politics processes and estrategies]|La contribución de las cooperativas se ha puesto en evidencia desde la década del 70 como principal línea de desarrollo en la producción agropecuaria de Cuba. En contraste, el reconocimiento de las cooperativas urbanas ha sido tardío, aun cuando fuese percibida la necesidad de transformaciones basadas en la realización de la propiedad en diversos escenarios territoriales. El artículo analiza los procesos de reforma impulsados en Cuba desde la primera década de 2000 centrándose en las iniciativas tendientes a la promoción, constitución y desempeño de las cooperativas no agropecuarias (CNA). Se examina el potencial y limitaciones propias de las experiencias recientes para reflexionar sobre los procesos y transformaciones organizacionales desde la perspectiva de sus miembros. A modo de conclusión el análisis plantea interrogantes acerca de la aptitud de estas cooperativas para sustraerse del impacto de circunstancias anteriores y sobre su capacidad para consolidar estrategias diseñadas por los cooperadores que tiendan a fortalecer los principios de adhesión voluntaria y autonomía en que se fundan estas organizaciones.
P21|The Link between Manufacturing Growth and Accelerated Services Growth in India|The impact of trade liberalization on manufacturing growth has been widely studied in the literature. What has gone unappreciated is that accelerated manufacturing growth has also been accompanied by accelerated services growth. Using firm-level data from India, we find a positive spillover from manufacturing growth to gross value added, wages, employment, and worker productivity in services, especially in large urban firms and in service sectors whose output is used as a manufacturing input.
P21|Reassessing the Economic Effects of Post-Socialist Constitutions Using the Synthetic Control Method|In response to the problems of endogeneity and causality in comparative studies with relatively small sample sizes, a new statistical approach has recently been developed, called the synthetic control method. In this paper we apply this method to reassess the effect of constitution-making in post-socialist countries of Europe and Asia on performance of these countries in the field of economic reforms during the post-1989 transition. We first verify the existence of such effects and evaluate their statistical significance. Then we search for the explanation of these effects and their magnitude focusing on the characteristics of these constitutions and the solutions that they envisage (structural provisions, bills of rights and enforcement mechanisms). Thanks to employing this approach we are able to avoid several technical caveats that have arisen in earlier studies and verify the validity of their conclusions. In addition, we obtain country-specific results for each individual post-socialist state, as well as formulate detailed insights regarding the actual mechanisms or channels of influence of the constitutional framework on economic reforms.
P21|Post-Socialist Constitutions: The De Jure - De Facto Gap, Its Effects and Determinants|In this paper we aim to contribute to the debate on constitutional rules and their economic effects by extending the focus to the de jure – de facto constitutional gap. Firstly, we provide evidence that the size of this gap matters as non-compliance lowers the effectiveness of the constitutional commitment mechanism. Secondly, we identify several explanans of this gap, in particular relating to the democratization process, political conflict, age and comprehensiveness of the constitution. We base the conclusions on an empirical study for the unique setting of the post-socialist countries of Europe and Asia, which all enacted new constitutional frameworks after 1989, and argue that the constitutions in these countries acted primarily as blueprints.
P21|De jure and de facto institutions – disentangling the interrelationships|In this paper we contribute to the debate on the nature of institutions and their economic effects by extending the focus to the de jure – de facto institutional distinction. Firstly, we define and conceptualize de facto institutions, as well as elaborate on their place in the broad institutional system and identification. Then we investigate the possible interrelationships between de facto and de jure institutions. Finally, we make a link between these interrelationships and economic outcomes. In this way the paper fills an underexploited niche in institutional research, which is a major background for law and economics.
P21|Changing Fortunes during Economic Transition - Low-Wage Persistence before and after German Unification|This paper studies whether the transition from a centrally planned to a market economy offers fundamentally new perspectives for those who, in economic terms, were relatively deprived under the old regime. Previous empirical research on this question has been limited by the availability of suitable representative longitudinal micro-data that tracks individuals' labour market careers across different political and economic regimes. Our study seeks to fill this research gap by looking at the transition of Eastern Germany following German Unification. Using a unique large-scale German administrative data set, we measure individuals' relative economic position by exploiting information on whether individuals were in the bottom of the pre-unification wage distribution. We further approach the question of how workers' low or high-wage status determines their wage and labour market status within and across different regimes. We first demonstrate that unobserved factors are the main drivers of low-wage persistence and are regime-dependent. We further show that, consistent with signalling considerations, economic dependencies across different regimes are only of minor relevance. Genuine state dependence after Unification amounts to relatively large values of about 15 per cent for males and 19 per cent for females. This measure of persistence is heterogeneous across time, indicating a strong adjustment process and the importance of signalling considerations.
P21|Russia's Legal Transitions: Marxist Theory, Neoclassical Economics and the Rule of Law|We review the role of economic theory in shaping the process of legal change in Russia during the two transitions it experienced during the course of the twentieth century: the transition to a socialist economy organised along the lines of state ownership of the means of production in the 1920s, and the transition to a market economy which occurred after the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s. Despite differences in methodology and in policy implications, Marxist theory, dominant in the 1920s, and neoclassical economics, dominant in the 1990s, offered a similarly reductive account of law as subservient to wider economic forces. In both cases, the subordinate place accorded to law undermined the transition process. Although path dependence and history are frequently invoked to explain the limited development of the rule of law in Russia during the 1990s, policy choices driven by a deterministic conception of law and economics also played a role.
P21|A model of sequential reforms and economic convergence: The case of China|Motivated by China's experience, a growth model is developed to explain the repeated interaction between economic reforms and growth in a developing country. Convergence occurs until the developing country reaches a bottleneck, then convergence stops unless the institution is improved. After the reform, convergence resumes until a new bottleneck is encountered, which triggers another reform, and so on. Using recursive methods, I show analytically that, in a perfect international credit market, each reform occurs when the new growth bottleneck just becomes binding; the reform size changes monotonically over time; there are finite reforms and convergence is unceasing until the last constraint binds, so a permanent GDP gap may exist. The model also implies that a politically more powerful government should adopt more gradual reforms. In an imperfect credit market, convergence can be delayed and an initially richer economy can be more likely to adopt insufficient reforms.
P21|What determines the market share of investment banks in Chinese domestic IPOs?|In this paper, we empirically examine how government forces vis-à-vis market forces have affected the market share of investment banks in Chinese domestic IPOs over the period 1995–2010. Before 2005, only political connections significantly positively influenced the market share of investment banks. After 2005, the effect of political connections declined, while a low evaluation standard on IPO candidates and low underwriting fees now also significantly enhance market share. We explain these findings by the pro-competitive, yet partial changes that were introduced in the regulatory framework for IPOs, thereby emphasizing the need for a delicate policy coordination in marketization reforms.
P21|Reported Utility Service Satisfaction: The Case of Electricity in Transition Economies|Since the end of the Soviet Union, the power sector in the countries resulting from its disintegration has evolved from a context of central planning towards independent regulation. There is great heterogeneity in reform progress in transition countries, with consequences to service quality and prices in utilities and also the view the population has of such services. This paper conducts an overview of the modern power sector in transition economies and analyses drivers of reported household satisfaction with the quality of electricity services in 27 countries using cross-sectional survey data from the EBRD Life in Transition Survey II, in a context of improving regulatory and infrastructural frameworks, using an ordinal random effects model with a probit link function. Key drivers of reported satisfaction are the uses of electricity within the household and some characteristics such as age, economic conditions and general life satisfaction. However, there is no evidence of the effect of power sector reform on the opinion of households. This points that the general life experience in transition can be the key driver of how households feel about utilities, as reform brings conflicting effects that stem from increasing cost sustainability, competition, transparency and quality of the service.
P21|Foreign Direct Investment In North Korea And The Effect Of Special Economic Zones: Learning From Transition Economies|This study analyzes critical factors that foreign investors would consider before investing in North Korea by empirically analyzing key FDI determinants in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union (i.e., transition economies) and juxtaposing these results against North Korea¡¯s main investment hurdles and pull factors in order to suggest a way forward. For the empirical study, a fixed effect model is employed based on the panel data of all the transition economies through their entire transition periods. The analysis suggests that the special economic zones in the Visegrad countries could provide a relevant benchmark for North Korea.
P21|Kína: a tervgazdaságtól a modern bankrendszerig|Az elmúlt évtizedekben a gazdasági növekedés ütemét meghaladva, rendkívül gyors ütemben növekedett Kínában a banki aktivitás, melynek eredményeként mára nemzetközi léptékekben is óriási bankok alakultak ki. Az erõs állami kontroll ellenére a kínai bankok az utóbbi évtizedekben egyre inkább nyitottak a kereskedelem és a nemzetközi pénzpiacok felé, a szabályozói környezet rendellenességei miatt azonban az árnyékbankrendszer elterjedése a jelenlegi kínai pénzügyi rendszer egyik legnagyobb kockázati tényezõjévé vált, és elõretekintve érdemi instabilitást jelenthet. Az elmúlt pár évben a kínai növekedés egyre kiegyensúlyozatlanabbá vált, melyben hatalmas szerepe volt a bankrendszernek. A fogyasztás rendkívül alacsony GDP-részesedése mellett a beruházások példátlanul magas aránya felveti annak a kockázatát, hogy a beruházások túlzott mértékûek és fölösleges extra kapacitás kiépüléséhez járulnak hozzá, melyek végül hosszú távon nem vezetnek fenntartható növekedéshez, és a beruházások nem térülnek meg. A beruházások felfutásával párhuzamosan a hitelek állománya is növekedett, aminek tekintélyes része nem a hagyományos bankrendszerben ment végbe, így a fenti folyamatok könnyen nemteljesítõ adósságok felhalmozódásához és pénzügyi pánikhoz is vezethetnek, ami a gazdasági növekedés hirtelen lassulásával járna.
P21|From Strategic Companies to Companies with the Objective Function of Ownership|The existing approach to the process of privatization in Russia suggests special procedure of privatization of major state enterprises, which produce goods of strategic importance for defensive potential and security of the state, protection of public morals, health, rights, and legally protected interests of the citizens of the Russian Federation. At the same time, the state sector of economy includes significant number of medium-sized enterprises having unique experience, technologies, and qualified personnel to provide special functions for the economy. In order to improve efficiency of the Russian economy, to mitigate risks of loss of technologies and special competencies, such enterprises have to be identified. The list of enterprises with specific procedure of privatization should be created based on the criteria of fulfillment of special functions in the economy and promoting of critical technologies.
P21|Managerial Paradoxes of Reform in Russian University Sector|The article discusses the complex of anomalous effects that were the result of failed reforms in the higher education of Russia. The author showed the paradoxes that arose in the process of introducing the unified state exam, systems of testing and distance learning, state standards and regulations in terms of research, publications and citations. It was shown a devastating effect on universities from inadequate policy for the appointment of rectors and their remuneration. The paper discusses the problems of escalated confrontation between the administrative staff of universities and professors, addressing the challenges of availability of education and syndrome of shifting the responsibility from top down. The discussed effects are accompanied by stylized examples.
P21|On the Formation of National Planning System in Russia|"We propose to distinguish between two ""ideal"" types of national planning: the universal and the program planning. The first is aimed at accelerating the balanced development of industries and regions through large-scale investment projects; it requires a hierarchy of specialized planning institutions. The second uses a relatively small number of programs aimed at addressing key economic problems. These programs are worked out by the ministries and agencies, which are also engaged in the current management. In developing countries, national planning tends to be the first type, and in the developed ones, it tends to be the second. In Russia, elements of both types of systems have spontaneously arisen. From them, it is necessary to form a mixed system that would be adequate to the Russian level of development. Its contours are discussed in the paper."
P21|The Role of Foreign Participation in Soviet Industrialization: An Institutional View|The foreign participation in USSR industrialization is considered to be a factor of institutional development of Soviet society. The paper considers the intellectual contribution of foreign specialists in the creation of important industrial projects. Foreign businessmen and specialists had considerable difficulties in their activity under influence of hostile institutional environment. Nevertheless, their professional success demonstrated the advantages of capitalism and conduced to dangerous spread of capitalist values into working class consciousness. Using repressions and propaganda, communist leaders institutionalized isolationism, i.e. watchful attitude to Western countries and belief in ability to solve any economic problem relying upon internal resources.
P21|(Former) Informal Networks As A Reflection Of Informal Institutions In East European Transitional Societies: Legacy Or Opportunism?|Only recently has the influence of culture on economic development been increasingly discussed among theoretical economists. Besides observing culture through cultural traditions inherited from ancestors, current social interactions are also considered as an influential factor. Over a long period of time, the research on East European transitional societies has been focused on formal institutions. Throughout that period, informal networks, many of which originated from the previous socio-political system, have mostly strengthened their position in the society and gained power in the formal structures. They helped in building the new capitalist states and therewith had positive effects by speeding up the transition process. Yet, in medium and long term, their activities typically resulted in state capture. This paper explores the persistence of tight informal and mostly inefficient formal business-government-society relations in Eastern Europe. It emphasises the influence of informal networks in the interaction of formal and informal institutions, and questions the possibility of new generations to make a turnaround in the functioning of the networks. Newly emerging social interactions are contextualised in the cultural dimensions: Power Distance and Collectivism versus Individualism. This paper argues that even when informal communities solely serve their own opportunistic purposes, the prevailing collectivist culture in the society provides tacit support to their existence and therewith delays the transformation from relation-based to rule-based governance. The empirical findings confirm the oversocialised view of the society and networks suggested by economic sociologists. Additionally, the changes in transitional institutional environment are deemed to be in line with the claims of institutional economists on durability and impact of informal institutions.
P21|On The Evolution Of Corruption Patterns In The Post-Communist Countries|In this paper, we study the evolution of corruption patterns in 27 post-communist countries during the period 1996-2012 using the Control of Corruption Index and the corruption category Markov transition probability matrix. This method allows us to generate the long-run distribution of corruption among the post-communist countries. Our empirical findings suggest that corruption in the post-communist countries is a very persistent phenomenon that does not change much over time. Several theoretical explanations for such a result are provided.
P21|Socialist Calculation and Market Socialism|"This paper focuses on the debate held in the twenties and thirties of the last century between libertarian economists and socialist economists, following the denial by the first ones of the feasibility of a socialist economy. This controversy is well known to specialists and has been widely commented. It seemed to me useful to initiate non-specialists in an original way: by having the controversy speaking by itself. We review the main contributions and summarise their arguments with, initially, the bare minimum of personal comments. Walrasian general equilibrium serves as a reference for the defenders of market socialism in the controversy. But the concept of competition behind this theory is very incomplete; it is purely passive. It follows that the market socialism which emanates from it is not really a MARKET socialism. It is lacking the competition which innovates. Markets for capital goods are also lacking in theses models. Our paper then turns to a new generation of socialist models involving this real competition. We review two models proposed by Bardhan and Roemer and then exhibit a personal model. This type of model is facing a modern criticism whose central concept is the ""soft budget constraint""."
P21|О Формировании Системы Национального Планирования В России<BR>[On the Formation of National Planning System in Russia]|We propose to distinguish between two “ideal” types of national planning: the universal and the program planning. The first is aimed at accelerating the balanced development of industries and regions through large-scale investment projects; it requires a hierarchy of specialized planning institutions. The second uses a relatively small number of programs aimed at addressing key economic problems. These programs are worked out by the ministries and agencies, which are also engaged in the current management. In developing countries, national planning tends to be the first type, and in the developed ones, it tends to be the second. In Russia, elements of both types of systems have spontaneously arisen. From them, it is necessary to form a mixed system that would be adequate to the Russian level of development. Its contours are discussed in the paper.
P21|Národohospodářské efekty privatizačního procesu v České republice<BR>[National Economics Effects of the Privatization Process in the Czech Republic]|The transformation of centrally planned economy to a market economy has confi rmed that the basic premise for the economic policy, characterized by liberal market economy, is democratically established property rights. This text analyzes the National Economic effects of one of the most complex transformation processes, which is the process of privatization. This publication examines all three legal regimes through which were the entire privatization process implemented. These are “The Small Privatization“ according to the Act no. 427/1990 Coll., “The Large-scale Privatization“ according to the Act no. 92/1991 Coll. and “The privatization of agricultural and forestry property“ according to the Act no. 229/1991 Coll. and the Act no. 95/1999 Coll., with respect to the: affected economic theories, theory of property rights in particular, transaction costs theory, theory of interested groups, rent-seeking theory, theory of government failure, etc.; macroeconomic analysis of the process itself; macroeconomic analysis of the use of the proceeds from the privatization process; evaluation of the National Economic effects, whether positive or negative, of the privatization process in the Czech Republic. The aim of this text is to provide professional and comprehensive overview of the National Economic effects of the privatization process as a whole, which has not been published until now by any author in view of the fact that the perception of the privatization process of the professionals and the general public has been narrowed to a process implemented by the National Property Fund and the Ministry of Finance (by selling shares through vouchers). Finally, the aim of this publication is to analyze the application of economic theories within the privatization process in the Czech Republic which describes the pros and cons of this unique economic and national economy “experiment“.

It was found that as a result it was not possible to achieve higher growth in freight volumes and high-quality performance in comparison with the period of the recovery taking place in the conditions of the NEP. The increase in traffic was extremely unstable and did not meet the needs of the economy, which, in turn, did not provide a supply of railway production resources in the required quantities. It is shown that in the first five years, a system of universal shortage, but the development was characterized by significant imbalances, inefficiency and low innovation. The conclusion about the need to implement innovative model of market-oriented economic development."
P21|On the Alleged Stagnation of Capitalism|The assumption that capitalist globalization has been a period of overall stagnation is the dominant consensus opinion within Marxist political economy. This paper criticizes this opinion and shows that it rests on a mis-measure of the transition of the centrally planned economics of the ex-USSR, Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and China developed by the official statistical agencies during the Cold War. This mis-measure has the effect of underestimating both the collapse of physical output in the ex-USSR and CEE during the transition and underestimating the growth of genuine national income after the creation of market economies where previously there had been none. This paper develops some alternative, much higher, estimates of the real growth of national income during the transition period.
P21|A quarter century of economic reforms in Ukraine: too late, too slow, too little / Æwieræ wieku ukraiñskich reform: za ma³o, za póŸno i zbyt wolno|"The first aim of this paper is to describe the main developments in the Ukrainian economy since its independence in 1991, focusing on the evolution of output, and the path of economic reforms — that is, to simply show what happened. The bottom line on that is well known: Ukraine’s economy performed very poorly, and its reforms moved quite slowly, lagging behind most of Central Europe and the Baltic, and even behind some FSU (Former Soviet Union) countries. This first task is a relatively easy one, though some measurement issues do need discussion. In comparison, the second aim — explaining why it happened, identifying the explanatory, causal factors — is much more difficult and contentious. Indeed, causation here means two dynamics: the relationship between performance and reform pace, and the underlying determinants of the slow reforms. The paper’s main effort will be to argue and present evidence that the poor economic performance is primarily due to the late and slow start on economic reforms. However, it only begins to point to the explanations for slow reforms and suggest a modeling approach to analyze this econometrically in future work. Contents of this publication were first presented by Oleh Havrylyshyn during the 135th mBank-CASE Seminar ""A quarter century of economic reforms in Ukraine: too late, too slow, too little"". / Niniejsze opracowanie ma na celu opisaæ g³ówne zmiany, jakie zasz³y w ukraiñskiej gospodarce od momentu odzyskania niepodleg³oœci w 1991 roku, równoczeœnie zwracaj¹c uwagê na rozwój produkcji i œcie¿ki reform gospodarczych.

P21|Quo vadis, Ukraine? Is there a chance for success? (Quo vadis Ukraino? Czy istnieje szansa na sukces?)|If I were to say just one thing about Ukraine, I think I would have to stress it is the most underperforming country of all the countries I know. Ukraine has had, and indeed still does have, a lot of potential. In the beginning of 1990s, in 1992 to be precise, Deutsche Bank prepared an analysis of the chances for the former Soviet Union states to be reformed and developed successfully, and according to this analysis, Ukraine had the best chance among them all to be successful. We know that in reality the opposite happened, and Ukraine is in a very difficult situation now. The main reason for this situation is that when at the beginning of 1990s communist countries collapsed, the old system in Ukraine was not replaced by a new one, one of functioning market economy. It was eroded, but not exactly replaced the way it happened for example in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and the Baltic states. The country was captured by oligarchs, and a very strange, dysfunctional, and corrupted system was created instead./ Gdybym mia³ powiedzieæ tylko jedn¹ rzecz o Ukrainie, musia³bym podkreœliæ, ¿e jest to kraj osi¹gaj¹cy najgorsze wyniki gospodarcze spoœród wszystkich znanych mi krajów. Ukraina mia³a i nadal ma ogromny potencja³. Na pocz¹tku lat dziewiêædziesi¹tych ubieg³ego wieku, a dok³adnie w roku 1992, Deutsche Bank przygotowa³ analizê szans by³ych pañstw Zwi¹zku Radzieckiego na przeprowadzenie reform i pomyœlny rozwój. Wed³ug tej analizy najwiêksze szanse na sukces wœród nich wszystkich mia³a w³aœnie Ukraina. Jak wiemy, w rzeczywistoœci sta³o siê inaczej, i Ukraina znajduje siê teraz w bardzo trudnej sytuacji.G³ównym jej powodem jest fakt, ¿e gdy na pocz¹tku lat dziewiêædziesi¹tych upada³ komunizm, stary system na Ukrainie nie zosta³ zast¹piony przez nowy system gospodarki rynkowej.

P21|Creativity and entrepreneurial efforts in an emerging economy|"While much research has focused on entrepreneurship and creativity in developed economies, the notions of both topics are still embryonic in many emerging economies. This paper focuses on entrepreneurs in one such economy, Vietnam, to understand the perceptions of entrepreneurs about the role that innovation and creativity may play in their own entrepreneurial ventures and success. This is important because before reaping benefits from entrepreneurship, entrepreneurs need to decide when and on what conditions they start based on their calculations of required resources and predictions of likely outcomes. The research also sought to understand how ""creativity,"" broadly applied (""innovation"" and ""creative performance"") affects the ways that entrepreneurs think about and anticipate their own success and decisions. In essence, the study suggests that the higher the entrepreur’s creativity is, the more likely she or he is to start a new business and believe success will result. Future research could examine whether history, industry and geographic location matter in entrepreneurs’ perceptions as well as whether transition/emerging economies like Vietnam may have different views altogether about the two key concepts."
P21|Economic Sovereignty. A Militant Agenda for Russia|Russia is engaged on a process of political and economic transformation in the direction of a model of “economic sovereignty”. This process is the result of economic and political ostracism enacted in 2014 against the country by major international powers as a consequence of developments in Ukraine. The paper examines three fundamental aspects of the new security approach to development: i) import substitution of foodstuffs as an asset for security, ii) militant nationalism, and iii) increasing focus on Asia for the re-orientation of commercial flows. A pattern out of privilege relations with Europe is clearly emerging.
P21|Economic Effects of Post-Socialist Constitutions Revisited (nearly) 25 Years from the Outset of Transition|Post-socialist transition taking place since 1989 in countries of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as later in Central and Southwestern Asia, brought about simultaneous changes of their political and economic systems, requiring the establishment of new constitutional frameworks. In this paper we study the effects of post-socialist constitutional change on economic policy decisions of countries involved in this process. As nearly 25 years have passed from the outset of transition, the data allows to conduct an empirical study based on an econometric model confirming the relevance of several constitutional rules in this respect, e.g. regarding the model of government and constitutional judiciary. Based on the results, recommendations are made for countries, where the transition process has been slow and unsuccessful.
P21|Crisis and conversion of industrial port complex: the case of Gdansk (Poland)|The Interference of liberal principles and the reintroduction of a market economy have changed the structure and the organization of the productive system of centrally planned and administered countries (NOVE, 1981; ANDREFF, 2007). The new forms of industrial organization, which are the source of these transformations, give priority to territorial logics. In this context, studies on industrial districts, innovative environments, clusters? found renewed interest. However, the issue of local conversion by economic liberalization is still much unexplored in terms of impact on the organization of local actors and the development of innovation on the local level in the former centrally planned countries. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the strong links between the institutional and organizational decentralization and development of innovation on the local level. Our method of analysis is based on the idea that the change of public management after liberalization contributes to the convergence of public and private interests resulting in the emergence of an institutional agent composed of a network of actors. Collective action of these actors plays a vital role in the emergence and development of a potential innovation. To justify our approach, we combine the institutional approach and the evolutionary approach to explain the formation of the institutional agent and its involvement in the development of innovation on the local level. We apply this interpretative framework to the case of industrial port complex of Gdansk because of its economic history, the establishment of the new local economic policy (after 1989), the choice of local authorities, although significant growth of the high-tech sector and the absence of previous study on this issue. The study of institutional change in Gdansk is based on the literature review. The potential of innovation that is forged in parallel is studied on a double level first through a statistical analysis of Gdansk economy to provide an overview on all the initial conditions, then, through the study of data from surveys conducted by the National Statistical Office (GUS) to determine the weight of high-tech enterprises in Gdansk. The results show that the liberalization of exchange considerably affects the organization of local actors in Gdansk. The collective actions of public and private actors are not yet common but they encourage the development of innovation in Gdansk promoting: first, the accumulation of core assets, then the improvement of its scientific and technical potential and third the emergence of innovative high-tech companies. This study shows that the economy of Gdansk is being transformed all by emphasizing the articulation between the different actors of proximity, the local specific resources, and the reports developed on the market and non-market and the introduction of innovation.
P21|Declining trust in growing China: A dilemma between growth and socio-economic damage|"Declining general trust has become a serious social issue in China in recent years. This paper attempts to understand and analyze this social phenomenon from a social interaction perspective. Based on a repeated prisoners´ dilemma game on networks, it finds that the evolution of general trust is dependent on changes of the social interaction structure, and the increases of both social and spatial distance may explain a decrease of the levels of cooperation and general trust. In addition, we find that the traditional Chinese family and clan networks culture has an ambiguous effect on general trust, and simple reactive social ""homing behavior"" might be critical for China´s future economic development. In order to recover the general trust level, a major strategic option for China, and for fast growing countries in economic transition in general, is to (re-)develop appropriate network structures and properties, as our model indicates."
P21|From Divergence to Convergence: Reevaluating the History behind China's Economic Boom|China's long-term economic dynamics pose a formidable challenge to economic historians. The Qing Empire (1644-1911), the world's largest national economy before 1800, experienced a tripling of population during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries with no signs of diminishing per capita income. While the timing remains in dispute, a vast gap emerged between newly rich industrial nations and China's lagging economy in the wake of the Industrial Revolution. Only with an unprecedented growth spurt beginning in the late 1970s did this great divergence separating China from the global leaders substantially diminish, allowing China to regain its former standing among the world's largest economies. This essay develops an integrated framework for understanding that entire history, including both the divergence and the recent convergent trend. We explain how deeply embedded political and economic institutions that contributed to a long process of extensive growth before 1800 subsequently prevented China from capturing the benefits associated with the Industrial Revolution. During the twentieth century, the gradual erosion of these historic constraints and of new obstacles erected by socialist planning eventually opened the door to China's current boom. Our analysis links China's recent development to important elements of its past, while using recent success to provide fresh perspectives on the critical obstacles undermining earlier modernization efforts, and their eventual removal.
P21|Methodological Approaches To Veterinary Service Efficiency Evaluation In Livestock| This paper presents the contradiction between modern views on the role of veterinary science from the concept “one health” position, which implies an important role in health assurance and the welfare of the whole veterinary care society, and existing methodological support of its efficiency evaluation. The analysis of existing methods of veterinary attendance efficiency evaluation was conducted on the case of Stavropol Territory and with the help of canonical correlations method their disadvantages were shown. The paper provides rationalization for the need of veterinary science external effect consideration, which operates in healthcare and environmental protection. The procedure for calculating the integral coefficient of veterinary service efficiency was proposed, which allows taking into account the complex of internal and external effects. The integral coefficient may be used in the process of comparative analysis, in the specification of strategic growth priorities, in the motivation system integration of veterinary service employees.
P21|Agricultural Sector Transformation In Selected Countries Of South Eastern Europe| Governing the process of economic transformation is one of the most prominent issues arising since the fall of the Iron Curtain. After the successful transition model of the Central and Eastern European countries and their EU accession, the main anchors of the EU enlargement are directed into the South Eastern part of the continent. Most obviously, the EU enlargement is entering into the new phase of its expansion. In this paper we evaluate the state of transformation in the agricultural sector of the potential EU members comprising countries constituting the South Eastern Europe (the Western Balkans), and Turkey. We analyze whether the significant transitional changes occurred in the agricultural sector in observed countries. The main areas of our interest involve the comparative analysis of the state of economic transformation and the income convergence, the economic importance of agriculture in the potential EU Members, impact of economic transformation on the agricultural assets, agricultural policy implications, investigation of consumption patterns and poverty prevalence.
P21|Social economy - trends and challenges|Social economy must meet the challenge of facing the dangers of dilution or trivialization of its characteristic features that give specific social usefulness. To this end, the actors of social economy must become more aware of their common core values, use all the social and cultural means which take these values into account in order to reassert their own institutional profile and achieve a multiplying effect of their economic and social potential.
P21|The Future Of Fdi In South Eastern European Countries: Messages From New Eu Member States|This paper looks at the interlinking of inward FDI, EU accession, and transition-related structural reform processes, and identifies the largest lags of SEE-6 countries in EU accession and transition processes, whose removal would have a positive impact on inward FDI. The analysis is based on EBRD Transition Indicators, the World Bank Doing Business Index, and the World Bank Governance Index. We find an obvious correlation of inward FDI, transition, and EU accession processes of NMS-10 countries and claim that SEE-6 countries will broadly follow the same pattern: their relative position as FDI recipients will gradually improve along with the progress of EU accession and transition processes. The analysis identifies the following main gaps of the SEE-6 in these processes: (i) in terms of economic system development - enterprise restructuring and governance, and sectoral reforms in energy, infrastructure, capital markets, and private equity; (ii) in terms of the governance of economy and society at large - regulatory quality and rule of law; and (iii) in terms of the business environment - dealing with construction permits, enforcing contracts, and registering property. Progress in narrowing down these gaps would mean a step forward in EU accession and transition, and consequently an improvement of SEE-6 countries’ positions as locations for inward FDI.
P21|Speed and Sequencing of Transition Reforms and Income Inequality: A Panel Data Analysis|" type=""main""> An extensive literature has analyzed the economic effects of transition patterns in Central and Eastern European and former Soviet Union countries. With few recent exceptions, analysis of the impacts of speed and sequencing of reforms has not concerned the dynamics of income inequality. In this paper we analyze the heterogeneous effects of transition reforms on inequality by explicitly considering their speed and sequencing. To this aim we identify eight transition models in which the 27 countries considered are classified. The dynamic panel-data analysis for the period 1989–2009 reveals that balanced transition patterns, which favored a coordination of reforms especially in specific fields, were relatively less pro-inequality."
P21|On Heaven's Lathe: State, Rule of Law, & Economic Development|We propose a theoretical framework for understanding the evolution of the rule of law state, which is conceived as the equilibrium of a societal game in which actors accept the legitimacy of publicly enunciated legal rules. A meta-norm of respect for the sovereign legal power of the state is not self-forming on the basis of private conduct, but requires the coevolution of impersonal market exchange with effective state capacity to constitute and regulate markets. A functioning legal system must acquire the means not just to control private power but to constrain other organs of government. The emergence of such a 'self-limiting state' is an historical process which, while complementary to a market order, is also contingent and path-dependent, and is not preordained. Illustrating our argument with empirical cases drawn from the contemporary experience of middle income countries, we argue that alternatives to the rule of law state, including interpersonal trust, closed networks and authoritarian political control, can only achieve limited scale and scope effects, and are prone to high deadweight costs arising from corruption and the capture of the public sphere by private interests. We also discuss the potential of transplants of legal rules and institutions to catalyse the transition to impersonal trade based on the rule of law, and present evidence, from time-series econometric analysis, that the diffusion of shareholder protection laws has the potential to support financial development in emerging markets. Evolution towards the rule of law state is, we conclude, one possible developmental path for middle income countries.
P21|Problems Encountered during the Transition to Market Economy in Azerbaijan and Solution Attempts|After re-gaining its independence on 18 October 1991, the Republic of Azerbaijan started the transformation to the market-based economy and the integration into the world economy. The country’s oil and natural gas reserves have been considered the main source for financing a range of government programs for reforms. On the one hand, these reserves had to be used effectively; on the other hand, there was a huge demand for foreign investment for extraction. To this end, Azerbaijan has signed “Contract of the Century” in 1994. Although Azerbaijan has wide oil and natural gas reserves, it has faced a number of difficulties in its transition path. This study analyzes these problems and reforms for solving them. One of the types of the problems related to the economic structure of the former Soviet Union: disruption of the economic ties between the republics resulted in a decline of production, high levels of unemployment and prices and consequently led to an economic recession in all of the republics. Another set of problems related to the lack of sufficient institutional bases to transform to the market economy. Moreover, internal conflicts between the political parties and groups for having authority as well as political chaos in the republic can be considered other serious problems during the transition period. Furthermore, Karabakh war and occupation of 20 percent of the Azerbaijani territory by the Armenian military forces had made the situation extremely complicated. Despite all of these extremes, Azerbaijan transformed to the market-based economy decidedly and even became one of the fast growing countries of the world. Even in 2013, with the GDP growth rate of 5.6 percent, Azerbaijan was a leader among growing economies. In parallel with this significant economic development, there is still a need for some socio-economic and institutional reforms in order to get a well-functioning market-based economy in Azerbaijan.
P21|Financialisation and the Financial and Economic Crises: The Case of Estonia|This study on Estonia examines the long-run changes between the financial and the non-financial sectors of the economy, and in particular the effects of financialisation on key variables / categories of the real economy as well as the their contribution to the financial crisis of 2007/08. The first part provides the background historical overview of last 20 years in Estonia with some descriptive statistics on GDP, growth contributions of the main demand aggregates, and the financial balances of the macroeconomic sectors since early 1990s, and it classifies the Estonian development path as following the ‘debt-led consumption’ one. The following chapters examine the effects of financialisation and their extent, accompanied by transition processes, on income distribution, financing of capital stock investments, consumption and current account dynamics in detail. The final parts deal with the elaboration on the causes of the financial and economic crisis as well as the policy response in Estonia.
P21|Interpreting Communist Systems and Their Differences in Operation and Transformation as Networks|Why some party-states collapse and others don't? Why some transformations are accompanied by economic crisis while others by economic growth? Are first political or economic transformation strategic alternatives? This paper comprises the essence of the author’s comparative research on party-state systems in Europe and Asia embodied in a comparative interactive party-state model interpreted as network. Networks evolve during the decision-making process formed by the tightly intertwined dependency and interest promotion relationships among actors in the party, the state, and the economy. The model also describes the structural background of the different operation and transformation of party-state systems as specific patterns of power distribution in the network forging the different ways and instruments of self-reproduction, and different sequence, speed and conditions of system transformation.
P21|Shortages and the Informal Economy in the Soviet Republics: 1965-1989|We measure the informal economy and shortages of consumer goods in the Soviet republics from 1965 to 1989 to estimate the relationships of these two variables. We use fixed-effect model and instrument variable approach and find that the informal economy and shortages reinforce each other. Results indicate that the Soviet central planning system is difficult to sustain in the long run. A substantial heterogeneity across the Soviet republics exists not only in the extent of the informal economy and shortages, but also in the associations of the two variables.
P21|Innovation Policies in the Visegrad Countries|This report first reviews the current discussion about innovation, looking at its definition and theoretical underpinnings from different angles. It is followed by an analysis of the rationale, goals, instruments and organisational framework of innovation policies in the Visegrad Countries. The report argues that the Visegrad Countries tend to focus on a narrow understanding of innovation – expressed in the science-push model of innovation, as well as in mainstream economics – as opposed to the broader understanding promoted by the evolutionary approach. The latter approach would provide more appropriate guidelines for developing innovation systems, improving performance and achieving more pronounced and favourable impacts on socio-economic development in general.
P21|Mérlegen a rendszerváltás 25 éve<BR>[The transition in a 25-year perspective]|1989-ben a Föld 36 országát marxista-leninista pártok irányították. Ma már csak Észak-Koreát és Kubát. Ez világtörténelmi jelentőségű változás, amelynek Magyarország is részese volt. A Kelet-Európában és a Szovjetunióban 1989-1990-ben végbement változások 25. évfordulója alkalmából a washingtoni Peterson Institute for International Economics és a Közép-európai Egyetem Politikatudományok Tanszéke 2014. május 6-7-én közösen rendezett konferenciát Budapesten Transition in perspective címmel. E tanulmány egyfelől ennek a konferenciának a főbb megállapításait foglalja össze, másfelől pedig a szerző saját kutatásai alapján számszerűsíti és minősíti is a 36 egykori szocialista ország gazdasági teljesítményét.

P21|A gazdaságosság jelentőségéről és szerepéről a népgazdaság tervszerű irányításában<BR>[The importance and role of efficiency in planned direction of the people s economy]|It became clear as the planned economy developed in Hungary in the first half of the 1950s that qualitative indices of enterprise activity cannot be improved by central command. Too many detailed regulations precludes the accomplishment of all. Nor is there time to verify their results. Excessive regulation casts doubt on the personal responsibility of heads of state-owned enterprises, leaving a mere appearance of it. Any radical change requires a new approach in many fields: directives must be issued only on important matters (for instance, apply to specific goals), financial incentives be linked to efficiency indices, not quantitative ones, buyers be so placed that their evaluations reverberate onto the financial situation of seller enterprises, prices reflect the quality of products, the directors and entire collectives of enterprises share to an appropriate extent in the profits obtained. In essence these tasks require efficiency, instead of quantitative indices, to be at the centre of economic activity.
P21|A hó végi hajrá és gazdasági mechanizmusunk<BR>[End-of-month rush and the mechanism of our economy]|The study reviews some findings of research done at the Institute of Economics on evening the pace of industrial production. The main conclusions are these: 1. End-of-month rush is marked less by an uneven pace in the production process as by an irregular pace of turning out finished goods. 2. The reasons for this are compulsory periodical reporting and material interests linked with fulfilment of the monthly production plan. 3. The basis for the phenomenon is lack of reserves. Diminishing reserves accentuate an irregular pace and help to make it general. On the other hand, rushed work itself and its concomitant symptoms absorb the very stocks and reserves that could attenuate the rush. The study rests on historical experience and logical analysis: it argues against views that seek the real reasons for irregular production in enterprise errors by and badly organized production, and interpret irregularity in the production pace as an index of latent reserves and unused capacity.
P21|A gazdaságirányítási reform küszöbén<BR>[On the threshold of reform of economic direction]|"The author sums up the lessons learnt in preparing the new system of economic management and deals with key problems to be met in 1968 when implementing the reform. He states that the measures taking effect in 1968 conform to the directives, but the guiding principles of the economic reform will take effect in a clearer form only after a longer period of transition. This requires a new, second phase of developing the economic management system. The annual plan for 1968 had to aim at balanced market relations, as activation of the market mechanism leaves the economy more sensitive to inflation. A similar limit appears because approximation of expectable value and price relations in the economy can only be a rough estimate. These two factors prompt caution dictated by responsibility to society. So it may be assumed that some elements in the regulation system will need modifying by 1 January 1969. Caution becomes manifest, for example, in a tendency to equalize somewhat the initial operating conditions for industries and enterprises. The state cannot suddenly withdraw support from all production branches that in terms of an abstract system of the international market would be non-viable. Economic reform is not a matter of pure economics but a cause for society. In the authors view the real problem in coming years will not be whether the state over-protects enterprises from market effects, but rather of enterprises demanding yet greater protection from the state. With enterprise behaviour the main thing is to avoid boosting production as an end in itself and consider saleability during production. As for government agency behaviour, harm may come from a routine urge to interfere. The author identifies a double task: securing general equilibrium, so that material levers"" of faster social progress come into operation; and creating conditions for a rate of increase in living standards characteristic of the 1957-61 period."
P21|A gazdasági verseny problémái hazánkban<BR>[Problems of economic competition in Hungary]|In seeking how achievements hitherto can be further advanced, the study sets out to clarify two groups of questions. First it asks whether competition, as a self-regulating system, can operate in the whole economy, or only in part of it. Secondly, it asks what problems should be purposefully influenced by special regulations in the part of the economy the author calls the competitive sphere. The study states it is desirable in that sphere to realize development harmonized with demand, which is partly set but partly only influenced by socialist economic policy. In this sense it is expedient to orientate enterprises with basically uniform indicators in line with the known interests of society. Since competition has self-regulating effects, other tools of purposive socialist economic policy must be developed. To achieve favourable external effects the state must implement action programs. But it will not be expedient automatically to finance actions defined in material terms (volume data) or via technical parameters. To hinder proliferation of preferences, ease the burden on the state budget, and maintain the competitive position of enterprises obtaining preferences, it will be advisable to grant only fixed-sum subsidies in chosen fields based on proposals from the specialists in central bodies. The second problem discussed concerns the conditions in which a well-functioning, self-regulating system can emerge in an economy where the bulk of means of production is publicly owned. By 1968 it was clear that creating autonomous enterprises with a profit motive was a precondition for competition. Experience in the last four years shows that enterprises have not become autonomous, though their independence has much increased. The author sees competition being hindered by the position of enterprises as parts of a uniform, hierarchical system subordinate to branch ministries, to which the accepted prime indicator of enterprise success is only secondary. The author proposes transforming the organizational and institutional order of the economy, increasing the possibility of distinguishing the central interests of the state from those of profit-motivated enterprises. Supervision of enterprises and flows of assets among them could be achieved by creating a system of production and commercial banks.
P21|Strukturális váltásunk társadalmi-gazdasági összetevői és ellentmondásai<BR>[The socio-economic components and contradictions of structural change in Hungary]|The study sets out from examination of the factors that necessitated formulating the economic policy concept approved at the 12th Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party: economic development has become intensive instead of extensive, a change of era is underway in the world economy, and the Hungarian economy struggles with disturbances of equilibrium. The present economic policy concept has greater coverage than that of the 1968 reform. It goes beyond methods of economic control and management to economic policy and the institutional system of control. Yet it now faces many more constraints than it did in 1968. Transforming the concept into social action makes big demands also on science, e. g. it has to disclose and help solve the conflicts necessarily developing in the course of transformation: ideology may lag behind economic policy efforts and impede necessary economic measures. Difficulties must also be faced in fitting into the export side of the world economy. Hungary can withstand world market competition only with dynamic properties, especially as its enterprises operate in a small country at a mid-level of technological development. Flexibility, high labour-force qualifications, effective innovation and adequate information are very important. It is vital to competitiveness to develop modern forms of organization, a production background susceptible to change in world market demand, a quick, efficient system of decision-making, and a political and ideological environment supportive of needful economic actions. The study advocates overall revision of the education and training system, where the prime task is to develop abilities for rational action and adaptation to changing conditions. Care must be taken that talents can freely unfold. The social sciences have a prime task of preparing systems of action that serve societys interests. Conditions for withstanding world market competition must be created by science fulfilling its informative, innovative and creative tasks to a high level.
P21|Fordulat és reform<BR>[Turn and reform]|The Hungarian economy is heading towards a crisis in the late 1980s. Despite all changes, wastage of resources remains and adjustment to the market fails to emerge. The unchanged structure and errors of economic policy have led in the short term to disequilibria. Only comprehensive, radical socio-economic reform can lead the way out of the crisis, its direction being from an indirect mechanism toward decentralized market socialism. In economic policy, a turn has to be achieved, to break with earlier multiple priorities. Illusions of faster growth, maintained living standards and curbed inflation must give way to immediate structural transformation. Monetary restriction has to be applied (strict regulation of the money supply, limited availability of credit raised by the budget, autonomous central banking policy, reduction of budget subsidies, more efficient management of budget-financed institutions, etc.) A consistent programme must be drawn up to eliminate crisis industries. Large, uneconomical CMEA investment projects must be re-examined. A turn in economic policy can only be achieved by reform of the mechanism. Part of this is to diversify ownership and render it competitive (equal rank for ownership forms, transition into each other, specific harmony between self-government and share property, new regulations for foreign capital participation), and creation of a long-term interest in capital assets. Anti-monopoly measures and consistent bankruptcy procedures are needed to increase the number and autonomy of actors in the market. Tax reform must be implemented even in the short run, to eliminate ad hoc interference and secure neutrality in competition. Social reform must affect the partys role in the economy. It should be made possible for various economic policy platforms and groups to form within the party. The maker of autonomous economic policy should be a responsible, effective government. It is expedient to increase Parliaments role in creating and preserving economic constitutionalism and checking on government. Founding free representatives of interests, with truly voluntary membership, should be enabled, so that various economic interests can appear openly and conflicts be handled. Arbitration forums between interest representers and the government need to be set up. Finally, reform that points the way out of the troubles can be applied only with active social participation. It is vital for the countrys grave economic situation to be made clear to the public, and to have alternative programmes openly compete with each other.
P21|Evolution of State Industrial Policy in Russia|The paper describes the evolution in 1990-s and 2000-s of approaches of Russian state towards industrial policy, which is understood as a policy facilitating structural changes in the economy. The mentioned evolution took place simultaneously with the development of theoretical paradigms of industrial policy in the economic literature both in Russia and in the World, and with extensive use of different instruments of industrial policy as well. Authors aim to analyze and summarize the Russian experiences in applying different instruments of industrial policy and to discuss the reasons for success and failures of those experiments. The paper formulates some lessons to be drawn from the extensive Russian experience that may improve the efficiency of such a policy, and puts some question for the discussion on the industrial policy issue.
P21|Successes and Failures of the Russian Energy Market Reforms|The partial privatization of the Russian energy industry with retained state regulation has made it impossible to produce targeted market models. In the paper the paths of the 2001 and 2008 reforms in the electricity and gas industries and in the associated petroleum gas market are discussed. Successes and failures of the reforms are evaluated in terms of the public interest. It has been shown that the reforms in all the three industries have not yet been completed and require further development.
P21|Why Reforms Fail|"Failure of reforms is typical, and a success is extremely rare. This article analyzes the causes of this phenomenon. Many reform proposals are based on mistakable postulates concerning, in particular, interconnections of economic and political institutions. Reform often used as a tool for rent seeking and administrative struggle, hampering social welfare growth. Finally, the most important cause of the failure is the expert community underdevelopment, which is supported by the prevailing system of the reform preparation. This system leads to conflicts of interest and does not promote higher qualification of experts, so that there is a kind of analogue with institutional trap. To exit from the ""bad equilibrium"", it is advisable to seek the adoption of regulations for the reform designing, the formation of specialized expert institutions with long-term financing and introduction of open competitive procedures for the selection of projects."
P21|Syndrome of Reforms' Arrhythmia in the Higher Education|The author discusses the process of reforms in the Russian higher education. It is shown that the first phase of reforms has been fraught with omissions of regulator and inflation of educational bubble, which gave rise to the budget crisis in the industry, and demanded radical interventions. At the second stage a regulator, trying to cope with the educational bubble, provoked a collapse of the industry, which is fraught with enormous social costs. The examples of distortion of university environment due to administration errors presented.
P21|The Second Start of Transformation in Ukraine?|The Ukrainian socio-economic crisis has been developing for years and resulted in the open socio-political turmoil and armed conflict. The Ukrainian population didn’t meet objectives of the post-Soviet transformation, and people were disillusioned for years, losing trust in the state and the Future. The role of workers’ remittances in the Ukrainian economy is underestimated, since the personal consumption and stability depend strongly on them. Social inequality, oligarchic control of key national assets contributed to instability as well as regional disparity, aggravated by identity differences. Economic growth is slow due to a long-term underinvestment, and prospects of improvement are dependent on some difficult institutional reforms, macro stability, open external markets and the elites’ consensus. Recovering after socio-economic and political crisis will need not merely time, but also governance quality improvement, institutions reform, the investment climate revival — that can be attributed as the second transformation in Ukraine.
P21|The Symbiosis of Economic Science and Practice in Reforming|"(On the Book by S. Ya. Chernavsky ""Reforms of the Energy Regulated Branches in Russia"") The book by S. Chernavsky is devoted to the reform of the Russian energy sector and the economy as a whole. The author assesses in detail carried out reforms and develops policy recommendations in the interest of the society. In some chapters of this book the author plays the role of an analyst, in the others — that of one of the participants directly involved in the reform or its main developer. In all cases, the analysis is combined with the use of modern economic theory, mathematical models of the behavior of economic agents and empirical data. Many mathematical models presented have been developed and evaluated in cooperation with the leading Russian experts in the field of mathematical modeling and econometrics analysis that determines their validity. The obtained results and policy recommendations allow us to count on lower transformation costs and higher probability of successful implementation of reforms."
P21|“The New Season of Chinese Economic Miracle” and its Challenges|The investment and export-driven economic model followed by Chinese governments after 1978 served very well their catching-up vision, but China’s unprecedented race to the top had its flaws and drawbacks, leading to negative externalities and multiple structural imbalances. The global economic crisis and the interventionist package implemented to countervail its impact triggered a host of unwanted, negative outcomes which further aggravated the imbalances of the Chinese economy and created some new ones. It therefore became more obvious than ever that the old economic model had reached its limits and it needed to be changed. This task rests with the new cabinet led by premier Li Keqiang who launched a blueprint of bold reforms, but their implementation will presumably meet the strong opposition of powerful vested interests. The paper looks at the structural imbalances of the Chinese economy, highlighting the needed rebalancing processes. It also looks at the reform blueprint designed by the new leadership, disclosing and discussing some of its main implementation challenges.
P21|Objectives Setting Problems in the Development Plans of Districts and Municipalities in Bulgaria|On the basis of an in-depth analysis, this article reviews the weaknesses of the targets in the district and municipal development plans in Bulgaria for the period 2007-2003. When it comes to planning and in particular the longterm (strategic) planning, the quality of the target setting process for the systems’ development has key significance and predefines their future. Thus the accurate targets that are clearly formulated in the district and municipal development plans are the most important prerequisites for the development of these territorial units. Without satisfying this precondition, the resources and measures for implementing these plans, irrespective of their quality and quantity, will not result in the development of the territorial units throughout the country. In the future the conclusions that were drawn in the article could serve as a starting point for improving the target setting process when it comes to developing the plans for the districts and municipalities’ development in Bulgaria.
P21|Redefining The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem Within Spatial Econometrics, The Case Of The Aggregation Problem|The paper focuses on the issue of the aggregation problem, which is frequently discussed within spatial econometrics. The aggregation problem is one of the two aspects of the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). The aggregation problem is connected with the volatility of the obtained results occurred when various com-positions of territorial units for the same aggregation scale were applied. The objective of the present paper is to consider the redefinition of aggregation prob-lem and showing positive solution of the aggregation problem based on the em-pirical example of determining agricultural macroregions. In the article the ag-gregation problem was defined as a problem of establishing a particular compo-sition of territorial units at a selected aggregation scale in a such a way that is remains in the quasi composition of regions within the undertaken research prob-lem. The paper also presented the procedure for determining agricultural macroregions where the analysis of the spatial volatility of the agrarian structure and the current knowledge on the agriculture in Poland were applied. In addi-tion, the paper considered the final areal interpretation problem connected with the incorrect determination of the area in relation to which final conclusions are drawn. The problem was presented basing on the example of the establishment of the average concentration of the area of agricultural land in Poland with the use of the Gini index calculated for districts. The paper emphasised that ignoring the final areal interpretation problem in spatial analyses may lead to an apparent identification of the modifiable areal unit problem.
P21|Reforms in Institutional Finance for Inclusive Growth|This paper analyses the need, significance and the advantages of ‘reforms in institutional finance for inclusive growth’ in the context of Indian economy and offers some practicable suggestions from the functional perspective. India’s Rural Financial Architecture (RFA) is subject to systemic policy issues and pervasive institutional weaknesses. Lack of autonomy and weak governance and unseen accountability have affected the sustainability of Rural Financial Institutions (RFI) and resulted in constrained outreach. Importance of access to institutional finance for the poor arises from the problem of financial exclusion of nearly 3 billion people from the formal financial services across the world. With only 34% of population engaged in formal banking, this paper argues that the reforms in institutional finance coupled with governance reforms in India’s RFA would greatly benefit the economy in making available the much-needed financial services to the poor and the neglected sections of the society and facilitate the efforts towards achieving inclusive growth.
P21|Куда Идти: Двадцать Четыре Тезиса<BR>[Where to go: twenty four theses]|"Abstract The article deals with the basic elements of a rational strategy of economic development of Russia in the modern circumstances. The analysis shows that the current state of confrontation between Russia and the United States will last long enough. Trying to shorten the period of forced partial isolation, Russia should use it to restore growth and to prepare for further integration with Europe. We need to debug the credit system, to complete the creation of the NIS, as well as systems of indicative planning and continuing education, and to improve the administration in accordance with the principles of the theory of ""developmental state."" Implementing import substitution, we should seek to production diversification, based on the expansion of domestic consumption of goods produced from natural resources. It is necessary to ensure the dissemination of the technologies available at leading Russian companies in the whole country, and accelerate the transition to innovative development. To solve these problems, one needs a modern science sector, containing all the intermediate links between basic and applied research. Strengthening the rule of law, respect for the opposition, improving the investment climate - this strategy is the best response to foreign political pressure, the key to Russia's strategic security."
P21|Региональная Проблема Социалистической Югославии В 1945–1991 Гг<BR>[Regional Problem in Socialist Yugoslavia 1945‒1991]|В статье рассматриваются региональные и межнациональные проблемы в социалистической Югославии в период 1945–1991 гг. После Второй мировой войны Югославия возобновилась, однако, учитывая предшествующий опыт, не в виде унитарного, централистски организованного государства, а как Федерация шести республик (к тому же с двумя автономными краями в одной из них). Несмотря на то что в развитии нового государства региональные цели и региональная политика стояли на первом месте, в своей основе они рассматривались как межнациональная проблема, мало отличавшаяся от аналогичной проблемы в первой Югославии. Этому способствовали и статус республик (и автономных краев) как макрорегионов, и редуцирование региональной политики на присовокупление и распределение так называемых дополнительных средств для развития неразвитых регионов. Когда в середине 1960-х гг. просторно координированная система регионального развития сменилась на просторно некоординированную, региональные проблемы усилились, а страна в целом, как и все её части, потерпела большие ущербы. Именно региональная, т. е. межнациональная, проблема стала одной из самых острых, в немалой степени способствуя развалу страны. The paper considers regional and ethnic problems in socialist Yugoslavia during the period 1945‒1991. After the World War II Yugoslavia was renewed, but according to previous experience not as an unitary, centrally organized state, but as the federal state of six republics (with two autonomous provinces in one of them). In the development of the new state regional goals and regional policy were constantly one of the most important purposes, but they were considered as the inter-national problem, so they were little different from these problems in the first Yugoslavia. To them contributed also the status of republics (and autonomous provinces) as macro-regions and reductions of the regional policy to the collection and distribution of the additional assets for the development of the underdeveloped. In mid 1960’s, when the spatial coordinate system of regional development was replaced with the spatial non-coordinate system, regional problems multiplied, and the country and its parts suffered losses. It was the regional, i.e. ethnic problem the one that got overly serious and lead to the destruction of the country.
P21|Смещение Неоклассической Экономической Парадигмы ‒ Предпосылка Повышения Качества Макроэкономического Образования<BR>[Removal of the neoclassical economic paradigm – condition for the improving of macroeconomic education]|Russian. В работе расматривается необходимость смещения современной господствующей неоклассической экономической теории. Показывается, что она с предпосылками равного качества и значения всех деятельности, и всемогущества саморегулирующего рынка, не имеет возможности и сил объяснить факторы экономического развития, появления и расширения бедности. Причём, это относится как к одной отдельно взятой стране, так и к международным обстоятельствам. В качестве новой парадигмы, которая должна заменить неоклассическую, выдвигается Другой канон, обосновывающийся на многовековой традиции и биологических метафорах. Он происходит из эпохи Возрождения, был подтверждён многовековым опытом современных развитых экономик, через применение политик которые в современном мире запрещают применять неразвитым странам, пока они сами их применяют. В отличие от неоклассических политик, воплощённых в (нео)либеральной политике Вашингтонского консенсуса, приводящих к дезиндустриализации, политики Другого канона, обоснованные на политиках образца плана Маршалла, приводят наоборот к индустриализации как предпосылке выхода неразвитых стран из кризиса и бедности. Смещение неоклассической экономической парадигмы появляется в этом смысле как предпосылка повышения качества макроэкономического образования и должна обеспечить лучшее понимание экономических проблем и процессов. English. The article considers a need for displacement of the contemporary neoclassical economic theory. This theory and its presumptions of equal quality and importance of all the economic branches, as well as the power of the self-regulating market, have proven unable to explain the economic development factors, nor the appearance of poverty and its growth. This has been demonstrated in cases of individual countries, as well in the international context. The Other Canon, based on many centuries’ tradition and biological metaphors, represents a new paradigm, which is suggested as a substitute for the neoclassical one. It dates back to the Renaissance period, and it has proved successful in many centuries’ experiences of the contemporary developed countries. In the contemporary world, the developed countries forbid the underdeveloped one from using these policies, at the same time applying them themselves. The neoclassical policies embodied within the Washington Consensus neoliberal policies lead to deindustrialization. On the contrary, the Other Canons policies, based on the policies such as Marshall Plan, lead to industrialization, which is the main requisite for the underdeveloped countries to find a way out of crisis and poverty. The dismissal of the neoclassical economic paradigm appears to be the condition for an improvement of macroeconomic education and is ought to secure a better understanding of economic problems and processes.
P21|Instabilitatea financiara, ciclurile si rolul institutiilor|In this study I review the main scientific contributions of Minsky and other scholars to the financial instability and crisis issues, and the role of institutions in modeling the medium and long business and financial waves. The topics developed in this paper are the following: the relationships between financial instability, business and financial crisis and institutions; the thwarting of the explosive instability by the specific institutions' actions and regulations; the impact of the institutional changes on the business and financial cycles; the empiric approach to the business and financial cycles and their synchronization in the Central and Eastern Europe countries / members of the EU, taking into account the main characteristics of the changes in these countries' institutions.
P21|Financial Instability, Cycles and the Role of Institutions|In this study I review the main scientific contributions of Minsky and other scholars to the financial instability and crisis issues, and the role of institutions in modeling the medium and long financial and business waves.

P21|Informal Payments to the Tax Collector in Transition Countries|In this paper, I empirically examine survey data on the likelihood and frequency of firms’ having to make informal payments or gifts to government officials in transition countries. The firm-level survey data are from the EBRD-World Bank Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) for enterprises in transition economies of Europe and Central Asia, including Turkey. Characteristics of firms are used as explanatory variables along with country characteristics to control for the stage of economic development and current economic conditions at the time the survey data were collected. Probit and selection models of tax inspections, tax-compliance efforts, and firms' informal payments are estimated. The empirical evidence indicates that several specific corporate characteristics influence the likelihood of tax inspections, including employment and the location of the company. Both corporate and country characteristics determine the likelihood of tax officials' requests for informal payments. Importantly, tax-compliance costs significantly affect informal payments.
P21|Serbia In Transition From Self-Governing Socialism To Liberal Capitalism| The transformation of the socialist system and economy in the East-European countries and in the former SFR of Yugoslavia began with the pulling down of the Berlin Wall in 1989. For ten Countries from the Baltic, Central and Eastern Europe, this process was ended by their membership in the EU in 2004. With the exception of Slovenia, which has been an EU member state since 2004, and Croatia, which has been the 28th full member country of the EU since July 2013, the transformation into the “welfare state” (market economy and democratic society) in the other countries in the Western Balkans has been lasting for almost 25 years, without clear indications of whether it has reached an end. With the collapse of the socialist (“eastern”) bloc, liberal capitalism became the winner and the universal model of a future regulation of the world. “The invisible arm of the free market”, as liberal capitalism used to be referred to, should automatically have ensured that the states have economic stability, a high rate of growth, welfare and peace. Transition countries accepted this concept of economic development and started joining the process of market liberalization, privatization and the deregulation of economy at a quick pace. It was believed that this concept would establish a welfare society in such countries. As it turned out, transition per se does not lead a country to the “welfare state”. On the contrary, the process of the transformation from socialism to liberal capitalism per se does not mean the welfare state, either; it rather brings with itself certain problems which are being faced by smaller developed countries of the market economy. It was anticipated that, in the developed countries of the market economy, in the shadow of the “invisible arm”, there would always be the “invisible role of the state”, whose shadow could have been seen in the periods of a crisis only, forcefully directing economic flows, putting them back to the wanted framework, surrendering them to the “invisible arm” of the market again. By accepting a liberal concept, Serbia, as well as the majority of other East-European countries, exposed itself to the powerful market competition of developed economies. In that way, for a longer period of time, developed countries assured their privileged position in less developed ones and ensured for themselves a high rate of economic growth. Although nowhere in the world has the liberal model of the development of an economy fully become a reality in its original form, a very deformed neoliberal model of the development of economy is forced on transition countries via financial institutions. The imposed concept is identified with the model of the free market in developed economies although, every step of the way, it reflects a visible interference of the state in economic flows, which failed to appear in transition countries. The attractivities of liberal capitalism, which the majority of insufficiently developed economies are not prepared to accept without bigger negative consequences, are excessively elongated. An additional confusion in the development of the concept of neoliberal capitalism in East-European countries is created by the fact that such development has been founded on the concept of liberal capitalism, whereas the negative consequences of such development have been dealt with according to the socialist model of the development of economy. So, today, on the one hand, we have the development of economy based on the model of neoliberal capitalism, and, on the other, problems we deal with according to the socialist model of development. The insufficient interference of the state in the transition process in former socialist countries led to the uncontrolled creation of monopolies and the market chaos instead of free market. The creation of monopolies is supported by the globalization processes. In the grip of these processes, Serbia has accepted such a concept of transition and economic development irrespective of the clearly visible negative consequences. The unprepared economy of Serbia is exposed to the competition of developed countries without having previously restructured its enterprises and accepted the economic role of the state in compliance with the new world environment. This paper is aimed at applying a comparative analysis in order to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the model of neoliberal capitalism in Serbia and in countries in transition, imposed on and directed by international financial institutions as the only one breakthrough model of economic development.
P21|China's Goal of Combining Economic Self-Reliance With Its Development: Changing Perspectives and Challenges| The attainment of self-reliance (zi li geng sheng) is an important goal for China. However, approaches to achieving it have altered greatly since the People’s Republic was established in 1949. Following the split between China and the Soviet Union in 1960, Mao Zedong claimed that China could achieve this goal by promoting economic self-sufficiency at the national level as well as at subnational levels. This approach resulted in a considerable economic burden for China. While national economic self-sufficiency probably was forced on China by the hostility of foreign nations towards it, subnational self-sufficiency was not. Following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the eventual rise to power of Deng Xiaoping, China’s market reforms began in 1978. With the introduction of the household responsibility system in agriculture, China gave up relying on communes and collectives for its agricultural production. The market reforms began in rural areas but were only slowly extended to urban areas because of some opposition to some politbureau numbers to the market reforms. The process of the market reforms since 1978 is outlined with some attention being given to the political hurdles involved in achieving these reforms. As a result of these reforms, the goal of subnational economic self-sufficiency has well and truly been abandoned and national self-sufficiency is no longer practised. These changes have brought new economic risks for China and the Chinese people. The benefit, however, has been greater economic growth and the enhanced global status of China. While economic self-sufficiency is no longer an over-riding goal for China, one part of zi li geng sheng is still very important for it nationally, namely, to control one’s destiny, that is, to be in charge of one’s own affairs, goals and decision-making.
P21|Monitoring Managers: Does It Matter?|We test under what circumstances boards discipline managers and whether such interventions improve performance. We exploit exogenous variation due to the staggered adoption of corporate governance laws in formerly Communist countries coupled with detailed ‘hard’ information about the board’s performance expectations and ‘soft’ information about board and CEO actions and the board’s beliefs about CEO competence in 473 mostly private-sector companies backed by private equity funds between 1993 and 2008. We find that CEOs are fired when the company underperforms relative to the board’s expectations, suggesting that boards use performance to update their beliefs. CEOs are especially likely to be fired when evidence has mounted that they are incompetent and when board power has increased following corporate governance reforms. In contrast, CEOs are not fired when performance deteriorates due to factors deemed explicitly to be beyond their control, nor are they fired for making ‘honest mistakes.’ Following forced CEO turnover, companies see performance improvements and their investors are considerably more likely to eventually sell them at a profit.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P21|Structural Reforms and Economic Growth: A Meta-Analysis|This paper evaluates the impact of structural reforms, mainly liberalization and privatization, on economic growth. To provide stylized facts on how such reforms worked in the past, we quantitatively review 60 studies that estimate the relation between reforms and growth empirically. These studies examine structural reforms carried out in 26 transition and post-transition countries around the world. Our results show that a typical reform caused substantial costs in the short run, but had strong positive effects on long-run growth. Reforms focused on external liberalization proved to be more beneficial than other types of reform in both the short and long run. The findings hold even after correction for publication bias and misspecifications present in some primary studies.
P21|Pertinencia y relevancia de la línea de investigación Equidad y Desarrollo: la innovación social y su relación con el desempeño económico y social desde el institucionalismo económico|Este artículo se fundamenta en el institucionalismo económico, y se relaciona con la pertinencia de la línea de investigación Equidad y Desarrollo de la Facultad de Ciencias Económicas y Sociales de la Universidad de La Salle en cuanto a la innovación social. Este concepto se ha planteado en el semillero de investigación Economía de los Servicios Públicos en términos de equidad, como el reconocimiento del otro excluido, y de desarrollo en cuanto a las reglas del juego y las organizaciones como determinantes del desempeño económico y social. Mediante la interpretación de los resultados del microanálisis de la investigación empírica sobre la prestación del servicio de alcantarillado en Bogotá y Cartagena, se plantea la necesidad de buscar nuevas aproximaciones epistemológicas, teóricoconceptuales y metodológicas respecto al concepto de innovación social. Se genera esta reflexión cuando se trata de los nuevos diseños institucionales en la prestación de los servicios públicos domiciliarios en Colombia.
P21|Religious Identity, Public Goods and Centralization: Evidence from Russian and Israeli Cities|In this paper, we analyze the effects of religious identity - defined both as personal identification with a religious tradition and institutional ideas on the provision of public goods - on attitudes toward central government. We explore whether citizens belonging to collectivist rather than individualist religious denominations are more likely to evaluate their central government positively. Moreover, we explore whether adherence to collectivist norms of economic and political organization leads to a positive evaluation of central government. Surveys were conducted in Russia and Israel as these countries provide a mosaic of three major world religions - Judaism, Eastern Orthodoxy and Sunni Islam. The information gathered also allows us to study whether attitudes towards religious institutions such as the Russian Orthodox Church, the Chief Rabbinate in Jerusalem, the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, and the Greek-Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem in Israel are able to predict positive attitudes toward centralized forms of governance. We find strong support for the proposition that collectivist norms and an institutional religious identity enhance positive attitudes towards central government.
P21|Soviet power plus electrification: What is the long-run legacy of communism?|Two decades after the end of central planning, we investigate the extent to which the advantages bequeathed by planning in terms of high investment in physical infrastructure and human capital compensated for the costs in allocative inefficiency and weak incentives for innovation. We assemble and analyse three separate types of evidence. First, we find that countries that were initially relatively poor prior to planning benefited more, as measured by long-run GDP per capita levels, from infrastructure and human capital than they suffered from weak market incentives. For initially relatively rich countries the opposite is true. Second, using various measures of physical stocks of infrastructure and human capital we show that at the end of planning, formerly planned countries had substantially different endowments from their contemporaneous market economy counterparts. However, these differences were much more important for poor than for rich countries. Finally, we use firm-level data to measure the cost of a wide range of constraints on firm performance, and we show that after more than a decade of transition in 2002–05, poor ex-planned economies differ much more from their market counterparts, in respect to both good and bad aspects of the planning legacy, than do relatively rich ones. However, the persistent beneficial legacy effects disappeared under the pressure of strong growth in the formerly planned economies in the run-up to the global financial crisis.
P21|Corporate governance and company performance across Sub-Saharan African countries|This paper examines the extent to which publicly listed companies across Sub-Saharan African countries have adopted “good corporate governance” practices. We investigate the association of these practices with companies’ accounting performance and market valuation. The findings indicate that companies across Sub-Saharan Africa have only partly implemented good corporate governance practices. We find a positive association between our constructed index of good corporate governance practices and accounting performance. However, we find a negative association between the corporate governance index and the market valuation. When the sub-indices are considered, we find that only the board of directors and the audit committee sub-indices are associated positively and significantly with accounting performance. However, we find that only the audit committee sub-index is associated negatively and significantly with market valuation.
P21|Agriculture, structural change and socially responsible development in China and Vietnam|This path-breaking book investigates the challenges of realizing the Asian century. Prosperity in Asia does not only mean economic growth; the issues of public health, sanitation, income equality, the social safety net and efficient use of natural resources are also important. It argues for new policy initiatives in social, environmental and natural resource areas of South, Southeast and East Asia.
P21|Structural Reforms and Growth in Transition: A Meta-Analysis|The present fiscal difficulties of many countries amplify the call for structural reforms. To provide stylized facts on how reforms worked in the past, we quantitatively review 60 studies estimating the relation between reforms and growth. These studies examine structural reforms carried out in 26 transition countries around the world. Our results show that an average reform caused substantial costs in the short run, but had strong positive effects on long-run growth.

P21|Fiscal Residuum and Localization of Foreign Direct Investments among Chinese Provinces|This paper examines the impact of fiscal residuum¡ªthe excess of expenditure benefits over tax burdens¡ªon the location choice of foreign direct investments among China¡¯s provinces. Using data provided by the National Bureau of Statistics of China we propose two fiscal residuum indexes for China¡¯s provinces over the period 1998¨C2004. According to Buchanan¡¯s original definition of fiscal residuum a first index is given by the difference between government expenditure and revenue. A second index measures enterprises¡¯ net fiscal benefit and is calculated as the difference between public expenditure that affect business activities and taxes paid by enterprises. We found that the first index does not significantly affect the FDI localization choice while the second one positively affects it. When looking at different subsets of provinces we found that for eastern provinces the first index has a positive and significant effect. These results confirm the role of the net fiscal benefit as a determinant of FDI inflows at the provincial level.
P21|"Re-thinking of ""Chintanakan Mai"" (new thinking) : new perspective for understanding Lao PDR"|"To date, many previous studies have viewed ""Chintanakan Mai"" (New Thinking), which was introduced in 1986, as one of the most important factors required for understanding present-day Laos. They tend to see the year 1986 as a watershed in Lao history and divide the history after 1975 into two periods before and after 1986: a period of socialism and a period of reform or market economy, respectively. Therefore, they are likely to see the current changes in Laos as the result or achievement of the reform started in 1986. The year 1986 is always a starting point for understanding Laos today. However, I suggest a different perspective and attempt to re-examine ""Chintanakan Mai."" ""Chintanakan Mai"" is not a watershed in Lao history, but rather a temporary slogan to advance postwar reconstruction. In this paper, I try to establish a new perspective for understanding Laos today."

P21|Aspects Regarding The Evolution Of Social Protection In Romania|In order to form a prosperous national social protection system we must know its evolution. Obviously, to elaborate an efficient policy on the development of the social protection system an important role lies in the practice study accumulated in the past. In the article the author reflects on the development of social insurance system, policies on social protection, the formation and distribution of financial and material resources.
P21|The Trends Of Food Consumption In The Process Of Property Relations Transformation In Ukraine’S Agriculture|The article highlights the necessity of studying the level of food consumption in the context of major changes of property relations in agriculture. It was suggested to use the ratio of food consumption adequate per person as an important indicator of socio-economic efficiency of reforms in the agriculture sector. Also, it is performed a characteristic of the reforming stages of property relations in agriculture from the standpoint of the dynamics of the country’s food security indicators.
P21|Policies for Inclusive Urbanisation in China|Urbanisation in China has long been held back by various restrictions on land and internal migration but has taken off since the 1990s, as these impediments started to be gradually relaxed. People have moved in large numbers to richer cities, where productivity is higher and has increased further thanks to agglomeration effects. In the process, the rural-urban income differential has narrowed. Urbanisation also entails costs, however, notably in the form of congestion, all the more so as public transport provision has not kept up. Demand for living space is set to continue to increase as living standards improve, putting pressure on land prices. This can be offset by relaxing the very stringent restrictions on the use of agricultural land for building. For migrants to better integrate in the cities where they work, their access and that of their families to education, health and other social services must continue to improve, in particular via further changes to the registration system, coupled with more market-based rules on land ownership and use. Comment favoriser une urbanisation plus inclusive en Chine Alors que l’urbanisation était depuis longtemps freinée en Chine par diverses restrictions appliquées au marché foncier et aux migrations internes, elle s’intensifie depuis que ces obstacles ont commencé à être progressivement levés dans les années 90. Les villes plus riches, caractérisées par une productivité élevée et en constante progression du fait des économies d’échelle générées par l’urbanisation, enregistrent un afflux massif de migrants. Parallèlement, l’écart de revenus entre zones rurales et urbaines s’est resserré. Néanmoins, l’urbanisation a aussi un coût, notamment illustré par les problèmes de congestion, aggravés par le développement insuffisant de l’offre de transports publics. La demande de surface habitable devrait rester orientée à la hausse sous l’effet de l’amélioration du niveau de vie, ce qui exercera une pression sur les prix des terrains. Cette pression peut être atténuée en assouplissant les restrictions très sévères appliquées à l’usage des terres agricoles à des fins de construction. Pour veiller à une meilleure intégration des migrants dans les villes où ils travaillent, il faut continuer à améliorer leur accès et celui de leurs familles à l’éducation, aux soins de santé et aux autres types de services sociaux, notamment en poursuivant la réforme du système d’enregistrement et en adoptant une réglementation plus axée sur le marché en ce qui concerne la propriété et l’utilisation des terres.
P21|China's March to Prosperity: Reforms to Avoid the Middle-income Trap|China is well-placed to avoid the so-called “middle-income trap” and to continue to converge towards the more advanced economies, even though growth is likely to slow from near double-digit rates in the first decade of this millennium to around 7% at the 2020 horizon. However, in order to sustain vigorous growth and improve the well-being of most citizens, renewed reform momentum is required in a number of areas. The following ones are discussed in this paper: financial sector liberalisation; strengthening competition in markets for goods and services; education, research and innovation. Progress is also needed in other areas, notably in fostering more socially-inclusive forms of urbanisation and more environmentally-friendly growth. En marche pour la prospérité : Réformer pour poursuivre le rattrapage en Chine La Chine est bien placée pour ne pas rester un pays à revenu intermédiaire et continuer à converger vers les économies les plus avancées, même si la croissance est vraisemblablement amenée à ralentir, passant d’un rythme à deux chiffres pendant la première décennie de ce millénaire à environ 7% à l’horizon 2020. Toutefois, le maintien d’une croissance vigoureuse et améliorant le bien-être de la majorité des citoyens nécessite une accélération des réformes dans un certain nombre de domaines. Sont passés en revue dans ce document : la libéralisation du secteur financier ; renforcer la concurrence sur les marchés des biens et services ; l’éducation, la recherche et l’innovation. Des progrès sont également requis dans d’autres domaines, notamment pour promouvoir des formes d’urbanisation socialement plus inclusives et une croissance plus respectueuse de l’environnement.
P21|Bruno Leoni and the Socialist Economic Calculation Debate|The Italian contribution to the Socialist Economic Calculation Debate (SECD) cannot be limited to the important and fundamental works by Pareto and Barone. In fact, if their contributions are still ambiguous and we have to wait for the Mises’ paper in 1920 in order to get the needed clarifications, during the 1960s Bruno Leoni follows the Austrian footsteps on the topic, stimulating in Italy a great debate. Bruno Leoni’s role is important because of the debate he promotes and the scholars he involves, but also because he places the matter of the socialist economic calculation in the broader context of the rule of law.

P21|Le système territorial d’innovation en Russie : du soviétisme au capitalisme The Territorial Innovation System in Russia: Sovietism to Capitalism|Le système territorial russe hérite d’une grande partie du système territorial de l’URSS. Les Soviétiques ont organisé l’espace selon une logique de planification étatique verticale. La transition économique des années 1990 a permis au marché de rationaliser le système productif russe. Le processus d’innovation soviétique s’en retrouve ainsi grandement touché. La Russie dispose de ressources naturelles abondantes et d’un parc industriel important. Restructurer le système territorial d’innovation devient un enjeu pour l’ensemble des acteurs du processus d’innovation. The Russian territorial system inherits the greatest part of the Soviet territorial system. The Soviets have organized the space according to the vertical state planning. The economic transition in the 1990s allowed the market to rationalize the Russian productive system. The Soviet innovation process is deeply affected. Russia has abundant natural resources and an important industrial park. Rebuild the territorial innovation system is a challenge for all the actors of the innovation process.
P21|Can the Socialist Market Economy in China Adhere to Socialism?|The recent round of debate over Chinaâ€™s state and private economy has fundamentally touched upon whether or not China should abandon or strengthen the socialist elements within the market economy. In this paper, we argue that the debate is, in essence, a continued class struggle in the political and ideological superstructure. Then we discuss the foreseeable future of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) under current political and economic conditions. We will further propose the necessary reforms for the SOEs to move towards a truly socialist form of public ownership.
P21|Measuring asymmetry and persistence in conditional volatility in real output: evidence from three East Asian tigers using a multivariate GARCH approach| We search for evidence of conditional volatility in the quarterly real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates of three East Asian tigers: Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The widely accepted Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (EGARCH)-type model is used to capture the existence of asymmetric volatility and the potential structural break points in the volatility. We find evidence of asymmetry and persistence in the volatility of GDP growth rates. It is noted that the structural breakpoints of volatility correspond reasonably well to the historical economic and political events in these economies. Policy implications from our findings are discussed.
P21|Myanmar's two decades of partial transition to a market economy: a negative legacy for the new government| Despite more than two decades of transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy, Myanmar's economic transition is still only partly complete. The government's initial strategy for dealing with the swelling deficits of the state economic enterprises (SEEs) was to put them under direct control in order to scrutinise their expenditure. This policy change postponed restructuring and exacerbated the soft budget constraint problem of the SEEs. While the installation of a new government in March 2011 has increased prospects for economic development, sustainable growth still requires full-scale structural reform of the SEEs and institutional infrastructure building. Myanmar can learn from the gradual approaches to economic transition in China and Vietnam, where partial reforms weakened further impetus for reforms.
P21|China's Unfinished State-owned Enterprise Reforms|This article discusses China’s incremental approach to SOE reform, the difficulties of continuing this approach as the need to make efficiency gains across all sectors of the economy becomes more acute, and future reform options and the challenges in carrying them out.

P21|The emerging structure of Russian urban systems: a classification based on Self-Organizing Maps|This paper argues that there is a complex socio-economic, spatial and political trend towards increasing unevenness among Russian cities against the shortage of researches about Russian urbanized space. In addition to this Russia experiences a lack of studies taking into account that, in modern globalized world, cities are considered as a power machine stimulating the country's development. The urban researches on Russian cities mainly are focusing on Moscow and Saint Petersburg, or on some regional capitals and cities hosting mega-events such as Vladivostok and Sochi. As a matter of fact, a considerable part of Russian cities have lost themselves in the new market conditions since the general vector of urban development has changed after the USSR breakup. Great transformations have occurred in both inter and intra urban levels. The disparity of country's development has increased: European Russia and Northern regions with rich oil and gas deposits are becoming more affluent, while Far East and Siberian regions are undergoing population loss and resources outflows. In spite of contemporary Russian policy is mainly focused on the national and regional issues, world economy is more and more aware that cities are the growth poles for a whole country. Therefore an updated development policy demands a re-scaling at the urban level and requires a precise analysis of urban condition and dynamics. The paper aims to classify the whole Russian urban system on the base of some socio-economic characteristics: demographic dynamics, housing quality, economic performance at two temporal thresholds. The adopted method, the Neural Network Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), is able to single out groups of cities with high internal resemblance. The paper starts with a brief overview of the urban networks formation during soviet period, its transformation after the breakup of the USSR and the consequences of these two processes for the contemporary cities. The second section explains the data which will be used for the analysis and describes the used SOM algorithm. The subsequent section presents the analysis of the results describing spatial urban patterns in terms of quantities and geographical characteristics. The conclusions discuss the nature of those patterns. Due to SOM implementation it has been possible to identify twenty five groups of cities, with similar socio-economic trends during the last decade, where each group is characterized by an appropriate profile (a codebook). Moreover the empirical results have allowed sketching a new urban hierarchy in Russia, outlining four layers: 'urban engine', 'strong cities'; 'potential cities' and 'weak cities'. The outcomes will allow the definition of appropriate urban development strategies.
P21|China's evolving green planning system: Are targets the answer?|China's national leaders have recently set ambitious goals to restructure and diversify the economy towards a more resource-efficient and sustainable growth path. To address the growing national environment and energy concerns, leaders introduced several binding environmental targets for government departments and large enterprises. The heavy reliance on a target-based implementation approach raises questions about the effectiveness of this strategy in the short and long run for environmental governance in China. Based on fieldwork in Jiangsu, Hunan, and Shandong provinces in 2012, this paper studies the desirable and undesirable outcomes of binding environmental targets in China's evolving green planning system. This paper argues that environmental targets have a signaling function that has resulted in ecological issues movement onto local governments' core policy agendas. However, in the nascent green planning system, classic planning problems have generated undesirable consequences such that that environmental targets are not always achieving their intended goals. Strategic and cyclical behavior by local government officials in leadership positions often lead to short-term maximization actions instead of long-term innovative environmental management. This analysis of local leaders' responses to top-down targets aims to generate a more realistic picture of what binding environmental targets can and cannot achieve.
P21|Religious Identity, Public Goods and Centralization: Evidence from Russian and Israeli Cities|In this paper, we analyze the effects of religious identity – defined both as personal identification with a religious tradition and institutional ideas on the provision of public goods – on attitudes toward central government. We explore whether citizens belonging to collectivist rather than individualist religious denominations are more likely to evaluate their central government positively. Moreover, we explore whether adherence to collectivist norms of economic and political organization leads to a positive evaluation of central government. Surveys were conducted in Russia and Israel as these countries provide a mosaic of three major world religions – Judaism, Eastern Orthodoxy and Sunni Islam.

We find strong support for the proposition that collectivist norms and an institutional religious identity enhance positive attitudes towards central government.
P21|A political theory of Russian orthodoxy: Evidence from public goods experiments|In this paper, I test the effects of religious norms on the provision of public goods. My evidence is drawn from public goods experiments that I ran with regional bureaucrats in Tomsk and Novosibirsk, Russia. I introduce three treatments, which I define as degrees of Eastern Orthodox collectivist enforcement: 1. Solidarity, 2. Obedience, and 3. Universal discipline. I argue for the existence of an Eastern Orthodox hierarchy in the Russian bureaucracy that facilitates the delivery of public goods under conditions of universal discipline and the principal´s overfulfillment. Eastern Orthodox hierarchy is enforced through universal disciplinary monitoring, which induces collective punishment when the public good is not delivered. Contrary to conventional wisdom about freeriding in administrative institutions, higher ranks in Russian bureaucracies are associated with less freeriding.
P21|Religious origins of democracies and dictatorships|In this paper, I argue that religion matters for the emergence of democracies and dictatorships. Religion is defined as a stochastically set demand for public goods. Different types of religious collectives reflect different tradeoffs between centralized resource distribution and market rewards. Religions are defined as collectivist, when their respective collectives facilitate the hierarchical provision of common pool resources toward their members at the expense of market incentives. Religions are defined as individualist, when their respective collectives recruit and preserve their members on the basis of market incentives. Islam, Orthodoxy and Catholicism are treated as collectivist religions, whereas Judaism and Protestantism as individualist ones. I provide a historical overview that designates the Jewish kibbutz as the collective of democracy and the Russian-Orthodox monastery as the collective of dictatorship. Assuming a collectivist economy, I solve the radical government and modernization stochastic games. I find that modernization occurs in a collectivist economy when the threat of a radical government is imminent and when the leader has high extraction rents over the economy. In order to stay in power, the leader credibly commits to provide more public goods in the future, and thus modernization occurs. Underdevelopment occurs at intermediate levels of state enforcement, modernization at low levels and centralization at high levels of state enforcement. The emergence of a radical government is more likely in a collectivist rather than in an individualist economy.
P21|Food availability, food entitlements, and radicalism during the Chinese great leap forward famine: an econometric panel data analysis|The purpose of this article is to investigate the socio-economic as well as the political, institutional, and ideological causes of the Chinese famine of 1959–1961. The main hypothesis of this paper is that the radical policies implemented as part of the Great Leap Forward resulted in agricultural output decline (i.e., availability issues), and in the implementation of an ineffective food distribution policy affecting rural populations (i.e., accessibility issues). An econometric analysis, based on provincial panel data from the 1954–1966 period, stresses the effect of ill-advised economic policies in handling the famine. This analysis also confirms that the increase in mortality rates during the famine was caused by the simultaneous collapse in food availability and food accessibility in rural areas.
P21|Impact and Response to the Financial Crisis: Comparing the EU and China Policies|This article, in a comparative approach, assesses the impact of governments’ policies both in the EU and in China to handle the impact of the international financial crisis. Europe, recovered quickly from the crisis, but it continues to experience low overall macro-economic performance, with noticeable variations among the EU’s 27 member-nations and the 17 Eurozone members. Debt levels and unemployment rates remain relatively high, and European authorities are forced to look for a balance between fighting inflation by raising interest rates and supporting demand, which necessitates a more permissive policy. The collateral impact of the financial crisis on Europe resulted in a currency crisis that endangered the euro and was caused by Maastricht mechanisms for convergence and stability that regulate the functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). China quickly returned to a high growth rate that was fueled by the implementation of vast expansionist policies by the national and provincial governments. After a brief recession, the Chinese economy very rapidly resumed its high performance levels in terms of GDP growth, trade balance, and currency reserves. The Chinese economy’s recovery from raises questions about its ability to change its growth model by abandoning a model based on promoting exports and on heavy investments in infrastructures, particularly in economic sectors that are not always productive, a strategy that creates a drain on households, whose savings finance the current growth model.
P21|Ekonomické reformy v Kórejskej ľudovodemokratickej republike|Príspevok je venovaný osobitostiam ekonomického vývoja KĽDR, jej geografickým podmienkam, histórii, nastoleniu politickej diktatúry a centrálne plánovanej ekonomiky, vplyvu jednotlivých severokórejských vodcov Kim Il Sunga, Kim Čong Ila a Kim Čong Una na ekonomiku krajiny. Popri ekonomických podmienkach sa venujeme i politickým a medzinárodným politickým podmienkam ekonomického rozvoja KĽDR. Severokórejská ekonomika zaznamenávala po Druhej svetovej vojne vysoké tempo hospodárskeho rastu spojené s industrializáciou. Postupne degradovala a v 90. rokoch 20. storočia došlo k jej kolapsu pod vplyvom dlhodobo negatívnych ekonomických podmienok a krátkodobo negatívnych prírodných podmienok. Vedenie krajiny bolo nútené začať realizovať ekonomické reformy v 90. rokoch a následne v roku 2002. V súvislosti so zmenami v riadení štátu po nástupe najmladšieho člena dynastie Kimovcov (2012) načrtávame v príspevku ďalší možný ekonomický vývoj v krajine. Nádejou pre realizáciu ďalších ekonomických reforiem v KĽDR je prijatie “Nový systém ekonomického riadenia 28. júla“ parlamentom krajiny v roku 2012.
P21|The Business Environment in the Transition|Following the collapse of planning, new small and medium-sized firms rapidly emerged in all transition economies. Using firm level data, we investigate the interaction between the widespread opportunities for new business activities such firms faced and their business environment. The business environment includes physical infrastructure, the availability of an educated labour force, provision of administrative and judicial services, the control of corruption and crime, and the stability of the macroeconomic environment. By comparing how different elements of the business environment affected firms in formerly planned economies with those in economies outside transition, we document not only the challenges faced by transition firms but also the effects of the planning legacy.
P21|Staged privatization: A market process with multistage lockups|Most privatizations around the world take the form of staged privatization with multistage lockups and step-by-step unlocking of shares. A lockup prevents the shares of a company from being sold to the public for a specified or unspecified period of time. This paper presents a theory and provides empirical evidence for staged privatization under market forces. The theory is based on a specification of a lockup effect on demand, where the existence of this lockup effect is shown by our empirical analysis. With this theory, we can analyze how various factors, such as the lockup effect, demand elasticity, growth potential and business fluctuations, affect staged privatization, in particular, the equilibrium speed of privatization. Our paper is the first to analyze a market-oriented, multistage privatization process, instead of a fully government-controlled or centrally planned process. Interestingly, staged privatization resembles initial public offerings (IPOs). Hence, our study can shed light on IPOs from a unique angle. Our empirical analysis provides evidence in support of our theoretical findings.
P21|Inequality and reforms in transition countries|Distributional patterns evolved quite differently and stabilized at diversified levels across the Central–Eastern European and former Soviet Union countries which underwent transition. In this paper we provide an overview of income inequality dynamics for 22 transition countries from 1989 to 2008 and of the explanations and interpretations proposed by the main literature. We then highlight that while the effects of different transition approaches on output dynamics and other macroeconomic aggregates have been largely analysed, scarce attention has been devoted so far to their impact on distributive patterns. However, this kind of analysis might usefully contribute to complete the complex picture of the many social, economic and structural factors affected by transition and provide useful policy insights for those countries still experiencing deep institutional change.
P21|Entrerpreneurial Catch Up And New Industrial Competence Bloc Formation In The Baltic Sea Region|Historically, the Baltic Sea Region (BSR) has been an institutionally homogeneous economy, integrated economically and culturally through the sea lanes of the Baltic. After WWII the BSR was broken up into a dual economy, consisting of a poor Soviet block of centrally planned economies, on the one hand, and the industrially advanced BSR economies Finland, Denmark, Germany and Sweden, on the other. 1990 saw the break up of the soviet political system. The liberated, but poor formerly planned economies were left to restore their institutions on their own to that of a market organization. 60 years of Soviet isolation had left the formerly planned BSR economies in an industrially backward state. Critical market functions did not exist, and corrupt institutions made normal business life impossible. Catch up with Western industrial economies therefore became a policy priority. During the 1970s also Western economies introduced elements of central planning in their industrial policy repertoires on the belief that it would improve economic performance. Policies to support “plans” by definition meant restrictions on entrepreneurial activity. By the Soviet break up, however, stagnation had also brought the need for entrepreneurship onto the policy agenda of Western nations. Obstacles to economic progress were gradually being dismantled. These shifts in policy attention in turn relate to the current discussion about globally increasing inequality. Are the economies of the world economy converging onto the same national standards of living, as was believed not long ago, or diverging. The industrial dynamics of the BSR pits those two hypotheses against each other. Will the previously centrally planned soviet economies of the BSR catch up with the living standards of the more market governed Western economies, or lag further behind? Perhaps some “mixed” Western economies with large and rigid public production of welfare services have got stuck with problems similar to those of the formerly planned economies? Do some formerly planned economies that have taken on a strong pro market policy agenda exhibit a superior catch up record to those that have not? The contrasting policy experiences among the BSR economies allow us to compare the catch up records in terms of policies chosen. The formerly planned Baltic economies, excepting Russia, were institutionally and industrially roughly on par with Denmark, Finland and Sweden before the Soviet occupation. The industrial backwardness of the formerly planned economies at the time they were liberated was therefore due to constraints on entrepreneurial initiatives, once imposed by the Soviet Union. So by definition there is a policy task of some magnitude to undo that heritage. More precisely asked, central planning in the formerly planned economies stifled entrepreneurial activities. Can the obstacles to catch-up in the transition economies through an entrepreneurially moved reallocation of resources then be overcome through centrally directed policy? If not, which is a key question of this paper, how can the diverse information and knowledge embodied in the agents of markets be mobilized for that task? Who knows best, the central policy maker, supported by his economic advisors, or the collective knowledge of all economic actors as intermediated through dynamically competitive product and factor markets. The historic developments in the BSR have therefore accidentally staged a unique economic policy experiment that allows us to distinguish between the relative roles in economic progress of improvements in local entrepreneurial environments (a policy task) and of individual entrepreneurial action. In carrying out that analysis we draw on the detailed statistical analysis in Braunerhjelm & Eliasson (2011). The Swedish evolutionary micro firm to macro model has provided a theoretical structure, both to support our reasoning on the catch-up dynamics, and to provide quantitative evidence for the empirical evaluation. Empirical research suggests that growth through entrepreneurial new firm formation is a slow process that may however suddenly and unexpectedly gain momentum. The import of new technology is the fast way to catch up. Both forms of innovation and entrepreneurship, however, benefit from the same positive entrepreneurial climate. On this we found that successful catch up among the formerly planned BSR economies still has a long way to go, and that political impatience in waiting for the dividends of economic liberalization to become available may have been destructive. Policy focus should therefore be set on the local entrepreneurial environments which are in great need of continued improvements to support both new firm formation for long run development, and to induce immediate FDI for the short term. More flexible labor markets will be required to support continued reallocation of resources from inefficient “soviet” installations to productive businesses of western quality. Significant remaining obstacles to trade and ownership transactions across BSR internal borders will have to be removed, so success in catch up should be expected to differ significantly among the BSR countries. We therefore propose a policy competition among those countries in improving their entrepreneurial environments to beat each other in catch-up performance. This policy competition is best enacted individually, without any delaying cooperation among the competing economies and, if individually enacted in a competitive spirit, will benefit both the winners and the entire BSR economy.
P21|Economic Freedom and Institutional Convergence|Francis Fukuyama argues that liberal democracy is the final form of human government and will become more and more prevalent in the long term. If this prediction is true, countries should converge in their political and economic systems toward liberal democracy, a form of institutional convergence. In this paper, we examine whether there is convergence in economic institutions, drawing on the literatures of economic convergence and of industrial organization. We use the Economic Freedom of the World-index over the period 1970-2009 to proxy for economic institutions. Our results indicate that countries with lower institutional quality experience faster institutional change than countries with higher quality, i.e., we observe institutional convergence. But countries with lower institutional quality have higher variability of institutional change. Using distributional analysis, we examine institutional transition probabilities, and find that the probability of a country ending up with high-quality institutions is high in the long-run. These findings support Fukuyama's prediction.
P21|What Did the Study of Transition Economies Contribute to Mainstream Economics?|Basing on examples this paper shows that the experience of the post-communist transition, and the policy-related and academic discussion about it, have made a useful contribution to mainstream economics. In particular, such issues as the role of the state and social policy, institutions and banking system in economic development were reconsidered. The new perspectives on the issue of the efficiency of privatization, path dependence, and the role of political elites in institutional reforms were developed. The author shows which of the recommendations provided by international organizations proved to be inadequate and why.

P21|Вашингтонски Консензус И Деиндустријализација Источне И Југоисточне Европе<BR>[Washington’s Consensus and Disindustrialization of the Eastern and South-Eastern Europe]|English. The paper considers the problems of the results of the reforms in so called post-comunist countries, they on Washington’s consensus are based. Them caracterise mostly three key points – privatization, deregulation and macroeconomic stability. Except the little cases, this countries realized deep and long-run economic fall, followed by similar processes in other spheres. Contrary to ordinary opinions that tranzition crisis show as result of inconsistency in reforms taking, the paper says this is normaly its result. As an analogue is the Morgenthau’s plan for West Germany observed, that has promoted Germany to industrial disarmament, and that would lead to its poverty and its transformation into raw material basis for the developed economies, and according to these to impossibility of survival of the existing number of population. Fortunately for the Germany, after scrupulous analysis Morgenthau’s plan was abandonen and Marshall’s plan was introduced. It lead to industrial renewal of Germany. For the countries of Eastern and South-Eastern Europe it is necessary the same: abandon neoliberal konception based on Washington consensus and implement conception of industrialization. Serbian. У раду се разматрају резултати остварени током дводеценијског спровођења реформи у тзв. посткомунистичким земљама, заснованих на Вашингтонском консензусу, односно прев свега на његовим трима кључним тачкама – приватизација, дерегулација и макроекономска стабилизација. Уз мање изузетке, ове земље забележиле су дубок и дуготрајан економски пад, праћен негативним процесима и у другим сферама. Насупрот уобичајеним мишљењима да је дугогодишња транзициона криза резултат недоследности у спровођењу реформи, у раду се истиче да је она управо супротно њихов закономеран резултат и да другачије и није могло да буде. Као аналог истиче се Моргентауов план за Западну Немачку, којим је након Другог светског рата било предвиђено да Немачка буде индустријски разоружана, што би водило њеном сиромашењу и претварању у сировински додатак другим развијеним привредама, и што би сходно томе условило немогућност опстанка њеног тадашњег броја становника. На срећу по Немачку, Моргентауов план је након скрупулозне анализе напуштен и замењен Маршаловим планом који јој је обезбедио индустријску обнову. И за земље источне и југоисточне Европе потребно је исто: напуштање (неолибералне) концепције засноване на Вашингтонском консензусу који их је деиндустријализовао и примена концепције (ре)индустријализације.
P21|Russia In Period of Transition From Socialism To Capitalism: What Sort A Capitalism?|With the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the official declaration of the transition from socialism to capitalism, Russia, both in terms of its economic potential and population and in terms of its inheritance of a strict centralist system has a special standing among transitional economies. Having undertaken a “shock” transition to capitalism under the leadership of the International Monetary Fund, this period was quite painful. Within a short time, the country underwent one of its most severe and painful crisis in 1998. Far beyond a transition from socialism to capitalism, bearing the multi-dimensional change in cultural, political and policy areas coupled with a complex process in mind, this transition was no doubt much more difficult and sensitive for a nation like Russia that had a rooted socialist tradition. This reality when combined with a “shock therapy” strategy based on neo-classical prescriptions that guided this process did not take into account the particular condition of the nation together with standard reform policies that ignored institutional change, it became inevitable to question what type of a system came about in Russia. In this context, the purpose of this study is to examine whether the policies put into the implementation within the axis of a basic strategy that was chosen during the transition period did in fact create a capitalist system or not in Russia.
P21|Is There a Central Asia? State Visits and an Empirical Delineation of the Region’s Boundaries|This article assesses the extent to which post-Soviet Central Asia is emerging as an interactive regional subsystem focused more on problems and actors within the region than on those outside the region. The answer to this question has important implications for policy, because in the presence of a strong subsystem the important sources of change in the region cannot be exclusively domestic in nature. Yet no empirical analysis of the international relations of the Central Asian states in any systematic way exists. In this article, I delineate the regional boundaries of Central Asia using intergovernmental visits data to uncover whether the region serves as an entree point for analysis. I analyze the results of the visits data using three structural models to assess the degree of fit for each. The findings suggest that a highly interactive subsystem does not yet exist; instead a Moscow-centric subsystem of interactions still persists in the region.
P21|Growth in Transition Countries: Big Bang versus Gradualism|This paper analyses the impact of the speed of transition reforms on economic growth in transition countries in the context of the debate big-bang versus gradualist approach. It builds a new indicator for the speed of transition reforms based on a three-way principal component analysis. It shows that: (i) the speed of transition reforms Granger-causes economic growth and there is no reverse causation; (ii) the impact of contemporaneous speed of transition reforms on economic growth is negative but becomes positive in the longer horizon; and (iii) other factors, such as initial conditions and macroeconomic stabilization program, also drive economic growth. While the first two results are robust to different estimators, the impact of control variables depends on the econometric specification.
P21|Azerbaijan Transport Sector 2011|The report evaluates progress achieved in implementation of structural reforms of the transport sector in Azerbaijan in the following subsectors: railways, road transport and roads, air transport and airports, maritime transport and ports. It presents standardized and qualitative indicators that assess the level of the transport sector reforms in three areas: 1) commercialization and privatization, 2) tariff policy, and 3) institutional and regulatory changes. The aggregated index is calculated on the basis of the 21 indicators that reflects the status of the reforms in each sector at a period under review.
P21|Infrastructure, Knowledge and Economic Growth in China: 1953–2004|This paper evaluates the economic development of China using the New Economic Geography (NEG) as a framework of analysis. The NEG addresses the formation of agglomeration economies accruing to physical linkages in one location leading to the formation of a coreperiphery pattern between the regions of a country. However, the NEG cannot account for the role of knowledge creation linkages which are location independent in the formation of the core-periphery pattern. The main findings of this paper are that the formation of the coreperiphery pattern predicted by the NEG depends upon government economic and development policy at a point in time. Furthermore, while the NEG does not allow for knowledge creation to be involved in the formation of the core-periphery pattern, this paper shows that once the core-periphery pattern is formed, the knowledge creation process sustains it. This paper also supports the hypothesis that investment in infrastructure and fixed assets, which has been concentrated in China due to the nature of the Special Economic Zones in the Coastal regions, and the interdependence between different types of infrastructure leads to the formation of the core-periphery pattern.
P21|Credit Constraints, Job Mobility, and Entrepreneurship: Evidence from a Property Reform in China| This paper provides new evidence on the impact of private property rights and employer-provided housing on entrepreneurship. I find an increase in self-employment following a reform in urban China that allowed state employees who were renting state-owned housing the opportunity to buy their homes at subsidized prices. I develop a model of job choice to test two mechanisms that might explain how the reform increased entrepreneurship. I find evidence that the reform reduced labor mobility costs and alleviated credit constraints by allowing households to capitalize on the value of the real estate. © 2012 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
P21|The Fundamental Institutions of China's Reforms and Development|"China's economic reforms have resulted in spectacular growth and poverty reduction. However, China's institutions look ill-suited to achieve such a result, and they indeed suffer from serious shortcomings. To solve the ""China puzzle,"" this paper analyzes China's institution—a regionally decentralized authoritarian system. The central government has control over personnel, whereas subnational governments run the bulk of the economy; and they initiate, negotiate, implement, divert, and resist reforms, policies, rules, and laws. China's reform trajectories have been shaped by regional decentralization. Spectacular performance on the one hand and grave problems on the other hand are all determined by this governance structure. (JEL O17, O18, O43, P21, P25, P26)"
P21|Lean Management In Banking|The main objective of this study is to clarify the concept of Lean Management by describing the system and the key concepts and techniques that underline its implementation. The study shows what organizations, in particular commercial banks, can gain from Lean Management. To achieve this objective, it has been conceived a comparative study of Lean Management using available literature, critical analysis and professional experience of the author. The implementation of a Lean Management program in a bank will result in a Lean Organization (less waste, less bureaucracy, but more employee knowledge and empowerment, more productivity, more satisfied customers). As practical implications, the study shows how to address change, how to implement Lean in different parts of business. The originality and value of the study comes from the suggestions that are made regarding concepts and methods that would contribute a Lean Organization through an integrated program.
P21|The Land that Lean Manufacturing Forgot? Management Practices in Transition Countries|We have conducted the first survey on management practices in transition countries. We found that Central Asian transition countries, such as Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, have on average very poor management practices. Their average scores are below emerging countries such as Brazil, China and India. In contrast, the central European transition countries such as Poland and Lithuania operate with management practices that are only moderately worse than those of western European countries such as Germany. Since we find these practices are strongly linked to firm performance, this suggests poor management practices may be impeding the development of Central Asian transition countries. We find that competition, multinational ownership, private ownership and human capital are all strongly correlated with better management. This implies that the continued opening of markets to domestic and foreign competition, privatisation of state-owned firms and increased levels of workforce education should promote better management, and ultimately faster economic growth.
P21|Der Umbau der Bundesanstalt/Bundesagentur für Arbeit zum modernen Dienstleister|"Die Reform der Bundesagentur für Arbeit (BA) war und ist ein schwieriger Weg. Ausgelöst wurden die Reformen durch eine tendenziell negative Entwicklung des Arbeitsmarktes Anfang des neuen Jahr Jahrtausends. Spätestens nach den gravierenden weltwirtschaftlichen Folgen des 11. September 2001, welche unmittelbare Auswirkungen auf den Arbeitsmarkt in Deutschland hatten und dem ""Vermittlungsskandal"" bei der damaligen BA waren tiefgreifende Änderungen in der Struktur und Organisation unumgänglich. Daher setzte die Bundesregierung am 22. Februar 2002 eine Kommission, unter dem Vorsitz von Dr. h. c. Peter Hartz, ein, welche ein neues Gesamtkonzept zur Reform der BA entwickeln sollte. Die Ergebnisse der sogenannten ""Hartz-Kommission"" den und der lange Weg des Umbaus der BA von einer Behörde zu einem modernen Dienstleister werden in diesem Beitrag beschrieben. Dabei gehe ich zunächst auf die Gesamtsituation des Arbeitsmarktes in Deutschland zu Beginn des neuen Jahrtausends ein. Anschließend werden die zentralen Programme und Steuerungsmodelle der BA-Reform erläutert. Der Beitrag schließt mit Anmerkungen zur zukünftigen Ausrichtung der BA."
P21|The case of transition economies: what institutions matter for growth?|There is a consensus among scholars that institutions (i.e. norms and regulations) are country specific. The article aims to contribute to the debate by examining what types of institutions have been most important for growth in transition countries. It employs a new set of institutional variables of the World Bank against the commonly used transition index of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. It appears that among the institutional variables government effectiveness has the most significant impact on growth in former planned economies. At the same time, classical growth factors seem to be more important for growth than institutions.

However, at this stage, the classical growth factors such as investment and export turn out to be more important for growth than institutions.
P21|Russia’s Economic Policy in 2010: Quest for Innovations|The austerity vs stimulus discussion among economists and politicians is gaining momentum. Not surprisingly, both parties are actively appealing to the memory of John Maynard Keynes who, indeed, put forth the idea of economic stimulus but never recommended that it be used on a scale as massive as that in the 1970s, when Richard Nixon declared himself a ‘Keynesian’ and pursued state intervention policies under the guise of Keynesianism.
P21|Crisis económicas y cambio institucional en España: de la gran depresión a la crisis de 2008|This paper discusses the economic crises in Spain, from the Great Depression to current recession. Institutional economics offers the theoretical framework for identifying and analyzing the institutions and the rules of the game that have triggered or aggravated the economic crises. This work identifies the institutional changes, caused by economic depressions, which have determined the path dependence of Spanish economy during the last century. In addition, this article analyzes in historical perspective three factors relevant for the institutional environment of the Spanish economy: the Stabilization Plan of 1959, the democratic Spanish transition and Spain joined the European Economic Community. They all have direct effects on policy-making of the country.
P21|Varieties of System Transformations and Their Structural Background Based on the IPS Model|This study is the theoretical chapter of a planned book. This book, aims to contribute to the theoretical foundations of similarities and differences in the transformation of party-state systems. Analytical framework of system transformation is based on the extension of the Interactive Party State model (Csan di, 2006) where specifics of the structure and operation of party-state systems and structural background of their disparities were described and analyzed. Self-similarities and disparities of transformation and path-dependency of the variety of systemic outcomes are assigned to structural characteristics of power distribution of party-state systems interpreted as networks. The empirical part of the book uses the Chinese case to test this theory, measuring the dynamics of system transformation, the consequences of short- and long-term external adaptation pressures on the system transformation and long-term consequences of the short-term reactions to these pressures and their spatial disparities. This research was supported by the National Research Foundation in Hungary.
P21|Changes in Occupational Demand Structure and their Impact on Individual Wages|This paper estimates wage losses arising due to changes in the structure of demand for occupations. The data on occupational changes made for the sake of adjustment to the changes in the demand structure come from the German reunification of 1990. Endogenous occupational changes are instrumented by the post-reunification demand properties of the occupation of the apprenticeship completed in the GDR. The IV computation reveals a negative wage effect of nearly 35 log points in 1991/92. This effect is persistent over time - after almost 10 years after reunification the negative wage effect associated with occupational changes due to the relocation of individual human capital across occupations is more than 20 log points.
P21|A Generalized Fact and Model of Long-Run Economic Growth: Kaldor Fact as a Special Case|This paper provides new evidence on the long-run relationship between economic growth and labor's share in national income, based on a comprehensive panel data set for 123 countries from 1950 to 2004. Xie's primary finding is that labor's share follows a cubic relationship with real GDP per capita over the long process of development. At the beginning of the modern economic growth process, the share of labor in national income first decreases until an initial threshold is reached. After that, labor's share keeps increasing until the country's GDP per capita reaches a second threshold before falling again. Xie argues that these dynamics apply not only to the less developed countries in the postwar years, but also to the advanced countries like the United States and the United Kingdom during their early economic take-offs, starting in the late 18th and 19th century, respectively. Finally, he proposes a two-sector constant elasticity of substitution (CES)-type growth model and simulate the model to replicate and explain the possible mechanism behind such a nonlinear pattern of movements in labor's share.
P21|The Value of Business Networks in Emerging Economies: An Analysis of Firms' External Financing Opportunities|The paper argues that networked firms are likely to have an advantage in securing external finance in countries with weak legal and judicial institutions since it helps financial institutions to minimize the underlying agency costs of lending. An analysis of recent BEEPS data from fifteen Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries lends some support to this hypothesis. Even after controlling for other factors, firms affiliated to business associations are more likely to secure bank finance. Importance of being associated with business networks is particularly evident among firms who borrow from private domestic and foreign banks, as these new banks attempt to minimize costs of adverse selection. Networking however discriminates against the small and medium sized firms' access to bank loans in the CEE regions. Results are robust in both single cross-section and panel data analyses.
P21|Can we relate economic performance to policy unambiguously?: Lessons from the experiences of Latin America, East Asia, China and India|Economic policies influence the economic performance of a country. Policymakers are often trying to form the types of policies which countries should adopt in order to develop. But what types of policies is a question arises always. What is the role of policy in economic performance? This paper is an attempt to check whether we can infer about policy on the basis of economic performance. By analyzing the experiences of Latin America, East Asia, China and India we found that there is no unique universal policy which is consistent in all situations. Success of a particular policy not only lies on the policy taken but also on the characteristics of the country and its institutional background. The study reaches the conclusion that economic performance cannot be unambiguously related to Policies.
P21|Transformaciona kriza i perspektive privrede Srbije u epohi globalizacije i finansijske krize<BR>[Transformational crisis and perspectives of Serbian economy in the era of globalization and financial crisis]|English Abstract: Paper considers the theoretic foundations, results and perspectives of transition process in Serbian economy. The foundations of that process were the postulats of neoclassical economics, the mainstream in recent world and domestic economic thought. They determined the goal, the methodology, and the ideological basis of transition process, and resulted especially in Washington Consensus, originally formulated by John Williamson in 1989, and that was implemented other among in eastern and south-eastern Europe. The implemented neoclassical proces took the form of either shock-therapy or gradualism, however each approach involved their combination. The results of the reforms, based on Consensus, showed, with some exceptions, that these countries realized deep and long-term economic fall, followed by similar processes in other spheres. Contrary to ordinary opinions that transition crisis show as result of inconsistency in reforms taking, this is normaly its result. As an analogue is the Morgenthau’s plan for West Germany observed, that has promoted Germany to industrial disarmament, and that would lead to its poverty and its transformation into raw material basis for the developed economies, and to impossibility of survival of the existing number of population. Fortunately for the Germany, Morgenthau’s plan was abandoned and Marshall’s plan was introduced. It lead to industrial renewal of Germany. For the transition countries it is also necessary, considering the practice and basic principles of the Other Canon, which have they origins as far as from the economic policy of the king Henry VII, to acess re-industrialization in the same way, which is the necessity for renewall of economies, and for overcoming the long-term crisis. Serbian Abstract: U radu se razmatraju teorijski osnovi, rezultati i perspektive procesa tranzicije privrede Srbije. Osnove ovog procesa činili su postulati neoklasične ekonomije, glavnog toka u današnjoj svetskoj i domaćoj ekonomskoj misli. Oni su opredelili cilj, metodologiju i ideološku osnovu tranzicionog procesa, i rezultovali su Vašingtonskim konsenzusom, kojeg je originalno formulisao Džon Vilijamson 1989, i koji je primenjen i na zemlje istočne i jugoistočne Evrope. Primenjeni neoklasični model uzimao je oblike šok-terapije ili gradualizma, ali je ipak svaki pristup inkorporirao njihovu kombinaciju. Rezultati reformi u ovim zemljama, zasnovanih na Konsenzusu, pokazuju, uz manje izuzetke, dubok i dugotrajan ekonomski pad, uz negativne procese i u drugim sferama. Nasuprot uobičajenim mišljenjima da je tranziciona kriza rezultat nedoslednosti u sprovođenju reformi, ona je upravo suprotno njihov zakonomeran rezultat. Kao analog ističe se Morgentauov plan za Z. Nemačku, kojim je nakon Drugog svetskog rata bilo predviđeno da ona bude industrijski razoružana, što bi vodilo njenom siromašenju i pretvaranju u sirovinski dodatak razvijenim privredama, ali time i onemogućilo opstanak tadašnjeg broja stanovnika. Na sreću po Nemačku, Morgentauov plan je zamenjen Maršalovim koji joj je obezbedio industrijsku obnovu. I za tranzicione zemlje potrebno je, u skladu s postavkama i praksom Drugog kanona, koji potiče od ekonomske politike kralja Henrija VII, pristupiti reindustrijalizaciji, kao nužnom uslovu oživljavanja privreda i izlaska iz dugotrajne krize.
P21|The financial instruments used by international financial institutions (IFIs) regarding the Southeast European countries: a critical assessment of their underlying philosophy and orientation|After the fall of the communist regimes in the Southeast European countries, what was attempted was a systemic transformation which was called transition. The economic transition aimed at transforming the nature of economic relations, since their coordination would be passed from the state to market mechanisms. In order to enable this transformation, what was necessary was to finance the attempted changes. However, since the countries in the region lacked sufficient equity capital, they resorted to foreign borrowing and, thus, international finance has to date been the main source of capital. The involvement of International Financial Institutions (IFIs) in the transition process was almost direct but after the cessation of hostilities in Kosovo in 1999 there has been a dramatic increase in financing throughout the area. The level of financing in conjunction with the immediate and increasing needs of countries was the main factors that configured the balance of powers among recipient countries and international financial institutions. The implementation of financial policies by Institutions is being conducted by means of specific financial instruments. he present article aims at examining and evaluating the instruments used by institutions to finance the transition of Southeast European countries, as their suitability, orientation and philosophy have been repeatedly questioned. In order to make this assessment feasible, an examination will take place with regard to the financial instruments of the major creditors of the region, namely the IMF (International Monetary Fund) the World Bank Group and the European Union, who are also managers of the vast majority of financings.
P21|To stay or leave: Motives behind the decisions of graduate programs’ trainees’ in European and Russian companies|This paper investigates the problem of retaining business school graduates after they have completed a trainee program in a company. Often when a company invests in training programs for young graduates, the company’s management expects that a graduate will remain with the company for a long time. But in some cases, the trainees decide to leave. This research shows the different perceptions among the trainees and the company of motives or reasons for such a decision. The main findings also indicate a significant difference in the graduates’ preferences in the countries being compared and suggest a list of motives that drive such decision making. Furthermore, managerial applications are given and the possible approaches for future discussions are suggested.
P21|Barriers to co-operation and competitive advantage: cross-border business networks of Saxon and Northern Bohemian firms|Small-scale business co-operation across borders is considered as major driving force of economic integration between Western and Central Eastern Europe. In this context, it is argued that business co-operation and networks support the creation of competitive advantage. This paper sheds new light on this issue by adding a case study of firms in selected East German and Czech border regions. The study focuses on two inter-related research questions: Can firms create competitive advantage in small-scale business co-operation and networks within border regions? And what role is there for the barriers to co-operation that firms encounter? These questions are investigated using a dataset of nearly 60 structured interviews with firms from the cross-border regions.
P21|Knowledge management and organisational culture in higher education institutions|This paper focuses on the higher education area in a small Central European country. Its purpose is to explore the concept of culture, the concept of knowledge management (KM) as well as the correlations among their dimensions at the university level. Since we assume that it is educational personnel who is involved in KM processes, our research covered the teaching staff. Our questionnaire is based on a similar research carried out by Wilkens et al. (2004). The literature is reviewed and the empirical analysis is performed in order to examine and to explain the relationship between organisational culture and knowledge management. The findings presented in the paper can be important for further development of the higher education sector in Central and Eastern European countries as well as for other profit oriented industries.
P21|Social Dividend Based on Overproduction|At present, although there are many cases of governments distributing money to their citizens, the fund sources are still very limited. This paper argues that, with overproduction as the material basis of a social dividend, it is possible to raise funding for this social dividend by issuing currency. This can not only expand the fund sources of the social dividend, but also help to solve the fundamental contradiction of capitalist overproduction and to realize socialism as soon as possible.

P21|Institutional change of the agricultural administration and rural associations in East Germany before and after unification<BR>[Institutioneller Wandel der Agrarverwaltung und ländlicher Verbände in Ostdeutschland vor und nach der Vereinigung]|With the collapse of the socialist regime in East Germany in late 1989 and the rising political call for unification in early 1990, a radical and abrupt change of the institutional structure became necessary. Among others, the (agricultural) administration had to be totally restructured. This referred not only to substance, functions and tasks which had to be adjusted, similar to most other transition economies, to the market-economic and pluralistic democratic system, but also the whole administrative set-up had to be re-established in line with the West German system (territorial re-organisation). Hence, a new administrative system had to be built up in the East, while simultaneously the socialist one had to be dismantled. This transformation process implied the recruitment of new staff and had to be carried out in a very short period. However, different to the other transition economies, there had been strong support from the West in re-organising the administration. Overall, this institutional change seems to have been accomplished successfully as billions of Deutsch Mark could be processed by the agricultural administration in 1990 in order to avoid an imminent collapse of the agricultural sector. In addition, the new administration also comprised the set-up of a specialised agency in charge of state property. This office while originally anticipated to last for a short period only, still operates today. Similarly, the organisations representing the agricultural population had to be re-organised. The re-organisation of the German Farmers' Union is of special prominence as both German parts were representing completely different agricultural models. Nevertheless, this is the only important organisation at national level where East Germans could stay in decision-making positions after unification. This had severe repercussions when shaping transformation policies affecting the agricultural sector in East Germany during the 1990s.
P21|Zur institutionellen Steuerbarkeit von produktivem Unternehmertum im Transformationsprozess Russlands<BR>[On institutional reforms and the allocation of entrepreneurship In Russia’s transition]|Der Transformationsprozess Russlands von einer zentralstaatlich geplanten Volkswirtschaft hin zu einer Marktwirtschaft nach westlichem Vorbild liefert eine aufschlussreiche Fallstudie über die von William Baumol (1990) vertretene These der institutionellen Steuerbarkeit von produktivem Unternehmertum durch einen unabhängigen und wohlmeinenden Staat (Journal of Political Economy 98, S. 893-921). Entgegen Baumols Annahme von der Konstanz des Unternehmertums in Raum und Zeit gibt es empirische und historische Hinweise, dass die Verbreitung von unternehmerischen Eigenschaften und Verhalten in Russland deutlich geringer ist als in anderen Ländern. Im Transformationsprozess nahmen politische Unternehmer nicht nur aktiv an der Ausgestaltung der institutionellen Regeln teil (etwa bei der Privatisierung von Staatsunternehmen), sondern schufen sich durch stark vertikal integrierte Industrieverbünde von ihnen selbst kontrollierte quasi-staatliche Strukturen.
P21|Romanian Rural Development And The Financing Policy|Romania has a large rural areas and a great potential, but the Romanian rural has many economic and social issues. The main idea is that the major risk for the Romanian rural development is generated of the combination between the transition problems, poverty and financing possibilities. For Romania is a need for benchmarking rural development and Romania looks at European Union and United States policy and programme. In Romania there is a vicious circle regarding the correlation between productivity and poverty. Because the poverty is a huge problem for Romanian rural areas, an essential problem is the access to the community funds. Important is the chain of the European structural funds financing: Allocation, Accession, and Absorption. One single error on every part of this chain would stop the investment. All insist that Romania should reform its administration and reduce red tape, to create a depoliticized and transparent system.
P21|Food Availability and Food Entitlements during the Chinese Great Leap Forward Famine: A dynamic panel data analysis (In French)|The article aims at identifying socioeconomic factors which explain the Chinese famine of 1959-1961. The main hypothesis of this paper is that the radicalism of Great Leap Forward policies generated both a decline of agricultural output (availability problems) and the implementation of an inadequate food distribution policy which penalised rural populations (accessibility problems). An econometrical analysis with provincial panel data for the period 1954-1966 points out the role of bad political choices on the occurrence of the famine and confirms the simultaneous influence of food availability decline and food distribution issues on mortality rates.
P21|Female Ministers, Governance and Reforms|In this paper, we test whether the gender composition of government affects the quality of governance and reform efforts, thus connecting the literature that documents the effects of gender on decision making to the literature on the determinants of reforms. We find that countries with a higher share of female ministers and a higher share of female MPs tend to score somewhat better in terms of regulatory quality and government effectiveness, and in terms of reforms in these areas, but also that tackling possible endogeneity shows most of these effects to be insignificant. Our results thus do not provide support for the claim that ‘conducting reforms is not women’s business’, they rather suggest that reform is as much women’s business as it is men’s business.
P21|The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959-61|This paper investigates the institutional causes of China's Great Famine. It presents two empirical findings: 1) in 1959, when the famine began, food production was almost three times more than population subsistence needs; and 2) regions with higher per capita food production that year suffered higher famine mortality rates, a surprising reversal of a typically negative correlation. A simple model based on historical institutional details shows that these patterns are consistent with government policy failure in a centrally planned economy in which the government is unable to easily collect and respond to new information in the presence of an aggregate shock to production.
