H83|Fair-Value Estimates of the Cost of Federal Credit Programs in 2020|The federal government supports some private activities by providing credit assistance to individuals and businesses. CBO shows two kinds of estimates of the lifetime costs of those credit programs: estimates created by following procedures prescribed by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA); and estimates that account for the market value of the governmentâ€™s obligations, which are called fair-value estimates.
H83|Accounting for Federal Retirement and Veterans' Benefits: Cash and Accrual Measures|Programs that provide benefits to retired federal civilian workers, retired military personnel, and veterans have long-term effects on the federal budget. The governmentâ€™s cash payments for those benefits are reported in the budget as outlays when they are madeâ€”which means that the long-term costs of current decisions about those benefits are not reflected in the current budget deficit.
H83|What Do Central Bankers Do? Evidence from the European Central Bank's Executive Board|This paper examines how managers at the top of a public institution, central bank executives, allocate their working time. Using detailed information from personal diaries of the six members of the European Central Bank's Executive Board over a period of two years, we codify and analyze more than 3,700 reported activities and compare the results with recent findings on the time use of CEOs in the private sector. We report four additional observations. First, the daily schedule of central bankers is dominated by routine tasks; variations in economic uncertainty have, on average, no significant effect on the number of activities. Second, there are sizable differences in the scope of activities across board members. Third, the change in publication rules of diary entries from `on request' to `regular' was associated with a significant decline in reported activities. Fourth, nationality matters: Board members interact disproportionately often with fellow nationals.
H83|Compliance effects of risk-based tax audits|Tax administrations use machine learning to predict risk scores as a basis for selecting individual taxpayers for audit. Audits detect noncompliance immediately, but may also alter future filing behavior. This analysis is the first to estimate compliance effects of audits among high-risk wage earners. We exploit a sharp audit assignment discontinuity in Norway based on individual tax payers risk score. Additional data from a random audit allow us to estimate how the audit effect vary across the risk score distribution. We show that the current risk score audit threshold is set far above the one that maximizes net public revenue.

H83|The dynamic effects of tax audits| Understanding tax non-compliance and the effectiveness of strategies to tackle it is crucial for a modern tax authority. In this paper we study how and why audits impact reported tax in the years after audit - the dynamic effect - for individual income taxpayers. We exploit data from a random audit program covering almost 35,000 income tax self assessment returns in the UK. We show that audits raise reported tax liabilities for at least ve years after audit, with the magnitude of the impact declining over time. In total this raises an additional $1; 230 per audited individual in the fi ve years after audit, 1.5 times the direct revenue raised from the audit. Looking by income source, we see that the magnitude of the initial impact is lower for income components which are third party reported, and the impact declines more quickly for components that are more volatile. We develop a model to allow us to distinguish different mechanisms that might explain the presence of dynamic effects, and show our fi ndings can only be explained by audits providing improved information to the tax authority.
H83|Corruption and firms|We estimate the causal real economic effects of a randomized anti- corruption crackdown on local governments in Brazil over the period 2003-2014. After anti-corruption audits, municipalities experience an increase in economic ac- tivity concentrated in sectors most dependent on government relationships. These effects spill over to nearby municipalities and are larger when the audits are covered by the media. Back-of-the-envelope estimates suggest that $1 away from corrup- tion generates more than $3 in local value added. Using administrative matched employer-employee and firm-level datasets and novel face-to-face firm surveys we argue that corruption mostly acts as a barrier to entry, and by introducing costs and distortions on local government-dependent firms. The political misallocation of resources across firms plays a seemingly secondary role, indicating that at the local level most rents are captured by politicians and public officials rather than firms.
H83|Making moves matter: experimental evidence on incentivizing bureaucrats through performance-based postings|Bureaucracies often post staff to better or worse locations, ostensibly to provide incentives. Yet we know little about whether this works, with heterogeneity in preferences over postings impacting effectiveness. We propose a performance-ranked serial dictatorship mechanism, whereby bureaucrats sequentially choose desired locations in order of performance. We evaluate this using a two-year field experiment with 525 property tax inspectors in Pakistan. The mechanism increases annual tax revenue growth by 30–41 percent. Inspectors whom our model predicts face high equilibrium incentives under the scheme indeed increase performance more. Our results highlight the potential of periodic merit-based postings in enhancing bureaucratic performance.
H83|A comparative analysis of the criteria for evaluating projects funded from structural funds from a risk management perspective|The evaluation of projects with non-reimbursable financing is an essential process for the efficiency of funds' use, regardless of the donor. Moreover, in the context of European Unionfunds managementand the multitude of development needs to be covered, Romania needed to establish the most efficient evaluation systems and criteria, the application of which leads to the selection of projects with better economic and social impact.This article outlines the results of a research approach that compared, fromthe perspective of the degree of subjectivity and their relevance to the selection of projects, the assessment criteria setby the managing authoritiesfor several relevant programs funded from Structural Funds 2007-2013 and 2014-2020.The research results allow answers to be definedto an important question for authorities and institutions that manage grants in Romania: Is there a link between how to approach the project evaluation process and the manifestation of risks specific to the evaluation process?Also, the results of the research allow a more detailed analysis of how anunitary risk management methodology for all non-reimbursable grants managed in Romania could be applied to the risks specific forthe project evaluation process.
H83|Ethnic Discrimination in Contacts with Public Authorities: A Correspondence Test Among Swedish Municipalities|We present a field experiment conducted in order to explore the existence of ethnic discrimination in contact with public authorities. Two fictitious parents, one with a Swedish-sounding name and one with an Arabic-sounding name, sent email inquiries to all Swedish municipalities asking for information about preschool admission for their children. Results show that the parents were treated differently by the municipalities since the individual with the Swedish-sounding name received significantly more responses that answered the question in the inquiry than the individual with the Arabic-sounding name. Also, the individual with the Swedish-sounding name received more warm answers than the individual with the Arabic-sounding name in the sense that the answer from the municipality started with a personal salutation. We conclude that ethnic discrimination is prevalent in public sector contacts and that this discrimination has implications for the integration of immigrants and their children.
H83|Love the Job... or the Patient?: Task vs. Mission-Based Motivations in Health Care|A booming literature has argued that mission-based motives are a central feature of mission-oriented labor markets. This paper shifts the focus to task-based motivation and finds that it yields significantly more effort than mission-based motivation. Moreover, in the presence of significant task motivation, mission motivation has no additional effect on effort. The evidence emerges from experiments with nearly 250 medical and nursing students in Burkina Faso. The students exert effort in three tasks, from boring to interesting. In addition, for half of the students, mission motivation is present: their effort on the task generates benefits for a charity. Two strong results emerge. First, task motivation has an economically important effect on effort. Second, mission motivation increases effort, but only for mundane tasks and not when the task is interesting. Moreover, even for mundane tasks, the effects of mission motivation appear to be less than those of task motivation.
H83|How Does Public Debt affect the Indian Macroeconomy? A Structural VAR Approach|This study investigates the macroeconomic effects of public debt in India using a Struc-tural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) framework for the period from 1980 to 2017. The objective of this study is to examine the impact of several types of public debt on economic growth, investment, interest rate and inflation in India. The results of the Impulse re-sponse functions show that public debt has an adverse impact on economic growth, a pos-itive impact on long-term interest rate and a mixed response (both negative and positive) on investment and inflation in India. It is also found that the domestic debt has a more adverse impact on the economy than external debt in India. The estimated variance de-composition analysis shows that much of the variations among selected macro variables are explained by public debt and growth in India. The study suggests that public debt, especially the domestic debt should be controlled and used in a more productive manner in order to have a favourable impact on the economy.
H83|Encouraging policy change for sustainable and resilient fisheries|How can policy makers successfully implement the policy changes needed to achieve greater economic, social, and environmental sustainability and resilience? This report combines lessons from the available literature, discussions with experts and stakeholders, as well as information on past policy change processes. Results suggest that, over the last decade, changes to fisheries policy have largely been triggered by the performance of the sector itself and how it is perceived, particularly with respect to resource management and to socio-economic outcomes. Other important factors stand out, in particular initiatives by people in charge of fisheries management and legal commitments to adopt changes. Macroeconomic and macro-political factors, however, appear to have had less impact on fisheries policy than on other policy domains. Key recommendations are proposed to facilitate policy change in the future through better use of data, commitment mechanisms, non-sectoral policies, and consultation processes.
H83|Municipal Merger and Debt Issuance in South African Municipality|Employing South African data and Difference-In-Difference (DID) method, this paper investigates whether the free-ride behaviour was taken by municipalities which faced their mergers before the municipal demarcation changes are executed. With several developed countries' data, many research show that there are opportunistic free-ride behaviours of municipalities such as over-issuance of debt before their mergers since the burden of them will be shared by newly constructed municipalities. In spite of these fruits of research, few solution is suggested in the literature. Considering this, we focus on the South African municipal mergers, where the upper government of municipalities implemented the policy for pre-merged municipalities to suspend new contracts involving the borrowing contract before the mergers. As a result of DID analysis, we show that South African municipalities did decrease the amount of borrowings before their mergers. This result is an opposite result considering the previous empirical researches and means that the proper policy for municipal mergers can prevent the fiscal common pool problem caused by free-ride behavior. In addition, this paper shed the light to utilize the data of developing countries and is the first paper to show there were reductions of borrowings before municipal mergers.
H83|Successful and Dead-end Jobs in a Bureaucracy:Evidence from Japan|This paper develops a novel method that assigns a job a value to capture both the likelihood and speed of promotion from each job to a top executive and applies it to investigate the career paths of bureaucrats in Japan. We find that outwardly similar jobs within the same hierarchical rank, estimated using the standard method in Baker, Gibbs, and Holmstrom (1994), have very different opportunities to be promoted to a top executive. We can also detect frequent real demotions and the presence of early selection (read fast track) of elite bureaucrats unable to be detected through use of hierarchical rank.
H83|From public information to democratic governance: a theoretical atlas from an axiomatic approach to the evaluation of public management|The general theme is the diagnosis of the quality of public information and the evaluation of democratic governance. The specific thematic axis is the nature and purpose of public information in the context of the democratic rule of law in Mexico, in the federal states and, in particular, in the state of Veracruz . The problem is to answer the question: What is required for an effective evaluation of public management? Based on this approach, it is argued that the way to effectively evaluate public management presupposes a theory and indicators of democratic governance. In order to understand the elements that constitute democratic governance it is necessary to use the axiomatic method; this requires establishing: 1) Basic, stipular and common definitions; 2) Axioms, as propositions articulated with the basic and consensual definitions; 3) Postulates, which are propositions admitted as true, which are derived from the basic definitions and from the axioms; 4) Theorems, propositions derived from the postulates. From the theorems are derived the indicators of the present theoretical atlas of democratic governance, which will be shown in a later phase of the essay. This research recovers philosophical, juridical, political, economic and accounting aspects. Its articulating axis is the concept of public information, which is linked to those of transparency, corruption, social participation, accountability and citizen oversight, being minimum elements necessary for the understanding and evaluation of democratic governance.
H83|Regulatory Spillovers in Common Audit Markets|We find that Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) had two significant effects on the audit market for nonpublic entities. The first short-run effect stems from inelastic labor supply coupled with an audit demand shock from public companies. As a result, private companies reduced their use of attested financial reports in bank financing by 12%, and audit fee increases for nonprofit organizations (NPOs) more than doubled. The second long-run effect was a transformation in the audit supply structure. After SOX, NPOs were less likely to match with auditors most exposed to public companies, while auditors increasingly specialized their offices based on client type. Audit market concentration for NPOs dropped by more than half within five years of SOX and remained at this level through the end of our sample in 2013, while the number of suppliers increased by 26%. Our results demonstrate how regulation directed at public companies generates economically im-portant spillovers for nonpublic entities.
H83|La pratique de la contractualisation interne hospitalière: vers une nouvelle gestion publique<BR>[The practice of hospital internal contracting: towards a new public management]|The interest of the internal contracting resides certainly in its use like instrument of administrative and financial regulation of the health, social and medico-social establishments, because it constitutes an element of technical and financial viability of a health mutual, but more still as a management and modernization tool. Internal contracting is thus the mode that allows the matching between costs and quality in the hospital field; remaining the indispensable tool for the introduction and adaptation of new public management in public bodies.
H83|Corrupt Reserve Prices|We develop a new methodology to identify corruption in public procure- ment auctions with reserve prices and apply it to Russian public procure- ment auctions of gasoline in 2011-2013. We identify corrupt procurer-seller pairs by exploiting the variation in reserve prices. Since auction reserve prices are set by the procurer before the auction, they should be indepen- dent from the identity of the winning seller. We estimate reserve prices as a function of the local market price, contract, procurer and time controls, and procurer-seller fixed effects. A procurer-seller pair is labeled as poten- tially corrupt if its pair fixed effect is significantly larger than the average procurer fixed effect. Despite their reserve price overpricing, corrupt sell- ers face less competition in auctions organized by procurers with whom they form a corrupt pair and have a higher probability of wining these auc- tions. Auctions won by corrupt pairs exhibit higher final contract prices, leading to considerable welfare losses. The detrimental effect of reserve price manipulation on final prices is mitigated by higher competition and fully offset by electronic auctions with sufficient competition.
H83|Does the pension system’s income statement really matter? A proposal for an NDC scheme with disability and minimum pension benefits|This paper develops a full accounting model for monitoring the solvency of a notional defined contribution (NDC) pension scheme with disability and minimum pension benefits. Using the annual report of the Swedish pension system as a benchmark (TSPS, 2018), we extend the “Swedish” actuarial balance developed by Pérez-Salamero et al. (2017) by adding an income statement which fully explains the reasons behind the changes in the system’s solvency by type of benefit. In line with the reference model, assets and liabilities are measured at present value at each reporting date, and changes in present value are reported in each period as income or expenses and are included on the income statement. Our proposed model is a step forward because it, also, incorporates the changes for disability pensions, the value of change in the discount rate and the explicit recognition of non-contributory rights (NCRs) into the Income statement. This accounting framework integrates both contributory and social aspects of public pensions and discloses the real cost of the disability contingency and the redistribution through minimum pensions. The paper contains a numerical example consisting of an income statement for a (fictional) already-functioning system to illustrate the main differences between the Swedish NDC scheme and our model. Mathematical details are presented in a comprehensive technical appendix.
H83|Risk allocation and management in PPP and PFI: Systematic Literature Review|Public private partnerships (PPP) and Public Finance initiative (PFI) have been widely used to finance infrastructures and public services. PPP and PFI are an effective way to achieve value for money (VFM) (Broadbent et al. 2008) as they guarantee efficiency levels and transfer risk away from the public sector. Scholars analysed â€œriskâ€ from different angles, i.e. risk identification and controlling (Broadbent et al. 2008), diffusion of risks (Demirag et al. 2012), demand risk (Burke and Demirag 2013) and risk management (Chung and Hensher 2015). Despite the importance of the risk the topic has not yet been deepened. This research aims at understanding the state of the art of risk consideration under PPP and PFI studies. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR), we defined five constitutive areas, namely: value for Money, risk determination and allocation, financial risk transfer, contractualization of risk and risk management in post construction phase. Risk in PPP and PFF is still in its infancy. Further research are required. In particular, regarding operational and post-operational risk studies, risk management and the role of trust between partners in operational phase, and more in general issues related to PPP/PFIs within developing countries.
H83|The diffusion of public eServices in European cities|Using a novel dataset on the diffusion of public eServices at the city level in EU 15, this paper contributes to extant empirical literature in three ways. First, it extends the coverage of public eServices beyond eGovernment, investigating four service categories: Infomobility, eProcurement, eGovernment and eHealth. Second, it provides information for both a cross-country and cross-municipality comparison. Third, on the methodological side, it also extends the literature on composite indicators at a municipal level. Cities exhibiting the highest diffusion of public eServices are found to be medium-large, highly endowed with well-educated human capital, and characterised by a lively industrial atmosphere favoured by a reasonable number and variety of production and service activities. The relative performance of the European cities helps identify plausible directions to be taken for policies aimed at favoring the diffusion of public service innovation in Europe.

H83|Winning a district election in a clientelistic society: Evidence from decentralized Indonesia|Lower-level officials often engage in clientelistic relations with the upper-level government. The nature of these relations might be determined by institutional factors such as how the lower-level officials come into their position. This paper specifically highlights the different political incentives that elected versus appointed lower-level officials have for becoming political intermediaries for the upper-level government, and it investigates empirically how these differing incentives bring electoral consequences. Upon exploiting a natural experiment in Indonesia, the study found that the elected village headmen have stronger incentives to support the incumbent mayor than the appointed village headmen do. The results suggest that while civil service reforms might weaken the bureaucratic clientelism, the pre-existing patronclient relations that are deeply embedded in the society are immersed in local political competitions; thus, this practice challenges political consolidation in the young democracy.
H83|Does accrual accounting alter fiscal policy decisions? Evidence from Germany|Many governments have replaced traditional cash-based accounting with some form of accrual-based accounting system. However, empirical evidence on the effects of the public accounting system on fiscal policy is scarce. Following rules by the federal states, municipalities in Germany have adopted accrual-based accounting systems gradually. By exploiting variations over time and across states I find no evidence for an impact on the overall financial balance. However, my findings suggest that accrual accounting has altered the structure of the budget. Revenues from the sales of non-financial assets have decreased significantly. This supports the hypothesis that municipalities had used these one-off measures before to meet fiscal constraints. Using data on entities controlled by the municipalities, the analysis provides no evidence for repercussions on these public funds, institutions or enterprises.
H83|Are Recessions Good for Government Hires? The Effect of Unemployment on Public Sector Human Capital|Utilizing a large dataset on U.S. federal government employees covering 24 years, we estimate and analyze the persistent wage effect of entering government employment during recessions for recent college graduates and other new employees. Contrary to previous results in the literature for private sector employees, we document a significant and long-term wage increase for federal civil servants who enter government service in recessions. We show this result is robust to alternative samples and model specifications. We conclude by examining agency occupation composition and job matching as mechanisms for these results.
H83|The role of Ombudsman Institutions in Open Government|Ombudsman institutions (OIs) act as the guardians of citizens’ rights and as a mediator between citizens and the public administration. While the very existence of such institutions is rooted in the notion of open government, the role they can play in promoting openness throughout the public administration has not been adequately recognized or exploited. Based on a survey of 94 OIs, this report examines the role they play in open government policies and practices. It also provides recommendations on how, given their privileged contact with both people and governments, OIs can better promote transparency, integrity, accountability, and stakeholder participation; how their role in national open government strategies and initiatives can be strengthened; and how they can be at the heart of a truly open state.
H83|OECD 2017 OURdata Index: Methodology and results|This paper presents the methodological process and results of the OECD 2017 Open-Useful-Reusable Government data Index (OURdata Index). It is meant to present the methodology and outline the data collection and verification process; discuss key findings of the composite indicators including overall country scores and scores by pillars and sub-pillars; and show the outcomes of different statistical tests to assess the robustness of the results, including tests to evaluate the sensitivity of the indicators to various weighting schemes. The paper highlights the relevance of the Index to support the design and monitoring of open government data policies and practices leading to socio-economic outcomes and to the improved performance and efficiency of public sector organisations.
H83|Je krytí závazků problémem obcí Moravskoslezského kraje?| Tento článek je zaměřen na problematiku krytí závazků, a to u všech 300 obcí Moravskoslezského kraje. Obce, podobně jako firmy, mohou při svém hospodaření řešit situace, kdy nedisponují dostatečným množstvím vlastních finančních zdrojů pro realizaci běžných výdajů na poskytování veřejných statků a služeb, popř. investičních výdajů. Řešením je použití cizích zdrojů, a to buď ve formě návratných, nebo nenávratných finančních prostředků, které ovšem mohou vést k zadlužování obcí. To, zda nedochází k předlužování, lze zjistit zhodnocením zatížení celkových aktiv obce externími zdroji, tedy mírou krytí závazků. Pro tento účel byly vybrány a následně analyzovány dva ukazatele – podíl cizích zdrojů na celkových aktivech včetně dotačních záloh a podíl cizích zdrojů na celkových aktivech bez dotačních záloh. Byl stanoven předpoklad, že dotační zálohy hrají důležitou roli v míře krytí závazků a mají podstatný vliv na to, jak jsou obce v tomto ohledu hodnoceny. Obce byly monitorovány v období od roku 2010 do roku 2016. Na základě provedené analýzy bylo zjištěno, že krytí závazků není pro municipality v Moravskoslezském kraji problémem, jak v případě započtení dotačních záloh, tak bez jejich zahrnutí. Více než osmdesát procent obcí vykazuje nízkou míru rizika pro finanční stabilitu a pouze dvě (resp. tři) procenta obcí se musí zaměřit na zlepšení své situace.
H83|Likvidita obcí Moravskoslezského kraje| Pokud obce nedisponují dostatečným množstvím svých finančních prostředků, nutných k financování běžných a investičních výdajů, musí nalézt cizí zdroje. To s sebou nese nejen pozitivní efekty v podobě zvyšování kvality života obcí, ale také efekty negativní v podobě neschopnosti výše uvedené cizí zdroje splácet a zvyšovat tak riziko finanční nestability obcí. Proto je nutno veřejné zdroje a jejich využívání monitorovat a kontrolovat. Jedním z významných ukazatelů monitoringu je likvidita a tento článek má za cíl vyhodnotit problematiku likvidity u všech (tři sta) obcí Moravskoslezského kraje, a to v období let 2010 až 2016. Pro tento účel byly vybrány a následně analyzovány dva ukazatele – podíl oběžných aktiv ke krátkodobým závazkům, tedy indikátor běžné (celkové) likvidity a podíl krátkodobého finančního majetku ke krátkodobým závazkům, tedy indikátor okamžité likvidity. Byl stanoven předpoklad, že monitorované obce budou v hodnocení okamžité likvidity ve větší míře spadat do rizikovějších skupin, než v případě likvidity běžné. Na základě provedené analýzy bylo zjištěno, že v případě počtu obcí s vysokou mírou rizika se tento předpoklad potvrdil, v případě obcí s rizikem středním byl předpoklad vyvrácen.
H83|Creative Accounting and Municipal Mergers -A Theoretical and Empirical Approach-|This study investigates what causes governments to use creative accounting. It is difficult to grasp the mechanism of creative accounting and show its existence. This is because, although creative accounting is seemingly closely tied with increases in debt, whether creative accounting is a cause or result of the debt increase is ambiguous and finding the occurrence of creative accounting is not easy. However,by focusing on municipal mergers in Japan in the 2000s, we clarify that the incentive to increase debt causes the use of creative accounting and show the existence of creative accounting, theoretically and empirically. Our theoretical model shows that a government with a stronger incentive to increase debt rationally employs creative accounting more fiercely and that an improvement in fiscal transparency reduces both the use of creative accounting and the deficit amount. Corresponding to this finding,by using a difference-in-difference analysis and data on Japanese municipal mergers, we show that municipalities with a stronger incentive to increase debt tend to employ creative accounting.

H83|Los efectos de la crisis económica en Galicia a través de 25 cuadros<BR>[The effects of the economic crisis in Galicia through 25 graphs]|Eleven years have passed since the beginning of the economic crisis that began in 2008 when two consecutive quarters of negative quarter-on-quarter variation rates were experienced. Throughout these eleven years, three key moments can be highlighted, which are the ones taken as a general reference: the second quarter of 2008, when the economic crisis begins; the fourth quarter of 2013, when the Galician economy begins its economic recovery; and the third quarter of 2017, when the pre-crisis level is achieved in terms of real GDP. The purpose of this paper is to offer, in a synthetic way, an image of the effects of the economic crisis from the data collected in the following graphs and tables
H83|A competitive framework for governmentâ€™s engagement of researchers|This article identifies a range of contestable and transparent mechanisms that Australian government agencies (including departments) may use to engage academic consultants and supporting research. It also provides guidance on deciding which mechanisms (such as tenders, calls for proposals or hybrid approaches) are most appropriate in specific circumstances. The key conclusion is that the selection of a mechanism involves trade-offs, and the best choice will likely depend on the research topic, the nature of the project, and the level of expertise within the agency.
H83|The Impact of Exogenous Demand Shock on the Housing Market: Evidence from the Home Purchase Restriction Policy in the People’s Republic of China|To deal with the rampant increase in housing prices, the Government of the PRC implemented the home purchase restriction (HPR) policy to curb speculation and prevent housing bubbles. This policy triggered an exogenous demand shock to the housing market. Employing a two-step difference-in-differences approach, we find significantly negative policy effects on property transaction volume but a small impact on housing prices. Cities that rely heavily on land sales for fiscal revenue experience a considerably higher increase in property investments after implementing the HPR policy.
H83|Does a Discount Rate Rule Ensure a Pension Plan Can Pay Promised Benefits without Excessive Asset Accumulation?|The choice of discount rate makes a substantial difference to the magnitude of the assets required to ensure a pension plan is fully funded. Finance theory suggests that the discount rate should equal the default-free rate, but pension plan administrators argue for a rate equal to the long run return on plan assets. We evaluate the ability of a fully funded pension plan to meet its promised benefit payments when the plan's liabilities are determined using different discount rate-setting rules. To account for the uncertainty of the return to plan assets and future benefit payments, we employ Monte Carlo techniques and estimates using U.S. data. Due to the volatility of pension fund asset returns and payouts, to generate a high probability of meeting promised pension payments, a plan must use a discount rate that leads, on average, to the accumulation of significant assets in excess of those required to cover promised benefits. The better performing rules are a function of economic variables, such as the return on government bonds or the inflation rate. Two rules that yield a relatively high probability that pension obligations can be met, combined with the relatively low accumulation of excess assets, set the discount rate equal to a proxy for the corporate bond yield or an inflation forecast plus 3 percent. These rates are greater than the default free rate, but lower than the return on the plan portfolio.
H83|Stakeholders? perspectives on accountability in Tanzanian Local Governments|This paper explores accountability in local government authorities (LGAs) in Tanzania from the perspectives of different stakeholders. The purpose was to examine the participants? understandings and practice of accountability in the context of the LGAs.The study used an interpretive methodology and data were gathered through in-depth interviews, documentary review, and observation particularly in meetings. The research involved five groups of participants, namely, the local and central government executives, councilors, external auditors, and members of the parliamentary committee responsible for the accounts of LGAs. The respondents described accountability in terms of relationships between parties, whereby one party has both specified and unspecified responsibilities and a duty to demonstrate discharge of the same to the other interested parties. Accountability was mainly associated with the power of the accountee to hold the accountor to account. Six typologies of accountability relationships were observed. These include subordinate-superior/managerial, executive-councilor, political, public, professional, and administrative. The study also found a tendency to pay more attention to the perceived ?sensitive accountees? and a poor sense of public accountability and accountability to councilors amongst the local government executives. The local government participants who were considered to play less important roles and/or were less powerful were perceived to have limited need for both accounting and other information related to the discharge of accountability.
H83|The French Health Care System at a Juncture: Stakeholder Analysis, Networks and Idiosyncratic Reforms|The French health system was at a juncture in the 2000s. Policy makers faced multiple conflicting expectations from a variety of stakeholders. Our aim is to investigate two critical stakeholders: patients, whose sovereignty was weakened, and physicians, whose values have shifted. The provision of health services took a different shape. The emphasis is now on territorial networks.Our approach consists of a literature review that investigated the critical elements of French health care reforms. As such, the article will trace the evolution of health care stakeholders, , the impact of reforms on patient sovereignty and on physician?s professional values. In retrospect, it appears that the invasion of norms led to a democratic recess that reinstated the French Jacobinist tradition at the expense of citizen engagement and patient sovereignty. As for physicians who remained the last gatekeeper of ethics, they developed new coping and anchoring strategies.The article gives a critical appraisal of the prevailing administrative principles contained in the French administrative apparatus, and how these were translated into practice with respect to the uniformisation of services and the concentration of power within a newly-formed Welfare elite.France adopted an idiosyncratic market model that contrast with Anglo-Saxon Public Private Partnerships and consumer-driven approach. Verticalization of the chain of command and concentration of decision-making power became salient characteristics of French reforms that contrast with Anglo-Saxon de-amalgamation strategies.
H83|On the Quest for Value in the Public Sector Management and its Implications|This paper seeks to draw the attention to a peculiar, complex and interesting issue: the search for value in the public organizations? management. Thus, after a brief reference to the classical theme of creation and measurement of the general economic-financial value for (Business / Private) firms, it focuses on the more insidious and much less quantitative argument of the generation and management of Public value. Public value is the equivalent (though modified) of shareholder value (SHV) in public management with special features. A first model internationally diffused in public sector studies is representable by means of the Strategic Triangle; whose angles are: 1) Vision (value); 2) Legitimacy & support; 3) Operational capability of the public organization. A second model concerns more directly the first, highest, angle (that is now zoomed and founded upon resources and competencies): the value created for citizens through public services above all as mission. The building blocks and the outcomes & metrics developments are the elements that constitute a PSV (Public Service Value) scheme. A comparative analysis per stages is essential for our purpose: starting firstly from Public Administration (1: traditional model), secondly to New Public Management (2: NPM, denoting policies aimed to modernize and render more effective the public sector), we may arrive finally to the New Public Service stage (3: NPS, which is coherent with a networked public governance vision). Such an evolution implies a transition from a technical government to a wider and flexible governance philosophy in the ambit of a renewed value&performance-oriented public sector, which is willing to adopt qualitative principles and where individual employees are free and stimulated to pursue and propose new ideas about how to improve the working of the organization, in terms of efficiency or services. In sum, the quest for public value is the next and urgent challenge for public sector at its various levels: consequently, it will deserve more attention by both policy-makers (central and local public administrators) and researchers. For this purpose, it would be appropriate to come to a kind of public value scorecard aimed at the rational estimate of the expected, or realized, public value created time after time.At a more analytical-quantitative level, interesting would appear the inter-institutional search for a correlation between the public management value (ie, the value of public administrations) and the value of private institutions that ultimately benefit, with the individuals, from public goods and services.
H83|The concept of tax gaps - Corporate Income Tax Gap Estimation Methodologies|The corporate income tax gap (CIT Gap) is the gap between corporate tax revenues as they “should be” collected and as they “are” collected. The gap is an indication of potential CIT revenue losses. This report defines the CIT gap as encompassing both non-deliberate actions by taxpayers (such as errors or omissions) and deliberate actions (such as fraud, evasion and avoidance) that lead to shortfall in revenues. This report reflects the objective of the Tax Gap Project Group (TGPG) to map and share expertise and good practices. The two main approaches to estimating the tax gap – the top-down and bottom-up methods – have both advantages and disadvantages. The choice of the estimation method depends heavily on the availability of data, resources and purposes of the estimate.
H83|What are the Costs of a New Tax Administration? The Case of a Personal Income Tax in Kuwait|This paper assesses the viability of introducing a new personal income tax (PIT), focusing on the administrative costs of new tax. I first present a methodology for calculating the one-time start-up costs and the ongoing administrative costs of a new PIT. I then apply this methodology to the specific case of Kuwait. I estimate that the first-year total administrative costs of a new PIT tax administration in Kuwait range from Kuwaiti dinars (KWD) 46.8 million to KWD 90.9 million (or from USD 154.4 million to USD 300.0 million), depending on how the construction costs are financed. However, after the initial construction costs are incurred, I find that the annual total administrative costs of a PIT fall significantly to about KWD 50 million (or about USD 164 million), regardless of specific financing methods, and then rise at an annual rate of less than 6 percent per year to reach KWD 82.0 million (or USD 270.6 million) by year 2020, driven mainly by labor force growth. I also estimate that the likely revenues of a new PIT far exceed these administrative costs, even if the PIT is imposed at low rates.
H83|Los procesos de reforma y modernización administrativa del Estado uruguayo desde la Oficina de Planeamiento y Presupuesto de la Presidencia de la República|"This is a descriptive and analytical study of the processes of modernization and State reform (RDE in Spanish) in Uruguay during the last five decades, which the Planning and Budgeting Office (OPP in Spanish) has either led or played an important role in its design and implementation. Firstly, a three-level conceptual precision about RDE is proposed. Next, the antecedents prior to the creation of the OPP are explored. Particularly, the proposals and advances during devised the period of the Commission of Investments and Economic Development (CIDE) work are focused on. Subsequently, the actions of the OPP in the matter during the successive governments since the democratic restoration are addressed: the guidelines in the first administration of President Sanguinetti (1985-1989); the drive towards ""de-bureaucratization"" during the presidency of Dr. Lacalle (1990-1994); the administrative reform during the second government of Dr. Sanguinetti (1995-1999) as well as its limits during the administration of Dr. Batlle (2000-2004); and the advances and difficulties in terms of institutional strengthening of the State (""the mother of all reforms""), during the presidencies of Dr. Vázquez (2005-2009) and José Mujica (2010-2014). Finally, some reflections on the contemporary challenges around this policy arena are discussed."
H83|Biased policy professionals|"A large literature focuses on the biases of individuals and consumers, as well as""nudges""and other policies that can address those biases. Although policy decisions are often more consequential than those of individual consumers, there is a dearth of studies on the biases of policy professionals: those who prepare and implement policy on behalf of elected politicians. Experiments conducted on a novel subject pool of development policy professionals (public servants of the World Bank and the Department for International Development in the United Kingdom) show that policy professionals are indeed subject to decision making traps, including sunk cost bias, the framing of losses and gains, frame-dependent risk-aversion, and, most strikingly, confirmation bias correlated with ideological priors, despite having an explicit mission to promote evidence-informed and impartial decision making. These findings should worry policy professionals and their principals in governments and large organizations, as well as citizens themselves. A further experiment, in which policy professionals engage in discussion, shows that deliberation may be able to mitigate the effects of some of these biases."
H83|What determines administrative capacity in developing countries?|Abstract While it is recognised that effective state institutions are pivotal for economic development, their origins and what explains their cross-country differences are not well understood. We focus on the quality of budgetary institutions in developing economies, as efficient public financial planning in such countries is crucial for public goods and services provision. We argue that political institutions, seen as the system of checks and balances on the executive, are a key ingredient for building such capacity. Exploiting a recent database on public financial management performance in developing economies and an instrumental variable strategy, we generally find that stronger constraints on the executive have a positive effect on the ability of states to design, implement and monitor their budget. Our findings are robust to different specifications, controls and estimation methods.
H83|Love the job... or the patient? Task vs. mission-based motiviations in healthcare|A booming literature has argued that mission-based motives are a central feature of mission-oriented labor markets. We shift the focus to task-based motivation and find that it yields significantly more effort than mission-based. Moreover, in the presence of significant task motivation, mission motivation has no additional effect on effort. The evidence emerges from experiments with nearly 250 medical and nursing students in Burkina Faso. The students exert effort in three tasks, from boring to interesting. In addition, for half of the students, mission motivation is present: their effort on the task generates benefits for a charity. Two strong results emerge. First, task motivation has an economically important effect on effort, more than doubling effort. Second, mission motivation increases effort, but only for mundane tasks and not when the task is interesting. Even for mundane tasks, moreover, the effects of mission motivation appear to be less than those of task motivation.
H83|Reform der Einheitlichen Ansprechpartner (EA): Anregungen von europäischen Good-Practice-Beispielen|Ausgangspunkt der Studie ist der Rückstand Deutschlands gegenüber anderen EU-Ländern bei der Implementierung des Einheitlichen Ansprechpartners. Basierend auf leitfadengestütz-ten Experteninterviews stellt die Studie die stärker digitalisierten EA-Systeme in Österreich und Dänemark vor und leitet daraus Handlungsempfehlungen für Deutschland ab. Neben notwendigen Fortschritten im Bereich des E-Government sollten die wirtschaftspolitischen Akteure - u.a. mit Hilfe einer Koordinierungsgruppe - den Aufbau weitgehend einheitlicher, modular konzipierter Strukturen für die Weiterentwicklung der EA-Landesportale anstreben und dabei auch relevante externe Stakeholder einbeziehen. Die Konsolidierung von beste-henden Parallelangeboten sollte im Wege eines speziellen Beirates erfolgen. Weitere Empfehlungen betreffen u.a. den inhaltlich-thematischen Aufbau der EA-Portale, die (indirekte) Verfahrensabwicklung sowie die stärkere Automatisierung der Helpdesk-Funktion des EA.
H83|Political competition and economic performance: Empirical evidence from Pakistan|The influence of politics on economic policy is not fully understood. The challenge to ensure political inclusiveness and economic prosperity remains. Perhaps, one way to attain this objective is by increasing political competition. This paper gathers empirical evidence from Pakistan, a country with a checkered political history characterized by episodes of representative, non-representative, and indirectly elected governments. In recent years, the country has witnessed a gradual strengthening of democratic rule with economic progress. Focusing on nine elections held over 1970 to 2015 the authors measure political competition and estimate its impact on economic performance. Contrary to popular conceptions about Pakistan's economic performance, they find a positive association between lack of political competition and poor economic performance. This finding holds at national as well as subnational levels in Pakistan and withstands a number of robustness tests.

H83|How CBO Produces Fair-Value Estimates of the Cost of Federal Credit Programs: A Primer|The federal government supports some private activities by providing credit assistance to individuals and businesses. CBO uses two approaches for estimating the lifetime costs of federal credit programs: the accounting procedures prescribed by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA); and an alternative approach that accounts for the market value of the governmentâ€™s obligations, known as the fair-value approach.
H83|Measuring the Costs of Federal Insurance Programs: Cash or Accrual?|Following on a January 2018 report about using cash or accrual measures in federal budgeting, CBO assesses the advantages and disadvantages of those measures for federal insurance programs, including deposit insurance, flood insurance, and pension insurance. The report also describes a range of options for the expanding the use of accrual measures in the budget process.
H83|Fair-Value Estimates of the Cost of Federal Credit Programs in 2019|The federal government supports some private activities by providing credit assistance to individuals and businesses. CBO offers two kinds of measures for estimating the lifetime costs incurred by those federal credit programs: estimates created by following procedures prescribed by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA); and estimates that account for the market value of the governmentâ€™s obligations, which are called fair-value estimates. Using FCRA procedures, CBO estimates that new loans and loan guarantees issued in 2019 would result in savings of $37.4 billion.
H83|Justicia y gasto público|Este estudio realiza una revisión general del gasto asociado a la justicia en Colombia en las siguientes tres dimensiones: i) Tamaño y evolución, eficiencia, efectividad y equidad del gasto orientado a la administración de justicia y las cárceles en el país, ii) El impacto en las finanzas públicas de decisiones de los jueces y de las altas cortes, y iii) Tamaño y evolución del gasto publico orientado a cumplir con las obligaciones financieras derivadas de demandas falladas en contra del Estado. El alcance del estudio es limitado y consiste en ilustrar estas tres dimensiones de la relación entre gasto público y justicia. En consecuencia, a partir de los resultados, el estudio sólo pretende recopilar algunas recomendaciones recientes y esbozar otras que surgen de los resultados del trabajo.
H83|Biased Policy Professionals|Although the decisions of policy professionals are often more consequential than those of individuals in their private capacity, there is a dearth of studies on the biases of policy professionals: those who prepare and implement policy on behalf of elected politicians. Experiments conducted on a novel subject pool of development policy professionals (public servants of the World Bank and the Department for International Development in the UK) show that policy professionals are indeed subject to decision-making traps, including the effects of framing outcomes as losses or gains, and, most strikingly, confirmation bias driven by ideological predisposition, despite having an explicit mission to promote evidence-informed and impartial decision making. These findings should worry policy professionals and their principals in governments and large organizations, as well as citizens themselves. A further experiment, in which policy professionals engage in discussion, shows that deliberation may be able to mitigate the effects of some of these biases.
H83|Implications of modifying internal managerial control regulations for a uniform risk management methodology regarding non-reimbursable financing|For the public authorities and institutions in Romania, risk management is an obligation established by the regulations on internal managerial control. Therefore, any changes to these regulations have an impact on the consistency and sustainability of the risk management measures implemented, including in the case of non-reimbursable financing programs.This paper analysesthe provisions of the internal managerial control regulations in view of the impact they may have on the implementation of a unitary risk management methodology for all non-reimbursable funds in Romania.The proposed methodology would apply to all non-reimbursable grants in Romania, both nationally and from international donors (the European Union, the Governments of Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, etc.), as the logic of non-reimbursable funding is the same for all funding programs.The proposed methodology also aims at computerizing the risk management process based on a unique risk register and rigorous organization of information collection and use of the risks, causes and effects.
H83|Going beyond analysis of internal data to support customs modernization: a case study in Gabon|Over the last few years, customs authorities in many developing countries have introduced modern risk management techniques relying on data mining and statistical scoring techniques. By demonstrating that risk analysis in customs may be a valuable tool to facilitate legal trade and combat fraud more effectively, these techniques have helped improving the performance of customs authorities. However, these risk management techniques may prove to be inefficient in a context of moral hazard and low-performance customs administration. One way to address this weakness is to rely on information gained from discrepancies in bilateral trade statistics. The analysis of discrepancies in bilateral trade statistics (or mirror analysis) is increasingly used to identify high-risk import operations and to estimate revenue losses. By comparing data on fraud recorded by the Gabon customs administration with discrepancies in Gabon’s bilateral trade data, this paper highlights the benefits for a customs administration of a joint analysis of fraud records and mirror trade statistics data, the latter being indicative of the fraud remaining to be detected. Such an analysis helps customs to target ex post audits on risky import declarations unadjusted by the frontline customs officer. Finally, we point that analyzing jointly data on fraud records and mirror trade statistics data may be useful to (i) identify imported products for which the fraud remaining to be detected is large and (ii) monitor the performance of customs inspections.
H83|Tax Evasion with a Conscience|How do moral concerns affect tax compliance and the need for audits? We propose answers by exploring an inspection game, modified to incorporate belief-dependent taxpayer guilt, unawareness, and third-party audience effects. Novel conclusions are drawn regarding whose behavior is affected by moral concerns (it's the authority's more than the citizen's) and regarding policy, in particular fines vs. jail, the role of information campaigns, and the use of a principle of public access whereby tax returns are made public information.
H83|Strategic Planning in the Russian Federal Government: Implementation, Costs, and Conditions of Effectiveness|A vital aspect of improving governance involves spearheading its strategic dimension and making current policy activities more closely aligned with the goals and objectives of sustainable growth. At the same time, implementation of strategic management is associated with considerable costs for the drafting, cross-cutting coordination and monitoring of strategic planning documents. These costs are often not taken into account. This article aims at showing that the costs of developing strategic plans can be significant. This is confirmed by survey data that allowed for estimating costs of drafting strategic planning documents in Russia
H83|La brecha fiscal: estudio y aplicación a los impuestos sobre la riqueza|La brecha fiscal es un concepto de importancia creciente en el ámbito de las administraciones tributarias que indica la diferencia entre la recaudación impositiva efectiva y la que debería obtenerse de haber un cumplimiento fiscal perfecto. Su estimación ofrece una información muy relevante sobre el tamaño relativo y la naturaleza del incumplimiento fiscal, así como sobre su evolución a lo largo del tiempo. En este artículo se destaca su utilidad como herramienta de gestión de la propia administración tributaria y para mejorar su rendición de cuentas ante la sociedad, señalándose también sus posibles debilidades metodológicas y las cauciones a la hora de interpretar sus resultados. Asimismo, se presenta la metodología y los resultados obtenidos al estimar la brecha fiscal de Cataluña, a partir de microdatos de los tres impuestos relacionados con la riqueza (patrimonio, sucesiones y transmisiones) más importantes que administran las comunidades autónomas españolas de régimen común. INGLÉS: The tax gap can be defined as the difference between the total amount of taxes collected by tax authorities and the total tax revenues that should be collected according to the tax code and under perfect tax compliance. The estimation of the tax gap offers very useful information about the relative size and nature of non-compliance, as well as its evolution over time. In this paper we point out that the tax gap is a valuable instrument not only to define the enforcement strategies of the tax administration but also to enhance the accountability of this public authority. Nonetheless, the methodology employed to estimate the tax gap and consequently the interpretation of the results of this assessment are subject to limitations that are discussed in the paper. Moreover, we present the methodology to estimate the tax gap in Catalonia for the three most important taxes related to wealth (wealth tax, inheritance and gift tax and transfer tax) administered by the Spanish regions and, finally, we provide the results from the estimations obtained employing microdata.
H83|Implementation Of Management Accounting Tools – Solution To Enhance The Performance Of Public Capital Companies In Difficulty. Case Study: Romanian Television Company|The current legislative framework and the tools the Romanian Television Company (SRTv.) has at its disposal, outdated by the realities of the competitive market whereon it operates, brought the Romanian public television before a permanent financial risk. The absence of a coherent long-term operating strategy led to the lack of financial performance and serious situation SRTv. faces for several years. By means of this paper, the authors aim to guide the managers of SRTv. towards the implementation of the management accounting tools, providing several possible solutions by which the financial performance of SRTv. can be improved: budgeting the costs and changing the method of cost calculation.
H83|Public works procurement in the new code: a legal and economic assessment of the main measures|In the light of the economic literature, this paper provides an analysis of the main measures for public works, introduced by the new Public Contracts Code, in order to assess whether they could help to solve the problems of the Italian market, characterized by fragmented public demand and a high level of cost overruns and delays in the execution phase. The paper highlights both the progress made, also thanks to the recently approved corrective decree, and the remaining shortcomings, such as the inconsistencies in the definition of the contracting authorities’ qualification requirements and firms’ rating factors, as well as the uncertainties affecting the wider margins of autonomy and flexibility granted to the contracting authorities. Overcoming these problems will also depend on the ANAC as a regulatory body that supports the functioning of the system. Moreover, both before and after the execution phase of works, the legal framework still needs to be completed with the introduction of independent reviews of the projects’ ex-ante appraisals and the definition of a systematic process for ex-post evaluations of finished projects.
H83|The Optimal NGO Chief: Strategic Delegation in Social Advocacy|Firms face social pressure to behave well. We provide the first formal model in which social penalties for wrong-doing emerge endogenously and are jointly produced between a state regulator and an NGO. Armed with the instruments of coercion the regulator plays the primary role in information provision while through attitude-leadership the NGO manipulates the social atmosphere into which information about misbehavior of firms emerges. The strategies of the regulator and the NGO are classified in a taxonomy of regulatory settings that vary in; (a) the weight that the NGO places on environmen- tal versus business outcomes and (b) community alertness to NGO messaging. In the strategic setting that results an NGO funder will typically want to delegate his bidding to an NGO chief who has values diÂ¤erent to his own.
H83|Trends in the Department of Defenseâ€™s Support Costs|From the mid-1980s to the early 1990s, the Department of Defenseâ€™s (DoDâ€™s) funding for support functions rose substantially relative to funding for forces. Four types of support functions experienced the largest increases: health care, DoD-wide management, communications and information infrastructure, and DoDâ€™s science and technology program. Increased spending in some of these areas may have improved efficiency (by helping meet military needs, boosting productivity, or reducing costs in other areas) but some increases may not have done so.
H83|Using Internal and External Sources of Information to Reduce Customs Evasion| This paper aims to identify some factors that reduce evasion of customs duties in developing countries. Following the recent literature on customs evasion, we proxy customs fraud by discrepancies in bilateral trade statistics. Estimates first show that the more frequently a product is imported, the more customs fraud reduces. We argue that this result is indicative of the fact that customs officers use what they have learned from similar import declarations - use customs' internal information - to better assess the compliance of declarations. Then, we show that relying on an information provider - a pre-shipment inspection company in our case - seems to increase tax enforcement. Results indicate that pre-shipment inspections significantly reduce observed discrepancies in trade statistics. In line with previous studies, we find that the semi-elasticity of evasion increases with the tax rate. Finally, estimates confirm that enforcement is product-varying. Results are robust to various robustness checks.

H83|Estado del arte sobre la corrupción en Colombia|En el Índice de Percepción de Corrupción elaborado por Transparencia Internacional para el año 2016, Colombia obtuvo una calificación de 37/100. ¿Cómo caracterizar el fenómeno de la corrupción en Colombia y qué estrategias académicas y de política pública se pueden adoptar para contrarrestarlo? Esta investigación sobre el “Estado del arte sobre la corrupción en Colombia” fue desarrollada por Dejusticia entre septiembre de 2016 y mayo de 2017, por solicitud de Fedesarrollo y con el apoyo financiero del Fondo Germán Botero de los Ríos de esa institución. Además de ofrecer un marco conceptual general sobre la corrupción, el estudio identifica las principales formas de corrupción en Colombia, así como las condiciones que favorecen y facilitan su reproducción. Con base en esto, preselecciona un conjunto de propuestas de política pública que traen los informes de recomendaciones que fueron producidos en Chile (2015) y en Perú (2016), y que a la luz del diagnóstico nacional podrían ser de aplicación en Colombia. Por último, sugiere un conjunto de líneas de investigación que deben ser abordadas en un futuro para entender mejor algunas problemáticas culturales, socio-normativos e institucionales que son propios del caso colombiano. Se incluye: Anexo V –Propuestas del Informe del Consejo Asesor Presidencial Contra los Conflictos de Interés, el Tráfico de Influencias, y la Corrupción de Chile que ya han sido aplicadas en la normatividad colombiana.

H83|Whistleblower Rewards, False Reports, and Corporate Fraud|It is often claimed that rewards for whistleblowers lead to fraudulent reports, but for several US programs this has not been a major problem. We model the interaction be- tween rewards for whistleblowers, sanctions against fraudulent reporting, judicial errors and standards of proof in the court case on a whistleblower.s allegations and the pos- sible follow-up for fraudulent allegations. Balancing whistleblower rewards, sanctions against fraudulent reports, and courts.standards of proof is essential for these policies to succeed. When the risk of retaliation is severe, larger rewards are needed and so are tougher sanctions against fraudulent reports. The precision of the legal system must be su¢ ciently high, hence these programs are not viable in weak institution environ- ments, where protection is imperfect and court precision low, or where sanctions against false reporting are mild. Internal reporting channels may interfere with external ones in unexpected ways.
H83|Rising Stars| We use the UK’s 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) to study which attributes characterize a top-scoring (four-star) publication in Economics and Econometrics. We frame the analysis as a classification problem and, using information in official documents, derive conditions to infer the unobservable score that panellists awarded to each publication. Juxtaposing institutions’ submissions with REF outcomes provides information on the latent pass-marks used for assigning quality levels, which respond to journal prestige measured by the Thomson Reuters Article Influence Score. We explore this statistical feature in the econometric analysis, which reveals the limited contribution to awarded quality made by other publication attributes, possibly unobservable to us, conditional on the Article Influence Score. We conclude that, in large-scale and costly evaluations such as the REF, the time-consuming task of peer reviews should be devoted to publications not in academic outlets with unambiguously top-scoring bibliometric indicators of journal impact. Our model also predicts a ranking of academic journals consistent with the classification of REF panellists.

H83|Going beyond analysis of internal data to support customs modernization: A case study in Gabon|Customs administrations in developing countries increasingly use risk-based techniques relying on data mining and statistical scoring. By demonstrating the value of using data analysis techniques to orient frontline controls so as to facilitate legal trade and combat fraud more effectively, these projects have helped promote a cultural change in these organizations. However, these risk management techniques may prove to be ineffective in assessing fraud risks based only on frauds detected by customs inspectors. In a context of moral hazard and low-performing customs administration, one way to address this weakness is to expand the approach by relying on other sources of information such as discrepancies in bilateral trade statistics. Several studies use these statistical discrepancies (mirror data) to identify fraudulent declarations and estimate their effects. By comparing Gabon's import customs data with discrepancies in its bilateral trade data, this paper stresses the usefulness of simultaneously analyzing customs fraud records and mirror trade statistics data. Such an analysis helps quantifying undetected fraud and therefore constitutes a valuable tool to target ex post audits. Then, based on the combination of these databases, the paper defines indicators to monitor the performance of customs controls.
H83|Transparency in state debt disclosure|We develop a new measure of relative debt transparency by comparing the amount of state debt reported in the annual Census survey and the amount reported in the statistical section of the state Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR). GASB 44 requires states to start reporting their total debt in the CAFR statistical section in FY 2006. However, states are allowed to use accounting choices to exclude some dependent agencies’ debt, which contributes to a gap between the two data sources. The regression results suggest that the gap tends to increase when states face greater fiscal stress or less political competition. Such patterns are not found in the pre-GASB 44 period.

Findings – Results show that the feeling of safety is quite high. Females are found to be more fearful than men. The study also found that more than half of the residents used special window/door grills for home safety control. As expected, the level of feeling very unsafe living at home alone after dark was double when their home was not protected by special windows or door grills. Novelty – The results of this study are important and provide the police with information on how they can get involved to help improve community safety. Future studies should investigate the type of crimes and experiences of crime victimization using the International Crime Victim Survey (ICVS)."""
H83|Evaluating Public Participation Mechanisms in LA21 Programs in Malaysia|"""Objective – The role of local government in LA21 is important in order to harness local level participation. In Malaysia, as in many other countries, the need to engage the public in sustainable development issues has shifted the focus to more decentralized and bottom up approaches in harnessing public participation in achieving sustainable development. This means that local authorities as the leading partners in LA21 need to work with the local community and the private sector to develop community action plans for sustainability under Local Agenda 21(LA21). Thus, the overall goal of the study is to determine how participation can best be implemented in LA21 programmes in selective councils by evaluating the key participatory mechanisms that have been employed by the councils. Methodology/Technique – This is a qualitative study that was conducted on four specific councils in West and East Malaysia to determine the effectiveness of the participatory mechanisms used in LA21 programs. The main methods of data collection were through the use of semi-structured interviews, focus groups and document analysis. Findings – The overall conclusion is that the councils were still using the conventional methods to encourage public participation and hence were not able to enhance public participation in the LA21 program. Novelty – The study will not only create a framework for local councils intending to implement a bottom-up approach to participation but also establish a base-line description of participatory mechanisms in LA21 programmes to encourage further research in this area of evolving LA21 research."""
H83|Feministic Analysis of Arundhati Roy's Postmodern Indian Fiction: The God of Small Things|"""Objective – The aim of the research is to identify the feminist strains in the postmodern Indian Fiction The God of Small Things (TGST). The researcher has planned to investigate the text systematically for seeking feministic values. Methodology/Technique – The study reviews previous literature. Findings – Gender bias and feminism are relevant themes explored by postmodernists. Arundhati Roy portrays the predicament of women through her female characters belonging to three generations in this novel. In the novel, a sense of antagonism and division also infuse the difference senses of identity among the different generation of women. It also generates a line of the clash between the older and the younger generation. Family and political customs play a key role in disadvantaging women. Social constrains are so built up as to sanctify the persecution of women. This is because, in most of the civilizations, social structures are basically patriarchal. Arundhati's novel challenges this position, though her avowed feminist stance. Novelty – Women across the globe worldwide, nationwide, regionally and may be capable of holding the influential note of feminism and being capable of deconstructing a constructive implication of their own femaleness and womanhood after reading this paper."""
H83|The Model of Public Relations Practices in Indonesia|"""Objective – This research aims to compare the government public relations with business public relations in Indonesia. The research proves the hypothesis that either government or business public relations in Indonesia have already applied symmetric model on their communication activities. Methodology/Technique – A national survey involves 160 practitioners of government and business public relations. The research reinforces Grunig and Hunt's model of public relations that business public relations tends practice twoway symmetrical communication. On the other hands, the research also differs with Grunig and Hunt's model that government public relations tend to apply public information model. Findings – It is concluded that both government and business public relations in Indonesia have implemented two-way communication models. The findings have confirmed that public relations practices have grown along with the development of democracy in Indonesia. Novelty – The research contributes to develop scientific knowledge in public relations study and practices."""
H83|The Effect of Tangible Service Quality on The Performance of The Regional Office of Directorate General of State Assets Management West Kalimantan|"""Objective – The objective of this study was to test and analyze the public sector performance from the customer perspective. This research is to see that Directorate General of State Assets Management (DJKN) can determine the factors that influence its performance, and consistently maintain the performance that its provider. Moreover, it also aims to examine and analyze the effect of tangible service quality to public sector performance using multiple regression analysis to test the hypothesis. Methodology/Technique – This study uses purposive sampling method and obtained 58 respondents who are clients of DJKN Regional Office of West Kalimantan as the study sample. The data used is primary data collected through questionnaires. Findings – The results showed that the service time and the conditions of the office or facilities significantly affect the customer's satisfaction. While the service procedures, the cost of service, and the service staff did not significantly affect the customer's satisfaction. Novelty – The implication of this study is the DJKN Regional Office in improving the performance requires improvement in some aspects related to the customer's perspectives to improve the satisfaction of the customers which can encourage the achievement of better performance."""
H83|Impact of Surplus Labor Existence on Land Lease Market in Rural Central Java|"""Objective – The Indonesian rice sector seems to lose global competitiveness, and the government intervenes in the market to achieve food self-sufficiency. Particularly, in the main rice producing areas of Central Java, the rice sector does not have a comparative and competitive advantage due to small farm size. Then, we need to investigate the reasons why the farm sizes of rice producers are still small. Methodology/Technique – We hypothesize that the existence of surplus labor in rural areas restrains farm size enlargement. Therefore, we need to examine the existence of surplus labor in study area. By using the empirical model of the Cobb Douglas production function, we test the hypothesis of surplus labor. The estimation result shows that there is a surplus of labor in the study area. Findings – In addition, we examine the impact of surplus labor on land lease market in rural area. This study proves empirically that there is surplus labor in rural areas; therefore, farmers have difficulty finding job opportunities in sectors other than farming. In such a case, they prefer to cultivate rather than lease their land. Novelty – This result implies that the existence of surplus labor restricts the number of land lease contract. As a result, the land lease supply in the land lease market has become very limited. Thus, the existence of surplus labor in rural areas would be a constraint of farm size enlargement. This is the first study which explores the relationship between surplus labor and land lease market in the main rice producer area in Central Java."""
H83|Hidden Subsidies and the Public Ownership of Sports Facilities: The Case of Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara|Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California is an example of a private financing / public ownership arrangement. While the stadiumï¿½s construction resulted in no direct tax increases, this ownership arrangement allows the San Francisco 49ers to avoid many types of taxes on the income generated from Leviï¿½s Stadium. We estimate the total tax savings to the 49ers at between $106 and $213 million over the first 20 years of Leviï¿½s Stadium compared with a privately financed and owned option. We argue that tax savings inherent in private financing / public ownership arrangements represent indirect and hidden subsidies.
H83|Occupational Intention of Public Administration Undergraduates|Augmenting behavioral public administration to occupational intention research we investigate the link between three types of motivation, and the intention of students to work in civil service after graduation. We make detailed observations of the self-reported job preferences of 2nd public administration undergraduates in two prestigious universities in Moscow, Russian Federation. We report that federal civil service is the top destination for Russian PA undergraduates. We also report that working in federal civil service by far triumphs over regional public administration in terms of self-reported occupational intention. We also make in-depth observations of the expected utility underlying students’ job preferences. We use these observations to propose a general model of civil service job intention. The model posits that the intention to work in civil service after graduation results from two major sources: the perceived expectation from parents with a civil service background, and the expected utility from four benefits of public sector employment. We empirically demonstrate that public service motivation is positively correlated with the intention to work in civil service after graduation
H83|Innovative Behavior and Prosocial Motivation of Russian Civil Servants|The motivation of civil servants has a considerable impact on their decision-making and thus the performance of a bureaucratic agency. This paper studies how innovative and error-correcting behavior of Russian public civil servants correlates with three types of motivation: public service motivation (PSM), power motivation (PM) and security motivation (SM). Civil servants with a higher level of PSM are expected to correct existing errors in standard operating procedures (SOP) and to introduce “new ways of doing things” (Fernandez and Moldogaziev 2013); and so to improve their organizations’ performance and citizens’ well-being by enhancing organizational learning. For empirical analysis the paper uses a new unique dataset with some 1,600 responses from a survey questionnaire among local civil servants in the Russian region of Leningrad. The results from regression analyses demonstrate that prosocial motivation (seven item scale, Cronbach’s alpha =0.72), power motivation (nine-item scale, Cronbach’s alpha=0.78), employee encouragement, empowerment practices, and citizens orientation are positively correlated with innovative and error-correcting. In contrast the level of security motivation and job satisfaction fail to achieve statistical significance throughout all models
H83|Motivations for Public Service in Corrupt States: Evidence from Post-Soviet Russia|Throughout much of the world, corruption in the civil service undermines state capacity, impedes economic development, and saps citizens’ morale. But while its pernicious effects are widely recognized, the roots of corruption remain poorly understood. Whereas most studies on corruption’s origins focus on the incentives bureaucrats face once in office, this study contributes to a line of recently emerging research that considers the role of self-selection of citizens with a propensity for corruption into bureaucracies where corruption is known to be widespread. Drawing on a survey and experimental games conducted with students at an elite university in Moscow, Russia, we compare the attitudinal, behavioral, and demographic traits of students seeking public sector employment to the traits of their peers seeking jobs in the private sector. Contrary to studies conducted in other high-corruption contexts, such as India, we find surprising evidence that students who prefer a public sector career display lss willingness to cheat or bribe in experimental games as well as higher levels of altruism. One interpretation of these findings is that corruption in Russia results from the transformation of bureaucrats’ behavior and attitudes after entering the civil service, rather than through a process of corrupt self-selection
H83|Public Policy As A Tool For Floriculture Development In The Municipality Of Tepetlixpa Mexico State, Politica Publica Como Herramienta De Desarrollo Para La Floricultura Del Municipio De Tepetlixpa Estado De Mexico|One problem facing the flower industry in Mexico, is a low linkage between government sectors responsible for supporting resources to producers. There are shortcomings in the management, dissemination and application of various types of programs that provide financial resources. These programs include national, state and municipal development at the federal level, the public body responsible for implementation is the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA). Such support programs must be permeated by t federal, state and municipal government with the intention of promoting the development of the region. This paper examines these government programs
H83|Using Internal and External Sources of Information to Reduce Customs Evasion|This paper aims to identify some factors that reduce evasion of customs duties in developing countries. Following the recent literature on customs evasion, we proxy customs fraud by discrepancies in bilateral trade statistics. Estimates first show that the more frequently a product is imported, the more customs fraud reduces. We argue that this result is indicative of the fact that customs officers use what they have learned from similar import declarations - use customs' internal information - to better assess the compliance of declarations. Then, we show that relying on an information provider - a pre-shipment inspection company in our case - seems to increase tax enforcement. Results indicate that pre-shipment inspections significantly reduce observed discrepancies in trade statistics. In line with previous studies, we find that the semi-elasticity of evasion increases with the tax rate. Finally, estimates confirm that enforcement is product-varying. Results are robust to various robustness checks.
H83|Exploring the role of ICT-Enabled Social Innovation to support the modernisation of EU Social Protection Systems: findings and insights from analysis of case studies in fourteen Member States|This report presents the results of the analysis of selected case studies on how ICT-enabled social innovations promoting social investment can contribute to the modernisation of social protection systems in the EU. The case studies are drawn from 14 different Member States and address diverse social services and policy domains. Evidence from the analysis points to the strong potential of using new approaches based on ICT-enabled social innovation to support public authorities, at various governance levels, in their efforts to improve the effectiveness and impact of social services delivery mechanisms and outreach. The analysis makes a first attempt to assess the relationship between different typologies of ICT-enabled social innovation and the broader social protection system in which they are embedded. However, more research is needed to better understand the potential impact these initiatives could have on enhancing the adequacy and sustainability of welfare systems in the EU.
H83|JRC Insights - Social Policy Innovation Series - Innovating EU Social Protection Systems through ICTs. Findings from analysis of case studies in fourteen Member States|This issue presents results from the analysis of selected case studies on how ICT-enabled social innovations promoting social investment can contribute to the modernisation of social protection systems in the EU. The selected case studies are drawn from fourteen Member States and address diverse social services and policy domains. Findings from the research show that they have made a positive contribution to transforming existing social services models, with ICT-enabled social innovation playing a crucial role, either as an enabler or game changer. The analysis illustrates examples of how ICTs can provide solutions to those global societal challenges that are adding new complexities to the delivery of social services; in particular, ICTs can help building a â€˜client pathwayâ€™ approach, with services centred on the needs of the beneficiaries. At a more operational level, the simplification and automation of procedures increases access to services and fosters a direct relationship between service providers and users. Innovative policies encouraging the development of ICT solutions for the management of social protection systems and the delivery of social services should thus be promoted; to this end, specific incentive schemes to guarantee development, sustainability and transferability of those initiatives that generate social value by leveraging on ICTs shall be identified and fostered across the EU. At the same time, high levels of digitalization in the services delivery system must be balanced with alternative channels, to ensure that the less technologically savvy are not excluded. For this purpose, it is crucial to involve citizens and relevant stakeholders right from the early stages of social policy programming, and the creation of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and partnerships with third sector organisations should be encouraged.
H83|Stock-Flow Adjustments and Interest Rates|We assess the e ects of stock- ow adjustments (SFA) on short and long-term interest rates for 14 European countries between 1970 and 2015, in panel and SUR analysis. We conclude that an increase in SFA reduces long- and short-term interest rates, with higher reductions for short-term rates. Furthermore, the decreasing e ects of an increment in the stock- ow have reduced since the 2008-2009 nancial crisis. As expected, there is also an upward push on both interest rates from a rise in the debt ratio. Key Words : Stock- ow adjustment; Debt; Interest rates; SUR; Panel.
H83|The Evolving Role of City Managers and Chief Administrative Officers|Ontario has benefited from well-functioning municipal government since Confederation, in large part because timely reforms have dealt with emerging problems. In response to recent issues, the Ontario government has decided that council-staff relations are sufficiently important to impose a legal requirement for a governing policy to be implemented in each of its 444 municipal governments. The often hidden, but very important, relationship between the municipal council and the public service is a key determinant of the success of any municipality. This paper explores how that relationship has changed over time with particular emphasis on the relatively recent ascendance in Ontario of the chief administrative officer (CAO) model. We believe that the CAO model performs better than either the council-committee model on which it was superimposed, or the U.S.-style â€œstrong mayorâ€ /political executive format that some favour. But the CAO model in Ontario is still relatively new and continues to evolve. This paper offers some suggestions for positive ways in which the CAO model can develop and warns of some clouds on the horizon that could harm the Canadian municipal government system.

H83|How Taxing Is Tax Filing? Using Revealed Preferences to Estimate Compliance Costs|This paper uses a quasi-experimental design and a novel identification strategy to estimate the cost of filing income taxes. First, using US income tax returns, I observe how taxpayers choose between itemizing deductions and claiming the standard deduction. Taxpayers forgo tax savings to avoid compliance costs, which provides a revealed preference estimate of the compliance cost of itemizing. I find that this cost increases with income, consistent with a higher opportunity cost of time for richer house- holds. Second, using my estimates and estimates of the time required to file other schedules, I estimate the cost of filing federal income taxes. I find that this cost has been increasing since the 1980’s and has reached 1.2% of GDP in the most recent years.
H83|Patent Examiner Specialization|We study the matching of patent applications to examiners at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Using test statistics originally developed to identify industry agglomeration, we find strong evidence that examiners specialize in particular technologies, even within relatively homogeneous art units. Examiner specialization is more pronounced in the biotechnology and chemistry fields, and less in computers and software. Evidence of specialization becomes weaker, but does not completely disappear, if we condition on technology sub-classes. There is no evidence that certain examiners specialize in applications that have greater importance or broader claims. More specialized examiners have a lower grant rate and produce a larger narrowing of claim-scope during the examination process. We discuss implications for instrumental variables based on examiner characteristics.
H83|Logic Models: Strengths and Weaknesses in the Context of Programmes Funded by the European Union|The main objective of the study is to provide opportunities for improvement of the logical model used in the European Union (EU) programming. The study provides an overview of the varieties of logical models, which starts with basic logic models, gradually increasing their complexity. The analysis identifies strengths and weaknesses of the models as well as their application by the European Commission (EC). In view of the identified deficiencies, the study proposes a new model that takes into account the bidirectional links between the elements of the logic model and the possible impact of external factors on each element of the model. The proposed model also includes additional elements that take into account the need for application of the outputs/results; the general objectives of a program, and best practices. Even the partial implementation of the proposed model in this study, allows the identification of weaknesses in the EU programming. In this case, they consist of: too general objectives; weak link between indicators and targets; disregard of prior experience (best practices) and lack of consideration of the general objectives.
H83|Enhancing public sector efficiency and effectiveness in the Czech Republic|Spending on public administration itself is relatively low and so are indicators of its performance. Challenges include wastage in public procurement, insufficient management of the investment cycle and high levels of staff turnover. This paper considers ways of building on recent reforms, including better procedures for EU-financed projects and the new Civil Service Act, to raise the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector. Performance monitoring is underused but could help drive improvements in service delivery. The structure of local government, which includes over 6 200 municipalities, exacerbates the challenges of the public administration by complicating co-ordination and stretching capacity. Accordingly, the second part of the paper focuses on ways of improving the efficiency and quality of public service delivery and realising greater benefits from decentralisation. Rendre le secteur public plus efficient et fonctionnel dans la République tchèque Les dépenses consacrées à l'administration publique proprement dite sont relativement faibles, et il en va de même de ses performances. Parmi les défis à relever, on peut citer notamment des gaspillages dans les marchés publics, une gestion insatisfaisante du cycle d'investissement et une rotation rapide des personnels. Le présent article est consacré aux moyens qui permettraient de prolonger les réformes récentes, en s’appuyant par exemple sur une amélioration des procédures qui régissent les projets financés par l'UE et sur la nouvelle loi sur la fonction publique, qui vise à rendre le secteur public plus efficace et plus efficient. Le suivi des résultats est peu pratiqué alors qu'il pourrait entraîner des progrès dans la prestation des services. La structure des collectivités locales, avec plus de 6 200 communes, aggrave les problèmes d'administration publique en compliquant la coordination et en dispersant les capacités. La deuxième partie de l’article porte donc sur les moyens d'améliorer l'efficience et la qualité de la prestation de services publics ainsi que de mieux tirer parti de la décentralisation.
H83|Spending reviews in Ireland – Learning from experience|This article examines the Irish experience of spending reviews and seeks to identify key lessons that should enhance the effectiveness of this process both in Ireland and in other OECD countries. Since the beginning of the economic and financial crisis, spending reviews have played an important role in Ireland’s efforts to restore expenditure policy to a more sustainable footing. However, the purpose of future reviews will move from improving the deficit position to ensuring all expenditure is considered when Government is making budget decisions. The purpose of spending reviews is to increase the fiscal space available to government for new, high priority, policies. By systematically examining baseline expenditure using available evidence and data, the increasing tendency to focus only on incremental improvements in expenditure can be countered. Spending reviews should be used to further embed the principles of expenditure efficiency and effectiveness into the wider budget process. This can be facilitated through extending the availability of relevant evaluations and performance information and ensuring such evaluations become central to the budgetary process.
H83|The accuracy of measures of institutional trust in household surveys: Evidence from the oecd trust database|A key policy concern in recent years has been the decline in levels of trust by citizen in public institutions. Trust is one of the foundations upon which the legitimacy and sustainability of political systems are built. It is crucial to the implementation of a wide range of policies and influences people’s behavioural responses to such policies. However, despite its acknowledged importance, trust in public institutions is poorly understood and is not consistently measured across OECD countries. The OECD Trust Database brings together information from a wide range of different household surveys containing measures of trust and combines this with information on other social and economic outcomes. The size of the database and range of covariates make it possible to identify the underlying patterns captured by survey based measures of trust in institutions and systematically test the accuracy (i.e. reliability and validity) of these measures. Reliability is tested by examining the consistency of measures of institutional trust across different surveys and between different waves of the same survey. Validity is harder to test than reliability. It is however possible to examine the construct validity of institutional trust measures by looking at whether these measures show the expected correlation with other social and economic variables on a cross-country basis. Analysis of item-specific non-response rates provides important additional information on the face validity of institutional trust measures.
H83|Governance statistics in OECD countries and beyond: What exists, and what would be required to assess their quality?|The paper provides a first assessment of the range of governance statistics that are available in OECD countries, reaching three main conclusions. First, while several statistics relating to various aspects of governance are already available, they differ in terms of the underlying concepts, the labels used to describe them, the range of institutions covered, and the detailed aspect or function considered: developing a common conceptual framework for governance is hence a prerequisite for gathering more robust and useful statistics in this field. Second, efforts should be devoted to thoroughly assess the quality of existing governance statistics, as a preliminary step towards providing general advice to statistical producers and users: the model currently used by the OECD with respect to measuring “trust”, based on an assessment of the reliability and validity of existing measures, could be usefully extended to other aspects of governance. Third, while politically sensitive, there are no a priori reasons why NSOs should consider governance statistics as falling outside their remit; these statistics should become part of their routine production, subject to the same quality standards and requirements that apply to other social, economic and environmental statistics. On trouvera dans le présent document une première évaluation de l’éventail des statistiques disponibles au sein des pays de l’OCDE dans le domaine de la gouvernance. Trois grandes conclusions s’en dégagent. Premièrement, si plusieurs statistiques relatives à divers aspects de la gouvernance sont déjà disponibles, elles diffèrent sur le plan de leurs concepts sous-jacents, des appellations employées pour les décrire, de la gamme d’institutions couvertes et des aspects précis pris en compte : l’élaboration d’un cadre conceptuel commun en matière de gouvernance apparaît donc comme une condition préalable pour rassembler des statistiques plus robustes et utiles dans ce domaine. Deuxièmement, il faudrait s’employer à évaluer de façon exhaustive la qualité des statistiques existantes en matière de gouvernance, afin de pouvoir ensuite fournir des conseils d’ordre général aux producteurs et aux utilisateurs de statistiques ; le modèle actuellement utilisé par l'OCDE s’agissant de mesurer la confiance, à la lumière d’une évaluation de la fiabilité et de la validité des éléments de mesure existants, pourrait utilement être étendu à d’autres aspects de la gouvernance. Troisièmement, même si cette question est politiquement sensible, il n’y a aucune raison, a priori, pour que les offices statistiques nationaux n’intègrent pas les statistiques de gouvernance à leur production courante, avec les mêmes exigences et normes de qualité que pour les autres statistiques d’ordre social, économique ou environnemental.
H83|A Model of a Liberally Conservative Approach to Negotiation in Public Administration| The goal of this essay is to suggest a strategy based on Cartesian quadrants which the current liberal-conservative politicians could apply to their decision-making and negotiating with their partners in public administration, in terms of integral approach that is based on the integral theory with AQAL framework. In the review and relevant leterature, the reader is presented with the concept of the liberal-conservative ideology that combines liberalism and conservatism where the liberal-conservative ideology complies with collective form of economy structure of the society. The models and data specification describes research methodology based on a comparison of the four key variables of the integral theory quadrants on the background of different aspects of the Cartesian ideology concept. The analysis and findings attributes and explains the key variables of the current liberal-conservative program of the ODS party to AQAL framework as the outcome of the integral approach of its current management. The conclusion summarizes the benefits of the integral theory as the intersection point of all four key variables of the AQAL framework quadrants for the current liberal conservative ODS members into one group where the negotiations and decision-making only work when being complex on a higher level.
H83|Opening the Black Box: Managing the Aid Policy Process in Pakistan|Scholars have suggested the need to open the ‘black box’ of the aid delivery system to gain a deeper understanding of how the aid policy process works in practice. This research responds to this gap in the literature by exploring how donors and the Pakistan government interact in game and network settings to manage foreign aid in the complex aid policy network. Using Klijn and Koppenjan’s (2016) process analysis, this research explores specific network management strategies actors employ to govern the aid policy process, and facilitate game and network interactions. The findings indicate that connecting strategies were the most prevalent strategies in managing the aid policy process in Pakistan. In strategic donor government interactions, incentives, research, and informality not only promote collaboration and cooperation, but also enable actors to mitigate stagnation and influence policy decisions. New insights from this research are valuable in improving existing knowledge about how the aid community interacts and manages the aid policy process on the ground; which would eventually contribute to the understanding of aid effectiveness.
H83|Organizational alignment in public administration: case study of Ministry of Justice of Cape Verde|This research has as an aim to perform scientific research on the topic of organizational alignment, where we can show the application and usefulness of the Vox Organizationis Instrument (Bojadziev et al., 2011) at the Ministry of Justice of Cape Verde. VOX Organizationis is the instrument used to measure the organizational alignment by dividing organizational functioning into two groups, non-formal (organizational culture, and leaders’ values) and formal (organizational structure, strategy, and policies) aspect of organizational functioning. Because this instrument involves five elements (organizational culture; leaders’ values; structure; strategy; and policies) measured on four dimensions (decision making and behavior; people versus task; innovativeness and risk-taking; open versus closed system) that are connected to the organizational functioning, it allow us to have a picture of specific areas within the organization that is misaligned or not, and by looking deeply at each dimension through the answers obtained from the questionnaire, we can also provide guidelines as to how alignment can be improved. The results that obtained shows that the formal and non-formal aspect of the organizational functioning are aligned, meaning that from the sample obtained, the Ministry of Justice presents a significant organizational alignment.
H83|Совершенствование Администрирования Государственных Программ В Республике Казахстан<BR>[Perfection of the administration of state programs in the Republic of Kazakhstan]|"It is well known that the final result of any process depends on a number of its components: the source material, the production process itself, quality control and qualification of the performer, as well as internal and external factors. The present work is intended to consider these elements, as applied to the evaluation of the effectiveness of the administration of state programs. The production process is the implementation of program documents, while quality control is represented by monitoring and control functions. Under the staffing and its quality, we mean the employees of the body responsible for state planning and their qualifications. It should be noted that internal and external factors are not considered within the framework of this article. The hypothesis of this study is the assumption that the current system of state planning in Republic of Kazakhstan has a hidden development potential that is not realized due to the low level of qualification of the involved personnel. To prove the hypothesis, such research methods as comparative analysis and analysis of normative legal acts were used. During the course of this study a number of recommendations were developed, presented during the open discussion of the draft state program ""Digital Kazakhstan-2020"". The author of this article proposed 21 proposals for changes in the system of target indicators, proposed projects and activities, as well as the formats for their implementation. 18 of them were adopted positively and included in the draft state program."

H83|Non-parametric methods applied in the efficiency analysis of European structural funding in Romania|One of the most widely used methods in assessing the efficiency of public policies and programs for a set of units is Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). DEA is a non-parametric method which identifies an efficiency frontier on which only the efficient Decision Making Units (DMUs) are placed, by using linear programming techniques. By applying non-parametric techniques of frontier estimation, the efficiency of a DMU can be measured by comparing it with an identified efficiency frontier. In this paper we have used DEA for evaluating the efficiency of the European structural funds allocated to finance the educational infrastructure through the Regional Operational Program 2007-2013, implemented in Romania. The output variables measure the educational performance as well as the school drop-out rate, while the focal input variable is the value of European funds. Romanian counties are considered to be the decision making units (DMUs) and our results confirm the deep disparities existing between Romanian counties concerning the efficient use of European structural funds.
H83|Transparency and Responsibility in the Public Administration Institutions. The case of Romania|An important topic often found in the media, but ambiguously treated is “transparency”. This article will present a blueprint for Romanian municipalities’ Websites done through the transparency concept’s filter. We will see that althoughthe law imposes to municipalities to post specific items on the Internet, they either omit or post a minimum of information just to “follow” the rules, without giving any evidence of interest. Assuming that displaying online more information requested by the law will lead to an increased users’ confidence in the system, we accessed the Website of each municipality in Romania (103) to search for the existence of financial data (budgets, financial indicators, assets etc.). In the end, we have presented a brief report on how the government responds to citizens’ concerns. The results are not very satisfactory, but we consider that such analyses will create a competition between municipalities, in which citizens are the winners.

For this reason, it is approached from three different perspectives: firstly, a macroeconomic approximation is carried out analyzing the remuneration of the employees according to the data of the macroeconomic picture of Galicia; Secondly, the salary payments declared in the “IRPF” to the Tax Agency are considered; Finally, the data obtained through surveys are collected: the “EPA” and the annual labor cost survey
H83|Rising Stars|We use the UK's 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) to study which attributes characterize a top-scoring (four-star) publication in Economics and Econometrics. We frame the analysis as a classification problem and, using information in official documents, derive conditions to infer the unobservable score that panellists awarded to each publication. Juxtaposing institutions' submissions with REF outcomes provides information on the latent pass-marks used for assigning quality levels, which respond to journal prestige measured by the Thomson Reuters Article Influence Score. We explore this statistical feature in the econometric analysis, which reveals the limited contribution to awarded quality made by other publication attributes, possibly unobservable to us, conditional on the Article Influence Score. We conclude that, in large-scale and costly evaluations such as the REF, the time-consuming task of peer reviews should be devoted to publications not in academic outlets with unambiguously top-scoring bibliometric indicators of journal impact. Our model also predicts a ranking of academic journals consistent with the classification of REF panellists.
H83|¿Cuántos trabajadores emplea el Estado de Chile? Problematización y orden de magnitud de la contratación a honorarios|En el presente artículo se presentan los resultados de un análisis que, en base a distintas fuentes de información administrativa, permite entregar un orden de magnitud a la cantidad de trabajadores que emplea el Estado de Chile. El principal resultado ha sido constatar que, independiente de la fuente de información utilizada, se identifica un cambio en la fisonomía del Estado: las formas de contratación temporales y desprovistas de derechos laborales han aumentado en los últimos 10 años de manera importante. El segundo hallazgo relevante es la incertidumbre que existe respecto al verdadero tamaño del Estado producto de las diferencias que tienen las diversas fuentes oficiales de información sobre la contratación de “trabajadores a honorarios”. El año 2014, de acuerdo la Dirección de Presupuestos y el Sistema Nacional de Información Municipal, se emplearon 358 mil trabajadores en el Gobierno Central y municipios, de los cuales 93 mil eran trabajadores a honorarios (1 de cada 4). Sin embargo, de acuerdo al Servicio de Impuestos Internos, para el mismo año calendario, 295 mil trabajadores emitieron boletas de honorarios al Estado. Estos resultados nos revelan la necesidad de estudios adicionales que permitan entender hasta qué punto están extendidas las formas precarias de contratación en el Estado y qué implicancias tiene ello sobre la calidad y sentido de la función pública. This article presents the results of an analysis that, based on different sources of administrative information, allows to deliver an order of magnitude to the number of workers employed by the State of Chile. The main result has been to verify that, regardless of the source of information used, a change in the physiognomy of the State is identified: temporary and precarious employment have increased significantly in the last 10 years. The second relevant finding is the uncertainty concerning the true size of the State, particularly because of the differences identified among official sources of information regarding the number of atypical workers. In 2014, according to the Bureau of Budgets and the National System of Municipal Information, 358 thousand workers were employed in the Central Government and municipalities, of which 93 thousand were atypical workers (1 in 4). However, according to the Internal Revenue Service, for the same calendar year, 295 thousand atypical workers were hired by the State. These results reveal the need for additional studies to understand the extent to which precarious forms of recruitment in the State are widespread and what implications this has for the quality and sense of the public function.
H83|Whistleblower Rewards, False Reports, and Corporate Fraud|It is often claimed that rewards for whistleblowers lead to fraudulent reports, but for several US programs this was not a major problem. We model the interaction between rewards for whistleblowers, sanctions against fraudulent reporting, judicial errors and standards of proof in the court case on the whistleblower's allegations and the possible follow-up for fraudulent allegations. Balancing whistleblower rewards, sanctions against fraudulent reports, and courts' standards of proof is essential for these policies to succeed. When the risk of retaliation is severe, larger rewards are needed and so are tougher sanctions against fraudulent reports. The precision of the legal system must be sufficiently high, hence these programs are not viable in weak institution environments, where protection is imperfect and court precision low, or where sanctions against false reporting are mild. Internal reporting channels may interfere with the external ones in unexpected ways.
H83|Significance of Communication and Project Management Processes in Public Sector Projects|Literature reveals that clarity in communication and employing consistent process are critical for project managers to improve project performance. A limited number of studies focused on such critical factors affecting project performance. This study aims to investigate the significance of communication and project management processes in Public Sector projects. For this empirical study, cross sectional design was used to collect data collected from project managers working on projects in Pakistan. Data analysis indicates significant and positive influence of clarity in communication and employing consistent process on project performance. Findings imply that project managers with clarity in communication and establishing consistent processes have an important role in improving project performance and increasing organizational growth.
H83|Endogenous Tax Audits and Taxpayer Assistance Services: Theory and Experiments|In recent years there has been a sharp rise in the information available to individual income taxpayers, such as through tax preparation software provided by third parties and support available by tax agencies, although the effects of this information on tax reporting is not well understood. Within a setting characterized by an endogenous audit process and taxpayer uncertainty, this study uses theory and laboratory experiments to investigate the effects of taxpayer assistance services that better inform taxpayers about their tax liability and the audit process. The endogenous audit rule we study is simple, yet relative to existing work is more likely to characterize the actual incentives facing taxpayers. Among our findings, and in contrast to the case of purely random audits, in theory the effect of information services on tax underreporting is ambiguous, and we find support empirically for increased tax underreporting even in a setting where theory predicts the opposite. When services provide better information on both liability and the audit process, audit information is more salient to participants, negating the strong effects observed when only liability information is provided.
H83|When the State Doesn't Play Dice: An Experimental Analysis of Cunning Fiscal Policies and Tax Compliance|We provide a test of the effect of aggressive fiscal policies on tax com- pliance in the lab. Our experimental setup allows tax agents to break a deontological rule concerning the implementation of audits on a group of tax payers. In one incentive condition, tax agents have a direct monetary benefit from higher compliance; in another, they have none. Tax payers, on the other hand, go through a phase of stringent controls under their tax agents and one where audit probabilities are fixed and implemented by a random device. We find that tax agents bend the rules to their advantage. Many either perform very frequent audits or place them in a strategic way, thus enforcing a norm of high compliance. Those following the rules have no success. Surprisingly, this is true for both incentive conditions. Tax payers exposed to these audit strategies display nearly full compliance and con- tinue to do so also when tax agents are inactive. We conclude that cunning fiscal policies can effectively be used by tax authorities, if it is transparent that they lead to higher overall compliance. This establishes a virtuous norm that can have positive spillovers even in domains where the state has less coercive power.
H83|The Employment Service-Unemployment Insurance Partnership: Origin, Evolutioin, and Revitalization|This study traces the origin and evolution of the partnership between the employment service and unemployment insurance programs in the United States. We examine objectives of the framers of the Wagner-Peyser and Social Security Acts that established these programs. Using primary sources, we then analyze early actions of the architects of social insurance to facilitate cooperation between the two programs to meet economic exigencies, grapple with political cronyism, and surmount legal barriers. We also discuss factors that caused changes in the employment service–unemployment insurance partnership over time. We identify reasons for the erosion in cooperation starting in the 1980s, and explain why ever since there has been a continuous decline in service availability. Reviewing evidence on the effectiveness of in-person employment services for unemployment insurance beneficiaries, we suggest ways to revitalize the employment service–unemployment insurance partnership. We explore the source of Wagner-Peyser Act funding, how it was formalized, then eroded, and how it can be renewed.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

Sebbene il legislatore abbia previsto in pi occasioni lÕapplicazione del diritto privato del lavoro anche alle imprese esercitate o controllate da enti pubblici (dallÕart. 2093 cod. civ. fino al d.lgs 175/2016), la disciplina speciale che ad esse pure si applica le colloca su un crinale fra natura pubblica e natura privata che affatica non poco gli operatori economici e del diritto.
H83|Biased policy professionals|"A large literature focuses on the biases of individuals and consumers, as well as ""nudges"" and other policies that can address those biases. Although policy decisions are often more consequential than those of individual consumers, there is a dearth of studies on the biases of policy professionals: those who prepare and implement policy on behalf of elected politicians. Experiments conducted on a novel subject pool of development policy professionals (public servants of the World Bank and the Department for International Development in the UK) show that policy professionals are indeed subject to decision making traps, including sunk cost bias, the framing of losses and gains, frame-dependent risk-aversion, and, most strikingly, confirmation bias correlated with ideological priors, despite having an explicit mission to promote evidence- informed and impartial decision making. These findings should worry policy professionals and their principals in governments and large organizations, as well as citizens themselves. A further experiment, in which policy professionals engage in discussion, shows that deliberation may be able to mitigate the effects of some of these biases."
H83|Housing Bubble and Government Regulation: Evidence from China|Facing rampant real estate price surge, Chinese government imposed the home purchase restriction policy to dampen the speculation activity in major cities in 2010. Using a comprehensive dataset covering the real estate markets across various cities, we find that the policy triggered substantial decline in the property price and transaction volume. Cities having higher reliance on real estate sector for fiscal revenue and economic growth experienced greater drop in housing prices following the policy implementation. However, the policy had no measurable effects on the construction boom, hinting the limitation of the policy to correct the housing bubble. These evidences are robust to endogeneity concerns addressed by both two-step difference-in-difference approach and endogeneous treatment effects regressions.
H83|Do Government Audits Reduce Corruption? Estimating the Impacts of Exposing Corrupt Politicians|This paper examines the extent to which government audits of public resources can reduce corruption by enhancing political and judiciary accountability. We do so in the context of Brazil’s anticorruption program, which randomly audits municipalities for their use of federal funds. We find that being audited in the past reduces future corruption by 8 percent, while also increasing the likelihood of experiencing a subsequent legal action by 20 percent. We interpret these reduced-form findings through a political agency model, which we structurally estimate. Our results suggest that the reduction in corruption comes mostly from the audits increasing the perceived nonelectoral costs of engaging in corruption.
H83|Elections, Ideology, and Turnover in the U.S. Federal Government|A defining feature of public sector employment is the regular change in elected leadership. Yet, we know little about how elections influence careers. We describe how elections can alter policy outputs and disrupt civil servants’ influence over agency decisions, potentially shaping their career choices. We use new data on federal career records between 1988 and 2011 to evaluate how elections influence turnover decisions. We find large levels of stability in the civil service but also pockets of employees that are responsive to presidential transitions. Senior career employees in agencies with views divergent from the president’s appear most affected. In the first three years of an administration, political factors such as elections, policy priorities, and political ideological differences, are estimated to increase turnover in the senior civil service by 30.9% in some agencies. We also find suggestive evidence that vacancies in high-level positions after elections may induce lower-level executives to stay longer in hopes of advancing.
H83|State-owned enterprises in the Russian market: Ownership structure and their role in the economy|This article analyzes the ownership structure of state-owned companies and their role in the Russian economy. Using a sample of 114 of the largest Russian companies, we estimated direct and indirect state participation as a percentage of shareholdings for direct and indirect federal property during the time period of 2006–2014. We used two methods to estimate the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which allowed us to compare our results with OECD and Rosstat statistics for a broader sample of Russian companies owned by the public sector. This study revealed a decline in SOEs’ share in the capitalization of the Russian stock market and a slight increase in their share of total revenues and employment. The results indicated that public SOEs demonstrated significantly higher productivity compared to non-public SOEs and private companies had a distinct advantage in productivity compared with public SOEs. Despite the significant advantages in productivity of private companies over the SOEs, over a 9-year period, we observed that this gap narrowed. This may be due to conditions of high financial volatility and stagnation of the economy that result in certain advantages for SOEs in terms of access to sources of long-term funding and other forms of state support. However, SOEs with indirect state control experienced a rapid growth in revenue and productivity compared to other firms. This may indicate the presence of a specific stock selection mechanism for transferring more effective SOEs from direct state ownership to indirect control as an alternative to privatization.

H83|Accrual practices and reform experiences in OECD countries Results of the 2016 OECD Accruals Survey|Over the past two decades, a growing number of governments have begun moving away from pure cash accounting toward accrual accounting. In the wake of these reforms, the budget presentation, audit techniques, and accounting standards setting and consolidation practices have evolved significantly. This paper reviews the current accrual practices in OECD countries, challenges associated with accruals reforms, and assesses the benefits achieved. It finally considers initiatives in OECD countries to make better use of accrual information in the future. JEL Classification: H60, H83 Keywords: accrual accounting, accrual budgeting, accounting practices, budgeting practices, consolidation, external audit, accounting standard setting.

H83|Budget institutions in low-income countries|This paper presents 12 budget institutions that can support planning and delivery of credible fiscal strategies in the fiscal policy-making process. The resulting framework is applied to seven low-income countries and the status of their budget institutions compared to the G20 advanced and emerging market economies. The paper then presents recommendations for designing and implementing appropriate reform strategy for low-income countries. Particular attention is paid to prioritisation and sequencing of reform efforts.

Today IFIs are considered among the most important innovations in the emerging architecture of public financial management. Within the OECD area, their number has more than tripled and is expected to continue to rise. This publication provides a unique set of in depth case studies of IFIs in 18 OECD member countries in light of many of the good practices for effective IFIs identified in the OECD Recommendation on Principles for Independent Fiscal Institutions.
H83|Ten years of PPP: An initial assessment|A public-private partnership (PPP) is a long-term contractual arrangement whereby the government calls on a company or a consortium formed for the purpose to design, build, finance and maintain a structure or facility necessary for its public-service mission. The company or consortium is subsequently remunerated according to the availability and performance of the structure or facility. The remuneration must enable the company or consortium to repay its initial investment and cover the financing costs and the services it provides. In a broad sense PPPs have long existed in France under various names and in various forms, marking the history of the development of the country’s infrastructure networks. In the modern sense, corresponding to the partnership contract (contrat de partenariat now renamed “machés de partenariat” since 2015) created in 2004 and covering all-inclusive government-pay contracts, PPPs have made significant inroads in certain sectors of public management such as social infrastructure (schools, hospitals, prisons, etc.). As a result France topped the European PPP league table in 2011-12, though PPPs remain a niche market overall in relation to the total amount of public procurement. Now, ten years later, it is possible to take stock, in both qualitative and quantitative terms, of projects initiated and carried out. This report aims to show the impact and effects of this new public procurement resource, sector by sector, in facts and figures, and to illustrate the contributions it has made and the feedback it has generated by major type of project and by public-sector initiator, from municipalities to central government agencies.

H83|Rekapitulace jednoduchého účetnictví rok 2016| Jednoduché účetnictví bylo konstituováno prvním zákonem o účetnictví z roku 1991, právní úprava zásadně rozlišila dvě účetní soustavy. Podmínečně mohly jednoduché účetnictví aplikovat účetní jednotky fyzické i právnické osoby. Jedním z důsledků vstupu České republiky do Evropské unie bylo zrušení jednoduchého účetnictví. Neziskové organizace využily přechodných opatření a přes neplatnou právní úpravu vedly jednoduché účetnictví až do konce roku 2015. V právní úpravě České republiky se znovuobjevuje jednoduché účetnictví od roku 2016. Cílem příspěvku je provést rekapitulaci stávajících podmínek vedení jednoduchého účetnictví a upozornit na nedostatky nové úpravy. Analýzou a komparací byly identifikovány poznatky, následně vysloveny závěry a stylizovány návrhy. Zákon o účetnictví ukládá povinnost všem účetním jednotkám vést účetnictví v plném rozsahu. Podmínečně je možno vést účetnictví ve zjednodušeném rozsahu, nebo jednoduché účetnictví. Právně nejde o účetní soustavy, ale o rozsahy vedení účetnictví s tím, že jednoduché účetnictví je určeno pouze právnickým osobám. Jednoduché účetnictví lze vést pouze za současného splnění čtyř podmínek, které se orientují na daň z přidané hodnoty, celkové příjmy, hodnotu majetku a právní formu. V případě nesplnění jedné z nich je účetní jednotka povinna přejít na účetnictví ve zjednodušeném nebo plném rozsahu. Analogicky platí i opačná možnost. Předmětem jednoduchého účetnictví jsou výdaje a příjmy o kterých je účtováno v peněžním deníku, dále majetek a závazky, které jsou evidovány v knize pohledávek a závazků. Po skončení účetního období vzniká povinnost sestavení přehledů se stanoveným obsahem. Účetnictví je právem považováno za dokonalý informační systém, aktuálně regulovaný zákonem a vyhláškou. Nově vzniklé jednoduché účetnictví nenaplňuje atributy účetnictví v mnoha ohledech. Nejde o komplexně provázanou informační soustavu, disponující kontrolními vazbami a prezentovanou výstupy účetní závěrky. Nejsou aplikovány odpisy, opravné položky, rezervy; principy věrného a poctivého zobrazení a úplnosti nejsou naplněny. Jednoduché účetnictví by mělo být přejmenováno tak, aby vhodně vyjadřovalo dispoziční obsah, stojící mimo správné účetnictví.
H83|Organizational Capacity, Regulatory Review, and the Limits of Political Control|Studies of administrative politics focus primarily on political control and ignore organizational capacity. We argue that political and organizational factors, as well as the interaction between the two, are necessary for explaining executive policymaking. To test this theory, we consider the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), an agency often perceived to be the president’s political instrument. Using a new dataset of over 22,000 regulations reviewed by OIRA, we demonstrate that political factors influence review lengths, but organizational factors also exhibit a significant role. We find that reviews are longer when OIRA is understaffed and over-worked. Significantly, we demonstrate that low organizational capacity inhibits the president’s ability to expedite priority rules. Overall, this study highlights the organizational limits of political control. (JEL H11, H83, K23, L50, L51, M50)
H83|Tax Farming Redux: Experimental Evidence on Performance Pay for Tax Collectors|Performance pay for tax collectors has the potential to raise revenues, but might come at a cost if it increases the bargaining power of tax collectors vis-à-vis taxpayers. We report the first large-scale field experiment on these issues, where we experimentally allocated 482 property tax units in Punjab, Pakistan, into one of three performance pay schemes or a control. After two years, incentivized units had 9.4 log points higher revenue than controls, which translates to a 46% higher growth rate. The scheme that rewarded purely on revenue did best, increasing revenue by 12.9 log points (64% higher growth rate), with little penalty for customer satisfaction and assessment accuracy compared to the two other schemes that explicitly also rewarded these dimensions. The revenue gains accrue from a small number of properties becoming taxed at their true value, which is substantially more than they had been taxed at previously. The majority of properties in incentivized areas in fact pay no more taxes, but instead report higher bribes. The results are consistent with a collusive setting in which performance pay increases collectors’ bargaining power over taxpayers, who have to either pay higher bribes to avoid being reassessed or pay substantially higher taxes if collusion breaks down.

H83|Innovation capabilities in the private sector: evaluating subsidies for hiring S&T workers in Spain|This article evaluates the effectiveness of a public programme intended to improve innovation capabilities in the private sector by subsidizing the hiring of research and development (R&D) personnel. Using information from the programme management database, we study factors associated with the duration of contracts and their transformation into open-ended contracts, a basic aim of the programme. We explore the characteristics of subsidies, individuals, entities, and projects related to the eventual stabilization of the new R&D employees, when the subsidies had ended. The programme was found to strengthen R&D capacity in recipient firms—above all in technology centres—yet, only about half of the subsidized short-term contracts had been converted into permanent contracts by the end of their second year.
H83|The International Macro-Environment of an Organization|The international macro-environment (supranational macro-environment) brings together all the uncontrollable factors with a global impact, and it is related to the organization’s indirect relationships on international markets. Romania’s globalization and the EU integration increased the importance of the macro-environment for all organizations, regardless of their degree of internationalization. In marketing, we must master the main agreements between countries and the regulations emanating from general international bodies, reflecting on their business, on different foreign markets. Knowledge of the international environment is possible only through an analysis of its components (Anastase, I., 2012, p.41).
H83|Making Promises Good: The Anti-Money Laundering Regime as a Multi-Purpose Tool for Governance|The creation of this international anti-money laundering regulatory regime is, contrary to itsneglect by the literature, important in two ways. First, it provides us with a second example -alongside the Basle Accord â€“ with which we can examine how political barriers to regulatorycooperation and coordination might be overcome; without overstating the success of the antimoneylaundering regime the paper argues that a lot of the political circumstances that enabledcooperation and coordination to develop in this case can be applied in facing other economiccrime forms. The FATF case may help us to identify important political conditions that can fostercollective regulatory initiatives in the international financial area and especially in South EasternEurope. Additionally the anti-money laundering regime may be useful more directly in pursuingsome other regulatory and security goals of particular interest for the Balkan region. Specifically,the kinds of international cooperation and coordination that have been introduced to combatmoney laundering may help to strengthen international regulatory initiatives aimed at curbingcorruption, tax evasion and capital flight and fighting the threat deriving from internationalorganised crime and global terrorism.
H83|Institutional Efficiency Of Local Government In Issuing Administrative Decisions, Exemplified By The Performance Of The Local Government Appeal Board In Olsztyn|Institutions and institutional structures play an important role in the theory and research of processes involved in economic progress. The competitive position of territorial units depends on their effective performance, especially on the efficiency of local governments. Skills, qualifications and functional abilities of local authorities gain importance. In this context, creating and stimulating the economic growth locally is essential, because it equates with building the foundation of development processes in all areas of life. Our purpose was to evaluate the institutional efficiency of local authorities manifested by administrative decisions they take. The data submitted to our analysis consisted of appeals against decisions taken by local governments. The objective was to analyze the appeals filed to local government appeal boards and how they were examined in compliance with the binding law. The time period spanned the years 2007 to 2013. The analysis covered appeals lodged to the Local Government Appeal Board in Olsztyn.
H83|Market Role of the State and Possibilities to Control this Role at Public Enterprises|This paper is intended to explore the role of the state in the economy, the controllability of this role and the ex-post control of the activities involved. The article focuses on the measurability of the efficiency of the state’s participation and the Hungarian characteristics and current trends of the state’s role; issues that are closely intertwined with the notion of transparent fiscal management and the requirement of accountability. The study presents the place and various forms of state participation from a theoretical perspective before it proceeds to discuss theoretical proposals, valuable methodologies and options regarding the performance measurement, controllability and control of the state’s role. The paper sums up the relationship between theory and Hungarian practice, and confronts the findings of a survey conducted among companies in majority state ownership with the theories. Finally, it draws practical conclusions from the findings of the author’s survey and offers a number of critical remarks.
H83|EPSAS: Investment Into the Future. European Public Sector Accounting: Present and Future|At present, IPSAS – the International Public Sector Accounting Standards developed by IPSASB (the International Public Sector Accounting Standard Board) – comprises the only internationally recognised system of public sector accounting standards. Although its application is not mandatory for Member States, IPSAS plays an important role in the development and practice of public sector accounting across the European Union. Council Directive 2011/85/EU acknowledges that IPSAS – i.e. the availability of a complete and reliable set of fiscal data that is comparable across Member States – is key to the budgetary surveillance framework of the Union. The European Commission has passed a decision to establish a set of European Public Sector Accounting Standards (EPSAS) applicable across all EU Member States, and the use of IPSAS standards may provide a sound basis for this endeavour. The most significant contribution of this paper is its attempt to summarise the current status of European public sector accounting, i.e. to present the practice of public sector accounting in the European Union and to outline expected changes in the European regulation of public sector accounting in light of the harmonisation efforts in progress.
H83|The Aid Policy Network in Pakistan: An Actor-Network Analysis|Despite an extensive debate on foreign aid, the voluminous literature mainly focuses on the evaluation of foreign aid outcomes (or aid effectiveness). The aid literature has rarely considered the aid policy process and the influence of aid policy networks on managing foreign aid decisions in an aid recipient country. Using an actor-network analysis, this study helps to understand the complexities, interdependencies, and constraints involved in managing aid policy process in Pakistan. The findings indicate that absence of an inclusive actionable development framework and limited capacity of the state provide opportunities for donors to dominate the policy debate and pursue their own priorities. Further, the provincial devolution of 2011 has made the aid delivery system in Pakistan even more fragmented and complex, operating at multiple levels.
H83|Efficiency assessment of Portuguese municipalities using a conditional nonparametric approach|Measuring local government efficiency is a complex task that has to take into account that they usually operate in a heterogeneous context. Therefore, the estimation of relative efficiency measures of their performance needs to account for the effect of contextual and exogenous variables on the production process. This should assure that the respective measures adequately reflect the portion of inefficiency that may be attributable to local authorities. In this paper, we apply time-dependent conditional frontier estimators to assess the performance of the 278 Portuguese mainland municipalities for the 2009-2014 period. By applying this nonparametric approach, we can avoid the strong assumptions on the specification of the estimated production function required by traditional two-stage methods. Furthermore, we examine the effect of contextual and exogenous variables on municipal efficiency levels and technological change. The results reveal that the recent local reforms introduced after the bailout agreement have slightly enhanced the performance of local authorities, but only for small and medium-sized municipalities.
H83|Credit allocation based on journal impact factor and coauthorship contribution|Some research institutions demand researchers to distribute the incomes they earn from publishing papers to their researchers and/or co-authors. In this study, we deal with the Impact Factor-based ranking journal as a criteria for the correct distribution of these incomes. We also include the Authorship Credit factor for distribution of the incomes among authors, using the geometric progression of Cantor's theory and the Harmonic Credit Index. Depending on the ranking of the journal, the proposed model develops a proper publication credit allocation among all authors. Moreover, our tool can be deployed in the evaluation of an institution for a funding program, as well as calculating the amounts necessary to incentivize research among personnel.
H83|Performance of mixed oligopoly model in the context of Indian telecom industry|The logic for state monopoly of public utilities arises from increasing returns to scale and the concern that private business in these areas results in monopolistic exploitation of consumers. The state monopoly however is fraught with the danger of production inefficiency. In this backdrop, the market form of mixed oligopoly is contemplated in markets like health, education, electricity, gas, telecommunications, etc, where public and private sector coexists. The private firms maximize profit but the public firm maximizes social welfare. Despite this theoretical exposition, it is often observed that public firms fail to make contributions according to their potentiality. As a result the issue of social welfare gets a short shrift. While assessing the behaviour and performance of the firm in this setup we must know the objective functions and the constraints. The asymmetry of objectives between private and public firms and the asymmetry of constraints may explain the below par performance of public firms. This needs focus on the existing theoretical construct on mixed oligopoly and empirical consideration of the performance of some specific public firm. In this paper we study the state owned Indian telecom company Bharat Shanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) to get an understanding of performance of mixed oligopoly.

H83|A Short “Second Best” Narrative of the Ukrainian Economy/ Una Breve “Segunda Mejor Opción” de Narrativa de la Economía Ucraniana|This article maintains that in our second best world, neither corruption nor the informal sector and political instability can be held responsible for the moderate performance of the Ukrainian economy. Corruption in Ukraine appears to act as “grease in the wheels of the economy”, while informal activities add to the welfare of its people. And, no connection of political instability with economic performance may be contemplated conclusively. The cause of the inefficiency of private and public investment is traced to poor public governance. Massive infrastructure investments can become the remedy (i) in the context of public-private partnerships with the collaboration of the subnational governments, and (ii) in financing the projects through domestic monetary expansion, under a macroeconomic policy viewpoint emphasizing the monetary rather than fiscal side of the venture. The proposed monetary expansion can only work only under the proper multiplier, accelerator, and capital accumulation link. Special care should be taken to improve the industrial organization of the inefficient banking sector Este artículo manifiesta que en nuestro mundo de la segunda mejor opción, no se puede atribuir ni a la corrupción ni al sector informal y a la inestabilidad política el rendimiento limitado de la economía ucraniana. En Ucrania, la corrupción parece funcionar como “lubrificante para las ruedas de la economía”, mientras las actividades incrementan el bienestar de su pueblo. Además, no se puede contemplar de manera definitiva ninguna conexión entre la inestabilidad política y el rendimiento económico. La causa de la ineficencia de las inversiones particulares y públicas resalen a la gobernación pública ineficaz. Las inversiones masivas en infraestructuras pueden constituir un remedio (i) en el ámbito de partenariados entre los sectores públicos y privados con la colaboración del gobierno a nivel sub-nacional y (ii) financiando los proyectos mediante una expansión monetaria interior, desde un punto de vista de política macroeconómica que se enfoque en el aspecto monetario de la inversión más que en el fiscal. La expansión monetaria propuesta puede funcionar únicamente con el enlace correcto entre multiplicadores, aceleradores y la acumulación de capital. Se debe cuidar en particular de mejorar la organización del sector bancario actualmente ineficiente.
H83|The rate of implementation of accrual based accounting in the EU public sector|The article deals with the extent of using of accrual based financial reporting in public sector of EU member states. The extent is expressed by the number of member states on the one hand and monetarily through budgetary expenditure on the other hand. Besides, the article describes the current attitude and actions of European institutions to introduce the accrual basis in the public sector at EU level. At the same time the article discusses the specific possibilities of implementation of accrual based accounting with the emphasis on introducing the principles based on International Public Sector Standards (IPSAS).
H83|Modernisation of Public Sector Financial Reporting Systems in Europe - Challenges and Milestones|Many European countries have been carried out a modernization projects in public sector financial reporting since the last two decades. Consequence of a stronger demand for complex, reliable and relevant economic information on government is governments´ efforts towards better accountability. IPSAS standards, a full accrual national financial reporting standards closed to, or national standards with clear reference to IPSAS, are often considered as the best tool for that. This article aims to identify key challenges and milestones - four key aspects of these public sector financial reporting modernization projects. It offers a comparison amongst several European countries comparing the ways these countries decided to deal with those challenges and milestones.
H83|Internal newsletter as an instrument for supporting an implementation human resources management strategy. Case study of Statistical Office in Kielce (Newsletter wewnetrzny jako instrument wspomagajacy realizacje strategii zarzadzania zasobami ludzkimi. Przyklad Urzedu Statystycznego w Kielcach)|The article is dedicated to practical aspects of management in public administration. It discusses the problem of internal communication in relation to selected areas of human resources management (HRM) strategy. The aim of the article is to present opportunities of using an internal newsletter as a form of communication in the HRM strategy implementation. The analysis is conducted on the basis of relevant literature, case study and results of the Authors study. The staff newsletter in the Statistical Office in Kielce presented here seems to be an example of good practice in internal communication supporting implementation of HRM strategy.
H83|Local public finances in Brazil: are mayoral characteristics important?|The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the importance of mayor’s characteristics (education, experience, and gender) on Brazilian municipalities’ fiscal outcomes. In order to estimate the causal effects we use a regression discontinuity methodology based on close elections. We find no evidence that the fiscal performance of a municipality is affected by mayor’s gender. Regarding the qualification of the mayor, we find robust evidence that education and experience matter only for the composition of spending. Experienced and educated mayors choose to devote a smaller fraction of the budget to current expenditures and as a consequence seem to be more concerned with the quality of public finances.
H83|Strategy implementation through hierarchical couplings in a management control package: an explorative case study|Abstract We examine how couplings of management control (MC) elements help to implement an organization’s strategy. Despite prior research stating that couplings between MC elements form a fruitful soil for further research, empirical studies in this area are still scarce. We draw on coupling theory to explore three hierarchical relations between MC elements, and examine how these couplings help to implement the organization’s strategy. We conducted a single case study in a medium-sized Dutch municipality, using interviews, observations and desk research. We identified three different types of couplings which yielded different effects, but were all distinctively helpful in implementing particular parts of the organization’s strategy. This study contributes to the MC literature by demonstrating how coupling theory can be operationalized to examine relations between MC elements in an MC package, and by showing how various hierarchical couplings can help to implement an organization’s strategy.
H83|Research assessment using early citation information|Abstract Peer-review based research assessment, as implemented in Australia, the United Kingdom, and some other countries, is a very costly exercise. We show that university rankings in economics based on long-run citation counts can be easily predicted using early citations. This would allow a research assessment to predict the relative long-run impact of articles published by a university immediately at the end of the evaluation period. We compare these citation-based university rankings with the rankings of the 2010 Excellence in Research assessment in Australia and the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise in the United Kingdom. Rank correlations are quite strong, but there are some differences between rankings. However, if assessors are willing to consider citation analysis to assess some disciplines, as is the case for the natural sciences and psychology in Australia, it seems reasonable to consider also including economics in that set.
H83|Social capital at the outburst of the economic crisis in Greece, 2008-2010|Purpose – Social capital and its core components of social trust and associational activity are widely acknowledged as a core feature of strong and active civil societies that promote effective democratic governance and economic prosperity. Within this context the present study sets out to explore two important research questions. The first one relates to the stock of social capital characterizing Greece and its change during a highly sensitive era, that of the outburst of the economic crisis. The second research question relates to analyzing the group of civil servants as carriers of higher or lower levels of social capital compared to the other citizens. Design/methodology/approach – Based on the available knowledge in the field social capital is measured via the measurement of six main constructs comprising the soft and hard attributes of the concept, namely social trust, social altruism, equality, tolerance, humanitarianism and civic participation. Data are drawn from the European Social Value round 4 (2008) and round 5 (2010) surveys for Greece. Findings – Overall, empirical analysis indicates that the country experiences a statistically significant decline in its social capital level while public servants hold higher levels of social capital albeit also declining as for the rest of the country's citizens. Research limitations/implications – Important policy implications arise as a result of these findings related to issues of democratic legitimation and social participation. Originality/value –the research questions analysed here are important as they can help us sketch the country’s profile with regard to the important concept of social capital that is highly associated with civil empowerment, democratization and increased civil participation levels.
H83|Estudio Delphi sobre la cooperativización de los servicios sociales En el territorio histórico de Gipuzkoa<BR>[A Delphi study on the cooperativisation of the social services in the historical territory of Gipuzkoa]|En el presente artículo se muestran los principales resultados obtenidos del estudio Delphi realizado a cargos políticos y técnicos del Departamento de Política Social de la Diputación Foral de Gipuzkoa, sobre la posibilidad de cooperativizar la provisión de los servicios sociales en este territorio histórico.

Una primera desarrolla el marco teórico que sirve de inspiración para el trabajo empírico, donde se apuntan las principales propuestas teóricas que inciden en la dimensión colectiva de la participación ciudadana en la gestión de los servicios públicos. Entre los distintos modelos, se han destacado aquellos que priorizan la participación ciudadana a través de entidades de economía social y solidaria. La segunda parte se dedica al relato de los resultados de la investigación de campo. Para ello, primero se exponen las notas metodológicas que dan cuenta del proceso de preparación del análisis Delphi, para acto seguido sintetizar los principales resultados obtenidos en este estudio. Este trabajo se cierra con un apartado de conclusiones y líneas futuras de trabajo.
H83|Accounting for accounting history: An exploratory study through topic modeling approach|This paper contributes to the growing history of accounting history by analysing the contents of all papers published in Accounting History, one among the leading journals of the field, through a recent and promising analytical technique called Topic Modeling. Based on literature, we know what accounting history is about, but we know less how the accounting history field has evolved. By adopting Topic Modeling, an automated procedure for coding the content of corpus of text based on Bayesian statistic, the paper complements prior assessments of the accounting history literature by providing accurate measures about the relative prevalence of research areas and their evolution over time. The analysis highlights three sets of topics not uncovered by previous categorizations. In particular, the ÔRegulationÕ topic, that refers to international accounting standards and auditing regulation, appears to be overlooked by previous reviews. In terms of dynamics we find that the ÔTechnical core of accountingÕ decreased in importance overtime in favour of more variegated and fragmented foci of research: this finding may substantiate the claimed shift from a conception of accounting as a technical practice to the one of accounting as a social practice, that is the transition from the so called ÔtraditionalÕ to ÔnewÕ accounting history. Moreover, we see a pluralisation in the range of issues that are under the lenses of accounting historians. Finally, our analysis suggests that the way in which accounting history is presented or Ôtalked aboutÕ has not changed much in the last 20 years.
H83|Accounting of pay-as-you-go pension schemes using accrued-to-date liabilities: An example for Switzerland|Due to demographic change, the fiscal sustainability of pension schemes financed on a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) basis is of more interest for policy makers than ever. Unsustainable financing brings along a future burden to pensioners through pension cuts and/or to the working population through increasing contribution rates. With comparable data about the unfunded accrued-to-date pension liabilities of social security pension schemes soon being available due to a recent update of the international System of National Accounts (2008 SNA), we present a simple framework for accounting of paygo pension schemes using these estimates of accrued-to-date liabilities. Additionally we incorporate another definition of liabilities, the current workers' and pensioners' net liabilities (CWL). Applying this accounting framework using both definitions of liabilities to the Swiss pension scheme (AHV), we show that financing of the AHV is unsustainable. In order to restore fiscal sustainability either an increase in the contribution rate to 12 percent or a cut in average pension levels of about 38 percent would be necessary.
H83|The German statutory pension scheme: Balance sheet, cross-sectional internal rates of return and implicit tax rates|We present a framework for accounting of the German statutory pension scheme and estimate a balance sheet for the years 2005 until 2012. Extending and applying the methodology proposed by Settergren and Mikula (2005), we estimate the cross-sectional internal rates of return of the German pension scheme over this period. We are able to show that the cross-sectional internal rate of return is mainly financed by increasing contributions and by changing the liabilities not backed by assets. Additionally, our results reveal that from an expenditure perspective, the major part of the internal rate of return is resulting from changing longevity rather than indexation of pension entitlements. Finally, we prove that from a cross-sectional perspective the implicit tax of a pension scheme can mainly be interpreted as an “implicit wealth tax” on pension wealth and subsequently present empirical estimates for these cross-sectional implicit tax rates.
H83|Corruption, Trade Costs, and Gains from Tariff Liberalization: Evidence from Southern Africa|This paper exploits quasi-experimental variation in tariffs in southern Africa to estimate trade elasticities. Traded quantities respond only weakly to a 30 percent reduction in the average nominal tariff rate. Trade flow data combined with primary data on firm behavior and bribe payments suggest that corruption is a potential explanation for the observed low elasticities. In contexts of pervasive corruption, even small bribes can significantly reduce tariffs, making tariff liberalization schemes less likely to affect the extensive and the intensive margins of firms' import behavior. The tariff liberalization scheme is, however, still associated with improved incentives to accurately report quantities of imported goods, and with a significant reduction in bribe transfers from importers to public officials.
H83|Monitoring Corruptible Politicians|Does monitoring corrupt activities induce a sustained reduction in corruption? Using longitudinal data on audits of municipal governments in Puerto Rico, we show corruption is considerably lower in municipalities with timely audits—before elections. However, these municipalities do not exhibit decreased levels of corruption in subsequent audits, even while mayors in these benefit from higher reelection rates. Our results suggest that audits enable voters to select responsive but corruptible politicians to office. Audit programs must disseminate results when they are most relevant for voters—shortly before an election—and ensure that these programs are sustained, long-term commitments.
H83|Performance Management and Monitoring of Internal Audit for the Public Sector in Romania|Performance management is an on-going process, which has an essential component part, performance measurement, which involves the identification, supervision and communication of performance results, through the relation to a set of performance indicators. Based on the assessment results, corrective measures are established to ensure attainment of targeted results, offering a feedback, essential for the decision grounding enhancement, at all levels: strategic, operational or individual. As concerns performance management in public institutions in Romania, The Code on managerial internal control provides a hierarchy type model, in the framework of which, the head of the public entity, which is on the first level, needs to provide for performance monitoring for each objective and activity, through the intermediary of relevant quantitative and qualitative indicators, including referring to economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. Given the importance of the internal audit in the process of performance management, identifying solutions for continuous improvement of the public internal audit was subject to a study that was based on questioning public sector auditors on how to monitor the performance of public internal audit activity. Considering issues arising, the article proposes a series of directions for improving the monitoring of the performance of public internal audit activity in the public sector.
H83|Internal Management Control Approach By Implementation Of Stages Of The Internal Control Management System In Public Entities|The internal managerial control system of public entity, envisages the realization of three categories of permanent objectives, namely: a) objectives on the effectiveness and efficiency of operations; b) objectives on the reliability of internal and external information; c) objectives relating to compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies. Thus, designing, implementing and further developing a viable system of internal control are possible by developing and updating stages of the implementation process and development of the internal control system management in public entities. It was approached a new aspect of the regulatory framework in internal management control by detailing the duties and responsibilities of the Monitoring Commission's of the public entities to establish and maintain internal management control system stages.
H83|The development of a corporate governance assessment model for the Romanian public sector|Corporate governance is an essential component of business management, and has acquired a particularly important momentum in the private sector, in the context of the economic crisis and financial maneuvers which are questionable in terms of legality. The same imperative need to develop corporate governance is also identified in the public sector, given the large number of stakeholders and their heterogeneity, the need for accountability, efficiency, performance, transparency and sustainability. By using a qualitative research approach, a set of ideas on corporate governance was presented, as published in the specialized literature; also, a model was proposed for the assessment of corporate governance in the Romanian public sector. In the current context, the development of such a model complements the informational valences in the literature regarding the corporate governance, allows the identification of the deficiencies in the governance of Romanian public institutions, and creates the potential for the development and implementation of a governance code dedicated to the public sector.
H83|Accounting policies and practices applicable for the impairment of assets that generate income other than cash flows|Starting with 2005, at an European level, the European Commission alongside the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) promoted the implementation of accrual accounting within the public sector and, by default, the shift from cash accounting to accrual accounting, as well as the development of financial statements based on the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). IPSAS’ starting point were the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The requests of the IPSAS Standard 21 “Impairment of Non-Cash-Generating Assets” were drawn up in accordance with this policy. The differentiated practices that can be applied to the public sector in relation to the private sector have led us to the analysis of the solutions suggested by IPSAS 21 precisely to understand and further study the concepts and mechanisms of the depreciation of assets that generate income other than cash flows. Without neglecting the reality of the Romanian accounting practice within the public sector, we will gradually go through the steps of measuring and recognizing the depreciation losses associated with the assets that generate income other than cash flows, owned by the public entities.
H83|Ipsas Implementation And Perspectives For Epsas Implementation At The European Union Local Government Levels| Nowadays, the implementation of the IPSAS (International Public Sector Accounting Standards) and the perspectives for EPSAS (European Public Sector Accounting Standards) implementation at the European Union level is a severe problem. The implementation of IPSAS could be the earliest step in the EPSAS implementation that is considered beneficial to the particular needs of the European Union. Within the present paper, in order to assess the level of harmonization at the local level, the Herfindahl index was used. For our study, we considered the European Union cities with a population larger than 300,000 inhabitants, using the financial reports published by these municipalities on their websites. The results of the study indicate a high degree of dispersion regarding the items disclosed by the local governments in their financial statements, taking IPSAS 1 and IPSAS 2 as a benchmark. On the other hand, the results reveal the fact that the English municipalities disclose to the greatest extent the items requested by IPSAS 1 and IPSAS 2.
H83|E-Government in Italy: current issues and future perspectives|The paper examines the development of e-Government in Italy and its critical aspects. The main obstacles lie both in citizens lagging behind in their digital skills and the fact that the public sector seems unable to fully exploit the benefits of computerization. ICT use by the public sector is mainly directed at internal processes and less at the provision of services. Moreover, the digitalization process has often overlooked the ï¿½networkingï¿½ capability of public information systems, having effectively been left to the initiative of individual institutions in a framework of weak governance at central level. Digitalization is currently moving towards a top-down approach aiming at solutions extendable over all the public sector. It relies on ï¿½system-wide projectsï¿½, which are on a national scale, have a large impact on the individual entitiesï¿½ applications, and fix standards for interoperability among systems. This process must be accompanied, however, by ï¿½ownershipï¿½ of the implementation by individual entities, which is essential to trigger the management and organizational changes needed to take full advantage of ICT.
H83|Internal controls in the Public Administration: current problems and future challenges|At the beginning of the 1990s, in line with trends in other European countries, the need to increase the efficiency of administrative activity resulted in legislative initiatives to extend some of the management tools developed in the private sector to the Public Administration. Among these instruments, an important role was assigned to internal controls. Over twenty years since their introduction, the functioning of public internal controls still displays several critical aspects. Through a comparative assessment with other European models, this paper highlights the problems affecting the legal framework of Italian public internal controls, such as the lack of a clearly identified internal audit structure; the paper also points out that controls focus almost exclusively on formal rather than substantive aspects. Moreover, the results of past performance appraisal activities show that the principles of ï¿½accountabilityï¿½ and ï¿½transparencyï¿½ are not widely applied within the Public Administration, thus undermining the effectiveness and usefulness of internal controls.
H83|Audit risk and rent extraction: Evidence from a randomized evaluation in Brazil|"We report results from a randomized policy experiment designed to test whether increased audit risk deters rent extraction in local public procurement and service delivery in Brazil. Our estimates suggest that temporarily increasing annual audit risk by about 20 percentage points reduced the proportion of irregular local procurement processes by about 17 percentage points. This reduction was driven entirely by irregularities involving mismanagement or corruption. In contrast, we find no evidence that increased audit risk affected the quality of publicly provided preventive and primary health care services -measured based on user satisfaction surveys- or compliance with national regulations of the conditional cash transfer program ""Bolsa Família""."
H83|Social Media And Online Communication In Public Sector Administration In Romania|Social networks first came to revolutionize communication in the private sector, that will soon become a necessity in the public domain, due to the need for increased information and interaction of citizens. So, in a few years from the occurrence of this phenomenon, we can talk today about a new paradigm of communication. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Youtube, blogs and many other diverse digital channels, represent key tools in public institutions communication with citizens. A strategic approach, well defined, concrete actions and initiating programs using social networks that can greatly enhance the work of public institutions in Romania and beyond. This article aim is to present the status of social networks usage in public administration institutions in Romania, but also the benefits of this new form of online communication for institutions and their citizens.
H83|Accounting in central banks|This paper examines the important but not often discussed issue of accounting in central banks. It highlights the distinguishing factors that make the financial statements of central banks unique relative to those produced by other bodies. We begin by explaining why central banks produce financial statements. We then discuss a variety of specific topics in central bank accounting. In terms of balance sheet items, we discuss banknotes, shareholders’ equity, gold, foreign exchange and financial instruments. Our discussion of the income statement then centres on profit recognition and distribution.
H83|The Need Of Youth Empowerment Through Civic Education|Reality often shows that young people are disconnected from civic and political life, which leads to a noticeable lack of education and participatory involvement. This paper aims to highlight an empirical analysis performed among students in business and economics, in order to reflect the need for education regarding participatory civic and the level of knowledge on the basic concepts of participatory democracy. The study presents results from a questionnaire with 250 respondents. They were asked to evaluate certain statements and express their opinion (agreement or disagreement) on the role of participatory democracy and their involvement in resolving issues in the society. Results showed that the majority of respondents do not know the specific notions of participatory democracy. The main conclusion of this investigation on civic education states that there is a low level of participation or active involvement of young people in the Romanian society. In order to solve this problem, particular attention needs to be paid on adapting and improving the educational offer in terms of the development of civic and ethical skills.
H83|Why Governments Won't Invest|The UK Government is currently exerting a sharp and tightening squeeze on public investment at a time when borrowing for public investment has never, historically, been cheaper with interest rates close to zero in real terms on long term public borrowing. Moreover, financially prudent and disinterested bodies like the IMF are calling for the UK to be more expansive in public investment. In this paper I discuss the Treasury's aversion to public investment, an issue which has persisted for some time, but become all the more pressing since the financial crisis. I argue that policymakers should focus on identifying and investing in high quality, professionally assessed, public projects - something that can be aided by a National Investment (or Infrastructure) Bank which would neatly complement the newly created Infrastructure Commission. But, like the Green Investment Bank, and other institutions before it, it would be allowed only a very modest role unless the institutional obsession with curbing public investment can be overcome.
H83|Prestação de contas no setor público: qual é o alcance da difusão dos resultados da organização?|Resumo O objetivo desta pesquisa é estudar como os Tribunais de Contas brasileiros fazem a prestação de contas dos resultados conseguidos por essas instituições por meio do planejamento estratégico. A metodologia tem como base uma busca documental nos planos estratégicos e nos relatórios de resultados com informação sobre o alcance dos objetivos, indicadores e metas. Também se fez uma comparação destes relatórios com o relatório de resultados do TCU, órgão de controle externo com jurisdição nacional. Encontrou-se que, ainda que um forte discurso de transparência esteja presente aos planos estratégicos das instituições, seja nos valores ou nos objetivos estratégicos, a divulgação de informações ao usuário externo é uma iniciativa executada por poucos tribunais. Em conclusão, este estudo demonstrou que a prestação de contas deve ser fortalecida nestas instituições, um fato já reconhecido pela maioria dos representantes das unidades de planejamento destes tribunais.
H83|Remuneraciones del sector público: ¿mayores que en el sector privado?|This paper analyzes the salaries of regular and fee-based staff of the central government in Chile. It uses an unpublished database obtained through the transparency system that contains information on approximately 214,438 civil servants working in one of those two capacities in 2015, which accounts for more than 90 percent of civil servants active in 2014. Moreover, following literature, the New Income Survey Supplement (NESI) of the National Statistics Bureau (INE) was used to compare the public sector salaries to private sector salaries. After controlling for observable variables, there still is a considerable gap of 32 percent in favor of civil servants.
H83|Research On The Romanian Public Sector Entities’ Accounting System|Public sector represents one of the main branches of the economy because of its importance and particularities: the mechanism of generating, allocating and use of financial resources, the important number of stakeholders, the heterogeneous structure, complexity and heterogeneity of services delivered, asymmetric information, and vulnerability in front of the internal and external economic and politic environment. Thus, accounting system must be developed as to insure a relevant, transparent, pertinent and integrated information flow as well as the interface between public sector entities and stakeholders. The research presented is divided into two components. The first component includes conceptual approaches concerning the accounting system on a national and international level, as well as an analysis of the evolution of the Romanian accounting system for public sector entities. The second component includes a questionnaire-based research which aimed to investigate the opinion of public sector accounting professionals regarding the in force accounting system.
H83|La relation entre les coûts et la qualité des soins : une alliance profitable pour les établissements de santé ? The relationship between costs and quality of care : a profitable alliance for hospitals ?|(VF)Les évolutions contraignantes de l’environnement économique, culturel et réglementaire ont conduit de nombreux pays à réduire la croissance des dépenses des établissements de santé et à améliorer la qualité des soins qu’ils proposent. Ces deux objectifs de recherche de qualité des soins et de maîtrise des coûts sont-ils contradictoires ? Les résultats de cette revue de littérature montrent qu’aucun consensus n’a pu être atteint, que ce soit au niveau des modèles théoriques, ou sur les résultats des études empiriques. L’impact des démarches qualité sur les coûts d’un établissement de santé reste difficile à chiffrer et demeure très dépendant du type de démarches et du contexte de soins dans lequel il est analysé. (VA)In many countries, the legal, cultural and economic factors binding the environments of hospitals have led to both reductions in costs and improvement of quality of care. Are these two objectives (quality of care and cost reductions) contradictory? The findings of our literature review show that no international academic consensus has yet developed. The impact of continuous improvement of quality of care on observed costs of hospitals is difficult to quantify. Moreover, it depends on the type of quality approach implemented and of the care context studied.
H83|Reconciling Chinaâ€™s official statistics on state ownership and control|Chinaâ€™s National Bureau of Statistics releases data for Chinaâ€™s industrial sector, fixed asset investment and real estate investment both according to the enterpriseâ€™s official registration status, and according to whether the controller of the enterprise is the state. For most applications data for â€˜state owned and state-holding companiesâ€™ based on the control concept is appropriate, as this includes coverage of SOEsâ€™ listed- and unlisted-subsidiaries. These data show that less than a third of Chinese industrial output, fixed asset investment, and less than twenty per cent of Chinese real estate investment is carried on by companies that are controlled by the state. A broader definition to cover all state ownership would include enterprises that are not â€˜state controlledâ€™ but nevertheless include state capital or investment from SOEs. This would capture some additional proportion of the limited liability companies, joint-ventures and shareholding corporations that are in mixed ownership.

H83|Pro-social motivation, effort and the call to public service|We investigate the interaction of pro-social motivation and wages in pro-social organizations with a novel subject pool, 1700 students destined for the private and public sectors in Indonesia, using a measure of pro-social motivation that exactly matches the mission of the organization. Three novel conclusions emerge. Consistent with a common, but untested, assumption in the theoretical literature, workers with greater pro-social motivation exert higher real effort. However, high pay attracts less pro-socially motivated individuals. Furthermore, we also test whether a real world pro-social organization (the Indonesian Ministry of Finance) attracts pro-socially motivated workers. We find that prospective entrants into the Indonesian Ministry of Finance exhibit higher levels of pro-social motivation than a comparable sample of general workers.
H83|Creative accounting and electoral motives: Evidence from OECD countries|Using an unbalanced panel of 27 OECD countries over the period 1970–2011, I examine whether electoral motives influenced creative accounting. Governments engage in “below-the-line” operations, such as transactions in financial assets, that do not show up in the deficit figures but give rise to changes in debt. I use the difference between the change in public debt and the deficit (stock-flow adjustment) to measure creative accounting. The results suggest that governments strategically engaged in creative accounting before regular elections so as to sugarcoat the budget balance. I also provide an overview of government interventions that gave rise to large stock-flow adjustments.
H83|A comparison of the wage structure between the public and private sectors in Japan|This study compares the wages in the public and private sectors in Japan. In addition to comparing overall wage levels, we examine the differences in the wage structures, specifically, the relative wages by gender, age, education, and region. The size of the public sector wage premium depends crucially on the size of the private companies chosen as the comparison group. Wage gaps by gender and educational attainment are smaller in the public sector than they are in private companies. The public sector's age–wage profile is steeper than that of the private sector. Public sector wages are more compressed. In other words, the wages are relatively higher at the lower end of the wage distribution and relatively lower at the higher end. The regional wage differentials are smaller in the public sector. Here, the wage levels of public sector workers are relatively higher in rural regions and relatively lower in large metropolitan regions. To ensure the efficient provision of public services, it is inappropriate to compare only mean wages.
H83|Mirror trade statistics between China and Latin America|Purpose - This paper aims to examine the accuracy of the trade statistics between the People’s Republic of China and 20 Latin American countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. Design/methodology/approach - This paper contrasts the mirror trade statistics between China and 20 Latin American countries during 2009-2014, after adding to the Chinese side the trade figures corresponding to Hong Kong and adjusting for some valuation issues. Using the resulting panel data, the paper then explores some of the possible explanatory variables, in the case of Latin America, which can account for the significant trade misinvoicing that is found among most of the countries involved. Findings - Trade misinvoicing, be that from the part of China or of its partners, varies substantially across Latin America. It is quite large in the case of some countries such as Bolivia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama and Paraguay, and, on the opposite side, relatively small in the case of other countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Guatemala and Venezuela. It is found that, from a Latin American perspective, trade misinvoicing is positively related to the countries’ lack of statistical capacity and their degree of financial openness. Originality/value - This is the first empirical paper that examines the mirror trade statistics between China and Latin American.
H83|Principles for independent fiscal institutions and case studies|Independent fiscal institutions serve to promote sound fiscal policy and sustainable public finances. Today IFIs are considered among the most important innovations in the emerging architecture of public financial management. Within the OECD area, their number has more than tripled and is expected to continue to rise. This publication provides a unique set of in depth case studies of IFIs in 18 OECD member countries in light of many of the good practices for effective IFIs identified in the OECD Recommendation on Principles for Independent Fiscal Institutions.

In contexts of pervasive corruption, even small bribes can significantly reduce tariffs, making tariff liberalization schemes less likely to affect the extensive and the intensive margins of firms' import behavior. The tariff liberalization scheme is, however, still associated with improved incentives to accurately report quantities of imported goods, and with a significant reduction in bribe transfers from importers to public officials.
H83|Setting a fox to guard the henhouse? Determinants in elections for presidents of supreme audit institutions: Evidence from the German federal states (1991–2011)|Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide evidence regarding the selection procedures for and characteristics of senior officials in supreme audit institutions (SIAs). Design/methodology/approach - This study follows a quantitative approach using original data collected for presidential elections of SIAs in the 16 federal states in Germany. A fractional logit model is calculated to test different theoretical assumptions in relation to structural, political and individual factors. Findings - The descriptive results confirm the findings of prior research that presidential candidates are elected with very high approval rates. The main determinants are the vote share of the ruling coalition and the executive experience of the presidential candidate. Research limitations/implications - This study focuses on 16 federal states in Germany, but an international comparative perspective covering subnational levels would further augment analysis through the variance of selection procedures and electoral outcomes. Social implications - Independence of auditors is a fundamental issue for the control of the executive, but it seems that there are inevitable trade-offs therein, such as between knowledge of the auditing objects or the politicization of the election process and the independence of the auditor. Originality/value - This study provides novel empirical insights into the election and selection procedures for senior SIA officials at the subnational level, and shows that the executive exerts strong, but functionally reasonable, influence on candidate selection.
H83|The public sector efficiency in Italy: The case of Lombardy municipalities in the provision of the essential public services|This paper evaluates how efficient are the municipalities located in the most populous Italian Region (Lombardy) in providing essential public services: general administration, municipal and administrative police, waste collection, road network and street lighting. The empirical analysis is conducted through bootstrap Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) on a sample of 331 municipalities with more than 5,000 inhabitants, and refers to the three years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The results highlight that there is room for substantial improvement of efficiency: the same level of output can be obtained while reducing the resources of about 33%. A second-stage truncated regression reveals that: the structure of population matters, scale effects do exist, and more financially healthy municipalities are also more efficient in providing essential services
H83|Criminalità e scelte degli amministratori locali in tema di procedure di acquisto|"Il lavoro analizza il nesso esistente tra il ricorso da parte dei Comuni agli strumenti ""centralizzati"" per l’acquisto di beni e servizi e il contesto in cui tali amministrazioni operano. Pur tenendo conto di un’ampia serie di fattori che possono spingere verso un maggiore o minore ricorso alla centrale unica di committenza a livello nazionale (Consip), il lavoro si concentra sul legame tra tale scelta e la presenza di criminalità a livello locale. L’analisi empirica mostra come soltanto in corrispondenza di bassi livelli di criminalità un aumento dei fenomeni delittuosi accresce la frequenza con cui si ricorre a fornitori selezionati da una terza parte, in connessione alla possibilità di limitare i rischi di inefficienza (passive waste). Di contro, in corrispondenza di livelli elevati di criminalità, il nesso si inverte, segnalando una crescente propensione a mantenere una gestione autonoma degli acquisti, che potrebbe essere connessa alla possibilità di estrarre parte delle relative rendite (active waste)."
H83|Equipping Public Servants with Accrual Accounting for Transparency, Accountability and Efficiency – Evidence from Nigeria and Ghana|Objective – This study is based on the social welfare viewpoint of accounting. It examines the benefits of accrual accounting as a replacement for cash accounting as a measure to enhance public service transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the public sectors of Nigeria and Ghana. Methodology/Technique – This study is based on a sample of 375 respondents from the accounting, auditing and budgeting cadres and legislatives of the public sector in Nigeria. In the Ghana perspective, 25 high-ranking public servants in the accounting, auditing and budgeting cadres were interviewed for the study. Three hundred and twenty-six valid responses representing 87% of the samples in Nigeria and the Ghana context were retrieved for analysed via descriptive statistics. Findings – Findings indicate that there is a significant association between accrual accounting and transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the public sectors of Nigeria and Ghana. Novelty – This study has the potential for improving financial reporting in the public sector. It is useful to researchers and academics because its focus on societal accounting is of current interest to accounting professionals and researchers.
H83|Corrupt Bureaucrats: The Response of Non-Elected Officials to Electoral Accountability|Modern state bureaucracies are designed to be insulated from political interference. Successful insulation implies that politicians' electoral incentives do not affect bureaucrats' corruption. I test this prediction by assembling a unique dataset on corruption, promotions and demotions for more than 4 million Indonesian local civil servants. To identify the effect of reelection incentives, I exploit the existence of term limits and a difference-indifference strategy. I find that reelection incentives decrease the corruption behaviour of both top and administrative bureaucrats, which constitutes new evidence of the deep, farreaching effects of politicians' accountability on local civil servants. I explore a mechanism where bureaucrats have career concerns and politicians facing reelection manipulate such concerns by increasing the turnover of top bureaucrats. Consistent with this mechanism, I find that reelection incentives increase demotions of top bureaucrats and promotions of administrative bureaucrats.
H83|Knowing the game: motivation and skills among policy professionals|This paper focuses on “policy professionals”, i.e. people who are employed to affect politics and policy, and analyzes their particular motivations and skills. The paper focuses on the occupational practices of policy professionals: what are their main motivations and driving forces, and what are the key resources they deploy in their work? The main motivation for policy professionals is a desire to wield power and influence the course of affairs, while their working-life satisfaction comes from getting their message into the media without becoming personally exposed. The key resource of policy professionals is context-dependent politically useful knowledge, in three main forms: “Problem formulation” involves highlighting and framing social problems and their possible solutions. “Process expertise” consists of understanding the “where, how and why” of the political and policy-making processes. “Information access” is the skill to be very fast in finding reliable and relevant information. These motivations and skills underpin a particular professionalism based in an “entrepreneurial ethos”, which differs from both the ethos of elected politicians, and that of civil servants, and which has some potentially problematic implications for democratic governance.
H83|"""Most MPs are not all that sharp"""" Political employees and representative democracy"|This paper analyses the orientations of political employees In Sweden. Why do they prefer to pursue politics in this particular form and not as elected politicians? What are their views more broadly about representative democracy, and what do they think about the elected politicians? What do these orientations imply for their role in democratic governance? The paper finds that their roles are diffuse: there is no agreement among political employees about whether they are politicians or not, and their mandate is fleeting and unclear. They hold the(average politician’s intellectual abilities in low regard, and sometimes take on clearly paternalistic views towards elected representatives. They see little attraction in pursuing a career as elected politicians, because of intrusive media scrutiny and since they hold a view of elected politics as slow, boring, and shallow. The professional route to politics is seen as more efficient, fast and fun.
H83|Postulates as the Basis of the Philosophy of State Audit|The article is devoted to the formation of the state audit postulates in view of its nature, goals and objectives. Characterized the current stage of development of the state audit in Ukraine. State audit defined as form of control carried out by specialized body conferred with specific constitutional powers, and aimed to identify the conformabilities of community resources management to the established criteria. Carried out a critical analysis of the classical tenets of the audit in order to determine their truth for the state audit scope. It is proved that the presence of the specifics of the goals and tasks of the state audit does not allow to put the basis for its theory of the existing auditing postulates unchanged. Framed the postulates that reflect the essence of the state audit and may constitute the basis of its philosophy: 1) the subject of state audit has public importance; 2) all information of public importance is the subject of state audit; 3) state audit enhances the transparency of the public administration system. Proposed postulates of state audit should be considered in future research and at the development of normative legal acts in the area of public finance control.
H83|Due Process of the International Accounting Standard Board|The article is devoted to the investigation of the due process of the International Accounting Standards Board to identify the means of influence of the national interested parties on the global publishers of standards, and to build a similar system of accounting regulation in Ukraine. The stages of the due process of the International Accounting Standards Board are revealed in the context of mandatory procedures and the procedures of type 'comply or explain'. It is found that the main instrument of influence of the national interested parties is a comment letters to documents and projects for discussion. It is found that the due process of the IASB observes all the four prerequisites of a 'wise crowd': 1) diversity of opinions; 2) independence; 3) decentralization; 4) aggregation of opinions. The necessity of active participation of national accountants in the creation of global standards by sending comment letters is emphasized. The advantages of the egalitarian approach to the regulation of accounting are substantiated.
H83|Cost Accounting as a Possible Solution for Financial Sustainability of Croatian Public Hospitals|The purpose of this paper is to present the current usage of cost accounting methodology in Croatian public hospitals through conducted empirical research and to provide opinions of accountants and financial officers regarding possible implementation of cost accounting methodology in public hospitals. In the paper, the authors analyze the accounting system in Croatian public hospitals, identifying the flaws of the current accounting system with regard to the recording and allocation of costs. National healthcare systems of different European countries provide a theoretical background for the usage of accrual accounting basis and cost accounting methodologies, showing better governance and financial sustainability of public hospitals which have introduced cost accounting methodology. The conducted empirical research shows that accountants and financial officers believe that the healthcare system in Croatia is ready for a change in the current accounting system based on the modified accrual basis through the implementation of accrual accounting basis and full costing approach to cost allocation. Full costing approach is also known as activity-based accounting method for cost allocation. The authors also recommend some initial steps for implementation of the new cost accounting system in Croatian public hospitals.
H83|Tax penalties in SME tax compliance|Small business tax compliance requires special attention. On the one hand small businesses are often incapable of rigorously fulfilling their tax obligations, more vulnerable to external risks and tempted to exploit opportunities to be non-compliant. On the other hand, unlike larger businesses, they are usually sole proprietors or owner-operated businesses, hence highly responsive to personal, social, cognitive and emotional factors. These attributes pave the way to a better use of measures designed to influence their behavior and choices. This paper discusses the role and effectiveness of tax penalties in enhancing tax compliance in small businesses. It argues that tax penalties, although indispensable for tax enforcement, may not be a first-choice tool in ensuring tax compliance. Too punitive a tax regime is an important barrier to business formalization and increasing severity of tax penalties does not produce the intended results. To be effective, tax penalties should deter and motivate taxpayers rather than exert repressive measures against them.
H83|Political Process Drivers Of Corruption In Eastern Europe|Corruption stands as one of the many obstacles to the political and economic security of the Eastern European region. Thus, despite the political and economic instability in the region, Eastern European countries, in and outside of the European Union need to fight corruption collectively and individually. The task is difficult, but hope is justified because the causes of corruption in this part of the region are similar and anti-corruption expertise is available. We believe that a deeper analysis of corruption’s drivers can produce a better articulated and more efficient anti-corruption strategy. This strategy will create an anti-corruption infrastructure that will strengthen the Eastern European Partnership. As a prelude to the deeper analysis that we believe must be a part of this strategy, this paper identifies the main drivers of corruption in the Eastern European Partnership countries and explains why addressing these drivers will strengthen the Eastern European Partnership.
H83|Factors Which Influenced the Success of the Implementation of the Regulation of the Minister of Home Affairs Number 59 of 2007 in North Sumatera Provincial Government|This study aimed to test empirically and analyze the influence of regulation, commitment, human resources and supporting devices to the successful implementation of the Regulation of the Minister of Home Affairs No.59 Year 2007. Population in this study is SKPD Officer of North Sumatra Province (108 people) which was sampled for 93 people. Simultaneous F test and partial t test were used to studies effects of regulation, commitment, human resources and supporting facilities to the successful implementation of the Regulation of the Minister of Home Affairs No. 59, year 2007. These results prove that the regulation, commitment, human resources and supporting devices simultaneously influenced the successful implementation of the Regulation of the Minister of Home Affairs No. 59 Year 2007. In partial, regulation, commitment and human resources affected successful implementation of the Regulation of the Minister of Home Affairs No. 59 Year 2007, while the supporting facilities did not have an effect. These results showed that 48% variations of successful implementation of the Regulation of the Minister of Home Affairs No.59 Year 2007, depended on variable of regulation, commitment, human resources and supporting facilities and the remaining 52% depended on other uninvestigated variables.
H83|Electricity Consumption Patterns: Comparative Evidence from Pakistan’s Public and Private Sectors|This study examines the behavioral aspect of Pakistan’s energy crisis by comparing electricity consumption in the public and private sectors. Specifically, we compare consumption patterns of electricity across a sample of student hostels at two public sector universities and privately run student hostels. In addition, we collect household data for a sample of students at Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) in Islamabad and compare their average electricity consumption with that of the public sector university hostels. We find that the latter’s average consumption of electricity is significantly higher than among private hostels and households. In assessing the moral hazard problem of the public sector in this context, we test the energy conservation behavior of QAU students and the university administration. The results show that students are largely indifferent to conserving electricity, while the administration pays little attention to the use of energy-efficient lights and equipment.
H83|Good Governance at the Local Level: Meaning and Measurement|This paper situates Canadian local governance practices within a review of international perspectives on the meaning and evaluation of governance quality. The author finds that Canadian authorities have construed local good governance largely in utilitarian terms, as the efficiency of service delivery. He proposes a broader research program on local governance quality in Canada, one that is expressly comparative, pays equal attention to the quality of decision-making and accountability processes, and is directed toward continuous improvement.
H83|Renewal Investment in Water Infrastructure and Sustainability of Municipal Water Service Utility|This paper estimates renewal investment in aging water infrastructure to investigate the fiscal sustainability of water service utilities operated by municipalities in Japan. Specifically, we focus on the water infrastructure in Nishiwaki City, Hyogo Prefecture and estimate the past infrastructure investment and the future renewal costs, and further forecast the future balance of payment in the water utility account. The past infrastructure investment is estimated on the basis of the actual record of water supply facilities such as water pipes developed and the actual construction costs at present, and the amount of future renewal investment is estimated on the assumption that investment would be made after the end of each facility fs service life. The estimated annual amount of renewal investment during the 50 years from FY2017 to FY2065 comes to 0.9 to 1 billion yen per year. It is about three times as large as the annual average of recent infrastructure investment by Nishiwaki City from FY2009 to FY2013, which stands at 334 million yen. The result suggests that the future renewal investment will be a huge fiscal burden on this city. Assuming that earnings from water supply services will decline in the future and the present revenues structure and water service charge will not be changed, the city will run out of its accumulated funds (internal reserve funds) in the water utility account by around FY2020 and will face revenue shortfalls. In order to renew infrastructure as needed while maintaining the present water services, the city must consider countermeasures such as the integration or abolition of facilities, revision of water charges, reform of the management approach, and the possibility of covering a part of expenses by general public expenditure, as soon as possible. It is also necessary to understand that this situation is not a particular problem faced by one local city but it is common to all municipalities throughout the country.
H83|You Are in Charge: Experimentally Testing the Motivating Power of Holding a Judicial Office|Apparently, judges' decisions are not motivated by maximizing profit. Two explanations compete: there are long-term monetary consequences; conscientious individuals self-select into the profession. In a lab experiment, we rule out both explanations. Nonetheless, authorities do a reliable job of overcoming a social dilemma. Calling the authorities public officials or judges strengthens the effect. This suggests that the effect is not driven by anger or sympathy with the victims but follows from the office motive: the desire to fulfill the expectations that come with an assigned task. We test three extensions: When given an opportunity to announce an explicit policy, judges become less sensitive to the objective degree of reproach and more sensitive to their personal social value orientation. If judges are elected or experienced, they react more intensely to norm violations. Experienced judges are more affected by their social value orientation.
H83|The Impact of Ethnic Diversity in Bureaucracies: Evidence from the Nigerian Civil Service|We document the correlation between the workplace diversity in bureaucratic organizations and public service delivery. We do so in the context of Nigeria, where ethnicity is a salient form of self-identity. We thus expand the empirical management literature highlighting beneficial effects of workplace diversity, that has focused on private sector firms operating in high-income settings. Our analysis combines two data sources: (i) a survey to over 4,000 bureaucrats eliciting their ethnic identities; (ii) independent engineering assessments of completion rates for 4,700 public sector projects. The ethnic diversity of bureaucracies matters positively: a one standard deviation increase in the ethnic diversity of bureaucrats corresponds to 9 percent higher completion rates. In line with the management literature from private sector firms in high-income countries, this evidence highlights a potentially positive side of ethnic diversity in public sector organizations, in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa.

H83|Innovative Perspectives On The Accountingof Romanian Public Institutions Of Academic Education|"At national level, the subject of public accounting is more relevant than ever, the legislator showing intense concerns for modernizing the specific rules in order to adapt to the requirements of the actual economy, under the significant impact of globalization as an overall phenomenon. Therefore, our paper presents the accounting of Romanian public institutions in full reformist process, starting to take shape the new vision in the field on the background of the community approach of contouring the European Public Sector Accounting Standards (EPSAS) starting from the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). Moreover, the normative ""revolution"" with impact on public accounting manifested in our country starting with 2014, leads us to anticipate important innovations on financial reporting in public institutions of academic education on the background of the obvious trend of rallying to the community paradigm."
