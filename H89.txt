H89|A Positive Effect of Political Dynasties: the Case of France's 1940 Enabling Act|The literature on political dynasties in democracies usually considers them as a homogenous group and points out their negative effects. By contrast, we argue that they may differ according to their origin and that democratic dynasties â??â?? those whose founder was a defender of democratic ideals â??â?? show stronger support for democracy. This claim is backed by an analysis of the vote by the French parliament on July 10, 1940, of an enabling act granting full power to Marshal Philippe PÃ©tain, thereby ending the Third Republic. Using newly collected data from the biographies of the members of the then parliament, we observe that members of a democratic dynasty were more likely, by a margin of between 7.6 and 9.0 percentage points, to oppose the act than were members of other political dynasties or elected representatives belonging to no political dynasty. We report suggestive evidence showing that the effect of democratic dynasties was possibly driven by internalized democratic norms and beliefs.
H89|Democracy and Governance|The purpose of the paper is to show that the nature of the relationship between governance and democracy varies depending on how the two terms (of a political discourse) are defined, that when the definition of one term encompasses distinctive features of the other we find that governance and democracy are not just mutually reinforcing but even overlapping, that only when we distinguish on theoretical ground governance from democracy we create the basis for analyzing their relationship on empirical grounds exactly as Fukuyama had suggested.

H89|Clustering European Welfare Systems through a Performance Index|We construct a composite performance indicator to assess the relative performance of welfare policies in the EU countries. We show that the variability of performances cannot be explained only by the amount of resources devoted to social policies, but also by the composition of social expenditure: countries with higher shares of redistributive public expenditure obtain better results in the social sector. This result confirms the association between the type of welfare system, according to the traditional four-way classification, and the performance level. However, considering a more complete set of indicators of the structure of the welfare systems, we find that European countries cannot be grouped according to the traditional classification. Considering expenditure-side indicators and financing-side indicators together, three groups form: one comprising the UK and Iceland, one the Nordic countries and the Netherlands, one the continental (and southern) countries and Ireland.
H89|Efficient social policies with higher expenditure: an analysis for European countries|Based on the construction of two indicators to assess the relative effectiveness and efficiency of European welfare policies, we show that the variability of efficiency cannot be explained only by the amount of resources devoted to social policies but also by the institutional environment. The OLS regression shows that institutional variables- such as accountability and honesty of public officials- have high significant effects on the efficiency
H89|L'opus di Mauro Fasiani|Scopo di questo lavoro non è quello di discutere il pensiero scientifico di Fasiani, ma solo di attirare l'attenzione degli studiosi facendo conoscere il contenuto dei suoi apporti scientifici, perché Mauro Fasiani non sembra occupare ancora il posto che merita nell'ambito scientifico. In questo lavoro viene quindi presentato un profilo biografico di Mauro Fasiani, seguito da una breve analisi dei suoi scritti scientifici disposta secondo i principali filoni delle sue ricerche. Segue una bibliografia delle sue opere e la bibliografia degli scritti riguardanti il suo apporto scientifico. Il lavoro si conclude con la presentazione di trentotto schede, ciascuna corrispondente ad un suo saggio; rispetto agli scritti elencati nella bibliografia, mancano le schede corrispondenti a otto scritti, considerati del tutto trascurabili.
H89|“The benefits of PSM: an oasis or a mirage?”|Scholarly interest in Public Service Motivation has yielded a vast amount of research explicating its benefits for public sector organizations; including increased employee job satisfaction, boosted individual performance, higher intention to stay with the organization, enhanced organizational commitment and organizational citizenship behaviour. However, a closer inspection of the literature reveals mixed empirical evidence for each of these impacts of PSM. We perform a meta-analysis on each of these five impacts of PSM in order to explicate the divergence in the results of the extant literature. We find evidence of the existence of a true effect for PSM over negative outcomes, organisational commitment and organisational citizenship. In addition, we also find that contextual variables, legal origin and corruption of the country, along with the measurement related variables, affect each of the five relationships in a unique manner.
H89|Are (More) Economic News Good for the Economy ? Case on Indonesian Sub-nationals|The online media has not only capture news at the national level but also deliver news on specific regions, either the province(s) or local governments. A focus on delivering more local economic news, may also align to trend of decentralization policies, triggered especially after period of post-1998 and the adoption of sub-national election (Morrell, 2005). Previous studies mostly explored of how economic news may affect election outcome (Holbrook, 2004), but not on the effect to related economic outcome. We use news data from four large media online, as follows: Kompas, Okezone, Republika, Sindonews, and Tribunnews, over the year of 2010 up to 2015. The data of economic news category, as it focused on news at the province and local level, are specific news classified in 13 categories. Based on fixed-effect panel regression, our preliminary finding indicates of how economic news may positively affected economic outcome – referring to per capita GRDP (Gross Regional Domestic Product). By category ofecoonomic news, news on investments and on tourism tat have positive effect on province per capita GRDP. Meanwhile, on the effect of political event, we only found a significant effect of province election in the case of election year 2012. For these provinces with election year in 2012, more economic news instead associated with lower province per capita GRDP.
H89|Male pupils taught by female homeroom teachers show higher preference for Corporate Social Responsibility in adulthood|On the demand side, we test how early childhood education creates preferences for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) through teacher-student gender randommatching. Using originally collected individual-level data, we examine how female teachers in elementary school influence students f CSR stated preferences in their adulthood. In a quasi-natural experiment setting, our major findings are: (1) female teachers affect pupils f preferences for corporate responsibility later in life, (2) the effect of a female teacher is robust if she was a class teacher in first grade, (3) the effect of a female teacher is observed only for different-gender pupils but not for same-gender ones. These findings imply that the gender gap in adulthood is reduced by matching female teachers with male students in earlier years. We examine and support the female socialization hypothesis.
H89|Demographic Change and Political Polarization in the United States|I construct an index of political polarization using seven previously proposed measures. I estimate the relative propensity for polarization across demographic groups in a regression framework and examine the extent to which demographic change can explain recent trends in polarization. Assuming fixed propensities for polarization, I estimate that 25 to 59 percent of the change in polarization between 1984 and 2016 can be attributed to demographic change in the United States.
H89|Measuring Party System Change: A Systems Perspective|The term â€˜party systemâ€™, explained Giovanni Sartori, refers to the pattern of interactions among major parties. That pattern can be represented as a type and treated as a proper unit of analysis. When â€˜party systemâ€™ is defined in this way, it becomes clear that the scholarship lacks a direct measure of â€˜party system changeâ€™. The Sartori approach to party system change is not the only legitimate way to understand this concept, but it does target an undoubtedly important feature of political systemsâ€”namely, the stability of major-party interactions. This article develops a new indicator, the index of fluidity, which measures the extent of such stability. Applying the index to Africa, we show there is significant cross-national variation in fluidity and weak correlation between fluidity and (Pedersen) volatility.
H89|Party System Change and the Quality of Democracy in East Africa|The purpose of this paper is to explore in greater detail the nexus between party system change and democratic qualities. In doing so, we do not simply assess whether, how and to what extent qualities of democracy in East Africa are affected by the instability of the patterns of inter-party competition (fluidity of the party system), but we also plan to show how the sub-components of party system fluidity (frequency of change, scope of change, variety of change) influence the democratic qualities. By disaggregating fluidity in its constitutive elements and by testing how each of them affects the qualities of democracy, we find that while the frequency of change has a beneficial impact on the qualities of democracy, the other sub-components of fluidityâ€”namely, the â€œscopeâ€ and â€œvarietyâ€ of system changeâ€”have a consistently negative effect on democratic quality.

H89|Logic Models: Strengths and Weaknesses in the Context of Programmes Funded by the European Union|The main objective of the study is to provide opportunities for improvement of the logical model used in the European Union (EU) programming. The study provides an overview of the varieties of logical models, which starts with basic logic models, gradually increasing their complexity. The analysis identifies strengths and weaknesses of the models as well as their application by the European Commission (EC). In view of the identified deficiencies, the study proposes a new model that takes into account the bidirectional links between the elements of the logic model and the possible impact of external factors on each element of the model. The proposed model also includes additional elements that take into account the need for application of the outputs/results; the general objectives of a program, and best practices. Even the partial implementation of the proposed model in this study, allows the identification of weaknesses in the EU programming. In this case, they consist of: too general objectives; weak link between indicators and targets; disregard of prior experience (best practices) and lack of consideration of the general objectives.
H89|Контрактация и квазирынок как форма взаимодействия государства и медиа в российских регионах. Contracting and quasi-market as a form of interrelations between state and media in russian regions|Масс-медиа являются не только отраслью народного хозяйства, но и социальным институтом. Однако коммерческая логика медиакомпаний, стремящихся к максимизации прибыли и рейтингов, приводит к «недораспространению» общественно значимой информации. В данной статье изучается, как общественная функция медиа реализуется через контрактные отношения между государством и масс-медиа в российских регионах. Участие в контрактации коммерческих медиакомпаний позволяет говорить о существовании квазирынка, когда выполнение функций общественного сектора осуществляется через рыночные механизмы. На примере информационных контрактов (N = 5 209), заключенных между государственными заказчиками и медиакомпаниями в 2011–2014 гг. в 12 субъектах РФ, методами статистического и сетевого анализа изучается специфика такого квазирынка. В отличие от «классических» моделей квазирынков, описанных в литературе, российские региональные медиарынки обнаруживают ряд особенностей, среди них: неспособность конечного потребителя (аудитории) влиять на распределение контрактов между масс-медиа, проблематичность оценки эффективности выполнения контрактов, распределение контрактов в зависимости от лояльных отношений с госзаказчиком, региональное неравенство и трансформация роли журналиста в обществе. Mass media are not only sector of the economy but also important social institute. However, commercial logic of media companies leads to «under representation» of socially significant topics. Contractual relationship between state and regional media are investigated in this article. Research sample includes informational contracts (N = 5209), signed between state clients and media companies in 2011–2014 in 12 Russian regions. Involvement of commercial media into such contracting relations let us suggest the existence of quasi-market. Within this quasi-market functions of public sector are performed by market mechanism. However, in comparison to «traditional» models of quasi-markets, described in the literature, some peculiarities were revealed in Russian regional media markets. Among them: end users’ failure to influence on the distribution of the contracts between mass media; difficulties to assess effectivity of contracts’ performance; distribution of contracts depending on the loyal relations with state clients; regional inequalities and transformation of the journalists’ role in the society.
H89|Media Coverage, Public Perceptions, and Consumer Behavior: Insights from New Food Technologies|The media often play the role of translating new science to consumers. We discuss the recent literature that has examined the supply and demand factors that affect media coverage of new food technologies and the impact on public perceptions and consumer behavior toward food that utilizes these technologies. We start with a discussion of the ways in which the media influence public perceptions and consumer behavior related to foods made with new technologies. We then discuss the incentives of news media and the potential sources of biases in their reporting. We review empirical studies that have examined media reporting of new agricultural and food technologies, especially biotechnology, in terms of both their agenda setting and framing effects and the social amplification of risk. We synthesize the findings of studies that have examined the influence of media coverage on public attitudes and consumer behavior. We conclude and discuss avenues for future research.
H89|Rational Skeptics: On the Strategic Communication of Scientific Data|I show that a credibility gap is created between the scientist and the government if the preference of the scientist is not perfectly aligned with that of the government. I find a remarkable result that the credibility gap is eliminated and the ex-ante social welfare is maximized if and only if the scientist’s preference is perfectly aligned with that of the government, not with that of the median voter. This is endogenously achieved when the government is allowed to appoint its optimal scientist without election concerns. In the case where the government has election concerns, if the median voter perceives an alarming message from the climate scientist, then even a “right-wing” government must choose an aggressive climate change policy to avoid losing the election. Accordingly, it will prefer to appoint a climate scientist who is unlikely to send an alarming message. Thus the government deliberately creates a credibility gap which may cause a distorted climate change policy in a democracy. Key Words: Climate Change; Cheap-Talk; Elections; SocialWelfare.
H89|The Preservation of Historic Districts - Is it Worth it?|I investigate the welfare effect of conservation areas that preserve historic districts by regulating development. Such regulation may improve quality of life but does so by reducing housing productivity - the efficiency with which inputs (land and non-land) are converted into housing services. Using a unique panel dataset for English cities and an instrumental variable approach, I find that cities with more conservation areas have higher house prices for given land values and building costs (lower housing productivity) and higher house prices for given wages (higher quality of life). The overall welfare impact is found to be negative.
H89|Mind What Your Voters Read: Media Exposure and International Economic Policy Making|e investigate the role of constituents’ preferences in shaping the voting behavior of elected representatives on immigration and trade policy. Using a novel dataset spanning the period 1986-2004, in which we match individual opinion surveys with congressmen roll call votes, we find that greater exposure to media coverage tends to increase a politician’s accountability when it comes to migration policy making, while we find no effect for trade policy. Our results thus suggest that more information on the behavior of elected officials affects decisions only when the policy issue is perceived to be salient by the electorate.
H89|The effect of news on the radicalization of public opinion towards immigration|This paper analyses the effects of newspaper coverage and the tone of news on immigration on the attitude of natives towards immigration in 19 countries (World Values Survey Database) for the period 2005-2009. The results can be summarised as follows: coverage and the negative tone of news have a significant effect in reducing the attitudes towards immigration for people with high trust in the media; for those with low trust in the media, news on immigration has no significant effects. In the latter case coverage and the negative tone of news radicalizes individuals’ prior preferences and prejudices on immigration, where the latter are proxied by individual political orientations.
H89|Raw-material-intensive Economy and Development of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan’s economy is growing in unstable dynamics and is still oriented on the mining industry. The purpose of the study is to determine the structure of the economy and to present an overview of the development and current status of small and medium-sized enterprises in Kazakhstan. Research was composed to measure variation in the economic development in Kazakhstan required in times of increasing global competition.
H89|Tax Stories from South Anatolia|In this research, the data obtained from the oral history interviews with both sides â€“ tax payer peasants and tax collectors â€“ are used to interpret how tax relations work and how this process is perceived by the tax payer. Based on the idea that nicknames might offer a more realistic framework in this sense, the nicknames given to tax collectors, such as RÄ±za of the Cliff (UÃ§urumlu RÄ±za), Mustafa the Angel (Melek Mustafa), the Slender Tyrant (Ä°nce ZalÄ±m), and the Black/Yellow Hell (Kara/SarÄ± Cehennem), are believed to be a representative of the relationship between both parties. Never published before in another medium, the story of SÃ¼leyman, the Butcher (Kasap SÃ¼leyman) is also hereby introduced into field literature.
H89|Prospects For The Development Of Prosumer Energy In Poland|Renewable energy will play a key role in the transition towards a competitive, secure and sustainable energy system. In 2014 the European Commission proposed an objective to increase the share of renewable energy to at least 27% of the EU's energy consumption by 2030. The European Council endorsed this target which is binding at EU level. The Renewable Energy Directive (Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC) was implemented in Poland on 20 February 2015 by the new renewable energy sources act. The objective of this article is to analyse the current state of the Polish energy sector related to the prosumer energy industry. It also describes the future potential for the development of prosumer energy in Poland. The analysis was conducted in the light of the new EU climate and energy initiatives. At the beginning, the article presents the current general state in the EU’s energy sector. European Union Climate and Energy Package targets up to 2050 and the state of renewable energy use gives the background to conduct an analysis of prospects for the development of prosumer energy in Poland. That is why the last part is devoted to the prosumer energy sector in Poland in the context of European Union regulations. The critical analysis of the current situation in that sector has made it possible to evaluate prospects for the development of prosumer energy in Poland in the context of the recently introduced legal regulations.
H89|Corruption Via Media Capture: The Effect of Competition|In this article, we compare a government's optimal choice of whether to engage in corruption by capturing the media outlets through bribery in two alternative media market structures: monopoly versus duopoly. While there is an extra bribe claimant in a media duopoly relative to monopoly, it may also be harder for each firm to individually expose corruption when the rival co-opts with the government. We find that when the latter effect is stronger than the former, media is captured at lower bribes under duopoly relative to monopoly and in such instances media competition facilitates rather than hindering corruption.
H89|Voting and Popularity|For about 45 years, vote and popularity functions have been estimated for many countries indicating that voting intentions as well as actual votes are influenced by economic development. The economy is, of course, not the only and probably not always the most important factor, but there is no doubt anymore that it is an important factor. The most relevant variables are still unemployment, and/or real growth, and inflation. The estimated coefficients vary considerably between countries and time periods. In papers, retrospective sociotropic voting dominates. However, the evidence is not so univocal; it rather tells that voting has egotropic as well as sociotropic aspects, and it is prospective as well as retrospective. It is still open what roles self-interest and altruism play in voting.
H89|Non-monotonic Selection Issues in Electoral Regression Discontinuity Designs|The Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) has become a popular method for program evaluation in recent years. While it is compelling in its simplicity and requires little in terms of a priori assumptions, it is vulnerable to bias introduced by self-selection into treatment or control group. The purpose of this article is to discuss the issue of non-monotonic self-selection, by which similar numbers of individuals select into and out of treatment simultaneously. This kind of selection has not been discussed in detail so far in the literature, and can be hard to detect with the commonly used methods for data-driven RDD specification testing. The focus of this article lies on selection in the context of close elections, since those are popular natural experiments for RDD applications, and because in this context the issue of non-monotonic selection is rarely considered in practise. I will present a slightly modified approach to specification testing, designed to detect non-monotonic self selection and based on the density test by McCrary (2008). In order to demonstrate how RDDs can be affected by the issue, two existing RDD applications are analysed with respect to non-monotonic sorting. In the first, this article follows up and expands on the remarks made by Caughey & Sekhon (2011) about selection issues in the well known RDD application by D. Lee (2008). The second application is based on the Mexican mayoral election RDD by Dell (2015).
H89|Don't Tax Me? Determinants of Individual Attitudes Toward Progressive Taxation|" type=""main"" xml:id=""geer12050-abs-0001""> This contribution empirically analyzes the individual determinants of tax rate preferences. For that purpose, we use representative survey data from the German General Social Survey, which offers information on attitudes toward progressive, proportional and regressive taxation. On the basis of theoretical considerations, we explore the factors which, beyond an individual's financial interest, should drive preferences for progressive taxation. Our empirical results confirm that the narrow redistributive self-interest does not offer the sole explanation of the heterogeneity in individual attitudes. Rather, we show that the choice of the favored tax rate is also driven by fairness considerations and beliefs on the role of effort for economic success."
H89|Collective beliefs and horizontal interactions between groups: the case of political parties|Groups matter in our ordinary folk psychology because a part of our social interactions is done with collective entities. In our everyday life, we indeed sometimes ascribe mental states to social groups as a whole or to individuals as members of groups in order to understand and predict their behavior. The aim of this paper is to explore this aspect of social interactions by focusing on the concept of ‘collective belief’ in a non-summative sense and, more precisely, on collective belief of a specific kind of group: the political party. How can the concept of ‘collective belief’ help to understand the interactions which involve these kinds of collective entities? After providing an epistemic description of political parties, this paper focuses on the collective belief in a non-summative sense. As Gilbert says, a group believes that p, if its members are jointly committed to believe that p as a body. It is argued, with the help of an example from the political history of France, that this view can enable us to understand the interaction between political parties. More precisely, it can help clarify the way in which a political party use the rational constraints on the party as a whole and/or the social and epistemic constraints on the behavior of the group's members in order to destabilize or weaken other political parties.
H89|Exposure to television and individual beliefs: Evidence from a natural experiment|Does the information provided by mass media have the power to persistently affect individual beliefs about the drivers of success in life? To answer this question empirically, this contribution exploits a natural experiment on the reception of West German television in the former German Democratic Republic. After identifying the impact of Western television on individual beliefs and attitudes in the late 1980s, longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel is used to test the persistence of the television effect on individual beliefs during the 1990s. The empirical findings indicate that Western television exposure has made East Germans more inclined to believe that effort rather than luck determines success in life. Furthermore, this effect still persists several years after the German reunification.
H89|Exposing politicians’ ties to criminal organizations: the effects of local government dissolutions on electoral outcomes in southern Italian municipalities|Since 1991, the Italian national government can dissolve municipal councils when infiltration by organized crime is suspected (Law 164/1991). We exploit variation over time and space in the application of this law to study voters’ responses to politicians’ publicly exposed ties to criminal organizations. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that public exposure of ties to organized crime significantly depresses turnout in local elections, and negatively impacts the electoral performance of incumbents and purely local political parties. The breach in the local political principal-agent relationship also translates into citizens’ reduced willingness to contribute to the financing of local public goods.
H89|Towards Putting a Price on the Risk of Bank Failure|This paper develops a new approach for conceptualizing and measuring the risk associated with bank failure. The price of this risk in risk-adjusted present-value terms is estimated at $170-340 million per annum (0.07-0.15% of GDP), representing the price of the financial risk that exists ex-ante (ie, before a bank fails). This can be interpreted as the cost that is either passed onto the banks via higher funding costs, or borne as an implicit risk on the government’s balance sheet. Alternatively, one could think of this as a one-off cost, in the event that all major banks failed in a single crisis. If that were to happen, and if net losses were to be 5-10 per cent of bank liabilities the total cost could be $16-31 billion (7-13% of GDP). This can be interpreted as either the net cost of a government bail-out, or the total value of haircuts on wholesale and retail creditors that would be applied under an Open Bank Resolution (OBR) or a liquidation. Bank bail-outs are not necessarily required or recommended in New Zealand given the existence of OBR. However, the major banks currently receive a one-notch uplift in their credit ratings specifically because of the expectation of government support. These ratings' uplifts are used to estimate the market-implied likelihood that the banks would be bailed out in the event of their failure, and therefore the size of the implicit guarantee banks that are seen to receive. This perceived implicit guarantee is estimated to be worth around $80-$230million per annum (0.04%-0.11% of GDP), equivalent to a 3-8 basis points subsidy on banks' total borrowing costs. This estimate is low by international standards, consistent with the current soundness of the major domestic banks and the relatively low perceived likelihood of government support.

H89|Empirical Investigation On The Corporate Financing For Sport Development In E.U|Assuming the increasing part that sport economics plays nowadays in research and pragmatic fields, the main objective of the present study is to investigate on the companies’ role for supporting sport development through sponsorships and donations, as one main component of the private financing for sport. The fundamental premise that stays behind this research is the potential of sport for inducing competitive advantages for the companies that assign corporate resources for this social domain. The research was conducted for the EU member countries by using secondary data freely available in official documents and databases. The comparative analysis highlighted the factors that generate significant differences between the investigated countries. The results showed that, although corporate financing for sport purposes is well-developed only in few EU countries, its part is constantly increasing as companies in different economic, social and cultural contexts are becoming aware of the strategic potential of sport on medium and long terms. The findings are presented in detail at country level.
H89|A demand for encompassment: A Hayekian experimental parable about political psychology|Emile Durkheim said that when all of the members of a tribe or clan come together, they can sanctify the sacred and experience a spiritual â€œeffervescence.â€ Friedrich Hayek suggested that certain genes and instincts still dispose us toward the ethos and mentality of the hunter-gatherer band and that modern forms of political collectivism have, in part, been atavistic reassertions of such tendencies. Picking up on Hayek, Daniel Klein has suggested a combination of yearnings: (1) a yearning for coordinated sentiment (like Smithian sympathy) and (2) a yearning that the sentiment encompasses â€œ the people ,â€ that is, some focal and seemingly definitive set of â€œwe.â€ This article reports on an experiment designed to explore the demand for encompassment by having subjects sing together. In each trial, one person in the room was designated not to sing unless every one of the others in the room had made a payment sufficient so as to have that person sing . Our evidence of a demand for encompassment is threefold: Subjects chose to sacrifice money to achieve encompassment 47.4% of the time, with 59.6% of the subjects doing so in at least one trial. An exit questionnaire showed that subjectsâ€™ chief reason for making such a sacrifice was a belief that the singing would be more enjoyable if it encompassed the whole group. Furthermore, the subjects reported significantly higher enjoyment when they had experienced encompassment. We are well aware of the significant differences between the situation of the experiment and the situation of actual political life. We nonetheless discuss the experiment as a parable for a penchant toward political collectivism, a parable that helps to clarify the role of encompassment in the sentimental facets of Hayekâ€™s ideas about the psychology of political collectivism.
H89|Analytical hierarchy as tool for decision making in public management|In Venezuela decision making in public management has become difficult, product of the social and political polarization, which has generated the absence of decisions or controversial and non consensual decisions. The purpose of this analysis is to contextualize the use of the analytical hierarchy on public management for decision making in complex and subjective environments; the methodological approach is descriptive type, a non experimental design transectional, sampling is directed non probability and data collection technique is secondary. The result includes the use of the analytic hierarchy to generate decisions evaluating subjective criteria in an objective procedure that favors consensus in decision making.
H89|Unintended consequences of enforcement in illicit markets|Legal enforcement of bans on goods can reduce the size of the black market but lead to greater violence by increasing revenue in the illicit market. However, the link between enforcement and violence is not as simple as is suggested by the textbook model, even for a competitive market. Nevertheless, under plausible assumptions more enforcement on trafficking in the illicit good leads to more violence.
H89|Preferences for government interventions in the economy: Does gender matter?|The extant economics literature finds relevant differences in preferences between men and women, with the former more supportive to competition than the latter. Using survey data for twelve Western European countries this paper shows that, when asked about their preferences for the government intervention in the economy, the two genders express significantly different preferences. While women would increase regulation and social responsibility of the government, they are not opponents of competition. Nevertheless, as the number of women in leading positions in politics and business grows, the world could become more regulated and more social-oriented. The analysis also shows that the gender-related differences depend on country-specific socio-economic factors.
H89|Centralized institutions and cascades|Why do sudden and massive social, economic, and political changes occur when and where they do? Are there institutional preconditions that encourage such changes when present and discourage such changes when absent? I employ a general model which suggests that cascades which induce massive equilibrium changes are more likely to occur in regimes with centralized coercive power, defined as the ability to impose more than one type of sanction (economic, legal, political, social, or religious). Centralized authorities are better able to suppress subversive actions when external shocks are small, as citizens have little incentive to incur numerous types of sanctions. However, citizens are also more likely to lie about their internal preferences in such regimes (e.g., falsely declare loyalty to an oppressive government), entailing that larger shocks are more likely to trigger a cascade to a vastly different equilibrium. The model is applied to the severity of protests that followed austerity measures taken in developing nations since the 1970s.
H89|Linguistic justice in IP policies: evaluating the fairness of the language regime of the European Patent Office|Alternative intellectual property laws relating to the use of languages in IP organisations can result in an asymmetric distribution of costs of patenting between innovators. We present a framework for the characterisation and evaluation of the fairness of the language regime of the European Patent Office (EPO), which is currently based on three official languages: English, French and German. We estimate that the costs of access to patenting procedures borne by English-, French- or German-speaking applicants are at least 30 % lower than those borne by European applicants whose first language is not one of the current official languages of the EPO. In order to correct language-related cost asymmetries, we explore two possible alternative language regimes. In both cases, we introduce a centralised system of financial compensation that covers translation costs borne by European applicants whose first language is not one of the official languages of the EPO. In the first alternative, financial compensation is covered by savings on current translation costs at the granting stage. In the second alternative, the number of official languages is increased to five and financial compensation is funded by an increase in filing fee and by partial savings on translation costs at the granting stage. We show that both alternatives could substantially reduce language-related costs asymmetries among European applicants. In addition, we show that the five-language alternative would reduce the global costs of access to patenting procedures borne by all European applicants. Thus, more multilingualism can be cheaper than less multilingualism, provided that “implicit costs” are taken into account. We conclude discussing under which conditions the alternative language regimes proposed could have a positive impact on the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of the EPO language regime.

H89|Boldog-boldogtalan - a közpolitika szerepe<BR>[Happiness and unhappiness. The role of public policies]|A szubjektív jóllét, a boldogság számtalan egyéni és társadalmi haszonnal jár: oksági kapcsolatban áll az egészséggel, a közösségorientált viselkedéssel, a termelékenységgel és a kreativitással. Egyre több vizsgálat bizonyítja a mutatók érvényességét és megbízhatóságát, s mindinkább használják őket nemzetközi intézmények és nemzeti kormányok. Ez azonban még nem jelenti a boldogság maximalizálására való törekvést. A tanulmány szerzője saját számításai alapján amellett érvel, hogy a kormányzatnak érdemes törekednie az elkerülhető boldogtalanság felszámolására, hiszen ezt hatékonyan teheti meg, és komoly etikai érvek is szólnak mellette.

H89|Greening Household Behaviour: Cross-domain Comparisons in Environmental Attitudes and Behaviours Using Spatial Effects|Discussions of the importance of public attitudes in shaping policy often lack clear evidence on causal relations between stated attitudes and observed behaviours. The 2011 OECD Survey of over 12,000 households allows analysing households’ environmental attitudes and behaviours in five different domains (electricity, food, transport, waste and water). Using econometric analysis, we investigate the relationship between stated environmental attitudes and indicators of civic engagement, such as voting in local elections, charity membership and membership in environmental organisations... La réflexion sur le rôle des attitudes du public dans l’élaboration des politiques manque souvent d’éléments probants au sujet du lien de causalité existant entre les attitudes déclarées et les comportements observés. L’enquête réalisée par l’OCDE en 2011 auprès de plus de 12 000 ménages permet d’analyser leurs attitudes et comportements environnementaux dans cinq domaines distincts (électricité, alimentation, transports, déchets et eau). Sur la base d’une analyse économétrique, on étudie ce qui lie les attitudes environnementales déclarées à différentes formes d’engagement civique, telles que voter aux élections locales, s’impliquer au sein d’une oeuvre caritative et être membre d’une association de défense de l’environnement.
H89|Quantitative Evaluation of Prevention Strategies in Public Health|Various schemes of prevention measures in public health are developed and analyzed on the basis of a general mathematical model. Features related to cost issues, including primary and secondary prevention interventions, differential survival experiences and communicable diseases are in turn used to show the potentialities of the theoretical framework. A numerical application is presented with reference to Italian cancer data.
H89|An Evaluation of the Transparency in the Inspection Practices of the Turkish Government Auditing Units over General Budget Institutions|The purpose of this study is to evaluate the transparency problem of public auditing for general budget institutions in Turkey. In this study, transparency in the auditing operations of 47 general budget institutions was studied by searching the institutions’ web sites. Upon examination, it is seen that the general practice in these public organizations is to keep the audit reports and activity reports of the audit committees keep away from public access. Only exceptions to this general tendency are the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre. These institutions open some of their audit reports and unit operation reports to the public. In regard to internal audit units, public organizations follow even more strict closeness. They do not share directly with the public the unit activity reports and audit reports but send them as a legal obligation to the Internal Audit Coordination Board. The public institutions which have been subject to external auditing also do not share the external auditing results. The internal inspection units of institutions send their reports to Internal Audit Coordination Board as a legal obligation. However, Turkish Court of Accounts has begun to publish its audit reports since December 2013. The results of the study point out that transparent auditing system could have not been constructed for fiscal management up to now. Turkish public auditing system need to be redesigned by legal modifications and institutional adjustments and it is suggested that new structure should include the boards of inspection. In order to improve the transparency and accountability of the administration and the auditing system, a convenient legal environment need to created. In addition to all these, it is remembered that fairness and transparency in auditing and its implementation in an efficient way require compatible changes in administrative and institutional mentality.
H89|Extending the 'voting with the feet' proposition: The impact of local economic development actions on immigration across Mexican municipalities|Since the early 1990s, experts across the economic development world have increasingly supported a sub-national response to the development challenges and opportunities stemming from economic globalisation and financial crisis. Recently, a notable number of studies stress the favourable impact of bottom-up development policies on population well-being in comparison to limited achievements of national government interventions. In this context, this study analyses quantitatively the effect of the fundamental features and policy actions of the bottom-up or local economic development approach (LED) on population mobility among the lowest level of government jurisdictions in Mexico. The relevance of this research lies on the fact that ?voting with the feet? (Tiebout, 1956) takes other dimension if the bottom-up approach to economic and social development is taken into account. This is because individuals can choose to move to a particular jurisdiction not only by considering its bundle of taxes and public services but also on the basis of development prospects that best satisfy their needs and aspirations.This paper finds significant evidence of a positive impact of LED elements on immigration across Mexican municipalities during the period between 1990 and 2005. In other words, in the Mexican context, the evidence provided in this analysis shows that the migration implications of Tiebout?s proposition work when its scope is extended to include LED fundamental elements as an indication of a more active role of the lowest sub-national level of government in economic and social development.
H89|E-government: the youngest brother|Information technology has become a very important issue in citizens' relations. It started with e-commerce followed by e-business and ended by e-government. Firms and consumers use internet to provide information and perform many of their business actions. During the last years Governments also started to communicate with citizens through internet providing information and some services. After e-commerce and e-business now it is the Public sector that should face new technologies through e-government. In Spain in order to achieve the optimal technological level, municipalities and Autonomous Communities (AC), have used financial aid from the Spanish Central Government and European Union institutions. This paper examines the evolution of e-government implementation during the last decade (2001-2011) in the Spanish AC. It also assesses its effectiveness exploring three different institutional factors, namely economic aid, type and size of government. The study concludes that e-government has been adopted by all AC but it is still at an early stage. Nevertheless we can also see from the results that institutional economic aid does not necessarily foster the development of e-government implementation. Therefore we suggest that when giving financial aid to promote specific economic aspects in an economy, Institutions should carefully look at efficiency rather than concentrating exclusively on income per capita or gross domestic product, as they tend to do.
H89|Hydrology and Economics in Water Management Policy under Increasing uncertainty| Well-designed public policy stimulates social progress. However, when governments translate political vision into programmes to deliver desirable social change, the complexity of issues can overwhelm the policy-making process, creating disappointment for all parties and suboptimal outcomes. In this paper we examine why well-known approaches to evidence-based policy-making often fail to provide policy-makers with credible, consistent and clear outcomes in line with broad social interest. We use the Murray-Darling Basin to highlight key stages to formulating effective natural resource policy, and identify key sources of difficulties that need to be managed to maximize scientific contributions. We argue that the need for public policy primarily arises from a lack of perfect knowledge, which causes individuals and agencies to behave in ways that counter social interest. We hypothesize that effective public policy formulation involves: determining what evidence is available, relevant and useful; as well as identifying critical gaps to making public policy necessary and meaningful. We then examine how effective public policy decisions can still be made and how information asymmetry can be managed via strong evidence, expert analysis to verify that evidence, and an understanding of knowledge gaps such that critical interventions can be agreed upon and objectives achieved in view of how they will be managed and resourced. We draw attention to the opportunities available and challenges that exist for hydrologists, economists and other social scientists to work together in assisting the policy process, and in particular to minimize the burden of information constraints in making effective water resource policy.
H89|Next Generation Spectrum Regulation:Price-Guided Radio Policy|This article explains how market signals in the form of pricing information can be introduced into spectrum management in order to optimally guide not only assignment, but also determinations concerning type of use, emissions characteristics and exclusivity. It presents a mathematical model to illuminate how one possible implementation of such price-guided policy might function to make these determinations. As compared to conventional spectrum auctions, price-guided mechanisms for determining allocation and policy would arrive at an assignment of spectrum rights to the highest value users as well as ensure that the contours of those rights were the most efficient possible. In the mathematical model, participants in a hypothetical auction are free to express their demand for spectrum licences which are different on several dimensions such as permissible power output and bandwidth. The most actionable initial implementations of this new approach include determinations of maximum power limits, bandwidth, duration of rights and channelisation. Other early potential implementations include boundary interference standards and possibly congestion-based protocols. Price-guided policy holds substantial promise because it encourages allocative efficiency of spectrum due to the fact that bidders can acquire exactly the set of spectrum rights they need. Further, price-guided policy mitigates the allocation errors inherent in administrative determinations.
H89|The Globalization Of The World Economy And Its Impact On The Development Of Accounting Reports In Ukraine|The article explains the impact of the globalization processes in Ukraine's economy on the development of accounting reports systems.

There are submitted proposals regarding accounting reports regulation in Ukraine in terms of economic globalization.
H89|What should every Young Farmer know about Agro lending?|Viable agricultural and rural development is almost impossible without additional finances. Agro lending allows additional capital accumulation necessary for agricultural households to increase its productivity, thus income. Unfortunately, financial institutions perceive agriculture as highly risky to be financed. In fact there are seven major risks immanent for agriculture: production, market, legal, human, technical, financial and political risks. Anyway, young farmers should not be frightened to apply for a loan. In contrary, financial institutions are far less reluctant to borrow to younger than senior farmers because of their courage, entrepreneurship and ability to understand modern agriculture and finance.

The final objective of such project is to allow entrepreneurs and investors to build in the city new ventures that can create employment, build an entrepreneurship culture, and develop local talent. It also focus on networking as the foundation to gain efficiency and economies of scale that can turn local and small SME´s into a large cooperation that, with the managerial and strategic help of the agency, can produce results in external markets.
H89|Political Institutions and Street Protests in Latin America|In this article, the authors argue that where institutions are strong, actors are more likely to participate in the political process through institutionalized arenas, while where they are weak, protests and other unconventional means of participation become more appealing. The authors explore this relationship empirically by combining country-level measures of institutional strength with individual-level information on protest participation in seventeen Latin American countries. The authors find evidence that weaker political institutions are associated with a higher propensity to use alternative means for expressing preferences, that is, to protest.
H89|Zur Politischen Ökonomie der wirtschaftspolitischen Beratung|After providing some examples of contradictory economic policy advice, we characterise different conceptions of policy advice. This is possible because, in many situations, neither economic theory nor empirical analyses provide unambiguous answers to policy questions. Thus, contradictory advice by different economists is often possible without violating scientific standards. Thus, in the process of seeking policy advice, politicians and interest groups will engage scientists with similar political ideologies. In this situation, the objectivity of political advice is still possible, but only if there is an open discussion and, in the case of empirical analyses, if data are available for re-estimations.

H89|Emergency Aid 2.0|Does the proliferation of aid donors lead to visible changes in the world of foreign assistance? Aid provided by low- and middle-income countries, autocratic regimes and donors operating outside the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD is gaining in importance. This article uses data on emergency aid supplied by 105 donor countries to explore the determinants of aid and the differences in allocation patterns between donor groups. Our results show that both the so-called new and traditional donors provide emergency aid based on humanitarian need and their self-interests, but we find evidence that non-DAC donors attach relatively more importance to political motives. Additionally, autocratic donors seem to favor countries rich in natural resources and to disfavor democracies. Since the timeliness of the aid delivery is crucial for aid effectiveness, we furthermore analyze which factors influence the number of days that pass after a natural disaster before a donor commits herself to provide emergency relief. With regard to aid promptness, we find DAC, developed and democratic countries to be significantly faster than non-DAC, developing and autocratic countries.
H89|Corruption and bureaucracy in public services|The theory that we shall seek to elaborate here puts considerable emphasis on the importance of big-time corruption in reducing funding for service delivery, the value of bureaucracy as a means of delivering public services, and the level of politicization of the public bureaucracy. This paper seeks to fill a gap in the current literature by examining different aspects of the benefits of openness and transparency in tackling corruption in the public sector, the bureaucratization of service tasks, and the failure of bureaucratic systems in delivering public services. In sum, the results of the current paper provide useful insights on the context and causes of corruption, incentives to assure efficiency within the public bureaucracy, and the organizational limits of public bureaucracy.
H89|Cultural and Political Determinants of Air Quality|This paper investigates empirically the determinants of air quality in a large cross-section of countries. We assess air quality by sulfur emissions and, following the literature, we consider three different groups of determinants: economic, political and cultural. We confirm the existence of an EKC for sulfur (inverted-U shaped relation between wealth and pollution). Political determinants are proxied by ethnic or religious fractionalization indexes and the country’s legal origin (we consider five possible legal origins: English common law, French civil law, German civil law, Scandinavian legal system and Socialist legal system). Cultural determinants are assessed by the percentage of a country’s population that belongs to one of the three main religions (Catholic, Muslim or Protestant). Our goal is to establish the economic, political and cultural profile of a country that manages to be efficient in providing good air quality. We conclude that a country will provide higher air quality if it has one or more of the following characteristics: it is ethnic and/or religious homogeneous, it has a German or Scandinavian legal tradition; it is Protestant.
H89|European Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Taxation|The operation of different taxation systems in EU member states appears to promote more increasingly the appearance of double taxation entailing fraud and tax evasion. The phenomenon is amplified by the remaining control competences at the national level, and the lack of administrative cooperation in tax matters at EU level is being a decisive factor in delaying the causes with the consequence of prescription of the facts which brings serious damage enhanced EU budget. This study aims to examine the legal ways and means to ensure that the information, reports, statements and other documents mandatory to the administrative or judicial proceedings to be legal required from the counterparts existing in other members states invoked as evidence by their competent bodies.
H89|Electoral Campaigns in the Process of Transition to Democracy in Romania after December 1989. Research Theme: Local Campaign for Mayor’s Office of Iasi, 2004 – The Construction of a Political Product (English version)|This study aims to present the electoral campaigns in Romania after December 1989. Electoral campaigns are designed, at least in theory, to inform voters about candidates and to help them better understand their position on problems of the moment, the causes for which they stand up for and party affiliations. Knowing the candidates and being aware of their conceptions and actions, the electors can decide who to vote for, whether to adjust or not their electoral options or if there is a need of changing the political power. Unfortunately, electoral campaigns succeed only partially to achieve these goals, failing most of the time to inform the electors and help them to vote according to them. The construction of the political figure, the notoriety of the candidate, the credibility, the slogan, the media agenda versus the population agenda, are matters of discussion absolutely necessary for a suitable analysis, and we cannot create an image of coherency in the planning of a campaign or, even more specific, in the construction of a political product. After the first part, which is to some extent theoretical, in the second part I will put forward a practical study which in this case can only be the presentation of a fragment of electoral campaign. It is a fragment because the amplitude and complexity of approaching an electoral campaign with all of its elements would overcome the time allocated during this conference, this is the reason why I will analyze the electoral campaign through the construction of the political product. The research’s presentation consists of the local campaign for the Mayor’s office of Iasi, in 2004, considered through the national electoral context: the realization of the D.A. alliance between PNL and PD in the autumn of 2003, meant the beginning of the actual electoral struggle in Romania. If when the alliance was launched, in the autumn of 2002, the two parties were almost alike, around 10-12%, after one year, PNL rose to 18-20% and PD remained at 10-12%. In order to have a clearer image upon the political „market” of Iasi I have presented the first five „brands” (political parties) with their „the political products” (candidates for the position of Mayor) resulted from this campaign and, bearing in mind the criteria announced above, I found interesting the evolution of two candidates for the seat of Mayor of Iasi: Dan Carlan- Democrat Party (PD) and Relu Fenechiu- National Liberal Party (PNL). Finally, I was concerned with the construction of the political product of PD and PNL, and moreover, the logical conclusions of the scientific study.
H89|The 2008 Election Moment. Iasi, the First Uninominal Elections (English version)|In this article we try to present and briefly analyze the local and the parliamentary elections from 2008 in Iasi County. Through this paper we intend to reveal the voters’ expectations in terms of electoral offer, and also the desirable dominant traits of the candidates proposed by the main political parties, through the choices at the polls. The results of these elections have revealed two contradictory features in the options of the electorate: at the local level, we can clearly see a trend of preserving local structures, voters going for the incumbent candidate for the seat of the Mayor and for the County Council they voted for a well- known person, with the highest degree of notoriety, certified by two terms as Mayor of Iasi; while in the general elections, a renewal trend of the Romanian Parliament, long waited as a renewal of the entire political class, was clearly seen.
H89|Campaign Contributions over CEOs' Careers|Individuals dominate money in politics, accounting for over 90 percent of campaign contributions, yet studies of drivers of individuals? giving are scarce. We analyze data on all contributions made between 1991 and 2008 by all 1,556 people who became S&P 500 CEOs during that interval. We exploit variation in leadership status over these individuals? careers to identify that being an S&P 500 CEO causes a $4,029 or 137 percent jump per election cycle in personal giving. While some fraction of CEOs? contributions can be attributed to long-standing preferences, the striking changes in behavior cannot be explained by these factors alone.
H89|The Social Perception of Actors on the New Local Public Management and Its Reform. A Survey at Timisoara City Hall|Local Public Administration is the base of operation of any administrative system as well as the base of constant objectives of central and local government. It has to be based on a series of well established coordinates, coordinated by an appropriate regulatory framework. The purpose of this study is to analyze the problems of local public administration in Romania by addressing a few important points, which have an impact on capacity and administrative quality. Legislative changes, training facilities and constant institutional reorganization of local government, show the presence of active interest for this problem, hence the actuality of the topic. However, real reform of local government still needs essential improvements. This study aims to analyze the social perception of the public local actors, to establish the positive and especially the negative aspects of local public system reform, all from the point of view of the employees of local government. In accordance with these principles, we formulated the following research objectives: first objective : local government of Romania, second objective: finding practical problems of local government in Timisoara and analysis of local government reform perception from the point of view of the civil servants in the Timisoara City Hall. The research instrument used is the scientific questionnaire.
H89|The Financial Crisis Of 2007 – 2008 A Review Of The Timeline And Of Its Causes| This article introduces one of the modern approach to management of self-government – it is the process management in comparation with the functional management and its application´s possibilities in pratice. The self-government whose performance is not based on profit but on the budget and the disposable resources are not applied in the way of maximising the profits but it is focused on meeting the demands of the client – citizen and the self-government is influenced by the political, judicial and economical environment in which it works. The managerial processes decide about the allocation of disposable resources and their input into the processes and the revenues and expenditures are assessed by them. The level of citizens´satisfaction having a textual reflection rather than a numerical representation is highlighted. An efficient method to be applied is the benchmarking which compares the different coefficients of different organisations or self-governments within the same processes.
H89|The consequences of Fiscal Episodes in OECD Countries for Aid Supply|This paper contributes to the established literature both on the side of fiscal consolidation (for e.g. Alesina and Perotti 1995; Alesina et al. 2010) and that of aid supplies (for e.g. Mosley 1985; Faini, 2006) by investigating the effects of fiscal episodes in OECD donor countries on their aid effort vis-à-vis the developing countries. We use descriptive statistics provided by Alesina and Ardagna (2010) on episodes of fiscal consolidation and stimuli in OECD countries and regression models to perform this analysis. The study is performed on a sample of 19 OECD DAC countries as well as on sub-samples for robustness check and over the period 1970-2007. Overall, the results suggest that the episodes of fiscal consolidation and the size of these fiscal austerity policies in OECD DAC countries lead to the curtailment of aid effort. Whilst during periods of fiscal expansion, aid expenditures increase, the size of these fiscal expansion policies may have an opposite effect. The fiscal austerity measures currently adopted by OECD DAC countries are likely to result in aid shortfalls to developing countries, with these effects likely be higher in the “Like-minded Donor countries”.
H89|The role of specific legislation in combating undeclared work and its socio-economic effects|The present article shows some aspects regarding black and gray labor, components of underground economy in Romania and the way the work legislation and the ones called upon to apply it intend to contribute to fighting this phenomenon. Fiscal pressure is, in fact, the degree of taxation, i.e. the extent to which taxpayers as a whole, society, economy, bear - to the results obtained from their work - taxes as compulsory levies and charges imposed by the legal State. Tax burden is the ratio of the sum of all taxes, social contributions and other samples containing the tax collected from central or local level, and aggregate macroeconomic indicators (GDP, GNP, national income).
H89|The Italian Tradition in Public Finance: An Annotated Bibliography of Mauro Fasiani|Mauro Fasiani’s scholarly achievement still does not occupy its proper place in scientific debate, either in Italy or abroad. Thus, the enhancement of the scientific figure of Mauro Fasiani presents a very significant scientific interest, in order to finally put into perspective his contribution to the evolution of the theory of public finance not only in the Italian tradition in Public Finance but in the international context also. To that end the present paper is directed, within the limits that the aim is not to discuss Fasiani’s scientific thought, but only to draw it to the attention of international scholars by making known the content of his work.

H89|Experiment on the Demand for Encompassment|The idea of political community is appealing on a gut-level. Hayek suggested that certain genes and instincts still dispose us toward the ethos and mentality of the hunter-gatherer band, and that modern forms of political collectivism have, in part, been atavistic reassertions of such tendencies. Picking up on Hayek, Klein (2005) has suggested a combination of yearnings: 1) a yearning for coordinated sentiment (like Smithian sympathy); and 2) a yearning that the sentiment encompass the whole group. This paper reports on an experiment designed to explore the demand for encompassment by having subjects sing together. In each trial, one person in the room was designated not to sing unless every one of the others in the room had made a payment sufficient so as to have that person sing. Subjects chose to sacrifice money to achieve encompassment 47.4 percent of the time, with 59.6 percent of the subjects doing so in at least one trial. An exit questionnaire showed that subjects’ chief reason for making such a sacrifice was a belief that the singing would be more enjoyable if it encompassed the whole group, and reported enjoyment is significantly higher with encompassment. We discuss the experiment as a parable for a penchant toward political collectivism.

H89|Measuring the Consumption Value of Higher Education| This article argues that the consumption value of education is an important motivation for educational choice. When controlling for ability, we find that individuals are willing to forego substantial future wage returns to acquire a particular type of higher education. We find that high-ability individuals who attended teachers' college in Norway during the 1960s could have substantially increased their lifetime income by choosing an alternative educational type. Moreover, the ex post price for the consumption value of teachers' college turned out to be even higher than the estimated ex ante willingness to pay for this consumption value.

H89|Perceptions about the mass media among the students from Republic of Moldova|The last decades revealed the importance of mass media in a society. Regarding the Republic of Moldova the role of mass media is influenced by some particularities of the economic, politic and social activities. Moldova is among the poorest states from Europe and its political situation is still unstable. On the markets of mass media from Moldova there are in competition different categories of participants: domestics and foreigners, public and private entities. This paper presents the results of an investigation among a group of students from the Republic of Moldova regarding their perceptions about mass media. Such results could contribute to understanding the impact of mass media for an important segment of the Bessarabian society.

H89|The Washroom Game|This article analyses a game where players sequentially choose either to become insiders and pick one of fi nitely many locations or to remain outsiders. They will only become insiders if a minimum distance to the next player can be assured; their secondary objective is to maximise the minimal distance to other players. This is illustrated by considering the strategic behaviour of men choosing from a set of urinals in a public lavatory. However, besides very similar situations (e.g. settling of residents in a newly developed area, the selection of food patches by foraging animals, choosing seats in waiting rooms or lines in a swimming pool), the game might also relevant to the problem of placing billboards attempting to catch the attention of passers-by or similar economic situations. In the non-cooperative equilibrium, all insiders behave as if they cooperated with each other and minimised the total number of insiders. It is shown that strategic behaviour leads to an equilibrium with substantial underutilization of available locations. Increasing the number of locations tends to decrease utilization. The removal of some locations which leads to gaps can not only increase relative utilization but even absolute maximum capacity.
H89|Political Connectedness and Firm Performance: Evidence from Germany| This paper investigates politically connected firms in Germany. With the introduction of a new transparency law in 2007, information on additional income sources for all members of the German parliament became publicly available. We find that members of the conservative party (CDU&sol;CSU) and the liberal party (FDP) are more likely to work for firms than members of left-wing parties (SPD and The Left) or the green party (Alliance 90&sol;The Greens). Politically connected firms are larger, less risky and have lower market valuations than unconnected firms. They also have fewer growth opportunities, but slightly better accounting performance. On the stock market, connected firms significantly outperformed unconnected firms in 2006, i.e. before the publication of the data on political connections. Differences in stock market performance were much smaller in 2007. Copyright 2010 The Authors. German Economic Review 2010 Verein für Socialpolitik.
H89|The Corruption Trend among Public Officials in Malaysia: An Overview|The war against corruption is vital to a nation. No one can dispute the negative consequences of corruption, but still, there are those who tend to condone its practice and view it as a necessary evil of economic development. Governments in several Asian and African countries tend to accept this as part and partial of economic development. However, the fallacy of this argument was exposed following the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which demonstrated how corruption had short-changed the countries. The example of Singapore was proof of the argument that a clean government is best positioned to handle an economic crisis. Corruption or bribery investigations should not be kept private but placed in the realm of public knowledge. To understand the main factors that lead to the increase of corruption among male officers as compared to women officers is of great importance as it may suggest the suitability of the Malaysian government or the federal government framework in controlling or curbing corruption for the Malaysian community which lay emphasis on traditional norms and values.

H89|Theoretical And Practical Approach Regarding Density And Penetration Insurance On Accident & Health Premiums|In this paper is realized an theoretical and empirical approach regarding density and penetration on accident & health premiums. The analysis is performed on a sample of 33 countries and a horizon of 5 years (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008), being tested 2 linear regression models. The results of study confirm a relationship between level of economic development and accident & health insurance activity insurance, but exclude the existence of the relationship between penetration factor and this type of insurance.
H89|Three-Candidate Spatial Competition When Candidates Have Valence: Asymmetric Voter Density and Plurality Maximization|I study both local and global Nash equilibria of a model of three-candidate unidimensional spatial competition. In the model, candidates may have different non-policy characteristics (valence). Generalizing the base model studied in Evrenk (2009a;b) the model allows for an asymmetric voter density as well as plurality-maximizing candidates. Unlike the standard Hotelling-Downs model of multi-candidate competition, under an asymmetric density with (heterogenous) vote-maximizing candidates a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) exists. Further, this PSNE is free from several non-plausible features of PSNE under a symmetric density. When candidates are plurality-maximizers, some of the PSNE are supported by paradoxical candidate behavior. Further, when voter density is asymmetric and candidates are plurality-maximizers, there are several non-monotonicities in the PSNE.
H89|Three-Candidate Competition When Candidates Have Valence: Stochastic Voting|We study the effects of stochastic (probabilistic) voting on equilibrium locations, equilibrium vote shares and comparative statics in a setup with three heterogenous candidates and a single-dimensional issue space. Comparing the equilibria with and without stochastic voting, we find that under an appropriate level of uncertainty about voter behavior, the model has a pure strategy Nash Equilibrium (PSNE) that is free from several non-plausible features of the PSNE under deterministic voting. The results are robust to extensions to asymmetric density and plurality maximization.
H89|The Consumption Value of Higher Education|The consumption value of higher education is an important factor behind the individual’s educational choice. We provide a comprehensive literature survey, and define the consumption value as the private, intended, non-pecuniary return to higher education. We provide new empirical evidence for the willingness to pay for the consumption value of a particular type of higher education. Even when controlling for ability selection, we find on US data that Liberal Arts graduates were willing to forego 46 pct. of their potential income in order to enjoy the consumption value of this educational type.
H89|The New Rural Paradigm And The Public Policies In France: Rural Excellence Poles|The new rural paradigm requires important changes in how policies are conceived and implemented to include a cross-cutting and multi-level governance approach. Designing rural development policy for different communities or territories requires the pooling of knowledge held by a wide variety of public and private actors. Traditional hierarchical administrative structures are likely to be inadequate to administer these policies effectively and adjustments are thus needed along three key governance dimensions: horizontally at both the central and the local levels and vertically across levels of government (OECD, 2006, p. 17). Two principles characterise the new rural paradigm: a focus on places instead of sectors and a focus on investments instead of subsidies. Thus, the main purpose of this paper is to analyse the experience of the French public policy for development of rural spaces and cities – The Rural Excellence Poles. Relative to these poles, we verify the lack of the literature. However, the theme is very interesting because it is conceived within the new rural paradigm and the recent preoccupations with the rural territories.
H89|The Making of Policy: Institutionalized or Not?|This article attempts to build bridges in the formal study of policymaking across polities of different degrees of institutional development. It explores the reasons why policymaking is fairly institutionalized in some polities but not in others. It suggests extending standard models of institutionalized policymaking to allow for a wider set of actions, including the threat of violence or of damage to the economy. It engages the discussion of institutions as rules and institutions as equilibria, delivering multiple equilibria with different degrees of institutionalization. The likelihood of institutionalized policymaking increases as the cost of alternative political actions increases, as the damage these alternatives cause decreases, and as the economy becomes wealthier. In cases in which the distribution of de jure political power is more asymmetric, it is more likely to observe use of alternative political technologies as well as low degrees of institutionalization.
H89|Three-candidate competition when candidates have valence: the base case|We study the Nash Equilibrium of three-candidate unidimensional spatial competition when candidates differ in their non-policy characteristics (valence). If the voters' policy preferences are represented by a strictly convex loss function, and if the voter density is unimodal and symmetric, then a unique, modulo symmetry, local Nash Equilibrium exists under fairly plausible conditions. The global Nash Equilibrium, however, exists when only one candidate has a valence advantage (or disadvantage) while the other two candidates have the same valence<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

H89|The Electoral College and voter participation rates: Reply|This theoretical note argues that although both gross costs and possible gross benefits from the Electoral College can be identified, they cannot be compared in such a way as to generate a case that the Electoral College yields net benefits to society. In other words, the Electoral College system, pure and simple, artificially distorts behavior in a market where household preferences are to intended be expressed; although this distortion yields apparent benefits and costs, the existence of net benefits is not established. In sum, since the Electoral College system artificially distorts geographic voter participation rate patterns, the case needs to be made w y the system should be retained.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
