Z33|‘Luxury’ As The Pedagogical Project Of The Russian Emperors And Empresses: The History Of The Concept In The 18th Century|Luxury has always been an intrinsic part of world history, but only in the 18th century the core of this phenomenon came up for discussion in Europe. During these debates the concept of luxury was gradually demoralized by economic liberalism and reshaped as “modern and more objective economic concept”. Eventually the concept of luxury became a universal concept with the only commonly accepted meaning (Sekora). A seminal role in this process played translations, as far as for the continental translators of the key writings “there was no need to invent an entirely new vocabulary of political economy or of cultural practice…” (Reinert). Thus, European thinkers coordinated their positions even if they disagreed with each other. But, how had the notion of luxury been conceptualizing outside of the European Roman world? Russia is an interesting example raising some intellectual puzzles. First of all, it was a relatively backward country, where luxury per se was the essential part of national self-representation. This contradiction caused the real economic problems of indebtedness. One way of fixing it up was the introduction of sumptuary laws which became an important channel of defining the concept of luxury. Secondly, starting from Petrine time Russia got more acquainted with the European political economy masterpieces, translating and adopting them. But “translators lost the security of compatibility when they turned to extra-European languages and traditions” (Reinert). How did Russian translators accomplish the task of describing such a relatively new phenomenon as luxury? By the 1760s, as a result of two processes of the development of legislation and translation the European writings starting the concept of luxury became not an economic term on a large scale, as in European tradition, but a pedagogical project, when the subjects had to acquire mostly the unwritten rules of permissible levels of luxury.
Z33|Asymmetric Risk Impacts of Chinese Tourists to Taiwan|Consider using the simple moving average (MA) rule of Gartley (1935) to determine when to buy stocks, and when to sell them and switch to the risk-free rate. In comparison, how might the performance be affected if the frequency is changed to the use of MA calculations? The empirical results show that, on average, the lower is the frequency, the higher are average daily returns, even though the volatility is virtually unchanged when the frequency is lower. The volatility from the highest to the lowest frequency is about 30% lower as compared with the buy-and-hold strategy volatility, but the average returns approach the buy-and-hold returns when frequency is lower. The 30% reduction in volatility appears if we invest randomly half the time in stock markets and half in the risk-free rate.
Z33|Microeconomics of tourism among selected CEE countries: What influences profitability in a case of those profitable firms?| The paper has focused on financial management of medium-sized hotels and travel agencies in eight selected Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. According to a business finance theory, there should be inverse relation between liquidity and profitability of companies. In general, if managers decrease firm's liquidity through investing into the fixed assets they should increase firm's profitability, which is caused by possible higher earnings from those investments. The aim of the study is to estimate how is profitability of those profitable tourism companies affected by selected financial variables, and decide whether the business finance theory is valid also within tourism industry among selected CEE countries. Annual data from Amadeus, the international statistical database are obtained from 1,957 hotels and 785 travel agencies from Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. General Methods of Moments (GMM) with panel data is used as the main estimation method for period from 2006 to 2015. However, results of the paper have shown that the business finance theory is not valid either within both types of tourism companies nor among all selected CEE countries. Furthermore, it is obvious that a conflict between managers of tourism companies and their owners should have been paid more attention. A creating of retained earnings within the stockholders' funds when owners had reinvested the earnings back to the business had particular significance for tourism companies' profitability within the period affected by the global financial crisis, even in the case of those profitable companies.
Z33|Risk Spillovers in Returns for Chinese and International Tourists to Taiwan|Fluctuations in the numbers of visitors directly affect the rates of return on tourism business activities. Therefore, maintaining a firm grasp of the relationship between the changes in the numbers of Chinese tourists and international travellers visiting Taiwan is conducive to the formulation of an effective and practical tourism strategy. Although the topic of international visitors to Taiwan is important, existing research has discussed the issue of the travel demand between Chinese tourists and international travellers visiting Taiwan. This paper is the first to examine the spillover effects between the rate of change in the numbers of Chinese tourist arrivals and the rate of change in the numbers of international traveller arrivals. Using daily data for Chinese tourists and international travellers visiting Taiwan over the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 October 2016, together with the Diagonal BEKK model, the paper analyses the co-volatility spillover effects between the rate of change in the numbers of international travellers and the rate of change in the numbers of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan. The empirical results show that there is no dependency relationship between the rate of change in the numbers of Chinese tourists and the rate of change in the numbers of international travellers visiting Taiwan. However, there is a significant negative co-volatility spillover effect between the rate of change in the numbers of Chinese tourists and the rate of change in the numbers of international travellers. The empirical findings suggest that Taiwan should abandon its development strategy of focusing only on a single market, namely China, and to be pro-active in encouraging visits by international travellers to Taiwan for sightseeing purposes, thereby increasing the willingness of international travellers to visit Taiwan. Moreover, with the reduction in the numbers of Chinese tour groups visiting Taiwan, and increases in the numbers of individual travellers, the Taiwan Government should change its previous travel policies of mainly attracting Chinese tour group travellers and actively promoting in-depth tourism among international tourists, by developing tourism that focuses on the special characteristics of different localities. In this way, the government can enhance the quality of Taiwan’s tourism, and also attract travellers with high spending power.

Z33|Asymmetric Risk Impacts of Chinese Tourists to Taiwan|Since 2008, when Taiwan’s President Ma Ying-Jeou relaxed the Cross-Strait policy, China has become Taiwan’s largest source of international tourism. In order to understand the risk persistence of Chinese tourists, the paper investigates the short-run and long-run persistence of shocks to the change rate of Chinese tourists to Taiwan. The daily data used for the empirical analysis is from 1 January 2013 to 28 February 2018. McAleer’s (2015) fundamental equation in tourism finance is used to link the change rate of tourist arrivals and the change in tourist revenues. Three widely-used univariate conditional volatility models, namely GARCH(1,1), GJR(1,1) and EGARCH(1,1), are used to measure the short-run and long-run persistence of shocks, as well as symmetric, asymmetric and leverage effects. Three different Heterogeneous AutoRegressive (HAR) models, HAR(1), HAR(1,7) HAR(1,7,28), are considered as alternative mean equations for capturing a variety of long memory effects. The mean equations associated with GARCH(1,1), GJR(1,1) and EGARCH(1,1) are used to analyse the risk persistence of the change in Chinese tourists. The exponential smoothing process is used to adjust the seasonality around the trend in Chinese tourists. The empirical results show asymmetric impacts of positive and negative shocks on the volatility of the change in the number of Group-type and Medical-type tourists, while Individual-type tourists display a symmetric volatility pattern. Somewhat unusually, leverage effects are observed in EGARCH for Medical-type tourists, which shows a negative correlation between shocks in tourist numbers and the subsequent shocks to volatility. For both Group-type and Medical-type tourists, the asymmetric impacts on volatility show that negative shocks have larger effects than do positive shocks. The leverage effect in EGARCH for Medical-type tourists implies that larger shocks would decrease volatility in the change in the numbers of Medical-type tourists. These results suggest that Taiwan tourism authorities should act to prevent the negative shocks for the Group-type and Medicaltype Chinese tourists to dampen the shocks that arise from having fewer Chinese tourists to Taiwan.
Z33|Total Quality Management Implementation and Guest Satisfaction in Hospitality|Total quality management (TQM) has become a modern system of constant improvement of the quality of all company activities. The purpose of this study is to measure the expectations and satisfaction of the guests concerning the attribute quality of the hotel product. Furthermore obtained results were compared in such a way as to analyse particularly the reviews of hotels which have implemented TQM and have the ISO 9001 certificates with reviews from hotels which have not implemented TQM and do not have the ISO 9001 certificates. The conducted analysis included 55 hotels in Serbia belonging to the 4- and 5-star categories, i.e. 1308 guests who have stayed in them. The results show that between the observed groups of guests there are fewer differences in expectations than in perception, and that generally speaking guests who have stayed in the hotels that have implemented TQM are more satisfied. The biggest difference concerning the guest satisfaction with the quality of service in the observed hotels is noticeable in relation to the employees and the value-for-money.
Z33|Do smoking bans always hurt the gaming industry? Differentiated impacts on the market value of casino firms in Macao (China)|The gaming economy has expanded rapidly in East Asia during the past decade. Despite the public health hazards of Second Hand Smoking (SHS), smoking bans in casinos remain controversial due to concerns over potential economic losses for casino firms. Applying an event study method, the authors examine the abnormal returns of casino stocks in response to three unexpected announcements of smoking bans in casinos from 2011 to 2015 in Macao. The analysis reveals that the announcements were associated with differentiated abnormal returns of casino stocks. The stocks of the traditional casinos in Macao suffered significant cumulative abnormal losses of 1% to 6%, while the Las Vegas themed casinos in Macao enjoyed significant cumulative abnormal excess returns of 1.4% to 4.8%. Furthermore, the authors find that the low air quality in gaming venues and high dependence on gaming revenues are associated with abnormal losses, while positive management initiatives are significant correlated with positive abnormal returns. This study provides a full picture of the impacts of smoking bans on casinos and will thus be a useful policy reference for the Macao government, as well as for the rapidly growing gaming industry in Asia and other developing economies.
Z33|Using The Factorial Correspondences For Analyzing Tourist Flows|This study aims to analyze the distribution of each flow of non-residents tourists, coming from 33 countries, on the six main categories of touristic destinations in Romania, in 2015, and assumes that there are differences or similarities between the tourists origin country and the touristic destinations that they chose. The performances recorded in Romania regarding the attraction of foreign tourists were relatively modest during the past three decades, from various reasons, starting with a poor access infrastructure and finishing with a deficient and, sometimes inadequate activity of tourism promotion. The statistical method used is the factorial correspondences analysis. The data processing, the indicators significance testing and the graph representations were performed using SPSS statistical software. We consider that the usage of this method allows the indirect knowledge of the tourist preferences and the results may be useful in developing a strategy for tourism promotion, customized for each country that sends tourists.
Z33|Impact of promotional tools on reservation channels management: a descriptive model of Italian accommodation facilities|Abstract Digital evolution has greatly affected the tourism industry, bringing new challenges and opportunities to accommodation facilities. Literature confirms that new technologies allow building personal and interactive relationships with customers, but also cause tourism service providers to interface with new intermediaries, especially the Online Travel Agencies. However, there is a lack of empirical studies showing which marketing activities are helpful to engage customers and overcome the difficulties highlighted by scholars. This paper aims to bridge the gap, by assessing the relationship between promotional tools used by accommodation facilities and the percentage of bookings received through direct channels, digital direct channels and Online Travel Agencies. Hypotheses are tested through a GLM model with data from 1194 accommodation facilities distributed on the Italian territory, interviewed in the summer 2015. The paper contributes on two levels: by showing which tools, primarily digital, are statistically significant to decrease the dependence from Online Travel Agencies in favor of direct bookings and by highlighting the relevance of the cooperation with destinations. Implications for further research are discussed.
Z33|The Anticipation Of The Number Of Tourists Arrived In Mamaia Using The Type Of Models Arima|The Mamaia station is, at the moment, the biggest and the most looked for touristic station from the Romanian seaside of the Black Sea. From the analysis of the evolution of the main indicators of touristic circulation from the last 10 years (2006-2015), we can notice a significant increase, but we are also interested in knowing the tendency of their modification in the near future. For this reason, in the present study, we wanted to test the contribution of the models ARIMA to the elaboration of an anticipation regarding the indicators: arrivals of tourists, totally and structurally: Romanians and foreigners, for Mamaia station. We consider that the results obtained in this study may contribute to the defining of the strategy of development of the station and ensuring the necessary conditions for hosting a significant greater number of tourists, in the following years.

Despite the known public health hazards of secondhand smoking, smoking bans in casinos remain controversial due to concerns over the potential economic harm to casino firms. Applying an event study, the authors examine the abnormal returns of casino stocks in response to three unexpected smoking ban announcements from 2011 to 2015 in Macao. Their analysis reveals that these announcements were associated with differentiated abnormal returns of casino stocks. Stocks of traditional casinos suffered abnormal losses of 0.58-3%, while the Las Vegas themed casinos enjoyed positive abnormal returns of up to 3%. Furthermore, the authors find that low air quality in gaming venues and high dependence on gaming revenues are associated with abnormal losses, while positive management initiatives are significantly correlated with positive abnormal returns. The findings of this study provide a full picture of the impacts of smoking bans on casinos and thus will be a useful policy references for the Macao government, as well as for the rapidly growing gaming industry in Asia and developing economies elsewhere.
Z33|Factorial Correspondences Analysis – A Tool In Tourism Motivation Research|"This study aims at analyzing the distribution of tourist flows in 2014, from 25 European countries, on three main categories of trip purposes, and assumes that there are differences or similarities between the tourists’ countries of residence and their trip purposes. ""Purpose'' is a multidimensional concept used in marketing research, most often for understanding consumer behavior, and for identifying market segments or customer target groups, reunited in terms of similar characteristics. Being aware that the decision of choice/ purchase is based on purposes, their knowledge proves useful in designing strategies to increase the satisfaction level provided to the customer. The statistical method used in this paper is the factorial correspondences analysis. In our opinion, the identification, by this method, of the existence of differences or similarities between the tourists’ countries of residence and their trip purposes can represent a useful step in studying the tourism market and the choice/ reformulation of strategies."
Z33|Quantitative Aspects Regarding The Tourist Traffic Indicators In The Human Settlements Located On The Black Sea Coast|The human settlements located on the Black Sea coast, between Navodari and Vama Veche, have developed over time, especially after 1970, both as localities/administrative units, as well as Romanian tourist resorts of national interest. The objective of this study is to statistically process the quantitative aspects of the widely used tourist traffic indicators, in order to capture the existence of similarities or differences between the 17 analyzed tourist resorts and locations. Moreover, based on the results triggered by the application of statistical methods, we also aim at achieving a qualitative analysis, encompassing the interpretations related to the attractiveness, image and perception of each resort/location and the motivation for the choice made by different segments of tourists. The interdisciplinary nature of this work is underlying the presentation and understanding the aspects related to the tourist supply, tourist demand/consumption, consumer/tourist behavior and effects/ results. Also, the information obtained from processing the available database on the 17 tourist resorts and locations, by means of the selected statistical methods, allows us to express our own views as proposals for local decision makers, in order to improve the activity and the economic performance and image of the respective tourist location/resort.
Z33|Overconfident Investors, Predictable Returns, and Excessive Trading|The last several decades have witnessed a shift away from a fully rational paradigm of financial markets toward one in which investor behavior is influenced by psychological biases. Two principal factors have contributed to this evolution: a body of evidence showing how psychological bias affects the behavior of economic actors; and an accumulation of evidence that is hard to reconcile with fully rational models of security market trading volumes and returns. In particular, asset markets exhibit trading volumes that are high, with individuals and asset managers trading aggressively, even when such trading results in high risk and low net returns. Moreover, asset prices display patterns of predictability that are difficult to reconcile with rational expectations-based theories of price formation. In this paper, we discuss the role of overconfidence as an explanation for these patterns.
Z33|Role of Tourist Destination Development in Building its Brand Image: A Conceptual Model|Tourism is truly an international/global industry. Tourism is vital to the economy of a country and sustainable tourism development requires an understanding of the complex interrelationships and interactions among a multitude of environmental factors and interdisciplinary forces that play a critical role in tourism development. While overall the field of tourism has been abundantly researched, there are certain areas where there is a paucity of research, namely, competition analysis, branding and positioning. Our research contributes to this extremely important but relatively less researched subject. Specifically, we study the relationship between destination development and its brand image. We develop a conceptual model which identifies various constructs, processes and linkages involved in the relationship between destination development and its brand image. We propose that the brand image has three components corresponding to the three stages of consumption/travel, namely, pre-travel, during travel, and posttravel. In developing this model we draw upon the interdisciplinary nature of tourism and discuss a variety of influences, such as, economic, social, cultural, political and psychological factors.
Z33|Forecasting extreme seasonal tourism demand|When we face an extreme seasonal demand such that off-season monthly demands go down almost to zero, it is important to forecast the high-season demand only. In forecasting tourism demand for a place like a cold-water island, we meet such an extreme seasonality. However, in such places, tourism is one of the most important industries, and to forecast tourism demand in the high season is important. Rishiri Island in Japan is a typical example. We construct some forecasting models and evaluate their forecasting performance using several criteria. Forecasts from the SARIMA model with full-season data and without a trend term perform best in postsample evaluation. This shows that off-season data also provide useful information for forecasting the high-season tourism demand.
Z33|Sukuk Issuance in China: Trends and Positive Expectations|The paper assesses the potential and importance of Sukuk issuance in China. The research proposes that Sukuk can be used as an alternative financing instrument to materialize the “One Belt One road (OBOR)” strategy. Hong Kong as a gateway of China had launched two Sukuks in 2014 and 2015 respectively. This paper analyzes the two sovereign Sukuk issuances out of Hong Kong in the last 3 years. Meanwhile, by conducting un-structured interviews of the potential issuers and related scholars, it is found that Sukuk issuance in China will face some challenges such as policies and regulations of Sukuk, tax and stamp duty issues, investors’ protection, establishing of Shariah Supervisory Committee, etc. However “OBOR” initiative provides the best opportunity for Sukuk to move forward in China.
Z33|Significant Moments In The History And Evolution Of The Touristic City Of Constanta And Anticipation Of The Number Of Arrived Tourists Using The Arima Models|For the Romanian economy, Constanța is appreciated mainly because it is the biggest port town in the country, and for many generations it has been the city where they spend many of their summer holidays. But how many of us know that the bathroom resort – Constanța has an officially attested existence of 140 years? In this study, the aim is, on one side, to present the significant moments in the history and evolution of this historic city, in order to bring to the foreground and sustain the position that the city has at the present moment in the system of touristic spots on the Romanian seaside, and on the other side, our concern is to know the future evolution of the touristic activity, to make some previsions using the ARIMA models, for one of the most used indicators in the analysis of touristic circulation, respectively: the number of arrivals of tourists, structurally and totally: Romanian and foreigners. We think that the obtained results, applying these models, may be considered a solid base for different debates regarding the choice of an efficient strategy, that should allow reaching an equilibrium between the effort of attracting a number of tourists as big as possible (Romanian and foreigners), of growing their degree of satisfaction towards the touristic offer and the concern of not generating disruptions in the economic, social and cultural life of the city.
Z33|The Quality of Hotel Services in Romania: an Application of the Servqual Model|The role and importance of service quality for hotel businesses cannot be contested. It is extremely important for managers to understand customers’ expectations. As a result, the paper presents an application of the Servqual model on the hotel industry in Romania. By using the Servqual scale, the article highlights the service dimensions Romanian consumers appreciate most in the hotel industry. The results show whether consumers are satisfied with the quality of Romanian hotel services. The implications of these results are discussed.
Z33|La qualità della comunicazione via web per la promozione del turismo nautico|Per le imprese turistiche la presenza sul web è di primaria importanza, al fine di inserirsi sul mercato turistico internazionale e interfacciarsi con gli utenti, sia potenziali sia effettivi. In questo lavoro viene analizzato il ruolo della comunicazione web nell'ambito del turismo nautico, con particolare riferimento ai porti turistici. Viene quindi proposto un modello di analisi della qualità dei siti web dei porti turistici, che viene poi applicato ad un campione di porti turistici italiani del nord della Sardegna. La valutazione risultante, integrata da un confronto con adeguati benchmark nazionali ed esteri, permette di individuare e proporre una serie di politiche e strumenti operativi finalizzati alla valorizzazione dei porti turistici e alla promozione del turismo nautico attraverso il web e i social media.
Z33|Building Brand Awareness In The Medical Travel Market|The research work has as objective to determine the factors that contribute to the construction of the e-Reputation of a medical tourism business. The research tries to propose to medical facilitators methods and in particular Web marketing strategies, to help improve the ergonomics and the effectiveness of their web sites in order to meet the expectations of potential patients (medical tourists). The first part of the thesis exposes fundamental theories on medical tourism, its history and the issues it represents, the segmentation of the world market and the flow of patients to different destinations, the role of the medical facilitator in the patient experience, the internet and e-Reputation. The second part is based on a research with a twofold objective: on the one hand determining the motivations of medical tourists and the information they need in order to be reassured to seek treatment abroad. On the other hand, to determine which is the best approach used by the medical facilitators to meet the needs of these tourists and understand how they can build their image on the Internet (e-Reputation). The results of the analysis will help formulate marketing messages to meet the needs of the new patterns of medical tourists, who are now Internet users.
Z33|Philatelic Boosterism: Tourism Stamps Of Small Island States|Small island states, because of their small populations and/or territorial size, compete with larger states on the world political map for identity, investment, revenue and visibility. Tourism represents one economic sector where these island states compete for tourist revenues. How they promote themselves internationally can be measured by the images they present of their amenity environments and culture and their hosting of regional religious, sporting and heritage events. Stamps, along with official webpages, are both products the state can/may use to increase its visibility; philatelic boosterism describes this strategy. I investigate the content of tourist stamps of twenty-four island states in the Caribbean, the Pacific, Europe, Africa and Asia. The major images portrayed are colorful, scenic, natural landscapes, festivals and cultural heritage. Few stamps depict maps, colonial histories and environmental uncertainties, including natural hazards. Tourism stamps appeal to international tourist markets, portray positive gazes and provide income for many small states.
Z33|Impacts Of Green Marketing Strategies On Benefits Of Hotels: The Case From Serbia|It is believed that tourism slowly and silently destroys environment, therefore implementing green technologies and responsible business behavior are among the most trending issues in contemporary tourism. Implementing Environmental Management System and quality standards ISO14000 and ISO14001 in hotels in Serbia are still at the early stage. The main goal of this study was to investigate the major obstacles for implementation of business based on ecological awareness and to assess to what extent the Green Marketing Strategies have influence on the image of the hotels, relations with the local community, competitiveness on the market, profitability and satisfaction of employees. The sample comprised 20% of the total number of hotels in Serbia which are known to use any form of â€˜greenâ€™ marketing. The results confirm that the process of implementation of sustainable marketing strategies is at a very low scale (M=2.89). The regression analysis shows that the most beneficial are the satisfaction of employees and profitability. Furthermore, the results show that there are no differences in the implementation of such strategies regarding the hotels location, categorization and capacity, whereas certain benefits of green marketing vary in relation to location and the capacity of the hotel.
Z33|How Travelers Use Online and Social Media Channels to Make Hotel Choice Decisions. A Comparative Study of Russian Federation and American Tourists’ Online Consumer Behavior|Over the last decades, the global hospitality and tourism (or H&T) industry has undergone dramatic changes. Among the factors stimulating the growth of the H&T industry, the spread of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and social media should be emphasized. The same trends characterize the Russian H&T industry as well. However, despite the significant role of social media in the Russian H&T industry, there is still a lack of understanding of Russian H&T customers’ behavior. The current study aims to fill this gap and demonstrates how Russian travelers use social media to make hotel choice decisions and share their experiences on social media after their travel is completed. In order to deliver a more thorough revealing of Russian travel consumers’ peculiarities and to discover if there is Russian uniqueness, the online behavior of American and Russian travelers is compared in this paper.
