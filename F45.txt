F45|Estimation and Inference for Multi-dimensional Heterogeneous Panel Datasets with Hierarchical Multi-factor Error Structure|Given the growing availability of large datasets and following recent research trends on multi-dimensional modelling, we develop three dimensional (3D) panel data models with hierarchical error components that allow for strong cross-sectional dependence through unobserved heterogeneous global and local factors. We propose consistent estimation procedures by extending the common correlated effects (CCE) estimation approach proposed by Pesaran (2006). The standard CCE approach needs to be modified in order to account for the hierarchical factor structure in 3D panels. Further, we provide the associated asymptotic theory, including new nonparametric variance estimators. The validity of the proposed approach is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulation studies. We also demonstrate the empirical usefulness of the proposed approach through an application to a 3D panel gravity model of bilateral export flows.
F45|Labor Mobility in a Monetary Union|The optimal currency literature has stressed the importance of labor mobility as a precondition for the success of monetary unions. But only a few studies formally link labor mobility to macroeconomic adjustment and policy. In this paper, we study macroeconomic dynamics and optimal monetary policy in an economy with cyclical labor flows across two distinct regions that share trade links and a common monetary framework. In our New Keynesian dynamic, stochastic, general-equilibrium model calibrated to the United States, migration flows are driven by fluctuations in the relative labor market performance across the monetary union. While labor mobility can be an additional channel for cross-regional spillovers as well as a regional shock absorber, we find that a mobile labor force closes the efficiency gaps in the labor market and thus lessens the trade-off between inflation and labor market stabilization. As migration flows are generally inefficient, however, regionspecific disturbances introduce additional trade-offs with regional labor market conditions. Putting some weight on stabilizing fluctuations in the labor market enhances welfare when monetary policy follows a simple rule.
F45|Do Unit Labor Costs Matter? A Decomposition Exercise on European Data|From the introduction of the Euro up to the 2008 global financial crisis, macroeconomic imbalances widened among Member States. This divergence took the form of strong differences in the dynamics of unit labour costs. This paper asks why this happened. Is it the result of distortionary public spending, or the consequence of economic integration? To answer this question, this paper builds a theoretical framework that is able to provide a decomposition of unit labour costs growth into various effects of economic integration and policy intervention. Using a novel dataset, it then measures the contribution of each effect to the dynamics of unit labour costs in 12 countries of the Euro area from 1995 to 2014. Results show that trade and financial integration are significant drivers of unit labour costs divergence. Before the global financial crisis, in Greece and Portugal for example, trade and financial integration explain up to 30% of the increase in unit labour costs relative to core countries. On the contrary, distortionary public spending plays a minor role. These results suggest that, in peripheral economies, increasing unit labour costs reflect more the process of real convergence than fiscal profligacy.
F45|The evolution of US and UK GDP components in the time-frequency domain : A continuous wavelet analysis|Understanding the relationship between national income GDP components is an essential part of macroeconomics. This study investigates quarterly real GDP component data for the U.S. and the U.K. and applies continuous wavelet analysis on cross comparisons of the data, from both within and between the two datasets. The results show that the cyclical interactions between consumption and investment are the most complex and most substantial at several different frequencies. The relationship of exports with other macroeconomic variables has also developed over time, likely due to the evolution of an international business cycle.
F45|Private bank deposits and macro/fiscal risk in the euro-area|We examine the relationship between private bank deposits and macro/fiscal risk in the euro area. We test three hypotheses: First, private bank deposits relative to Germany are determined by macro/fiscal risk factors. Second, this relationship is time-varying. Third, time-variation is driven by the level of macro/fiscal risk. Our findings validate all three tested hypotheses. They also reveal persistent fragmentation between EMU core and periphery banking systems caused by a deficit of trust in periphery banking systems, unmitigated by the introduction of OMT and European Banking Union. Our findings have implications for the introduction of the European Deposits Insurance Scheme (EDIS), for which they offer tentative support.

F45|The Euro Crisis and Economic Growth: A Novel Counterfactual Approach|Macroeconomic adjustment in the euro area periphery was more recessionary than pre-crisis imbalances would have warranted. To make this claim, this paper uses a Propensity Score Matching Model to produce counterfactuals for the Eurozone crisis countries (Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Cyprus, Spain) based on over 200 past macroeconomic adjustment episodes between 1960-2010 worldwide. At its trough, between 2010 and 2015 per capita GDP had contracted on average 11 percentage points more in the Eurozone periphery than in the standard counterfactual scenario. These results are not dictated by any specific country experience, are robust to a battery of alternative counterfactual definitions, and stand confirmed when using a parametric dynamic panel regression model to account more thoroughly for the business cycle. Zooming in on the potential causes, the lack of an independent monetary policy, while having contributed to a deeper recession, does not fully explain the Eurozone’s specificity, which is instead to be traced back to a sharper-than-expected contraction in investment and fiscal austerity due to high funding costs.
F45|How to Handle the Fiscal Crisis in Greece? Empirical Evidence Based on a Survey of Economic Experts|We asked economic experts polled by the CESifo World Economic Survey how to handle the fiscal crisis in Greece in the year 2015. The sample includes about 850 experts from 110 countries. We find systematic differences in experts’ recommendations. Our results suggest that policy advice is related to an expert’s personal and country-level attributes. Country-level characteristics, especially credit default swaps as a measure of fiscal stability, predict views on whether Greece should exit the eurozone. An expert’s educational background, age and professional affiliation predict opinions on the credit programs of the International Monetary Fund. We propose that policymakers who seek balanced policy advice should consult experts from different countries and personal backgrounds.

F45|Heterogeneity within the euro area: New insights into an old story|We assess cross-country heterogeneity within the eurozone and its evolution over time by measuring the distances between the equilibrium exchange rates’ paths of member countries. These equilibrium paths are derived from the minimization of currency misalignments, by matching real exchange rates with their economic fundamentals. Using cluster and factor analyses, we identify two distinct groups of countries in the run-up to the European Monetary Union (EMU), Greece being clearly an outlier at that time. Comparing the results with more recent periods, we find evidence of rising dissimilarities between these two sets of countries, as well as within the groups themselves. Overall, our findings illustrate the building-up of macroeconomic imbalances within the eurozone before the 2008 crisis and the fragmentation between its member countries that followed.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F45|The Euro Crisis in the Mirror of the EMS|Why was recovery from the euro area crisis delayed for a decade? The explanation lies in the absence of credible and timely policies to backstop financial intermediaries and sovereign debt markets. In this paper we add light and color to this analysis, contrasting recent experience with the 1992-3 crisis in the European Monetary System, when national central banks and treasuries more successfully provided this backstop. In the more recent episode, the incomplete development of the euro area constrained the ability of the ECB and other European institutions to do likewise.
F45|Macroeconomic Effects of Debt Relief: Consumer Bankruptcy Protections in the Great Recession|This paper argues that the debt forgiveness provided by the U.S. consumer bankruptcy system helped stabilize employment levels during the Great Recession. We document that over this period, states with more generous bankruptcy exemptions had significantly smaller declines in non-tradable employment and larger increases in unsecured debt write-downs compared to states with less generous exemptions. We interpret these reduced form estimates as the relative effect of debt relief across states, and develop a general equilibrium model to recover the aggregate employment effect. The model yields three key results. First, substantial nominal rigidities are required to rationalize our reduced form estimates. Second, with monetary policy at the zero lower bound, traded good demand spillovers across states boosted employment everywhere. Finally, the ex-post debt forgiveness provided by the consumer bankruptcy system during the Great Recession increased aggregate employment by almost two percent.
F45|Small Firms and Domestic Bank Dependence in Europe’s Great Recession|The paper studies the role of small businesses (SME) in the transmission of the Eurozone crisis to member countries and whether regions or countries with many SMEs were less able to share risk. Our analysis draws attention to domestic bank dependence—defined as the share of domestic private credit originated by domestic banks—as a key variable modulated the impact of shocks on bankdependent SMEs and thus on the real economy. We argue that Eurozone banking integration in the years after the creation of the single currency was lopsided in the sense that, until 2008, cross-border lending between banks increased markedly while foreign banks’ lending to the real sector stayed relatively flat. Hence, SMEs remained very dependent on domestic banks for credit, in spite of high levels of banking sector integration between Eurozone countries. Our results suggest that domestic bank dependence made countries, regions, and sectors with many SMEs more vulnerable to global banking sector shocks and, at the same time, provided little risk sharing.
F45|Revisiting the Economic Case for Fiscal Union in the Euro Area|Abstract After significant progress as an immediate result of the euro crisis, the drive to complete Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) has decelerated. While there is a broad consensus in Europe that EMU needs further development, the exact nature and timing of the reform agenda remains controversial. This paper makes an analytical contribution to the ongoing discussion about the euro area’s institutional setup. An in-depth look at the remaining gaps in the euro’s architecture, and the trade-offs that repairing them would present, suggests the need for long-run progress along three mutually supportive tracks. The first is more fiscal risk sharing, which will help enhance the credibility of the sovereign “no-bailout” rule. The second is complementary financial sector reforms to delink sovereigns and banks. And the third is more effective rules to discourage moral hazard. Helpfully, this evolution would ensure that financial markets provide more incentives for fiscal discipline than they do now. Introducing more fiscal union comes with myriad legal, technical, operational, and political problems, however, raising questions well beyond the domain of economics. These difficulties notwithstanding, without decisive progress to foster fiscal risk sharing, EMU will continue to face existential risks.
F45|Macroprudential Regulation and Leakage to the Shadow Banking Sector|Macroprudential policies for financial institutions have received increasing prominence since the global financial crisis. These policies are often aimed at the commercial banking sector, while a host of other non-bank financial institutions, or shadow banks, may not fall under their jurisdiction. We study the effects of tightening commercial bank regulation on the shadow banking sector. For this purpose, we develop a DSGE model that differentiates between regulated, monopolistically competitive commercial banks and a shadow banking system that relies on funding in a perfectly competitive market for investments. After estimating the model using euro area data from 1999-2014 including information on shadow banks, we find that tighter capital requirements on commercial banks increase shadow bank lending, which may have adverse financial stability effects. Coordinating the macroprudential tightening with monetary easing can limit this leakage mechanism, while still bringing about the desired reduction in aggregate lending. We discuss how regulators that either do or do not consider credit leakage to shadow banks set policy in response to macroeconomic shocks. Lastly, in a counterfactual analysis, we then compare how a macroprudential policy implemented before the crisis on all financial institutions, or just on commercial banks, would have dampened the leverage cycle.
F45|Did the euro change the nature of FDI flows among member states?|In this paper we investigate the impact of the euro integration process on the drivers of FDI inﬂows. We show theoretically and empirically that the single currency alters the drivers of FDI inﬂows across its Member States. Estimating bilateral gravity models of FDI inﬂows into euro area countries, we show that the euro facilitates intra-euro area vertical FDI ﬂows but reduces incentives for horizontal or market seeking FDI. Instead, horizontal FDI ﬂows stemming from investor countries located outside the monetary union increase. Such ﬂows are however not more likely be directed towards euro area countries with larger domestic markets but rather to countries that are close to large euro area markets and that have higher quality institutions. Overall, these results suggest that while the euro has been beneﬁcial to FDI inﬂows into the monetary union, the impact differs signiﬁcantly across countries. The global ﬁnancial crisis does not change our main ﬁndings. Our results are robust to various economic speciﬁcations. JEL Classification: F21, F23, F45, O43
F45|Financial integration in Europe through the lens of composite indicators|This paper develops composite indicators of financial integration within the euro area for both price-based and quantity-based indicators covering money, bond, equity and banking markets. Prior to aggregation, individual integration indicators are harmonised by applying the probability integral transform. We find that financial integration in Europe increased steadily between 1995 and 2007. The subprime mortgage crisis marked a turning point, bringing about a marked drop in both composite indicators. This fragmentation trend reversed when the European banking union and the ECB's Outright Monetary Transactions Programme were announced in 2012, with financial integration recovering more strongly when measured by price-based indicators. In a growth regression framework, we find that higher financial integration tends to be associated with an increase in per capita real GDP growth in euro area countries. This correlation is found to be stronger the higher a country's growth opportunities. JEL Classification: F36, F43, F45, G01, G15
F45|The Global Multi-Country Model (GM): an Estimated DSGE Model for the Euro Area Countries|This paper presents the European Commission's Global Multi-country model (the GM model). The GM model is an estimated multi-country DSGE model, developed by the European Commission, that can be used for spillover analysis, forecasting and medium term projections. Its development is jointly performed by the Joint Research Centre and DG ECFIN. Since the GM model is developed to be flexible under different country configurations,we present the GM model in its configuration designed for EMU-countries (GM3-EMU), which has been estimated for the four largest European economies (Germany, France, Italy and Spain). We analyse business cycle properties, present the model fit and provide a quantitative assessment of the relative importance that supply, demand and international shocks as well as discretionary policy interventions had in explaining the cyclical patterns observed in each country since the establishment of the EMU.
F45|Liquidity Funding Shocks: the Role of Banks’ Funding Mix|Abstract This study attempts to evaluate the impact of an increase in banks’ funding stress and its transmission to the real economy, taking into account different funding sources banks can rely on. Using aggregate data from eight Euro area financial systems, we find that following a liquidity funding shock, both credit and GDP decline in different amounts and lengths. GDP reverts faster than credit. Furthermore, periphery countries experience a more pronounced fall in deposits and credit growth and the negative effects from the shock last longer than in core countries. Banks’ funding seems to play a relevant role as periphery countries rely more on wholesale funding during normal times.

F45|The Transmission of Business Cycles: Lessons From the 2004 Enlargement and the Euro Adoption|This paper evaluates macroeconomic interdependencies of seven Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) with the Euro Area (EA) through trade relationship. We estimate a near-VAR model and we simulate responses of activity in those CEECs to output shocks for twelve former members of the EA before and after the 2004 enlargement of the European Union (EU). During both periods, empirical results show that spillover effects come through the main economies of the EA: Germany, France and Italy. Furthermore, CEECs are more responsive to output shocks in the EA after 2004 than before (3.3 times larger on average). Increases in spillover effects are larger for the three CEECs that adopted the Euro early (Slovenia, Slovakia, and Estonia) than the other CEECs (4.9 versus 2.1) but without higher trade intensity with the EA (1.07 versus 1.12). Our results show that trade effects are positive inside the same currency area but negative for the CEECs without the euro. JEL Classifications: F13, F15, F45
F45|Heterogeneity, Rigidity and Convergence of Labor Markets in the Euro Area|This paper investigates the welfare consequences of labor market convergence reforms for a large range of calibrations in a two-country monetary union DSGE model with search and matching frictions. The model features trade in consumption and investment goods, price stickiness, firing costs and is calibrated to reflect the structural asymmetries of flexible and rigid countries of the Euro Area in terms of size and labor market variables. Across steady states, convergence brings welfare gains for the rigid country and welfare losses for the flexible country in most situations. The higher the flexibility induced by the convergence, the higher the gains for the rigid country and the lower the losses for the flexible country. Taking into account the transition path brings results that are qualitatively similar, but have a lower magnitude in terms of welfare gains/losses. Indeed, wage bargaining has a short-term negative impact on the rigid country and a short-term positive impact on the flexible country. As such, I conclude that convergence in labor markets can lead to substantial welfare gains in a monetary union, but only if the implementation is carefully designed.
F45|Public Support for the Euro and Trust in the ECB: The first two decades of the common currency|This paper examines the evolution of public support for the euro since its introduction as a virtual currency in 1999, using a unique set of data not available for any other currency. We focus on the role of economic factors in determining the popularity of the euro. We find that a majority of citizens support the euro in each individual member country of the euro area (EA). The economic crisis in the EA following the Great Recession led to a slight decline in public support, but the recent economic recovery has strengthened that support, which is now approaching historically high levels after two decades of its existence. We detect a similar, but less pronounced upturn in trust in the ECB during the recovery. Our econometric work demonstrates that unemployment is a key driver of support behind the euro. Given these developments, we discuss whether the large and persistent majority support enjoyed by the euro equips the currency to weather populist challenges during its third decade.
F45|The Third Round of the Euro Area Enlargement: Are the Candidates Ready?|In this paper, we study the readiness of Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania to adopt the common monetary policy of the ECB in the context of the third round of euro area enlargement. Following the later stages of the optimal currency area (OCA) theory we focus on the coherence of economic shocks between candidate countries and the euro area and analyse the relevance of euro area shocks for key macroeconomic variables in these countries. Our results, based on a novel empirical approach, show that the overall importance of those shocks that are relevant for the ECB is fairly similar in candidate countries and the euro area. The cost of joining the euro area should, therefore, not be pronounced, at least from the aspect of the adoption of the common counter-cyclical monetary policy. This conclusion holds for all three candidates, despite important differences in monetary and exchange rate regimes.
F45|The euro at twenty: Follies of youth?|This paper overviews the early history of the euro and argues that the euro was suboptimally designed, without monetary sovereignty of Eurozone (EZ) Member States, in order to comply with political goals set by wealthier Member States. Given this constraint, the euro architects designed a single currency in which its irreversibility is achieved through the EZ banking system, with recourse to the TARGET2 payment system. This allowed the banking systems of deficit Member States to fund large cumulative current account deficits in the first decade of the euro. The euro crisis led EZ policy makers to define new far more demanding fiscal rules and a new Banking Union to constrain the ability of EZ banking systems to fund sovereigns and current account deficits. Thus, the euro at twenty has become more fragile.
F45|On the Design of Empirical Stock-Flow-Consistent Models|While the literature on theoretical macroeconomic models adopting the stock-flow-consistent (SFC) approach is flourishing, few contributions cover the methodology for building a SFC empirical model for a whole country. Most contributions simply try to feed national accounting data into a theoretical model inspired by Wynne Godley and Marc Lavoie (2007), albeit with different degrees of complexity. In this paper we argue instead that the structure of an empirical SFC model should start from a careful analysis of the specificities of a country's sectoral balance sheets and flow of funds data, given the relevant research question to be addressed. We illustrate our arguments with examples for Greece, Italy, and Ecuador. We also provide some suggestions on how to consistently use the financial and nonfinancial accounts of institutional sectors, showing the link between SFC accounting structures and national accounting rules.
F45|Fiscal Stabilization in the United States: Lessons for Monetary Unions|The debate about the use of fiscal instruments for macroeconomic stabilization has regained prominence in the aftermath of the Great Recession, and the experience of a monetary union equipped with fiscal shock absorbers, such as the United States, has often been a reference. This paper enhances our knowledge about the degree of macroeconomic stabilization achieved in the United States through the federal budget, providing a detailed breakdown of the different channels. In particular, we investigate the relative importance and stabilization impact of the federal system of unemployment benefits and of its extension as a response to the Great Recession. The analysis shows that in the United States, corporate income taxes collected at the federal level are the single most efficient instrument for providing stabilization, given that even with a smaller size than other instruments they can provide important effects, mainly against common shocks. On the other hand, Social Security benefits and personal income taxes have a greater role in stabilizing asymmetric shocks. A federal system of unemployment insurance, then, can play an important stabilization role, in particular when enhanced by a discretionary program of extended benefits in the event of a large shock, like the Great Recession.
F45|Measuring Redenomination Risks in the Euro Area - New Evidence from Survey Data|This article introduces a new indicator to measure redenomination risks in Euro area countries. The measure is based on survey data. The influence of this indicator in determining sovereign bond yield spreads is tested using an ARDL-approach. The results for ten EMU countries in the period June 2012 to January 2018 show that the risk of a depreciation is almost abandoned for Euro area countries, i.e. the former crisis countries Ireland and Portugal. If anything an appreciation may occur for some countries once they leave the EMU. The only countries facing depreciation problems once leaving the monetary union are Italy and to some extent Spain.

Rechtsnormen und Zahlen werden ungenau und missverständlich wiedergegeben, Kausalzusammenhänge werden nicht belegt. Der Begriff des „Target-Kredits“ vermengt volkswirtschaftliche und einzelwirtschaftliche Vorstellungen auf unzulässige Weise und ist analytisch unbrauchbar. Dass die Deutsche Bundesbank in ihrem operativen Geschäft nicht selbständig agiert, wird verdrängt. Eine inhaltliche Auseinandersetzung mit den Aufgaben der Zentralbank fehlt weitgehend.

F45|Regional Effects of Exchange Rate Fluctuations|We exploit differences across U.S. states in terms of their exposure to trade to study the effects of changes in the exchange rate on economic activity at the business cycle frequency. We find that a depreciation in the state-specific trade-weighted real exchange rate is associated with an increase in exports, a decline in unemployment and an increase in hours worked. The effect is particularly strong in periods of economic slack. We develop a multi-region model with inter-state trade and labor flows and calibrate it to match the state-level orientation of exports and the extent of labor migration and trade between states. The model replicates the relationship between exchange rates and unemployment. Counterfactuals show that the high degree of interstate trade plays a dominant role in transmitting shocks across states in the first year, whereas interstate migration shapes cross-sectional patterns in following years. The model suggests that a 25% Chinese import tariff on U.S. goods would be felt throughout the United States, even in states with small direct linkages to China, raising unemployment rates by 0.2 to 0.7 percentage points in the short run.
F45|EMU-Risk Synchronisation and Financial Fragility Through the Prism of Dynamic Connectedness|This study employs dynamic connectedness as a measure of financial risk synchronisation considering government bond yields in 11 EMU member states. In particular, large values of the relevant index can be an indication of comparable levels of risk further implying that the common currency area consists of a financially sensible set of countries. By contrast, small connectedness values can be an indication of fragmentation whereupon certain countries are considered to be safer than others. The latter would be detrimental for the EMU as it fuels financial fragility, which practically stipulates that crises occur as a result of self-fulfilling market fears. The results are based on a daily dataset which spans between 1st September 2003 and 31st August 2018. Findings show that fragmentation was present at the height of the European sovereign debt crisis and that the interconnectedness has not yet reverted to its pre-2009 levels. In addition, core countries appear to transmit shocks to periphery countries although, occasionally, there are noteworthy disparities. Further investigating these disparities on a pairwise connectedness level - which helps to identify sensible pairs of countries in terms of financial risk - shows that core countries dominate this exercise, with the exception of the bilateral relation between Italy and Spain. The fact that most periphery countries of our sample are not included in these pairs raises concerns and calls for a more substantial integration.
F45|On a low-competitiveness country joining the Eurozone: Are there lessons from Greece?|Seven remaining states are presently on the Eurozone’s enlargement agenda: Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Sweden. Except Sweden, all these countries tend to have low competitiveness not only relative to Germany but also to most of the Eurozone countries (especially, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands). For countries adopting the euro, issues of political economy may have a decisive effect on the eventual outcome and largely determine their economic prospects within the Eurozone. The Greek experience shows that the intensity of partisan strife is certainly an important element to be taken into account in a far from easy assessment of how entry will likely affect the country's economic progress. The crucial issue that needs to be considered is whether entry will improve or worsen the prospects for a substantial gain in competitiveness. It is the assessment of how entry will affect the forces favoring reforms relative to those opposing them that should ultimately determine the decision to opt for early or delayed entry.
F45|(A)-symétrie des cycles économiques dans la Communauté Economique des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (CEDEAO)<BR>[(A) -Symmetry of business cycles in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)]|L’asymétrie des cycles constitue un obstacle majeur à la viabilité des unions monétaires. C’est pourquoi le présent article s’intéresse à la convergence des cycles économiques en Afrique de l’Ouest au regard de la volonté des Chefs d’Etat de la CEDEAO de créer une monnaie unique. Pour cela, l’article utilise une mesure de synchronicité et de similarité permettant d’analyser l’asymétrie des cycles. L’article est novateur car il vient pallier les limites liées à l’identification des chocs spécifiques issue des modèles vectoriels. En outre, la méthodologie utilisée permet de savoir comment l’asymétrie des cycles économiques varie période par période plutôt que d'être mesurée comme un seul coefficient de corrélation sur toute la période d'étude. Enfin, l’étude tient compte des changements au fur et à mesure que les pays maintiennent ou transforment leurs régimes monétaires. Les résultats montrent un faible degré de synchronicité et de similarité dans la zone. De plus, les résultats indiquent que l’entrée du Mali et de la Guinée-Bissau dans l’Union Economique et Monétaire Ouest Africaine (UEMOA) n’a pas accru leurs degrés de synchronisation et de similarité. Enfin, les résultats montrent que le Nigéria n’est pas responsable du faible degré de symétrie dans la zone.
F45|Heterogeneous effects of single monetary policy on unemployment rates in the largest EMU economies|This paper studies the effects of monetary policy on the national rates of unemployment in Germany, France, Italy and Spain, the four largest economies of the European Monetary Union (EMU), since the introduction of the euro in 1999 and before and after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007-09. Estimating and simulating a version of a canonical medium-scale New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with indivisible labor that incorporates unemployment developed by Galí, Smets and Wouters (2012), the paper compares the relative importance of monetary policy shocks, risk premium shocks, wage markup shocks and labor supply shocks and studies their effects on other labor market variables, such as labor force participation and real wages. We find that the same monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) has had heterogeneous effects on unemployment rates and other labor market variables in these four major EMU economies. Moreover, in all of them monetary policy shocks are the second largest source of unemployment rate variability in the short, medium and long run, only preceded by risk premium shocks. Our results also confirm that the post-GFC zero lower bound environment has rendered ECB's interest rate policy much less powerful in affecting EMU unemployment rates. In addition to the heterogeneity documented in the effects of monetary policy along various labor market dimensions across the countries in our sample, we also reveal that the EMU economies are, further, characterized by important differences along these dimensions with respect to the United States (US).
F45|Oil price shocks, monetary policy and current account imbalances within a currency union|For more than two decades now, current-account imbalances are a crucial issue in the international policy debate as they threaten the stability of the world economy. More recently, the government debt crisis of the European Union shows that internal current account imbalances inside a currency union may also add to these risks. Oil price fluctuations and a contracting monetary policy that reacts on oil prices, previously discussed to affect the current account may also be a threat to the currency union by changing internal imbalances. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the impact of oil price shocks on current account imbalances within a currency union. Differences in institutions, especially labor market institutions and trade result in an asymmetric reaction to an otherwise symmetric shock. In this context, we show that oil price shocks can have a long-lasting impact on internal balances, as the exchange rate adjustment mechanism is not available. The common monetary policy authority, however, can reduce such effects by specifying an optimum monetary policy target. Nevertheless, we also show that there is no single best solution. CPI, core CPI or an asymmetric CPI target all come at a cost either regarding an increase in unemployment or increasing imbalances.

It also enjoys the support of majority of the euro area population and is seen as a good thing for the European Union.

F45|Euro Area Accession and its Effect on Manufacturing|A single currency could bring both benefits and challenges, hence, this paper examines one of the various dimensions of euro adoption. Moreover, although previous studies have illuminated the euro effect on inflation and trade, the research on manufacturing remains limited. The paper aims to make an assessment of whether euro area accession has an impact on industrial output in the context of the manufacturing sector, as this sector is considered to have a crucial role for sustainable economic growth. The research fits a panel regression model for seven-euro area member states from Central and Eastern Europe and covers a 16-year period from 2003 to 2018. The findings suggest that the participation in the monetary union might increase manufacturing turnover for its members.
F45|The Euro at 20: Successes, Problems, Progress and Threats|The euro has had a difficult second decade but the project has still had some important successes. The common currency is popular among the euro area’s citizens, intra-European exchange rate instability has been removed and the ECB has successfully achieved its primary goal of price stability. The single currency’s popularity has made the euro more resilient than many sceptics thought possible twenty years ago. A number of improvements to the architecture of EMU have been implemented in the past decade but serious tensions remain, relating to fiscal capacity, sovereign default and financial stability. To keep the euro together, Europe’s politicians need to make the euro area less crisis-prone and to make it easier for member states to recover from the inevitable cyclical downturns that will happen in the future. The past few years have seen many proposals put forward for future improvements to the economic policy structure underlying the euro. Keeping the euro together may depend on Europe’s politicians agreeing to implement them.
F45|Holding Together what Belongs Together: A Strategy to Counteract Economic Polarisation in Europe|The 2017-2018 economic upswing in the EU only masked the underlying economic polarisation in the bloc, which will again become more evident as the economy continues to cool. What could a European strategy look like that counteracts the existing structural polarisation and thereby strengthens the cohesion of Europe? Based on a new study, this policy brief provides a sketch of policy suggestions on which the European Commission or leaders of EU member countries could take the lead, including Coordinated industrial policy programmes Measures against rising income (and wealth) inequality Institutional reforms of the eurozone Further reforms of the financial sector Efforts to harmonise social and ecological regulation in the EU towards higher common standards Wage and fiscal policies geared towards reducing excessive current account surpluses Measures to counteract tax avoidance by international corporations.
F45|Economic Polarisation in Europe: Causes and Options for Action|"This study discusses the challenges that economic policy-makers in Europe have to cope with, in order to ensure an economically prosperous and institutionally stable community of Member States of the European Union (EU). At the analytical level, we not only document a process of multi-dimensional polarisation of EU countries, but also link the existing economic divergences with a central long-term problem, namely structural polarisation differences in the institutional and legal embedding (e.g. in the areas of tax and corporate law, the labour market or the financial sector) and in technological capabilities are a major driver of divergence in living standards between some Member States. This polarisation, which started even before the financial crisis but has intensified over the last ten years, is due largely to the global and the European ‘race for the best location’. Without coordinated and cooperative intervention by economic policy-makers, a further drifting-apart of economic development paths seems unavoidable. The large differences in the production structures of the EU countries and the resulting highly unequal distribution of technological capabilities are self-reinforcing in nature, and will further intensify polarisation. The present study provides proposals for a coherent European overall strategy that not only addresses existing problems and renders possible the often-promised upward convergence between EU countries, but also provides a potential basis for dealing with key future challenges (such as digitisation, ageing society, climate change or global trade) on the basis of common European objectives. The focus is on safeguarding and expanding European values and institutions, in order to deepen European integration at key points; and thus also to contribute, in the medium to long run, to a transformation of the global economic order from the European side. A central argument is that coordinated measures in various policy areas – especially in wage, monetary, fiscal and industrial policy – are of central importance in creating a long-term successful economic basis for the common European economic and monetary area.

F45|Capital Flows in the Euro Area and TARGET2 Balances|We estimate a panel VAR model for the euro area to quantitatively asses the contribution of the TARGET2 system to the propagation of different types of structural economic shocks as well as to the historical evolution of aggregate economic activity in euro area member countries. Our results suggest that TARGET2 has significantly affected the transmission of capital ow shocks while leaving the macroeconomic responses to other aggregate shocks virtually unaltered. Furthermore, on basis of counterfactual analyses, we find that TARGET2 has contributed substantially to avoid deeper recessions in distressed periphery member countries like Spain, Italy, Ireland and Portugal, while to a smaller degree depressing aggregate economic activity in core member states, such as Germany, the Netherlands and Finland.
F45|Does one size fit all in the Euro Area? Some counterfactual evidence|"This paper examines whether Euro Area countries would have faced a more favorable inflation output variability tradeoff without the Euro. We provide evidence that this claim is true for the periods of the Great Recession and the European Sovereign Debt Crisis. For the Euro Area as a whole, the deterioration of the tradeoff becomes insignificant with Draghi's ""whatever it takes"" announcement onwards. However, a more detailed analysis shows that the detrimental effect of the Euro is more severe and long-lasting for peripheral countries, pointing to structural differences among Euro Area countries as a key element of the detrimental effect of the Euro. We base our results on a novel empirical strategy that, consistently with monetary theory, models the joint determination of the variability of inflation and output conditional on structural supply shocks. Moreover, our findings are robust to potential endogeneity concerns related to adoption of the Euro."
F45|Public Support for the Euro and Trust in the ECB. The First Two Decades of the Common Currency|This chapter examines the evolution of public support for the euro and public trust in the European Central Bank (ECB) during the new currency’s first two decades. Using a unique set of opinion poll data that is not available for any other currency, we find that a majority of citizens in every member country of the euro area (EA) support the euro. The economic crisis in the EA following the Great Recession and the euro crisis led to a slight decline in public support for the euro but a sharp fall in trust in the ECB. The recent economic recovery has strengthened support for the euro as well as trust in the ECB. We suggest that support for the euro as a medium of exchange was not strongly affected by the crisis, while trust in the ECB, as the framer of monetary policy, was measurably weakened by the crisis. Our econometric work demonstrates that unemployment is a key driver of support for the euro and its governance. Given these developments, we discuss whether the present levels of support for the euro equip the currency to weather populist challenges in the coming decade.
F45|The Corporate Saving Glut and the Current Account in Germany|We investigate for Germany the positive correlation between the corporate savings glut in the non-financial corporate sector and the current account surplus from a capital account perspective. By employing sign restrictions our findings suggest that mostly labor market, world demand and financial friction shocks can account for the joint dynamics of excess corporate savings and the current account surplus. Private savings shocks, in contrast, cannot explain the correlation. We conclude that a corporate savings glut is a main driver of the current account surplus.
F45|Fiscal transfers in a monetary union with sovereign risk|This paper investigates the welfare and economic stabilization properties of a fiscal transfers scheme between members of a monetary union subject to sovereign spread shocks. The scheme, which consists of cross-country transfer rules triggered when sovereign spreads widen, is incorporated in a two-country model with financial frictions. In particular, banks hold government bonds in their portfolios, being exposed to sovereign risk. When this increases, a drop bank’s equity value forces them to contract credit and to raise lending rates at the same time as they retain funds to build up their net worth. I show that, when domestic fiscal policy is not distortionary, fiscal transfers improve welfare and macroeconomic stability. This is because fiscal transfers can reduce banks’ exposure to government debt, freeing credit supply to the private sector. On the contrary, when domestic fiscal policy is distortionary, fiscal transfers cause welfare losses, despite stabilizing the economy. This result arises because the distortions caused by funding the scheme outweigh the positive effects of fiscal transfers in smoothing the adjustment of the economy hit by the shock.
F45|Risk perceptions and fundamental effects on sovereign spreads|We examine the determinants of spreads based on views regarding sovereign riskiness. The empirical analysis relies on panel data estimation techniques for 30 sovereign bonds for the period of 2009Q1 to 2017Q1, with data in quarterly frequency. We find that indeed there is a wide asymmetry in the effects exercised by sovereign spreads’ determinants, which is related to the riskiness of the sovereign. Low-risk spreads are found to be more sensitive to the prospects of higher growth rates and inflation; high-risk spreads are found to be more sensitive to idiosyncratic volatility and global volatility. Also, our results indicate that primary surpluses indeed lower spreads, but this reduction is not strong enough to ‘shield’ the sovereign against volatility; thus, policy makers should avoid ‘noise’ that may undermine investor confidence by increasing idiosyncratic volatility.
F45|One money, many markets: a factor model approach to monetary policy in the Euro Area with high-frequency identification|We reconsider the effects of common monetary policy shocks across countries in the euro area, using a data-rich factor model and identifying shocks with high-frequency surprises around policy announcements. We show that the degree of heterogeneity in the response to shocks, while being low in financial variables and output, is significant in consumption, consumer prices and macro variables related to the labour and housing markets. Mirroring country-specific institutional and market differences, we find that home ownership rates are significantly correlated with the strength of the housing channel in monetary policy transmission. We document a high dispersion in the response to shocks of house prices and rents and show that, similar to responses in the US, these variables tend to move in different directions.
F45|Debt Sustainability and the Terms of Official Support|We study theoretically and quantitatively how official lending regimes affect a government's decision to raise saving as opposed to defaulting, and its implication for sovereign bond pricing by investors. We reconsider debt sustainability in the face of both output and rollover risk under two types of institutional bailouts: one based on long-maturity, low-spread loans similar to the ones offered by the euro area official lenders; the other, on shorter maturity and high-spread loans, close to the International Monetary Fund standards. We show that official lending regimes raise the stock of safe debt and facilitate consumption smoothing through debt reduction. However, to the extent that bailouts translates into higher future debt stocks and countercyclical deficits in persistent recessions, they also have countervailing effects on sustainability. As a result, the effect of official loans is nonlinear in their size. As the threshold for safe debt rises, the maximum debt level the country finds it optimal to sustain when markets price rollover risk falls. This result unveils a fundamental trade-off in the provision of official loans, in turn rooted in a basic form of moral hazard. Quantitatively, the model is able to replicate Portuguese debt and spread dynamics in the years of the bailout after 2011. We show that, depending on the composition of debt by maturity and official lending, sustainable debt levels can vary between 50% of GDP and 180% of GDP depending on the state of the economy and the conditions for market access. Longer maturities have a stronger effect on sustainability than lower spreads.
F45|Labor Tax Reforms, Cross-Country Coordination, and the Monetary Policy Stance in the Euro Area: A Structural Model-Based Approach|We evaluate the effects of permanently reducing labor tax rates in the euro area (EA) by simulating a large-scale openeconomy dynamic general equilibrium model. The model features the EA as a monetary union, split into two regions (home and the rest of the EA, or REA), the United States, and the rest of the world, region-specific labor markets with search and matching frictions, and public employment. Our results are as follows. First, a permanent reduction in labor tax rates in the home region would have stimulating effects on domestic economic activity and employment. Second, reducing labor tax rates simultaneously in both home and REA would have additional expansionary effects on the home region. Third, the short-run macroeconomic effectiveness of the EAwide tax reduction is enhanced if the EA monetary policy is accommodating.
F45|Speculative Eurozone Attacks and Departure Strategies|This article shows that the eurozone payment system does not effectively protect member states from speculative attacks. Suspicion of a departure from the common currency induces a terminal outflow of central bank money in weaker member states. TARGET2 cannot inhibit this drain but only protects central bank assets. Evidence presented here suggests that a run on Italy is already on the way. The article also considers departure strategies of strong and weak member states and the distributive effects of an orderly eurozone dissolution. (JEL codes: E52, E58, and F45)
F45|One Money, Many Markets|We reconsider the effects of common monetary policy shocks across countries in the euro area, using a data-rich factor model and identifying shocks with high-frequency surprises around policy announcements.

F45|Economic Integration and the Non-tradable Sector: The European Experience|From the introduction of the Euro up to the 2008 global financial crisis, macroeconomic imbalances widened among Member States. This divergence took the form of strong differences in the dynamics of unit labor costs. This paper asks why this happened. Is it the result of distortionary public spending, or the consequence of economic integration? To answer this question, this paper builds a theoretical framework that is able to provide a decomposition of unit labor costs growth into various effects of economic integration and policy intervention. Using a novel dataset, it then measures the contribution of each effect to the dynamics of unit labor costs in 12 countries of the Euro area from 1995 to 2014. Results show that trade and financial integration are significant drivers of unit labor costs divergence. Before the global financial crisis, in Greece and Portugal for example, trade and financial integration explain up to 20% of the increase in unit labor costs relative to core countries. On the contrary, distortionary public spending plays a minor role.
F45|Independent Monetary Policy Versus a Common Currency: A Macroeconomic Analysis for the Czech Republic Through the Lens of an Applied DSGE Model|The goal of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the macroeconomic costs and benefits of euro adoption by the Czech economy through the lens of the CNB's official structural macroeconomic model - called g3. To do so, we perform simulations using the g3 model and a modification thereof with a fixed nominal exchange rate and with the policy rate given by the ECB. First, we compare the unconditional volatilities of selected macro variables implied by the two models. Second, we use the g3 model to filter the historical data to identify the structural shocks that affected the Czech economy in the past ten years, and we then use the modified model to simulate the counterfactual outcome of what would have happened to the Czech economy if the euro had been adopted in the past. Our results indicate that euro adoption would have had positive effects on the levels of macroeconomic variables at the cost of an increase in nominal volatility.
F45|The Term Structure of Redenomination Risk|This paper assesses redenomination risk in the euro area. We first estimate daily default-risk-free yield curves for French, German, and Italian bonds that can be redenominated and for bonds that cannot. Then, we extract the compensation for redenomination risk from the yield spreads between these two types of bonds. Redenomination risk primarily shows up at the short end of yield curves. At the height of the euro crisis, spreads between first-year yields were close to 7% for Italy and up to -2% for Germany. The ECB's interventions designed to reduce the risk of a breakup successfully did so for Italy, but increased it for France and Germany.
F45|Sovereign Default in a Monetary Union|In the aftermath of the global fi nancial crisis, sovereign default risk and the zero lower bound have limited the ability of policy-makers in the European monetary union to achieve their stabilization objective. This paper investigates the interaction between sovereign default risk and the conduct of monetary policy, when borrowers can act strategically and they share with their lenders a single currency in a monetary union. We address this question in an endogenous sovereign default model of heterogeneous countries in a monetary union, where the monetary authority may be constrained by the zero lower bound. We uncover three main results. First, in normal times, debtors have a stronger incentive to default to induce more expansionary monetary policy. Second, the zero lower bound, or constraints on monetary policy, may act as a disciplining device to enforce repayment of sovereign debt. Third, sovereign default risk induces countries with a preference for tight monetary policy to accept a laxer policy stance. These results help to shed light on the recent European experience of high default risk, expansionary monetary policy and low nominal interest rates.
F45|Financial and Fiscal Interaction in the Euro Area Crisis : This Time was Different|This paper highlights the anomalous characteristics of the Euro Area `twin crises' by contrasting the aggregate macroeconomic dynamics in the period 2009-2013 with the business cycle fluctuations of the previous decades. We report three stylised facts. First, the contraction in output was marked by an anomalous downfall in investment, while consumption, savings and unemployment followed their historical relation with GDP. Second, households and financial corporations debts, and house prices deviated from their pre-crisis trends. Third, the jump in the public deficit GDP ratio in 2008-2009 was unprecedented and so was the fiscal consolidation that followed. Our analysis points to the financial nature of the crisis as a likely explanation for these facts. Importantly, the `anomaly' in public deficit is in large part explained by extraordinary measures in support of the financial sector, which show up in the stockflow adjustments and reveal a key interaction between the fiscal and the financial sectors.
F45|Are banking and capital markets union complements? Evidence from channels of risk sharing in the eurozone|EMU was a major step towards deeper financial integration among member states. However, diversification of equity portfolios remained limited while banking integration surged. We argue that the nature of banking integration is of first-order importance for understanding the patterns and channels of risk sharing. While EMU was associated with the creation of an integrated interbank market, as witnessed by an explosion in cross-border interbank flows, “real” banking integration (in terms of cross-border bank-to-real sector flows or banking-consolidation) remained limited. But we find that real banking integration is associated with more risk sharing, while indirect integration via interbank flows is not. Further, indirect banking integration proved to be highly procyclical, which contributed to the freeze in risk sharing after 2008. Based on this evidence, and a stylized DSGE model that allows us to explain these patterns in the data, we discuss implications for banking union. Our results show that real banking integration and capital market union are complements and robust risk sharing in the EMU requires both.
F45|Debt Sustainability and the Terms of Official Support|We study theoretically and quantitatively how official lending regimes affect a government's decision to raise saving as opposed to defaulting, and its implication for sovereign bond pricing by investors.

Longer maturities have a stronger effect on sustainability than lower spreads.

F45|Fiscal discipline in EMU? Testing the effectiveness of the Excessive Deficit Procedure|The Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP), central to the Stability and Growth Pact, is criticized for both its procyclical effects and - in contrast - a perceived lack of enforcement. To test its actual effects, we construct a real-time database of EDP recommendations and estimate augmented real-time and ex-post fiscal reaction functions for a panel of EMU member states. We find that a 1% of GDP larger EDP recommendation leads to close to 1% of GDP of additional fiscal consolidation plans, and around 0.8% of actual consolidation. For countries in financial support programs we find that, while they did implement substantial consolidation measures, required and delivered consolidation efforts are less connected. Overall, our results suggest that EDP recommendations have substantially shaped euro area fiscal policy, especially in the years 2010-2014, when EDP recommendations were both largest and most frequent.
F45|Macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area: where do we stand?|This occasional paper reviews the macroeconomic developments in the euro area countries over the past 20 years. It analyses the accumulation of macroeconomic imbalances in the first decade of the EMU and their unwinding during the second decade. It shows that while flow imbalances have been corrected to a large extent, stock imbalances persist. The presence of large stock imbalances implies that the adjustment process needs to continue in the years to come. Accordingly, this paper reviews the national responses so far and the importance of well-functioning national economic structures for facilitating the adjustment process within the EMU. It shows that national structural policies are able to stimulate the supply side of the economy, increase adjustment capacity and mitigate the adverse growth effects of high debt and deleveraging. Finally, it gives an overview of the European response to address macroeconomic imbalances, i.e. the establishment of the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP). The MIP has contributed to increasing the general attention given to macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area and to the critical role that structural reforms play in facilitating their adjustment. Looking forward, further steps would appear to be warranted in order to move from greater awareness towards stronger ownership and implementation of reforms. JEL Classification: E02, F45, O52
F45|Beyond spreads: Measuring sovereign market stress in the euro area|We develop a novel composite indicator to measure sovereign bond market stress in the euro area. The indicator integrates yield and liquidity spreads along with volatility into an overall measure of sovereign market stress. An application to the spillover literature suggests that stress mainly originates from a few countries, but that spillover patterns also vary over time.
F45|Financial Heterogeneity and Monetary Union|In this paper, we analyze the business cycle and welfare consequences of monetary union among countries that face heterogeneous financial market frictions. We show that facing financial distress in the absence of devaluation, the firms in financially weak countries countries have an incentive to raise their prices to cope with liquidity shortfalls. At the same time, firms in countries with greater financial slack poach from the customer base of the former countries by undercutting their prices, without internalizing the detrimental effects on union-wide aggregate demand. Thus, a monetary union among countries with heterogeneous degrees of financial frictions may create a tendency toward internal devaluation for core countries with greater financial resources, leading to chronic current account deficits of the peripheral countries. A risk-sharing arrangement between the core and the periphery can potentially undo the distortion brought about by the currency union. However, such risk sharing requires unrealistic amounts of wealth transfers from the core to the periphery. We show that unilateral fiscal devaluation carried out by the peripheral countries can substantially improve the situation not only for themselves but also for the core countries if there exists an important degree of pecuniary externality not internalized by the predatory pricing strategies of individual firms.
F45|On the origin of current account deficits in the Euro area periphery: A DSGE perspective| This paper studies the sources of current account deficits in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain after the introduction of the Euro. I lay out a DSGE model with a rich structure of the external sector and estimate it separately on each periphery country. I show that the model exhibits a solid in-sample-fit across periphery countries and use it to quantitatively assess different explanations concerning the origin of the deficits. The focus thereby lies on the role of interest convergence in the early years of EMU as well as of the nominal appreciation of the Euro after 2001 together with the ECB's capability to prevent the build-up of the deficits and smoothen future current account adjustment processes via a nominal depreciation.
F45|Labor Market Conditions and Geographic Mobility in the Eurozone|Abstract The Eurozone crisis has sparked renewed interest in the literature about optimum currency areas, in particular in the role of labor mobility as a mechanism of adjustment to shocks. We study the response of mobility in the Eurozone to national labor market conditions. We measure mobility by using data on stocks of foreign population by nationality. We find that mobility in the Eurozone is relatively low. It responded to national differences in unemployment during the crisis, but neither to national differences in wages nor to national differences in GDP per capita.
F45|Internal Devaluations and Equilibrium Exchange Rates: New Evidences and Perspectives for the EMU|From the onset of the euro crisis to the Brexit vote, we have witnessed impressive reductions of current account imbalances in peripheral countries of the euro area. These reductions can be the result of either a compression of internal demand or an improvement in external competitiveness. In this paper, we compute exchange rate misalignments within the euro area to assess whether peripheral countries have managed to improve their external competitiveness. After controlling for the reduction of business cycle synchronization within the EMU, we find that peripheral countries have managed to reduce their exchange rate misalignments thanks to internal devaluations. To some extent, these favourable evolutions reflect improvements in external competitiveness. Nevertheless, these gains could only be temporary if peripheral countries do not improve their non-price competitiveness, their trade structures and their international specializations in the long run.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F45|Do Unit Labor Costs Matter? A Decomposition Exercise on European Data|From the introduction of the Euro up to the 2008 global financial crisis, macroeconomic imbalances widened among Member States. This divergence took the form of strong differences in the dynamics of unit labour costs. This paper asks why this happened. Is it the result of distortionary public spending, or the consequence of economic integration? To answer this question, this paper builds a theoretical framework that is able to provide a decomposition of unit labour costs growth into various effects of economic integration and policy intervention. Using a novel dataset, it then measures the contribution of each effect to the dynamics of unit labour costs in 12 countries of the Euro area from 1995 to 2014. Results show that trade and financial integration are significant drivers of unit labour costs divergence. Before the global financial crisis, in Greece and Portugal for example, trade and financial integration explain up to 30% of the increase in unit labour costs relative to core countries. On the contrary, distortionary public spending plays a minor role. These results suggest that, in peripheral economies, increasing unit labour costs reflect more the process of real convergence than fiscal profligacy.
F45|Heterogeneity, Rigidity and Convergence of Labor Markets in the Euro Area|This paper investigates the welfare consequences of labor market convergence reforms for a large range of calibrations in a two-country monetary union DSGE model with search and matching frictions. The model features trade in consumption and investment goods, price stickiness, firing costs and is calibrated to reflect the structural asymmetries of flexible and rigid countries of the Euro Area in terms of size and labor market variables. Across steady states, convergence brings welfare gains for the rigid country and welfare losses for the flexible country in most situations. The higher the flexibility induced by the convergence, the higher the gains for the rigid country and the lower the losses for the flexible country. Taking into account the transition path brings results that are qualitatively similar, but have a lower magnitude in terms of welfare gains/losses. Indeed, wage bargaining has a short-term negative impact on the rigid country and a short-term positive impact on the flexible country. As such, I conclude that convergence in labor markets can lead to substantial welfare gains in a monetary union, but only if the implementation is carefully designed.
F45|Economic convergence and exchange rate misalignments in the European Union|We investigate (i) the characteristics of real economic and price convergence, (ii) the relationship between economic growth (convergence) and real exchange rate (RER) misalignments within the European Union (EU) during the period 1995–2016. In addition to the relative external price level of GDP, we quantified an alternative indicator for the RER: the internal relative price of services to goods, as measured from the expenditure side of GDP. We interpreted RER-misalignments as deviations from levels consistent with levels of economic development among EU countries. Regarding real convergence, the “catching up” of the less developed member states to the more affluent ones within the EU was expressly rapid in terms of relative per capita growth measured at current PPPs; it was less impressive if measured at constant PPPs, and rather modest in terms of relative real GDP-growth. As for price levels and the relative price of services to goods, a rapid convergence could be observed until the international financial crisis, but this process halted in 2008. Using pooled OLS and dynamic panel techniques, we found that within the EU there is a negative relationship between the contemporaneous sign of RER-misalignment (based on both the external price level and internal relative prices) and economic growth: over- (under-) valuations are associated with lower (higher) growth. This is mainly due to developments in countries operating under fixed exchange rate regimes. Our results indicate that the level of development does not influence the strength of the growth-misalignment relationship within the EU. These results are robust to the applied panel estimation method. Regarding the external price level, we find that the positive relationship between undervaluation and growth diminishes with increasing size of undervaluation. The aggregate effect of misalignments is significantly negative on both export market shares and the ratio of gross fixed capital formation to GDP: both the competitiveness and the investment channel play an important role in the relationship between growth and RER misalignments. As an extension, we analyse the relationship between growth and the misalignment of wages from productivity levels; “wage-misalignments” are also negatively associated with economic growth. Although our study carries policy messages – in particular, mild real exchange rate undervaluations are positively, while overvaluations are negatively associated with growth and real economic convergence – the RER is an endogenous variable, which is not under direct policy control. Our results point to the importance of a growth strategy avoiding overvaluation on the one hand, and to the futility of aiming at excessive undervaluation, on the other.
F45|Growth-indexed Bonds and Debt Distribution: Theoretical Benefits and Practical Limits|Sovereign state-contingent bonds, in particular growth-indexed bonds (GIBs), have rarely been issued in practice despite their theoretical benefits. This paper provides support for this apparent sovereign noncontingency puzzle by deriving the impact of GIBs on the upper tail of the distribution of the public debt-to-GDP ratio. Although this impact varies importantly across countries and indexation formulas, empirical estimates show there is almost no reduction in the upper tail of the distribution under the realistic assumption that GIBs only represent 20 percent of the stock of debt. Moreover, a sustained premium of 100 basis points would actually increase the upper tail of the distribution for most countries.
F45|Germany in fundamental macroeconomic disequilibrium - the external surplus|Despite performing very positively on some key macroeconomic indicators in recent years, the German economy is in grave disequilibrium if the high current account surplus is included in the analysis. The paper scrutinises the evolution of Germany's external surplus since the inception of the Euro in 1999. This is done by identifying the main determinants of exports and imports and by analysing the accounting identity in which the current account is national saving less total fixed investment. While price competitiveness measured by real exchange rates is strongly improved by German imports for exports within international value chains, also by real undervaluation against other member countries, the focus is on the combination of price- and non-price competitiveness. The latter is mainly determined by the global income elasticity for imports from Germany, relative to the income elasticity for imports to Germany. Despite heavy fluctuations, the past trend shows a clear wedge between the growth of exports and imports of almost one percentage point. If this trend continues the German trade balance would reach 15% of GDP in 2026 which would be a time bomb for the cohesion of the European Monetary Union. Market-based rebalancing is not in sight. It is the built-in dynamics of the external surplus that is hazardous. The problem is aggravated as Germany sits in the same boat with three other hard-core surplus seeking countries (Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg). In recent years the imbalances within EMU have changed, pulling former deficit countries in mild surplus but leaving the diversity of current account balances among EMU members at a spread of 8-10 percentage points, with an external trade surplus of EMU as a whole of 4.5% and 3.5% current account surplus. Germany carries nearly 77% and 55% of the current account and the trade surplus, respectively, and has - far ahead others - become the largest surplus country on the globe, in absolute terms. This constellation is unsustainable and requires policy action in Germany, in the European Union, the Euro Area and also by global authorities.
F45|What went wrong with Italy, and what the country should now fight for in Europe|In this paper we briefly review the evolution of the Italian economy in the post-war period, discussing the shift from a first period when fiscal policy was targeted – among other things – at full employment, to a later period when controlling inflation through a “foreign discipline” became the main policy target. We review critically the literature on the Italian productivity slowdown, suggesting that it neglects the role of aggregate demand, and of labor market reforms, on productivity. Finally, we discuss Eurozone imbalances, suggesting that Eurozone institutions adopt new rules to keep the interest rate low enough to make public debt sustainable, while using fiscal policy to stimulate growth
F45|Structural Change in Times of Increasing Openness|Assessing Path Dependency in European Economic Integration This paper analyses the dynamics of structural polarisation and macroeconomic convergence vs. divergence in the context of European integration, where the latter is understood primarily as an increase in economic and financial openness. In the process of estimating the dynamic effects of openness shocks on 26 EU countries, we develop a taxonomy of European economies that consists of core, periphery, financialised and Eastern European catch-up economies. As these four country groups have responded in a distinct way to the openness shocks imposed by European integration, we argue that the latter should be seen as an evolutionary process that has given rise to different path-dependent developmental trajectories. These trajectories relate to the sectoral development of European economies and the evolution of their technological capabilities. We propose a set of interrelated policy measures to counteract structural polarisation and to promote macroeconomic convergence in Europe.
F45|Adjustment dynamics and business cycle heterogeneity in the EMU: Evidence from estimated DSGE models|The paper reviews adjustment dynamics in the EMU on the basis of estimated DSGE models for four large EA Member States (DE, FR, IT, ES). We compare the response of the four countries to identical shocks and find a particularly strong response of employment and wages in ES, a high sensitivity of IT to investment-related shocks, and a comparatively strong impact of global shocks on the DE economy. We also perform counterfactual exercises that apply the estimated shocks and parameters for ES to DE, FR, and IT. The counterfactual simulations suggest that differences in shocks have been important for GDP growth differentials, and together with structural differences also contributed to differences in employment fluctuations across the four countries considered.
F45|Banks, debt and risk: assessing the spillovers of corporate taxes|Using bank balance sheet data, we find evidence that leverage and asset risk of European multinational banks in the crisis and post-crisis period is affected by corporate taxes in their host country as well as by the tax rates in all the jurisdictions where the banking group operates. Then, we evaluate the effects that establishing tax neutrality between debt and equity finance has on systemic risk. We show that the degree of coordination in implementing the hypothetical tax reform matters. In particular, a coordinated elimination of the tax advantage of debt would significantly reduce systemic losses in the event of a severe banking crisis. By contrast, uncoordinated tax reforms are not equally beneficial. This is because national tax policies generate spillovers through cross-border bank activities and tax-driven strategic allocation of debt and asset risk across group affiliates.
F45|Twenty Years of the German Euro Are More than Enough|This paper reviews the performance of the euro area since the euro's launch 20 years ago. It argues that the euro crisis has exposed existential flaws in the euro regime. Intra-area divergences and the corresponding buildup of imbalances had remained unchecked prior to the crisis. As those imbalances eventually imploded, member states were found to be extremely vulnerable to systemic banking problems and abruptly deteriorating public finances. Debt legacies and high unemployment continue to plague euro crisis countries. Its huge current account surplus highlights that the euro currency union, toiling under the German euro and trying to emulate the German model, has become very vulnerable to global developments. The euro regime is flawed and dysfunctional. Europe has to overcome the German euro. Three reforms are essential to turn the euro into a viable European currency. First, divergences in competitiveness positions must be prevented in future. Second, market integration must go hand in hand with policy integration. Third, the euro is lacking a safe footing for as long as the ECB is missing a federal treasury partner. Therefore, establishing the vital treasury/central bank axis that stands at the center of power in sovereign states is essential.
F45|The behavioral economics of currency unions: Economic integration and monetary policy|Currency unions are often modeled as homogeneous economies, although they are fundamentally different. The expectations that impact macroeconomic behavior in any given country are not the expectations of variables at the currency-union level but at the country level. We model these expectations with a behavioral reinforcement learning model. In our model, economic integration is of particular importance in determining whether economic behavior in a currency union is stable. Monetary policy alone is insufficient to guarantee stable economic behavior, as the central bank cannot conduct different monetary policies in different countries. These results are easily overlooked when modeling expectations as rational.
F45|Equilibrium Real Interest Rates for the BRICS Countries|The equilibrium real interest rate is one of the most discussed variables in economics, although it is unobservable. While it has been estimated with respect to various developed countries, this paper is the first to estimate it for five developing countries - the BRICS countries. To do so the most widely used model in this respect - the Laubach and Williams model - is used. Moreover, the results are compared to the actual real interest rate to give an indication whether e.g. monetary policy was too tight or too loose in certain periods. The results indicate that we indeed have substantial differences between the actual and the equilibrium real interest rate going either way. While for China and India monetary policy tends to be too loose in many periods, thus boosting economic growth even further, the reverse seems to be true with respect to Brazil especially in the late 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s. In Russia and South Africa the actual real rate is mainly in line with the equilibrium one, thus monetary policy is neither to loose nor too tight.
F45|Quantifying the Benefits of Labor Mobility in a Currency Union|Unemployment differentials are bigger in Europe than in the United States. Migration responds to unemployment differentials, though the response is smaller in Europe. Mundell (1961) argued that factor mobility is a precondition for a successful currency union. We use a multi-country DSGE model with cross-border migration and search frictions to quantify the benefits of increased labor mobility in Europe and compare this outcome to a case of fully flexible exchange rates. Labor mobility and flexible exchange rates both work to reduce unemployment and per capita GDP differentials across countries provided that monetary policy is sufficiently responsive to national output.

F45|Stabilising the Euro Area through unemployment benefits re-insurance scheme|The paper examines the possible design and macroeconomic stabilisation properties of a euro area unemployment benefits re-insurance scheme using annual historical data from 2000 to 2016. The scheme we propose is similar in some aspects to the recent proposals, including the IMF’s paper on the central fiscal capacity, while preserving important re-insurance characteristics, such as experience rating and caps on cumulative balances. Counterfactual simulations for individual euro area countries suggest that the scheme, at the cost of average annual contributions of 0.17% of national GDP, could have (i) provided additional macroeconomic stabilisation in the financial crisis of 2009-2013, both at the euro area level and at the level of individual countries hit by the crisis, and (ii) avoided permanent transfers among countries.
F45|Varieties of Capitalism and post-Keynesian economics on Euro crisis|The 2008 global financial crisis that began in the US housing sector mutated into a sovereign debt crisis and an economic depression for countries in southern Europe, threatening the very existence of the Eurozone. The paper contrasts analyses of the eurocrisis based on the Varieties of Capitalism (VoC) approach and post-Keynesian analysis. The VoC analysis has argued that the eurocrisis is ultimately a crisis of incompatible institutional settings, in particular wage bargaining institutions, tied together in a monetary union. The Mediterranean Market Economies lack the institutional capacities to restrain wage growth. The Coordinated Market Economies (in northern Europe) have managed to maintain modest wage growth and inflation because export-oriented sectors play the role of wage leader. Post-Keynesian analysis has interpreted the crisis as the outcome of the unsustainable growth models and neoliberal policies in Europe; i.e. a neo-mercantilist export-led demand regime in the North and a debt-driven demand regime in the South and the EMU policies of financial deregulation that accompanied European economic integration. What is specific to the Euro area is the absence of adequate central fiscal stabilization or effective lender of last resort facility for the member countries. The ECB was hesitant in its unconventional monetary policy and began buying government bonds of countries under pressure only at a late stage of the crises. The imbalances resulted in a full blown sovereign debt crisis. We argue that the VoC analysis has important shortcomings as it focuses excessively on labour market institutions and that the post-Keynesian approach integrates financial factors and economic policy in explaining the crisis.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F45|A fire department for the Euro area: reflections on a fiscal risk-sharing capacity|This essay investigates the necessity of and options for a central fiscal risk-sharing capacity in the Euro area. How can these aims be reconciled with the member countries’ responsibility for sound fiscal policy that also considers constitutional sovereignty, institutional efficiency and economic effectiveness? As a result, such a capacity can be created as an overlay over the existing fiscal framework without treaty changes and can complement it according to the distinct features of the monetary union. A stabilization fund dedicated to investment appears to be the best solution in light of the applied criteria.
F45|Renoncer à la théorie des zones monétaires optimales ?<BR>[Renouncing to the Optimal Currency Aera Theory ?]|Abstract This paper emphasize the 2008 economic crisis in Europe and try to jauge the convenience of the Optimal Currency Area Theory (OCA). First, among the the causes of this crisis one does not see the famous « assymetric chocks » but only the increasing path of desequilibria before the clash, worsened by the Monetary Union itself. Second, on the ajustment side, after the recession, there were some of the adjustment patterns described by the Theory. Nevertheless, they have not conducted the european economies to optimal situations both from the point of view of members (adhesion optimality) and of the entire group (admission optimality).We think that this two kinds of optimality must be validated in case of independant nations joining themselves in a Monetary Union. The OCA Theory is very strongly challenged by the recent european experience.
F45|The Effectiveness of Japan’s Negative Interest Rate Policy|In April 2013, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) introduced an inflation target of 2% with the aim of overcoming deflation and achieving sustainable economic growth. But due to lower international oil prices, it was unable to achieve this target and was forced to take further measures. Hence, in February 2016, the BOJ adopted a negative interest rate policy by massively increasing the money supply through purchasing long-term Japanese government bonds (JGB). The BOJ had previously purchased short-term government bonds mainly, a policy that flattened the yield curve of JGBs. On the one hand, banks reduced the numbers of government bonds because short-term bond yields had become negative, and even the interest rates of long-term government bonds up to 15 years became negative. On the other hand, bank loans to the corporate sector did not increase due to the Japanese economy’s vertical investment–saving (IS) curve. Firstly, we explain why the BOJ has to reduce its 2% inflation target in the present low oil price era. Secondly, we argue that Japan cannot make a sustainable recovery from its long-lasting recession and tackle its long-standing deflation problem by means of its current monetary policy and its negative interest rate policy in particular. It is of key importance to make the IS curve downward sloping rather than vertical. That means the rate of return on investment must be positive and companies must be willing to invest if interest rates are set too low. Japan’s long-term recession is due to structural problems that cannot be solved by its current monetary policy. The last section reports our simulation results of tackling Japan’s aging population by introducing a productivity-based wage rate and postponement of the retirement age, which will help the recovery of the Japanese economy.
F45|Modern financial repression in the euro area crisis: making high public debt sustainable?|The sharp rise in public debt-to-GDP ratios in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008 posed serious challenges for fiscal policy in the euro area countries and culminated for some member states in a sovereign debt crisis. This note examines the public policy responses to the euro area crisis through the lens of financial repression with a particular focus on how they contributed to easing government budget constraints. Financial repression is defined in this context as the government’s strategy – supported by monetary and financial policies – to gain privileged access to capital markets at preferential credit conditions and divert resources to the state with the aim to secure and, if necessary, enforce public debt sustainability. Following a narrative approach, this note finds that public debt management and resolution, European financial legislation, EMU crisis support and ECB monetary policy have significantly contributed to relieving sovereign liquidity and solvency stress and generated fiscal space through non-standard means. The respective authorities have in fact applied the tools of financial repression to restore stability after the euro area crisis.
F45|Equilibrium real interest rates, secular stagnation, and the financial cycle: Empirical evidence for euro-area member countries|Is the Euro area as a whole, or are individual Euro-area member countries facing a period of sustained lower economic growth, a phenomenon known as secular stagnation? We tackle this question by estimating equilibrium real interest rates and comparing them to actual real rates. Since the financial crisis has altered the degree of leverage in several European economies, we expand our model to incorporate the financial cycle. We estimate the model for the Euro area as a whole and for nine Euro-area member countries. Incorporating the financial cycle changes the estimated equilibrium real interest rates: For some Euro-area member countries, estimates of the equilibrium real interest rate are substantially higher than the standard estimates. In other cases, including our estimates for the Euro area as a whole, the estimated equilibrium real rates are slightly lower than without taking the financial cycle into account but are still higher than the actual rates. This indicates that real monetary policy rates were set even more systematically and consistently below (or not as far above) the natural real rate. Comparing the sequence of actual and equilibrium real rates, only Belgium, France, and Greece are likely to face a period of secular stagnation.
F45|Pregatirea României pentru aderarea la Uniunea Europeana|Romania’s lead-up to the accession to the European Union lasted quite a long time (1991-2007). The first steps had been taken by the conclusion and the enforcement of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (1990) and the Association Agreement (1993) which paved the way for the transition to higher forms of cooperation and integration for expanding the domains and improving these forms. An important step for the accession was the negotiation for transposing and implementing the EC legislation in Romania, to be followed by economic, institutional and administrative changes and restructuring, which needed significant efforts. The wish of the majority of the Romanian citizens in favour of the country’s accession to the EU had a positive impact on the European Communities, which offered a substantial aid provided that the new candidate fulfils some requirements for ensuring the political, economic, institutional, legal and administrative compatibilities and all obligations of an EU member. The main actions taken by Romania, by the EU officials and by the EU member countries are presented below.

F45|L'Integration De L'Uemoa Est-Elle Pro-Croissance ?|Economists are divided on the effect of exchange rate regimes on economic growth. In this article we study the particular case of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), which is one of the oldest monetary unions in the world resulting from French colonization. The objective is to study the impact of this integration on the economic growth of the region. To this end, we propose an empirical model of economic growth specific to the zone. We also address the problem of simultaneity bias between integration and growth relying on a gravity-based IV strategy. Our econometric results show that although West African regional integration is one of the most important in Africa, it has not led to significant economic growth in the Union. We propose measures to strengthen community transport infrastructures, which are essential to boost integration and its impact on the growth of We propose a massive investment plan in the community transport infrastructure, which is essential to strengthen integration and its impact on the growth of the area.
F45|Montenegro’s Unilateral Euroization|Unilateral euroization is underexplored even in comparison to unilateral dollarization (taken to mean the adoption of the US dollar as legal tender). This paper attempts to partly fill this gap in the literature by investigating the case of Montenegro, which is one of the two countries that have unilaterally adopted the euro as the legal tender. Montenegro's limited monetary policy options make the nature of business cycles important. The evidence presented here suggests that Montenegro has a low degree of synchronization, limited structural similarity, and weak trade integration with the Eurozone. Moreover, there is limited evidence for endogenous structural assimilation following euroization. The case for currency union is weak for Montenegro and appears to be defensible only on grounds of policy credibility.

F45|Which Structural Reforms Does E(M)U Need to Function Properly?|Structural reform proposals have undergone significant change both as proposed by IMF and OECD as by the European Union. From a narrow flexibility-enhancing (‘liberalising’) focus complementing a strict budget consolidation course, they have evolved towards embracing institutional reforms and promoting of growth and productivity. Some of these reform proposals are motivated by increasing divergence between Member States since the financial crisis, others attempt to compensate for the fact that EMU did not and does not yet constitute an optimal currency area with all its institutions required. This paper analyses the various motivations and restrictions for structural reforms and proposes an even wider array of additional reforms, with the aim to enhance socio-economic-environmental sustainability and well-being in the European Union (‘progressive’ reforms). ‘Progressive reforms’ should establish equivalence between economic, social and environmental objectives. Excessive ‘financialisation’ of the economy should be reversed by promoting longer-term real investment decisions, by slowing financial trading decisions, by increasing capital requirements of financial institutions, by levying financial transactions taxes, etc. Productivity-oriented wage setting and working conditions procedures through collective bargaining covering a wide spectrum of the labour force should be promoted as enhancing workers’ well-being and be balanced with flexibility requirements. Industrial policies aimed at enhancing the innovative capabilities of countries, with appropriate education, patent and innovation interventions need to gain wide-spread acceptance. The ‘race to the bottom’ with respect to corporate and personal income taxation, as well as generous tax-reducing policies need to be prevented. National and regional preferences with respect to social and cultural aspects need to be exempted from competition rules, as manifestations of social cohesion, environmental protection and identity-preserving heritage. In cases where cross-country spillovers matter, such ‘progressive’ structural policies should be set as general framework conditions by the European Union but be adjusted and implemented by the Member States.
F45|Structual change in times of increasing openness|This paper analyzes the dynamics of structural polarization and macroeconomic divergence in the context of European integration, where the latter is understood primarily as an increase in economic and financial openness. In the process of estimating the dynamic effects of such an openness shock on 26 EU countries, we develop a taxonomy of European economies that consists of core, periphery and catching-up countries, as well as financial hubs. We show that these four country groups have responded in a distinct way to the openness shock imposed by European integration and argue that the latter should be seen as an evolutionary process that has given rise to different path-dependent developmental trajectories. These trajectories relate to the sectoral development of European economies and the evolution of their technological capabilities. We propose a set of interrelated policy measures to counteract structural polarization and to promote macroeconomic convergence in Europe.
F45|What Explains Austria’s Export Market Performance?|This paper analyses Austria’s export market performance by exploring four channels that can impact on exports a) cost competitiveness, b) ties to trading partners through their demand for import goods, c) global investment demand, and d) offshoring of goods production. By using cointegration analysis and error corrections, we estimate an export model based on quarterly data over the time period 1997-2016. The main results underscore that it is not only price competitiveness that inﬂuences Austria’s export performance, as global export demand and trading partners’ demand for capital goods are shown to have a signiﬁcant long-run impact on Austrian goods exports. Cost competitiveness does play a role in determining export market performance, but over the last twenty years the relative contributions of changes in the real effective exchange rate based on unit labour costs to export growth are shown to be relatively small. While Austria’s international competitiveness has only recorded small variations since the ﬁnancial crisis, this paper provides evidence that lower export growth and the falling global export market share of goods since 2007 largely reﬂect relatively weak economic activity of many of Austria’s important trading partners including Eastern Europe.
F45|Financial and Fiscal Interaction in the Euro Area Crisis: This Time was Different|This paper highlights the anomalous characteristics of the Euro Area `twin crises' by contrasting the aggregate macroeconomic dynamics in the period 2009-2013 with the business cycle fluctuations of the previous decades. We report three stylised facts. First, the contraction in output was marked by an anomalous downfall in investment, while consumption, savings and unemployment followed their historical relation with GDP. Second, households' and financial corporations' debts, and house prices deviated from their pre-crisis trends. Third, the jump in the public deficit-GDP ratio in 2008-2009 was unprecedented and so was the fiscal consolidation that followed. Our analysis points to the financial nature of the crisis as a likely explanation for these facts. Importantly, the `anomaly' in public deficit is in large part explained by extraordinary measures in support of the financial sector, which show up in the stock-flow adjustments and reveal a key interaction between the fiscal and the financial sectors.
F45|Fiscal Deficits as a Source of Boom and Bust under a Common Currency|We investigate in depth, using predominantly analytical, rather than numerical, methods, the mechanisms which operate following a one-period, debt-financed, fiscal deficit in a small open economy operating under a common currency. The economy incorporates the New Keynesian features of staggered price setting and overlapping generations. Unsurprisingly, these features cause the impact effect to be a boom, in the sense of a positive output gap. However we also find that the boom must later turn into a bust, or negative output gap. Moreover inflation also follows a boom-bust pattern and on average there is deflation rather than inflation.
F45|Product market integration in the Euro area|The goal of this paper is to determine if the euro area (EA) accession and membership had a significant impact on the product market integration in the EA countries. The paper employs LM and RALS-LM unit root tests with two breaks on the seasonally adjusted monthly Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), from 1996:01 to 2017:05. We find EA-accession related breaks in most of the EA11 countries, but, apart from Malta, no such breaks for the later-EA-joiners. However, EA formation had a significant impact on both EA and non-EA countries at that time. We also find greater product market integration and less adverse effects after negative shocks in the EA member countries. However, based on unit root analysis, we find that EA membership in not a sufficient condition for product market integration and integration is not necessarily related to being an EA member.

F45|Real exchange rate dynamics in New-Keynesian models – The Balassa-Samuelson effect revisited|This paper explores the Balassa-Samuelson effect in a New-Keynesian DSGE model of a monetary union with traded and non-traded goods. Credible sets for theoretical impulse response functions show that a model with perfect intersectoral labour mobility is unable to reproduce an appreciation of the real exchange rate caused by higher productivity in the traded sector. Allowing for imperfect intersectoral labour mobility resolves this obstacle and delivers testable restrictions for model parameters governing the labour market specification in a Bayesian estimation context.
F45|The Role of Shadow Banking for Financial Regulation|Macroprudential policies for financial institutions have received increasing prominence since the global financial crisis. These policies are often aimed at the commercial banking sector, while a host of other non-bank financial institutions, or shadow banks, may not fall under their jurisdiction. We study the effects of tightening commercial bank regulation on the shadow banking sector. For this purpose, we develop a DSGE model that differentiates between regulated, monopolistically competitive commercial banks and a shadow banking system that relies on funding in a perfectly competitive market for investments. After estimating the model using euro area data from 1999 – 2014 including information on shadow banks, we find that tighter capital requirements on commercial banks increase shadow bank lending, which may have adverse financial stability effects. In a counterfactual analysis we compare how a macroprudential policy implemented before the crisis on all financial institutions, or just on commercial banks, would have dampened the leverage cycle.
F45|Capital Flows in the Euro Area and TARGET2 Balances|We estimate a panel VAR model for the euro area to quantitatively assess the contribution of the TARGET2 system to the propagation of different types of structural economic shocks as well as to the historical evolution of aggregate economic activity in euro area member countries. Our results suggest that TARGET2 has significantly affected the transmission of capital flow shocks while leaving the macroeconomic responses to other aggregate shocks virtually unaltered. Furthermore, on basis of counterfactual analyses, we find that TARGET2 has contributed substantially to avoid deeper recessions in distressed periphery member countries like Spain, Italy, Ireland and Portugal, while to a smaller degree depressing aggregate economic activity in core member states, such as Germany, the Netherlands and Finland.
F45|Are Banking and Capital Markets Union Complements? Evidence from Channels of Risk Sharing in the Eurozone|"The interplay of equity market and banking integration is of first-order importance for risk sharing in the EMU. While EMU created an integrated interbank market, ""direct'' banking integration (in terms of direct cross-border bank-to-real sector flows or cross-border banking-consolidation) and equity market integration remained limited. We find that direct banking integration is associated with more risk sharing, while interbank integration is not. Further, interbank integration proved to be highly procyclical, which contributed to the freeze in risk sharing after 2008. Based on this evidence, and a stylized DSGE model, we discuss implications for banking union. Our results show that real banking integration and capital market union are complements and robust risk sharing in the EMU requires both."
F45|Yields on sovereign debt, fragmentation and monetary policy transmission in the euro area: A GVAR approach|The divergence in sovereign yields has been presented as a reason for the lack of traction of monetary policy. We use a GVAR framework to assess the transmission of monetary policy in the period 2005-2016. We identify sovereign yield divergence as a key mechanism by which the leverage channel of monetary policy worked. Unconventional monetary policy was successful in mitigating this effect. When exploring the channels through which yields may affect the heterogeneous transmission of monetary policy, we find that the reaction of bank leverage depended substantially on where the sovereign yield originated, thus providing a mechanism that explains this heterogeneity. Second, large spillover effects meant that yield divergence decreased the traction of monetary policy even in anchor countries. Third, the heterogeneity in the transmission mechanism can be in part attributed to contagion from euro area wide sovereign stress. Fiscal credibility, therefore, may be an appropriate tool to enhance the output effect of monetary policy. Given the importance of spillovers, this credibility may be achieved by changes in the institutional make up and policies in the euro area.
F45|Currency unions and heterogeneous trade effects: the case of the latin monetary union|The Latin Monetary Union (LMU) agreement signed in December 1865 by France, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland standardised gold and silver coinage in member countries and allowed free circulation of national coins in the Union. In his seminal study, Flandreau (2000) found no evidence of an overall positive effect of the LMU on trade. In this paper, I estimate the effects of this currency agreement on trade. In my gravity model I explicitly take into account the changing conditions in the international environment that affected the LMU’s underlying economic foundations (i.e. the limits on silver coinage agreed upon in 1874) and its rules (i.e. the “liquidation clause” of 1885). I also test the existence of heterogeneous effects on bilateral trade within the LMU. In line with Flandreau, I find no significant LMU trade effects. However, I find support for the hypothesis that the LMU had significant trade effects for the period 1865-1874. These effects were nonetheless concentrated in trade flows between France and the rest of the LMU members, following a hub-and-spokes structure. Moreover, I find evidence for the existence of an 1874 “LMU-wide” structural break, which affected the course of trade flows within the Union.
F45|A new approach to governance and integration in EMU for an optimal use of economic policy framework - priority to financial union|This paper proposes a new approach to EMU governance and integration consisting of the following elements: (i) an optimal use of the existing EU institutional framework for economic, fiscal and financial policies is necessary and possible at each level of EMU integration that is politically feasible, in order to strengthen synergies between stability and growth policies, complete the single market, support public and private investment, and improve macroeconomic and fiscal coordination and surveillance, (ii) priority should be given to financial union which would facilitate the smooth transmission of monetary policy, enhance financial stability and economic growth and contribute to macroeconomic stabilization through private risk sharing, (iii) the drive to fiscal union should be focused on the creation of fiscal backstops to banking union, enhancing its solidity and credibility (iv) initiatives towards deeper EMU integration should be undertaken where there is strong evidence, within the EU and beyond, of their usefulness and for which widespread political support exists, maximizing benefits and avoiding controversial proposals, and (v) institutional strengthening and democratic accountability are indispensable elements for a successful EMU and should be pursued by following the “Community approach”, based on the Treaties, in contrast to the “intergovernmental approach” increasingly used in recent years.
F45|Official Sector Lending Strategies during the Euro Area Crisis|In response to the euro area crisis, European policymakers took a gradual, incremental approach to official lending, at first relying on the approach followed by the International Monetary Fund, then developing their own crisis resolution framework. We review this development, marked by a substantial divergence in the terms of official loans offered to the crisis countries by the IMF and the euro area official lenders. Based on a unique dataset, we use event analysis to assess the impact of changing maturity and spreads of official loans on bond yields, liquidity and market access. In light of the euro area experience, we discuss arguments for rebalancing Debt Sustainability Analysis and programme design in favour of cash-flow management. While the official assistance granted to crisis countries in the euro area may not be replicable elsewhere, key lessons from it could foster a reconsideration of the modalities by which official lending institutions handle crises.
F45|European Fiscal Compact in Action: Can Independent Fiscal Institutions Deliver Effective Oversight?|The paper explores if EU independent fiscal institutions (IFIs) are in a position to exercise effective scrutiny over national fiscal policies. It identifies substantial heterogeneity across IFIs in resources which is not matched by a similar diversity in mandates, and highlights the role of local ownership as a potentially important factor in explaining this. In addition to financial and human resources, better access to information, effective comply-or-explain mechanisms and closer links with legislatures could enhance fiscal scrutiny and accountability in the EU. The paper provides rankings of individual IFIs constructed based on measures that quantitatively aggregate these pre-conditions for effective fiscal scrutiny.
F45|Fiscal Federalism in a Monetary Union: The Cooperation Pitfall|Fiscal federalism may not be a panacea in a monetary union if it does not address the non-cooperative behaviour between fiscal policymakers. To prove this, we assess the relative merits of a fiscal federalism scheme in a monetary union and intergovernmental fiscal cooperation without such a federal authority. Using a standard macroeconomic model commonly used for policy analysis we show that it is impossible to conclude that one solution is always preferable to the other. The benefits from an extra instrument and a policymaker with union-wide objectives may not compensate the adding of a non-cooperative player to the policy game. This result is sustained when an active monetary policy is introduced in the model or when shocks affect the functioning of the economy. The welfare ranking of these two options depends on the cross-border spillover effects, the objectives of policymakers and the variances of shocks.
F45|Exit Strategies, Capital Flight and Speculative Attacks: Europe's Version of the Trilemma|In the winter 2011/12 a wave of internal capital flight prompted the ECB to abandon its exit strategy and to announce an unprecedented monetary expansion. We analyze this episode in several dimensions: (i) by providing an event-study analysis covering key variables from national central banks' balance sheets, (ii) by rationalizing their patterns in a portfolio balance model of the exchange rate, augmented by institutional characteristics of the TARGET2 system, and (iii) by proposing a theory-based index of exchange market pressure within the euro area. We argue that the euro area entails an inherent policy trilemma that makes it prone to speculative attacks.
F45|The Collateral Policy of Central Banks - An Analysis Focusing on the Eurosystem|Die vorliegende Dissertation wurde von Christopher Weber während seiner Tätigkeit als wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter am Center for Economic Studies (CES) an der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) München verfasst. Sie wurde im Juli 2016 an der volkswirtschaftlichen Fakultät der LMU eingereicht. Ziel der Arbeit ist es, die Ausgestaltung der Pfänderpolitik innerhalb des Zielsystems von Zentralbanken als Instrument der Zentralbankpolitik zu etablieren und praktische Ausgestaltung, Wirkungsweise sowie Auswirkungen darzulegen. Die Arbeit gliedert sich in drei Teile und neun Kapitel. Der erste Teil bespricht die Rolle von Pfändern in der Zentralbankpolitik. Die verschiedenen möglichen Aufgaben und Ziele von Zentralbanken werden historisch abgeleitet. Dann wird die Ausgestaltung der Pfänderpolitik innerhalb dieses Zielsystems besprochen und geschlussfolgert, dass Pfänderpolitik mit Blick auf alle Zentralbankziele von Bedeutung ist. Somit entsteht ein normativer Rahmen für die Rolle von Pfänderpolitik. Im zweiten Teil werden praktische Pfänderpolitikmaßnahmen mit Blick auf diesen Rahmen vorgestellt. Der Fokus liegt dabei auf der Pfänderpolitik des Eurosystems, deren Facetten im Detail erarbeitet werden. Während der Finanz- sowie der Eurokrise hat das Eurosystem seine Pfänderpolitik mit Blick auf verschiedene Zentralbankziele stark intensiviert. Vergleichend werden der historische Einsatz von Pfänderkriterien als Instrument der Zentralbankpolitik und die Ausgestaltung der Pfänderkriterien im Federal Reserve System sowie bei Bank of England und Bank of Japan während der jüngsten Krisenjahre gegenübergestellt. Im dritten Teil geht es zunächst darum, die Wirkungsweise von Pfänderpolitik innerhalb des Zielsystems einer Zentralbank theoretisch zu fundieren. Sie wird dazu in Haircut- und Quantitypolicy gegliedert und klassischer Zinspolitik gegenübergestellt. Der optimale Einsatz von Pfänderpolitik, je nach Zentralbankziel, wird hergeleitet. Anschließend werden Auswirkungen der Ausgestaltung der Pfänderpolitik des Eurosystems aufgedeckt: Ein Kapitel zeigt modelltheoretisch die einseitigen Förderung schlechter Qualitäten durch das Angebot von segmentweise gepoolten Refinanzierungsbedingungen (adverse Selektion der schlechten Pfandqualitäten). Ein weiteres Kapitel geht mit Hilfe eines schematischen Modells auf die Verteilungseffekte innerhalb der Währungsunion durch diesen Poolingansatz ein, die sich gegenüber einer Fiskalunion, wie den USA, dem Vereinigten Königreich oder Japan, wesentlich unterscheiden. Im Ergebnis kann für die Eurozone auf eine Umverteilung zugunsten der Krisenländer geschlossen werden. Schließlich widmet sich ein Kapitel der Suche nach Spuren im Marktverhalten, als Reaktion auf die Politik des Eurosystems. Dazu wird der Datensatz der zentralbankfähigen Sicherheiten im Eurosystem von 2007 bis 2013 angereichert und deskriptiv ausgewertet. Besonders für Pfänder aus Krisenländern und aus dem Bankensektor sind solche Marktreaktionen ableitbar.

Im Jahr 2007 hat das ifo Institut zur methodischen Basis seiner Konjunkturforschung einen ersten Sammelband mit ausgewählten Artikeln aus dem ifo Schnelldienst veröffentlicht. Der vorliegende zweite Band setzt diese Tradition fort und präsentiert Artikel aus den Jahren 2003 bis 2016 aus den Gebieten: Prognosemethodik, makroökonomische Analyse, monetäre Analyse, ifo Konjunkturtest und Ifo World Economic Survey. Die ausgewählten Artikel zur Prognosemethodik schlagen einen Bogen von den Spezifika der ifo Prognosetechnik zu den wirtschaftsstatischen Grundlagen wie der Volumenrechnung in den Volkswirtschaftlichen Gesamtrechnungen oder das vom ifo Institut eingesetzte Saisonbereinigungsverfahren. Ein weiterer Themenkreis befasst sich mit ausgewählten Aspekten der makroökonomischen Analyse. Darüber hinaus wird der monetären Analyse und speziell der Geldpolitik der EZB breiten Raum gegeben. Schließlich findet sich eine Palette von Aufsätzen zu den Spezifika des ifo Konjunkturtests für Deutschland bzw. des ifo World Economic Survey. Mit diesem Band soll die angesprochene Thematik, die bisher nur im ifo Schnelldienst veröffentlicht wurde, einem breiteren Leserkreis zugänglich gemacht werden.

F45|ECB Policies Involving Government Bond Purchases: Impact and Channels|We evaluate the effects of three ECB policies (the Securities Markets Programme, the Outright Monetary Transactions, and the Long-Term Refinancing Operations) on government bond yields. We use a novel Kalman-filter augmented event-study approach and yields on euro-denominated sovereign bonds, dollar-denominated sovereign bonds, corporate bonds, and corporate CDS rates to understand the channels through which policies reduced sovereign bond yields. On average across Italy, Spain and Portugal, considering both the Securities Markets Programme and the Outright Monetary Transactions, yields fall considerably. Decomposing this fall, default risk accounts for 37%, redenomination risk accounts for 13%, and market segmentation effects accounts for 50%. In Italy, Spain and Portugal, the default risk premium and market segmentation channel were the dominant policy channels. The redenomination risk premium channel also contributed for Spain and Portugal, but not Italy. Stock price increases in distressed and core countries suggest that these policies also had beneficial macro-spillovers.

F45|Heterogeneity, Convergence and Imbalances in the Euro Area|The inception of the euro allowed countries from the periphery to experience a large fall in the cost of borrowing. Lower nominal rates were only partially o?set by lower in?ation rates. We rationalize this real interest rate reversal using a two-region model of a monetary union where, consistently with real interest rate data, discount factors are initially heterogeneous, leading the periphery to be borrowing-constrained. We model the inception of the euro as a partial convergence process in in?ation rates and a slow rise in the discount factor of the periphery, relaxing the borrowing constraint. This simple set-up accounts for the bulk of post-euro ?uctuations in both regions. In particular, it replicates very well the observed joint dynamics of current accounts and terms of trade
F45|Home biased expectations and macroeconomic imbalances in a monetary union|Under monetary union, economic dynamics may diverge across countries due to regional inflation differentials and a pro-cyclical real interest rate channel, yet stability is generally ensured through endogenous adjustment of the real exchange rate. The speed of adjustment depends, inter alia, on the way agents’ form expectations. We propose a model in which agents expectations are largely based on domestic variables, and less so on foreign variables. We show that such home bias in expectations strengthens the real interest rate channel and causes country-specific shocks to generate larger and more prolonged macroeconomic imbalances.
F45|Large net foreign liabilities of euro area countries|Over recent years, several euro area countries have registered large and persistent net foreign liabilities. This paper examines the risks arising from these external stock imbalances, the prospects for their smooth unwinding and the menu of policy options. The paper demonstrates that external stock imbalances remain a source of vulnerabilities in the (former) programme countries and, to a lesser extent, the euro area countries in central and eastern Europe. The net foreign liabilities of these economies stand at levels that are typically associated with an increased susceptibility to external crises. Mechanical projections indicate that the net foreign liabilities of the (former) programme countries will remain at elevated levels over the next decade despite some gradual adjustments, while those of the central and eastern European (CEE) countries could return to more sustainable levels more quickly. There are also vulnerabilities related to the composition of external positions, most notably the unfavourable debt-equity mix in the (former) programme countries. However, the long maturity of public external debt – which is often owed to official creditors – and, in the CEE countries, the prevalence of stable foreign direct investment should mitigate external sustainability risks. Furthermore, the net payments associated with the external positions of the euro area debtor countries are relatively low at the current juncture, although the burden could increase markedly if euro area interest rates were to normalise again. Against this backdrop, a timely and well-designed policy response would provide critical support to the orderly unwinding of the remaining external stock imbalances in the euro area. An optimal policy mix would consist of measures simultaneously fostering GDP growth and sustainable current account improvements in the debtor economies, in particular reforms aimed at enhancing productivity growth and export performance.

F45|Interactions between fiscal multipliers and sovereign risk premium during fiscal consolidation: model based assessment for the euro area|The paper presents a model-based assessment of fiscal multipliers operating in the euro area during the period 2011-2014. The assessment is conditional on two distinct reactions of the sovereign risk premium (either responding endogenously to fiscal shocks or being an exogenous process) and two types of monetary policy (accommodative and non-accommodative). Applying those multipliers to the amount of austerity measures implemented in years 2011-14, the paper evaluates their possible fallouts and shows that the output effects of the recent fiscal consolidations were largely determined by two key factors: financial markets JEL Classification: E42, E32, F42, F45

F45|Internal devaluation in currency unions: the role of trade costs and taxes|This paper studies export adjustment to negative shocks in currency unions. I consider the hitherto ignored role of trade costs and taxes in internal devaluations, which have been brought to the fore of international policy during the recent euro periphery crisis. Trade costs can limit the pass-through of internal devaluation on export prices. Using data on export prices ”on the dock”, I document that higher trade costs are associated with a lower reduction of export prices relative to domestic prices in the euro periphery. Furthermore, VAT (in theory trade neutral, but in practice much higher on tradables) hikes prevent the required shift of resources towards tradables. I show that the real exchange rate (RER) adjustment was heavily affected by indirect tax hikes, by comparing headline RER and tax-adjusted RER. I then build a standard New Keynesian small open economy model with sticky wages and prices, incorporating trade costs and indirect taxes (allowing for VAT imperfections), and show that both these frictions, but especially trade costs, can be quantitatively crucial in affecting export growth, more so than either product markups or wage rigidity. I apply the model to data for Greece, the least successful of the euro periphery ﬁscal devaluation programs, and show that it can account for the most salient features of the data; trade costs explain the failure to substantially raise exports, and taxes the initial small fall in exports.

F45|ECB Policies Involving Government Bond Purchases: Impacts and Channels|We evaluate the effects of three ECB policies (the Securities Markets Programme, the Outright Monetary Transactions, and the Long-Term Refinancing Operations) on government bond yields.Â We use a novel Kalman-filter augmented event-study approach and yields on euro-denominated sovereign bonds, dollar-denominated sovereign bonds, corporate bonds, and corporate CDS rates to understand the channels through which policies reduced sovereign bond yields. On average across Italy, Spain and Portugal, considering both the Securities Markets Programme and the Outright Monetary Transactions, yields fall considerably. Decomposing this fall, default risk accounts for 37% of the reduction in yields, reduced redenomination risk for 13%, and reduced market segmentation effects for 50%. Stock price increases in distressed and core countries suggest that these policies also had beneficial macro-spillovers.
F45|Current Account Imbalances and Cost Competitiveness: The Role of the Euro|The changing environment that the Euro has brought to its member countries could have fuelled the deteriorating effect that net capital in ows have on cost competitiveness. This paper uses a di erence-in-di erences (DID) approach to assess the e ect of the Euro on the relationship between net capital infl ows, as measured by current account imbalances, and cost competitiveness over the period 1980-2014. The sample consists of annual data for 26 developed economies and comprises the EA12 countries as well as non-Euro countries, which are used as the comparison group in the analysis. First, we find evidence that positive capital in ows may negatively impact cost competitiveness levels in recipient countries. Second, and this is the main contribution of our paper, we find that the Euro seems to have amplified the deteriorating effect of net capital in ows on cost competitiveness. Therefore, although the policy debate is focused on constraining unit labour cost growth through structural reforms, additional macroprudential policies should be implemented to mitigate the detrimental e ect that capital in ows may have in an economy.
F45|Fiscal policy in Europe: The importance of making it predictable|This paper provides evidence in support of the hypothesis that fiscal policy is largely anticipated and its effects depend on the extent to which policy is able to affect expectations. Based on a set of 2-country Bayesian VAR models between major European economies, we find that a surprise stimulus triggers expectations of deficit reversals that may crowd out private expenditure. An anticipated stimulus, on the contrary, is found to boost domestic activity in all samples. Moreover, it has positive cross-border effects in 50 percent of the cases. Overall, our findings suggest that fiscal policy is effective when it is not “crowded out” by expectations of reversals. We document such crowding out effects in Italy and France. Finally, we argue that predictability has important consequences for the design of discretionary policy.
F45|Macroeconomic imbalances and business cycle synchronization. Why common economic governance is imperative for the Eurozone|This paper investigates a new category of influential factors on business cycle synchronization (BCS), so far hardly regarded in the BCS literature. It provides an empirical assessment of the impact of macroeconomic imbalances, as monitored by the European Commission by the scoreboard indicators since 2011, on BCS in the Euozone. We use a quarterly data set covering the period 2002–2012 and estimate the direct and indirect effects of macroeconomic imbalances in the pre- and post-crisis period in a simultaneous equations model. Business cycle correlation between EA members is measured by the recently proposed dynamic conditional correlation of Engle (2002) which can better identify synchronous and asynchronous behaviour of BC than the commonly used measures. We find that appearing differences between EA members in current account, in government deficit and public debt, in private debt and unit labor cost developments have reduced BCS in the EA, even more in the post-crisis period than before. Moreover, these explanatory factors of BCS, generally reinforce each other and are also influenced by other critical macro imbalances. Since BCS is essential in a monetary union, this paper provides clear support that a stronger, common economic governance would be important for the functioning and survival of the Eurozone.
F45|Asymmetric credit growth and current account imbalances in the euro area|The euro-area crisis is often linked to the emergence of current account imbalances. As most of the deficit countries experienced pronounced credit booms at the same time that these imbalances were building up, this paper investigates the link between domestic credit developments and the current account balance. Using a panel error correction specification, the estimation results show that flows of bank loans to the non-financial private sector are a significant determinant of the current account and that they – together with changes in competitiveness – constituted the most important factor driving the build-up of current account imbalances in the deficit countries. Accordingly, impeding an increase in private sector indebtedness seems to be a promising way to dampen the formation of unsustainable current account imbalances.
F45|The real effects of financial (dis)integration: A multi-country equilibrium analysis of Europe|Using data from 15 European Union economies, we quantify the real effects of supply-side frictions due to the financial disintegration of European countries since the 2008 financial crisis. We develop a multi-country general equilibrium model with heterogeneous countries and destination-specific financial frictions. Financial institutions allocate capital endogenously across countries, determining the cost of capital to firms and the wealth of nations. The cost of financial disintegration is reduced access to capital for firms which results in lower output. Financial disintegration leads to a 0.54% fall in output in Europe since the crisis. We also estimate benefits of further financial integration.
F45|Strategic fiscal policies and leadership in a monetary union|We consider the strategic interactions between fiscal and monetary policies in a monetary union when a fiscal authority enjoys a strategic advantage. In particular we depart from the standard literature on strategic interactions in monetary unions in that we solve a three-stage game, where the two national fiscal authorities do not play simultaneously. We find that there is always an incentive for the leader fiscal authority to play a three-stage game, which leaves the other fiscal authority worse off under demand shocks. This choice leads to more (less) volatile union-wide fiscal stance for demand (supply) shocks compared to the standard narrow-coordination case. This volatility is positively related to demand shocks' asymmetries.
F45|Oil price shocks, monetary policy and current account imbalances within a currency union|For more than two decades now, current-account imbalances are a crucial issue in the international policy debate as they threaten the stability of the world economy. More recently, the government debt crisis of the European Union shows that internal current account imbalances inside a currency union may also add to these risks. Oil price fluctuations and a contracting monetary policy that reacts on oil prices, previously discussed to affect the current account may also be a threat to the currency union by changing internal imbalances. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the impact of oil price shocks on current account imbalances within a currency union. Differences in institutions, especially labor market institutions and trade result in an asymmetric reaction to an otherwise symmetric shock. In this context, we show that oil price shocks can have a long-lasting impact on internal balances, as the exchange rate adjustment mechanism is not available. The common monetary policy authority, however, can reduce such effects by specifying an optimum monetary policy target. Nevertheless, we also show that there is no single best solution. CPI, core CPI or an asymmetric CPI target all come at a cost either regarding an increase in unemployment or increasing imbalances.
F45|Fiscal Policy Stabilisation and the Financial Cycle in the Euro Area|This paper examines the impact of the financial cycle on the capacity of the economy to deal with shocks, with a particular focus on fiscal policy in the euro area member states. It starts by measuring national financial cycles and investigating the synchronisation across them as well as their relationship to the medium-term business cycle. It finds that financial cycles tend to be synchronised but their amplitudes differ significantly across countries. Business cycles tend to be positively correlated with the financial cycle, but they usually are smaller. The paper then examines if and how the financial cycle affects international risk-sharing among euro area member states and finds that economic booms and busts are often associated with phases of financial integration and disintegration at the level of the euro area. Such developments are reflected in the degree of international risk-sharing, which turns out to behave procyclically. Lastly, the capacity of domestic fiscal policy to smooth asymmetric shocks in the euro area declines dramatically during recessionary phases of the domestic financial cycle. The paper concludes that macroprudential policies are an important tool for preventing excessive swings in the financial cycle, but they should be complemented by a central stabilisation mechanism, which can make both capital markets and fiscal policy more resilient to disruption associated with the financial cycle.
F45|Dynamics and factors of inflation convergence in the European union|We analyze inflation convergence in the whole European Union (EU) over 1999–2017. We provide comprehensive evidence that the process of inflation convergence among the countries of the EU was not permanently disrupted during the global financial crisis, the European sovereign debt crisis, or the period of zero lower bound interest rates. Specifically, the convergence process did not noticeably weaken after the crisis and the occurrence of inflation convergence became more widespread compared to the pre-crisis years. Our results are robust with respect to the use of three inflation benchmarks (the cross-sectional average, the inflation target of the European Central Bank, and the Maastricht inflation criterion), structural breaks, and a core inflation measure. Our main findings imply that further enlargement of the euro area is feasible from the perspective of inflation convergence among EU countries.
F45|Deflation in the Euro Zone: Overview and Empirical Analysis|Two main issues, closely related to each other, have occupied the European Central Bank in recent years: the sovereign debt crisis and the possibility of deflation in the Euro Zone. In this paper we discuss the causes, the consequences and the policy options regarding deflation. In addition, we assess the magnitude of the risk of deflation in the Euro Zone. For this purpose, we will employ the methodology of Kilian and Manganelli (2007). Our results suggest that the threat of deflation in the Euro Zone is related to the international financial crisis and to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. Thus, the probability of deflation in the Euro zone increased in recent years. Nevertheless, it appears to have subsided in 2017, justifying the view taken by the ECB’s Governing Council, according to which deflation is no longer a problem for the Euro zone.
F45|Internal Devaluations and Equilibrium Exchange Rates: new evidences and perspectives for the EMU| From the onset of the euro crisis to the Brexit vote, we have witnessed impressive reductions of current account imbalances in peripheral countries of the euro area. These reductions can be the result of either a compression of internal demand or an improvement in external competitiveness. In this paper, we compute exchange rate misalignments within the euro area to assess whether peripheral countries have managed to improve their external competitiveness. After controlling for the reduction of business cycle synchronization within the EMU, we find that peripheral countries have managed to reduce their exchange rate misalignments thanks to internal devaluations. To some extent, these favourable evolutions reflect improvements in external competitiveness. Nevertheless, these gains could only be temporary if peripheral countries do not improve their non-price competitiveness, their trade structures and their international specializations in the long run.Abbreviations: EMU, European Monetary Union; FEER, Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange Rate; SMIM, Symmetric Matrix Inversion Method; BEER, Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate; PPP, Purchasing Parity Power; OCI, Own Country Included; IMF, International Monetary Fund; OECD, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; NIESR, National Institute of Economic and Social Research.
F45|Réduire les divergences en zone euro en régulant les cycles financiers|La zone euro souffre de divergences économiques et financières entre ses membres. La politique monétaire ne peut pas y remédier, puisqu’elle est unique, donc calibrée et menée pour la moyenne de la zone. Elle peut même les accroître en agissant seule, sans autre levier de politique économique pour la compléter. Cela rend urgent un nouveau policy mix en zone euro, qui prenne en compte le fait que la zone est hétérogène et soumise à des cycles financiers peu synchrones. Rechercher la stabilité économique par la stabilité financière est possible dans le cadre de la politique macroprudentielle, dont l’action contracyclique peut-être calibrée par pays, tout en étant coordonnée au niveau de la zone par une institution déjà en place, le Conseil européen du risque systémique. La zone euro se trouverait ainsi dotée de l’instrument d’ajustement macro-conjoncturel qui lui fait tant défaut depuis ses débuts.
F45|Global banking and the conduct of macroprudential policy in a monetary union|This paper questions the role of cross-border lending in the definition of national macroprudential policies in the European Monetary Union. We build and estimate a two-country DSGE model with corporate and interbank cross-border loans, Core-Periphery diverging financial cycles and a national implementation of coordinated macroprudential measures based on Countercyclical Capital Buffers. We get three main results. First, targeting a national credit-to-GDP ratio should be favored to federal averages as this rule induces better stabilizing performances in front of important divergences in credit cycles between core and peripheral countries. Second, policies reacting to the evolution of national credit supply should be favored as the transmission channel of macroprudential policy directly impacts the marginal cost of loan production and, by so, financial intermediaries. Third, the interest of lifting up macroprudential policymaking to the supra-national level remains questionable for admissible value of international lending between Eurozone countries. Indeed, national capital buffers reacting to the union-wide loan-to-GDP ratio only lead to the same stabilization results than the one obtained under the national reaction if cross-border lending reaches 45%. However, even if cross-border linkages are high enough to justify the implementation of a federal adjusted solution, the reaction to national lending conditions remains remarkably optimal.
F45|La zone euro en quête de coordination|The Eurozone crisis has revealed three major design errors: (1) a monetary union without a banking union, (2) an inconsistency between three prohibitions, namely monetization of public debts, bail-out of a Member state by its partners, and sovereign default, and (3) the virtual absence of coordination of macroeconomic policies. Although the first two errors are being corrected, the third ? the purpose of this article ? is resistant to reforms because it concerns the sovereignty of the Member states. The coordination of fiscal policies could in fact prove more difficult than the introduction of a common budget based on automatic stabilizers to mitigate business cycles. As for the coordination of other macroeconomic policies, the existing schemes (macroeconomic imbalances procedure, Europe 2020 integrated guidelines) would benefit from being refocussed each on a specific objective, and assessed according to an appropriate timetable.

F45|Can the Adoption of the Euro in Croatia Reduce the Cost of Borrowing?|"The paper analyses the impact of euro adoption on the reduction of borrowing costs of EU member states. The results of the analysis point to the existence of a ""euro premium"" – after controlling for the dynamics in the macroeconomic fundamentals of particular countries and the market sentiment, member states of the monetary union have, on average, lower borrowing costs and higher credit ratings than other EU member states. In order to draw attention to the significance that the results could have for bank interest rates in Croatia in the event of euro adoption, a simple VAR model is used to demonstrate that there is a statistically significant transmission of the changes in government borrowing costs to interest rates on bank loans."
F45|Whatâ€™s Mine Is Yours: Sovereign Risk Transmission during the European Debt Crisis|We develop an empirical network model to study bilateral sovereign credit risk spillovers during the European debt crisis. We show that the spillover density is typically asymmetric with heavy tails. This confounds efforts to track time-variation in spillover activity using the mean-based summary statistics that are widespread in the literature. Density-based measures â€” specifically divergence criteria â€” yield stronger and timelier signals of changes in spillover activity than mean-based measures. This is particularly apparent for sovereign bailouts, which principally affect the tails of the spillover density. Consequently, densitybased measures provide valuable additional information about changes in the credit risk environment.
F45|Is Europe disintegrating? Macroeconomic divergence, structural polarization, trade and fragility|This paper analyses economic developments in the Eurozone since its inception in 1999. In doing so, we document a process of economic divergence and polarization among those countries that joined the Eurozone during its first two years, which fits a typical ‘core – periphery’ pattern. We show how this polarization process first manifested in increasing current account imbalances before the crisis, before it translated unto the level of general macroeconomic development after the crisis. Empirically, we demonstrate how this divergence is tied to a ‘structural polarization’ in terms of the sectoral composition of Eurozone countries: specifically, the emergence of export-driven growth in core countries and debt-driven growth in the European periphery coincides with differences in technological capabilities and firm performance. Pushing for convergence within Europe requires the implementation of three intertwined policy programs: macroprudential financial regulation, active industrial policies aiming at a technological catch-up process in periphery countries, and progressive redistributional policies to sustain adequate levels of aggregate demand throughout the Eurozone.
F45|Exit Strategies, Capital Flight and Speculative Attacks: Europe's Version of the Trilemma|In the winter 2011/12 a wave of internal capital flight prompted the ECB to abandon its exit strategy and to announce an unprecedented monetary expansion. We analyze this episode in several dimensions: (i) by providing an event-study analysis covering key variables from national central banks’ balance sheets, (ii) by rationalizing their patterns in a portfolio balance model of the exchange rate, augmented by institutional characteristics of the TARGET2 system, and (iii) by proposing a theory-based index of exchange market pressure within the euro area. We argue that the euro area entails an inherent policy trilemma that makes it prone to speculative attacks.
F45|Cross-country fiscal policy spillovers and capital-skill complementarity in currency unions|We investigate cross-country fiscal policy spillovers through the integration of capital markets in a currency union and allow capital use in production to differ across countries. Following empirical evidence, we assume that production exhibits capital-skill complementarity. Using a multi-country overlapping-generations model calibrated for 14 European Union countries, we find that output spillovers are small with standard tax reforms but can be sizeable with large government spending increases financed by taxes: long run output losses in shock-free countries can amount to a quarter of the losses in countries hit by the spending shock. Conditional and temporary relaxing of the EU debt ceiling rule could benefit the Union as a whole.
F45|Risk sharing by financial markets in federal systems: What do we really measure?|"This paper criticises the standard methodology used to measure the importance of different channels of risk sharing in federal states such as the one used in Asdrubali et al.'s (1996) seminal contribution. It argues that the methodology chosen in these papers systematically underestimates the role federal governments play in stabilizing the business cycle in its member states (and overstates the role of financial markets in stabilization) as it a) ignores the possibility of direct spending by the federal government in a single state stabilizing state GDP, b) strips out effects of transfers and grants in national recessions, c) counts smoothing of distributed profits by domestic firms as ""smoothing by capital markets"" and d) counts a normal variation of households' savings to smooth consumption as ""smoothing by credit markets""."
F45|Stagnation policy in the Eurozone and economic policy alternatives|Empirically, the macroeconomic institutions and the macroeconomic policy approach in the Eurozone have failed badly, both in terms of preventing the global financial and economic cri-sis from becoming a euro crisis and in generating a rapid recovery from the crisis, in particular. In this paper I will argue that the dominating macroeconomic policy regime in the Eurozone can be seen as a version of what Steindl (1979) had called ?stagnation policy?. To underline this argument, I will provide a simple Steindlian distribution and growth model in order to identi-fy the main channels through which stagnation policy affects accumulation and productivity growth. This will also provide a set of elements of a Steindlian anti-stagnation policy. Against this theoretical background I will then examine the macroeconomic institutions and the macro-economic policy approach of the Eurozone which has been based on the New Consensus Macroeconomics (NCM) and I will highlight its main deficiencies. This will then provide the grounds for an outline of an alternative macroeconomic policy approach for the specific institu-tional setup of the Eurozone based on a post-Keynesian/Steindlian/neo-Kaleckian approach.
F45|Opportunities and limits of rebalancing the Eurozone via wage policies|In this paper we discuss the relationship between the current account rebalancing in the Eu-rozone, income distribution and wage policies with a focus on the main surplus economy, Germany. We will illustrate how and to which extent German wage policies could be able to contribute to a more balanced development of the Eurozone and to overcome the export-led mercantilist German model. Our analysis and our scenarios will be based on stylized econo-metric results for Germany, as they have recently been obtained in the empirical literature estimating the German demand and growth regime based on post-Kaleckian models. We will focus in particular on the relationship between nominal wages and functional income distribu-tion, on the one hand, and between functional income distribution and domestic demand, on the other hand. We show that more expansionary wage policy can contribute to reducing the excessive German current account surplus, mainly through the domestic income-imports channel. However, wage policy alone will be overburdened with the task of rebalancing. For this, in particular more expansionary fiscal policies are required.
F45|Euro area imbalances: How much could an expansion in the North help the South?|We run simulations of current account rebalancing scenarios in the Euro Area and the European Union based on a closed multi-country input-output model. The spillover effects of domestic demand booms in the Northern European surplus countries are non-negligible, but not large. While they cannot on their own create a meaningful upswing in the former Southern European deficit countries, they could be an important element thereof. In particular, a Northern expansion can create the necessary policy space for a domestic demand-driven expansion in the European South by relaxing the balance of payments constraint. Then, a coordinated asymmetric expansion in the Euro Area could alleviate the unemployment crisis in the European South.
F45|Oil price shocks, monetary policy and current account imbalances within a currency union| For more than two decades now, current-account imbalances are a crucial issue in the international policy debate as they threaten the stability of the world economy. More recently, the government debt crisis of the European Union shows that internal current account imbalances inside a currency union may also add to these risks. Oil price fluctuations and a contracting monetary policy that reacts on oil prices, previously discussed to affect the current account may also be a threat to the currency union by changing internal imbalances. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the impact of oil price shocks on current account imbalances within a currency union. Differences in institutions, especially labor market institutions and trade result in an asymmetric reaction to an otherwise symmetric shock. In this context, we show that oil price shocks can have a long-lasting impact on internal balances, as the exchange rate adjustment mechanism is not available. The common monetary policy authority, however, can reduce such effects by specifying an optimum monetary policy target. Nevertheless, we also show that there is no single best solution. CPI, core CPI or an asymmetric CPI target all come at a cost either regarding an increase in unemployment or increasing imbalances.
F45|Eurace Open: An agent-based multi-country model|The global economic and financial crises, whose genesis is often associated with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, had a pervasive impact on all the leading economies in the world. The place where it might have been more disruptive has been the European Union (EU), which revealed a structural fragility and inadequacy to tackle some of the main challenges ahead. In this paper we mainly focus on migration challenges, further integrations of a monetary union, spatial inequality, and sovereign debt crisis. To address the relevant issues, we use a multi-country model that is an extension of the Eurace agent-based model. We design a flexible modeling framework that can host many different countries. In this paper the model hosts four countries. It is designed as a monetary union of two countries with international labor market, international trade, and international financial market, and another two independent countries that are always identical to the union members and serve as control states. We found that when countries are identical it is always beneficial to join the union, however an excess of workers mobility can weaken the performance of the union and even create persistent inequality between countries. Moreover, the monetary policy of the union central bank can deteriorate if the difference between countries growth and in general it tends to overshoot the inflation target. When the two countries differ in productivity, the union on aggregate performs again better than the sum of the isolated countries counterparts. However, taking into account the welfare in both countries of the union, it is not always convenient to form the union. The performance of the union is strongly affected by the level of labor market frictions and the size of the productivity gap among countries. The real sovereign debt per capita in the union increases with low mobility frictions and high productivity gap. Stronger fiscal integration (fiscal transfers) reduces inequality between countries, allowing the low productivity country and, hence, the total union to sustain even with a higher mobility of workers.
F45|Relational Contracts, the Cost of Enforcing Formal Contracts, and Capital Structure Choice - Theory and Evidence|This paper shows that the cost of enforcing contracts governing non-financial relationships between firms affects a firm’s financing structure. We analyze the interaction between a firm’s capital structure and the type of contracts it uses to deal with its suppliers. We first develop a theoretical model where a downstream party needs an intermediate good from an upstream party, and this intermediate good can be of high or low quality. Court-enforceable contracts can be used to enforce high quality, but their use is costly. If these costs are too high, relational contracts - self-enforcing informal arrangements that can be sustained in long-term relationships - are needed. Relational contracts, though, can only be sustained if debt is not too high. The reason is that a firm’s commitment in relational contracts is determined by its future profits in the cooperative relationship, and the need to repay debt reduces future profits. We therefore derive the prediction that, on average, higher costs of enforcing formal contracts should be associated with firms having less leverage. We test this prediction with the help of two datasets. First, the Microdatabase Directinvestment (MiDi) provided by Deutsche Bundesbank, which records balance-sheet information on the universe of German investments abroad, including detailed information on external debt and equity capital. Second, the World Bank’s Doing Business Database, which provides information on the average cost of enforcing (formal) contracts between a firm and a supplier of an intermediate good. Using a panel data model for fractional response variables, we can show that an increase in the cost of enforcing contracts in a country makes firms use substantially more equity financing.
F45|Is Europe Disintegrating? Macroeconomic Divergence, Structural Polarisation, Trade and Fragility|This paper analyses economic developments in the eurozone since its inception in 1999. In doing so, we document a process of economic divergence and polarisation among those countries that joined the eurozone during its first two years, which fits a typical ‘core – periphery’ pattern. We show how this polarisation process first manifested in increasing current account imbalances before the crisis, before it translated unto the level of general macroeconomic development after the crisis. Empirically, we demonstrate how this divergence is tied to a ‘structural polarisation’ in terms of the sectoral composition of eurozone countries specifically, the emergence of export-driven growth in core countries and debt-driven growth in the European periphery coincides with differences in technological capabilities and firm performance. Pushing for convergence within Europe requires the implementation of three intertwined policy programmes macroprudential financial regulation, active industrial policies aiming at a technological catch-up process in periphery countries, and progressive re‑distributional policies to sustain adequate levels of aggregate demand throughout the eurozone.
F45|Greece’s Three-Act Tragedy: A Simple Model of Grexit vs. Staying Afloat inside the Single Currency Area|Abstract Against the backdrop of the Greek three-act tragedy, we present a theoretical framework for studying Greece’s recent debt and currency crisis. The model is built on two essential blocks: first, erratic macroeconomic policymaking in Greece is described using a stochastic regime-switching model; second, the euro area governments’ responses to uncertain macroeconomic policies in Greece are considered. The model’s mechanism and assumptions allow either for a Grexit from the euro area or, conversely, the avoidance of Greece’s default against its creditors. The model also offers useful guidance to understand key drivers of the long-winded negotiations between the Greek government and the “institutions”.
F45|Market reactions to ECB policy innovations: A cross-country analysis|Regulators have been paying increasing attention to governing and steering market fluctuations, with their role in shaping the economic cycle being ever more crucial. The combined effect of the financial and sovereign debt crises, as well as the approach to the zero lower bound, has made actions even more pressing, forcing the European Central Bank to resort to unconventional instruments to revive the economies and counter deflationary pressures. By using a combined event study and panel regression methodology, we investigate whether European Monetary Union equity markets react heterogeneously to standard and non-standard European Central Bank policy innovations. Our results show that conventional policies unevenly affect financial indices in the Eurozone and, hence, are bound to generate asymmetries that reflect on real economies, while unconventional measures, albeit with different intensities, exercise a homogeneous pressure on all markets. Our evidence highlights the beneficial impact of unconventional measures and suggests that they can play a useful role even in non-crisis times.
F45|Unconventional Monetary Policy in a Financially Heterogeneous Monetary Union|The cross-country interbank market in the euro area was a crucial transmission channel of financial stress. By using a two-country DSGE model of a financially heterogeneous monetary union where banks in one country lend funds to their foreign counterparts, I examine its role as shock amplifier and the implications for unconventional policy interventions Using the international interbank market to pool and insure against shocks is not neutral, the resulting spillovers rather act as shock multipliers on union output. Country-specific unconventional policies of direct lending to firms seem to be the most effective interventions in terms of union and relative output stabilization. The higher the size of the interbank market, the more effective are these policies in terms of union stabilization. The effectiveness of interventions in the interbank market seems to be very sensitive to the type of shock and the interbank market size. Hence, the central bank should rather shy away from this policy as it is only useful under specific circumstances.
F45|The Role Of Capital Controls In Mediating Global Shocks|This paper studies the role of capital controls in the transmission of global commodity price shocks in explaining the variation of domestic business cycles in 89 countries for the period 1995â€“2013. The results suggest that countries that are relatively open or closed have lower variance in output, consumption and investments explained by global shocks than those countries that have partially liberalised capital markets. On the contrary, relatively closed and open economies have a much higher share of the trade balance to output ratio volatility explained than partially liberalised countries. This pattern is independent of the level of economic development or geographical region. The results show that a partial liberalisation of the capital account might make countries more vulnerable to world shocks, than opening and closing the capital account completely.
F45|Exchange Rate Volatility and Exports in the run-up to the EMU accession|According to theory of monetary integration, lower exchange rate variability is believed to be the main positive effect of a common currency. However, empirical studies do not confirm this negative and significant impact of exchange rate volatility on trade. In this report, we analyze the relationship between the exchange rate volatility and the export performance of Central and Eastern European non-euro EU countries: Poland, Czechia, Hungary, and Romania. We use monthly frequency data on export flows to the euro area and the European Union. The sample covers the period from 2000M1 till 2015M6 and we control for the financial crisis of 2008-2009 when exchange rate variability increased considerably. We measure exchange rate volatility using traditional standard deviation approach and GARCH models. The main hypothesis is verified using both aggregated data and sectoral trade data. The effects of euro exchange rate volatility on Polish trade are explored with more focus by estimating a series of vector error correction models and by assessing impulse-response functions. For the panel data estimation, we employ second generation dynamic panel cointegration model with PMG estimator. The results suggest that the elimination of the exchange rate volatility through euro adoption will not necessarily increase the export performance of the countries integrating with the euro area.
F45|Austerity in the Aftermath of the Great Recession|We examine austerity in advanced economies since the Great Recession. Austerity shocks are reductions in government purchases that exceed reduced-form forecasts. Austerity shocks are statistically associated with lower real GDP, lower inflation and higher net exports. We estimate a cross-sectional multiplier of roughly 2. A multi-country DSGE model calibrated to 29 advanced economies generates a multiplier consistent with the data. Counterfactuals suggest that eliminating austerity would have substantially reduced output losses in Europe. Austerity shocks were sufficiently contractionary that debt-to-GDP ratios in some European countries increased as a consequence of endogenous reductions in GDP and tax revenue.
F45|Financial stress, regime switching and spillover effects: Evidence from a multi-regime global VAR model|The globalization process leads to increasing synchronization of business cycles among different countries. As a consequence, many policy makers and Central Banks are afraid of vulnerabilities of their countries arising from external risk drivers. In this paper we develop a multi-regime global VAR model to study the spillover effects in financial markets, in goods markets and between financial markets and goods markets across countries, which are assumed to be either in a high financial stress regime or in a low financial stress regime. It turns out that in both the high and the low stress regimes financial shocks to a country, big or small one, can have large and persistent impacts on financial markets of other countries, and only in the high stress regime financial shocks to a country can have some negative output effects on other countries. In the high stress regime output shocks of a big country can have larger effects on financial conditions than those of a small country, while in the low stress regime output shocks of a country, big or small, have little impact on financial conditions. Further, we study the effects of global and regional shocks, as well as the spillover effects of national monetary policies and internationally coordinated policies on the financial and real sectors.11This paper had been presented as an invited paper in a special session on Carl Chiarella at the CEF Conference, June 28–30, 2017 New York. The paper is dedicated to Carl Chiarella’s work. It is exploring in a large scale regime change model the real-financial interaction that Carl had pursued in much of his work for lower dimensional systems, see Chiarella et al. (2015) and Charpe et al. (2011)). Here we thank the anonymous reviewers for constructive comments and suggestions in shaping the final version.
F45|Potential costs and benefits of monetary integration in the Eurasian Economic Union|The Treaty of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), in force in 2015, marked the transition to the deep regional economic integration, including the coordination of macroeconomic and monetary poliсies. The paper provides quanti­tative analysis of the costs and benefits of the ultimate scenario, namely of the hypothetical monetary union. The analysis indicates that the monetary union would require a large-scale preparatory work by the EAEU member states and is justified only in the long term.
F45|Fiscal policy coordination in a monetary union at the zero lower bound|[eng] Following the 2008 Financial Crisis, Euro Area governments faced adverse economic environments: high ratios of public debt to GDP, depressed outputs and the prospect of monetary policy hitting the zero lower bound (ZLB). This article assesses to what extent the conduct of fiscal policy differs within a monetary union at the ZLB. Using a fiscal DSGE model with two regions (North and South) calibrated to replicate the conditions where, absent any additional shock, the Euro Area economy would have been stuck at the ZLB for three years starting in 2013, we show that cross-border spillovers from fiscal policy are substantially higher without monetary offset and increase with the extent of fiscal consolidation measures. Spillovers can amount up to half (resp. one sixth) of the domestic impact in the case of VAT-based (resp. spending-based) consolidations. Outside the ZLB, fiscal expansion in one region triggers monetary tightening which has negative effect in the whole union, and gives rise to gains from fiscal cooperation. At the ZLB however, national objectives tend to be closer and the coordinated policy is less consolidating. Moreover, cooperation encourages symmetric rather than asymmetric policies.
F45|Das Nichts ist Zentralbankgeld. Anmerkungen zu Dirk Ehnts' Buch über Geld und Kredit<BR>[The Nothing is Central Bank Money. Comments on Dirk Ehnts' book on Money and Credit]|The importance of liquidity for banks and even for nation states has been demonstrated once more by the last series of global crises, of which the repercussions still are being felt ten years later. It is a common understanding that a shortage of liquidity leads to insolvency. Under the auspices of central banks and a two-level monetary system, the connection between lost liquidity and insolvency could be cut. If central banks are lenders of last resort, they are capable of removing any problem of illiquidity and insolvency. This is a thesis propagated by Dirk H. Ehnts (2016), who presents a monetary theory beyond the one we find in textbooks. Ehnts extends his super-optimistic view even to states that can – according to him – solve any crisis if they are allowed to enhance their spending. In his theoretical approach to monetary theory, Ehnts puts the examination of balance sheets in the center of his deliberations. The whole body of arguments can be found in his book, “Money and Credit,” which is written in German, as is this analysis of the new perspective to modern money. It results in a list of more than forty flaws - wrong assertions, inherent contradictions and unfounded consequences. The main problems of the balance sheet-centered analysis are these: (i.) Balance sheets are identities. They cannot inform us about causal relations and action sequences. It is an illusion to hope that balance sheets can highlight the functioning of the monetary system. Ehnts’ book is filled with statements that are not consequences of his balance sheets, but untested hypotheses being presented as plausible claims about reality. (ii.) The balance sheet approach is masking the legal dimension of financial interactions. For instance, in credit agreements it is accepted by the debtor to pay back the sum. Otherwise, he or she faces a compulsory execution. According to Ehnts, only one thing happens: the creditor loses his or her claim. (iii.) The theoretical conception ignores the role of the collateral, which is a limiting factor to central bank money and serves as an anchor to stabilize its value. High quality securities are scarce and therefore real money cannot be delivered unlimited in size. (iv.) The subject matter of a credit is not specified correctly in the theoretical framework. According to the author, it can even be jelly babies. But it is money emitted by central banks. No complete explanation of the creation of money by central banks can be found in the whole book. The availability of central bank money is an ignored prerequisite to the creation of money by commercial banks. If money could be created out of nothing, like it is claimed, no bankruptcy would have ever happened. The rationale of Ehnts’ policy advice has as many holes as Swiss cheese. It is not the base upon which serious policy recommendations can be built.
F45|Towards Regional Monetary Unions through Blockchain Networks|The concept of political and economic integration has not progressed beyond the concept of a Nation-state. The primary reason is the trust deficit among citizens in a supra-national entity. We can use Blockchain systems-which are trustless networks-to resolve this issue. We can float a Regional Cryptocurrency (RCC) which can bring about a successful Regional Monetary Unions (RMU) amongst a group of nations in a transparent manner. This paper deals with the idea of realizing a monetary union through Blockchain networks. Firstly I describe the basics of cryptocurrencies and RSBCs. Then we shall evaluate how RMUs have failed due trust deficit among citizens of members of RMU. We then analyse as to how Blockchain networks can be a solution to these problems. The paper concludes by summarizing the difficulties and solutions regarding successful formation of Regional Monetary Unions.
F45|Imbalances and policies in the Eurozone|The present paper highlights the imbalances that have characterized the Eurozone during the crisis. The contribution focuses on the issue of current account imbalances and the factors that caused them. It also examines the banking union as an important step toward a better management of the Eurozone financial imbalances. Furthermore, the paper discusses and assesses the policies, especially monetary policy, implemented in the Eurozone, stressing the limits of the strategy pursued by the European authorities. The main purpose of the paper is to point out possible solutions in order to correct the imbalances and discuss changes in Eurozone policies.
F45|ESBies as a Basis for a TARGET2 Settlement Mechanism|The broadly discussed TARGET2 imbalances in the European Monetary Union result from the fact that there is no settlement mechanism such like the Interdistrict Settlement Accounts (ISA) in the Fed system. The proposal of Brunnermeier at al. (2011, 2017) of so-called European Safe Bonds (ESBies), although designed for different purposes, could be used as a remedy of this problem. In this brief note I suggest to use ESBies as a standardized safe asset for settling cross-border transfers of deposits.
F45|Exchange Rates, International Trade and Growth: Re-Evaluation of Undervaluation|This paper shows that a regional bias resulting from trade integration alters the transmission of a country’s monetary policy by shifting the burden of the exchange rate adjustment towards the less integrated trading partners. I first develop a simple model which illustrates how a concentration of trade flows among regional trading partners affects the sensitivity of the trade balance to the terms-of-trade. In particular, the trade balance becomes less sensitive to the terms-of-trade vis-a-vis regional partners and more sensitive to the terms-of-trade vis-a-vis the other country. I then test the implication of the model using a panel of 133 countries between 1985 - 2010 that includes information on Regional Trade Agreements (RTA). I find that movements in the terms-of-trade vis-a-vis non-RTA members affect a country’s trade balance, while movements vis-a-vis RTA partners do not.
F45|La politique macroprudentielle dans une union monétaire|En utilisant un modèle néo-keynésien simple, qui représente une union monétaire et intègre des frictions financières, cet article montre qu’une politique macroprudentielle ciblée par pays et agissant sur l’offre de crédit pourrait compléter la politique monétaire unique au niveau de l’union. Une telle politique macroprudentielle améliore le degré d’optimalité de l’union monétaire en atténuant les déséquilibres économiques et financiers entre les pays en présence de chocs financiers, des spreads de crédit contracycliques, ou d’une transmission incomplète de la politique monétaire aux conditions financières. Ces résultats sont d’autant plus vrais lorsque les pays représentant le coeur et la périphérie font face à des chocs asymétriques ne nécessitant aucune réaction de la politique monétaire
F45|Macroprudential Policy in a Monetary Union|Abstract Using a simple New Keynesian model of a monetary union that incorporates financial frictions, we show that country-targeted macroprudential policy could complement a single monetary policy at the union level. In particular, macroprudential policy helps taming financial and economic imbalances in the presence of countercyclical financial shocks and imperfect transmission of monetary policy to financial conditions in a monetary union. These results are even stronger when different economies are hit by asymmetric shocks that cancel out without provoking any monetary policy reaction. In addition, we show that when coordinated with monetary policy, country-targeted macroprudential policy (implemented by national or supranational authorities) has advantages over a federally implemented policy that reacts to average financial indicators.
F45|Optimal adjustment paths in a monetary union|What to do when a country experiences a sudden stop in capital inflows and has to adjust externally? Sticky wages make adjustment to an external imbalance more difficult within a monetary union. Periods of high unemployment are usually necessary to achieve the required real depreciation (internal devaluation). Gradual adjustment is usually recommended to distribute the output and employment cost over time. But a gradual adjustment also implies that current account deficits persist for longer, leading to higher debt, and higher debt-service costs. The optimal path of price and wage adjustment thus involves a trade-off between the pain (unemployment) and the gain (lower debt) from adjustment. A simple model shows the determinants of the optimal path in terms of deeper parameters, such as the slope of the Phillips curve and the degree of openness. The rules for the resolution of future crises within the euro area should take this into account. Gradual adjustment is not always the optimal choice, and sometimes the alternative path of introducing abrupt changes produces the desired results.
F45|Equilibrium Real Interest Rates and Secular Stagnation: An Empirical Analysis for Euro Area Member Countries|Is secular stagnation—a period of persistently lower growth such as that seen following the financial crisis of 2008/09—a valid concern for euro-area countries? We tackle this question using the well-established Laubach-Williams model to estimate the unobservable equilibrium real interest rate and compare it to the actual real rate. In light of the considerable increase in heterogeneity among EU member countries since the beginning of the financial crisis, we apply our approach to twelve euro-area countries to provide country-level answers to the question of secular stagnation. The presence of secular stagnation in a number of euro-area countries has important implications for ECB decision-making (i.e., voting power in the Governing Council) and EU governance. Our results indicate that secular stagnation is not a significant threat to most euro-area countries, with one possible exception: Greece.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F45|Austerity & Competitiveness in the Eurozone: a misleading linkage|After focusing on fiscal indiscipline, the debate on the Eurozone crisis switched over persistent external imbalances among the European Monetary Union countries. Current account differentials were almost exclusively ascribed to the weak price competitiveness of deficit countries – neglecting demand-side factors – and consequently austerity measures have been imposed to peripheral countries in order to foster their competitiveness with the purpose of adjusting external imbalances through export growth. In this context, the contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we identify this view as competitive austerity (in parallel with the expansionary austerity narrative), as the set of measures which, according to policy makers, would stimulate trade balance, output and employment. Secondly, we criticize this approach since fiscal restraints were proved to be counterproductive. We conclude by disproving the austerity-competitiveness linkage from a Keynesian perspective as well as by means of some macroeconomic evidence, and we provide an alternative recipe for the Eurozone issues.
F45|A Public Investment Stimulus in Surplus Countries and Its Spillovers in the EA|The Euro Area recommendations endorsed by the European Council in 2016 called for a differentiation of the fiscal effort by individual Member States, taking into account spillovers across Euro Area countries. This article shows model-based simulations of an increase in public investment in Germany and the Netherlands and their spillovers to the rest of the Euro Area. While spillovers in a monetary union may be small when monetary policy reacts by raising interest rates, when rates are kept constant and the stimulus is accommodated, spillovers can be sizeable. An increase in (productive) spending in Germany and the Netherlands can boost GDP in these countries and also have significant positive spillovers on the rest of EA GDP, while the effects on current accounts are likely to be small. Effects can be even larger when investment is directed to the most productive projects. With low borrowing costs at present, the increase in government debt for surplus countries will be modest, while there could be an improvement in debt ratios in the rest of the Euro Area.
F45|Stagnation policy in the Eurozone and economic policy alternatives: A Steindlian/neo-Kaleckian perspective|Empirically, the macroeconomic institutions and the macroeconomic policy approach in the Eurozone have failed badly, both in terms of preventing the global financial and economic crisis from becoming a euro crisis and in generating a rapid recovery from the crisis, in particular. In this paper I will argue that the dominating macroeconomic policy regime in the Eurozone can be seen as a version of what Steindl (1979) had called ‘stagnation policy’. To underline this argument, I will provide a simple Steindlian distribution and growth model in order to identify the main channels through which stagnation policy affects accumulation and productivity growth. This will also provide a set of elements of a Steindlian anti-stagnation policy. Against this theoretical background I will then examine the macroeconomic institutions and the macroeconomic policy approach of the Eurozone which has been based on the New Consensus Macroeconomics (NCM) and I will highlight its main deficiencies. This will then provide the grounds for an outline of an alternative macroeconomic policy approach for the specific institutional setup of the Eurozone based on a post-Keynesian/Steindlian/neo-Kaleckian approach.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F45|Inspecting the Mechanism: Leverage and the Great Recession in the Eurozone|We provide a comprehensive account of the dynamics of eurozone countries from 2000 to 2012. We analyze private leverage, fiscal policy, labor costs, and spreads, and we propose a model and an identification strategy to separate the impact of credit cycles, excessive government spending, and sudden stops. We then ask how periphery countries would have fared with different policies. We find that countries could have stabilized their employment if they had followed more conservative fiscal policies during the boom. Macroprudential policies and an early intervention by the central bank to prevent market segmentation and reduce fiscal austerity would also have significantly reduced the recession.
F45|A policymaker’s guide to a Euro area stabilization fund|Abstract In 2012, several reports were published advocating the creation of a genuine fiscal capacity at the European level, to strengthen the foundations of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) by helping member countries to adjust to asymmetric shocks. The design of a common stabilization fund should be well thought, though: what would be stabilized? When would transfers be paid? Would they be directed towards governments or individuals? How would they be financed? And would they help stabilize economies? We address these questions by outlining recent existing proposals, their features and their simulated stabilization effects. We finally underline the difficulties in implementing such a scheme.
F45|Yields on sovereign debt, fragmentation and monetary policy transmission in the euro area: A GVAR approach|The divergence in sovereign yields has been presented as a reason for the lack of traction of monetary policy. We use a GVAR framework to assess the transmission of monetary policy in the period 2005-2016. We identify sovereign yield divergence as a key mechanism by which the leverage channel of monetary policy worked. Unconventional monetary policy was successful in mitigating this effect. When exploring the channels through which yields may affect the heterogeneous transmission of monetary policy, we find that the reaction of bank leverage depended substantially on where the sovereign yield originated, thus providing a mechanism that explains this heterogeneity. Second, large spillover effects meant that yield divergence decreased the traction of monetary policy even in anchor countries. Third, the heterogeneity in the transmission mechanism can be in part attributed to contagion from euro area wide sovereign stress. Fiscal credibility, therefore, may be an appropriate tool to enhance the output effect of monetary policy. Given the importance of spillovers, this credibility may be achieved by changes in the institutional make-up and policies in the euro area.
F45|Stock-flow consistent data for the Dutch economy, 1995-2015|In earlier work Meijers, Muysken (and Sleijpen) have developed an open economy stock-flow consistent (SFC) macroeconomic model of the Dutch economy with an elaborated financial sector. This model has been used to analyse several stylised facts of the Dutch economy, such as the deposit financing gap, the excessive trade surplus, the impact of firms accumulating financial assets and the impact of quantitative easing. However, the stylised facts were collected in an ad hoc way and the parameters used in the model were taken from the international literature, without proper reference to Dutch data. In the present paper we develop a stock flow consistent data set for the Dutch economy 1995 - 2015 in order to stimulate further research in the SFC tradition using actual data, and to enhance our understanding of the Dutch economy. The data set is based on data from the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) for most sectors - these are consistent with the AMECO data published by Eurostat. However, for the financial sector we show that the CBS-data are incomplete and also use data provided by the Dutch Central Bank (DNB). We distinguish between households, firms, government, a foreign sector and within the financial sector between a central bank, banks and pension funds. For each sector we provide a somewhat simplified balance sheet and consistent flows, which can be used in the model.
F45|Money and credit overhang in the euro area|In this paper, we employ panel co-integration techniques to identify and estimate homogeneous long-run equilibrium relations for money and credit for 10 euro area countries. Over the period 1999–2013, we do find evidence of such long-run relations when accounting for a structural break in 2008. While money and credit follow similar long run trends, the short and medium term relation between money and credit overhang is weak, throwing doubt on the hypothesis that money creating potential drives credit booms. Especially in current account deficit countries, we observe a sizable build-up of credit overhang prior to 2008. Positive (negative) credit overhang is strongly related to net foreign borrowing (lending).
F45|Persistence and stochastic convergence of euro area unemployment rates: evidence from LM and RALS-LM unit root tests with breaks|The goal of this paper is to determine if the euro area (EUA) accession and membership had a significant impact on the unemployment rates of the EUA countries. The hypothesis of the paper is that there is unemployment hysteresis and EUA accession thus contributed to the economic integration and convergence of the unemployment rates in the EUA. The paper employs LM and RALS-LM unit root tests with two breaks to analyze the persistence, test the stochastic convergence and locate structural break(s) in the seasonally adjusted quarterly unemployment rates, covering the period from 1995q1 to 2016q2. The most interesting results are that: (i) there are EUA-related down breaks in unemployment rates with hysteresis, (ii) EUA-related breaks are followed by the periods of convergence to the EUA11 average, (iii) crisis-related breaks are followed by the periods of divergence and (iv) the EUA membership is not a sufficient condition for stochastic convergence.
F45|Output gap similarities in Europe: Detecting country groups|The literature on business cycle synchronization in Europe frequently presumes an alleged 'core-periphery' pattern without providing empirical verification of the underlying cyclical (dis)similarities or the supposed but unobservable 'European business cycle(s)'. To provide a data-based country group analysis, we apply a fuzzy clustering approach to quarterly output gap series of 27 European countries over the period 1996-2015. Our results confirm the existence of a persistent core cluster as opposed to clusters on the Eastern and Southern European peripheries, highlighting the inadequate composition of the euro area (EA). Moreover, we find that Germany's business cycle is not a suitable substitute for the core. By analyzing the relation between the identified 'European core business cycle' and the peripheral cycles over time, we show diverging patterns for the southern periphery after the financial crisis, casting doubt on the endogeneity properties of the EA.
F45|The Euro from a business perspective|The euro area has several problems. Nevertheless, there is not only strong political support for it, but also most companies back the euro or at least do not complain. It is worthwhile to analyse which companies do profit from the euro and why most others do not oppose it. Exporting companies in the northern countries of the euro zone profit from the euro and the policies to save the common currency even if their countries and people suffer. Other companies, especially in the southern member countries, suffer themselves but fear a break-up of the euro area even more than its continuance. For small companies it is not worthwhile to lobby for other policies, while the companies worst affected already ceased to exist. All companies have to come to terms with the euro but should also prepare for the possible end of the euro zone. Companies in other European countries reconsider whether they really want their countries to join the euro area.
F45|Wirtschaftsethische Überlegungen zur Finanz- und Eurokrise|Die Finanz- und Eurokrise sind das gegenwärtig wichtigste wirtschaftliche und wirtschaftspolitische Thema, welches auch wirtschaftswissenschaftlich noch stärker untersucht und diskutiert werden sollte. Etliche Akteure haben zu diesen Krisen beigetragen, darunter auch Wirtschaftswissenschaftler. Es werden Möglichkeiten vorgestellt, wie sich die immer noch anhaltenden Eurokrise beenden und eine Wiederholung verhindern lässt.
F45|Export Subsidies and Interdependence in Euro Union: Beggar Thy Neighbor?| We examine the inter-linkages between economies in the European Monetary Union. We work through a baseline New Keynesian Model and include export subsidies into the analysis. Theoretically, it is plausible to have a beggar thy neighbor expansion of the core at the cost of periphery.
F45|Economic governance in the euro area: balancing risk reduction and risk sharing|The unchecked build-up of imbalances during the 2000s exposed the euro area to the risk of sudden stops. Such risk materialized in 2009â€“10 and its consequences were amplified by the absence of adequate institutions. Europe embarked on a thorough process of reforming its economic governance. We review the measures taken concerning sovereigns and banks since 2010 and discuss possible ways forward on both fronts. We argue that, while significant progress has been achieved, a lot of ground remains to be covered. In general, reforms have favoured risk reduction over risk sharing. As a result, in the face of exceptional circumstances, the euro area is not equipped with the fiscal tools necessary for macroeconomic stabilization; moreover, banking union lacks common financial backstops. Only further risk (and sovereignty) sharing can avoid harmful pro-cyclical excesses.
F45|EAGLE-FLI: A macroeconomic model of banking and financial interdependence in the euro area|We incorporate financial linkages in EAGLE, a New Keynesian multi-country dynamic general equilibrium model of the euro area (EA) by including financial frictions and country-specific banking sectors. In this new version, termed EAGLE-FLI (Euro Area and GLobal Economy with Financial LInkages), banks collect deposits from domestic households and cross-country inter-bank market and raise capital to finance loans issued to domestic households and firms. In order to borrow from local (regional) banks, households use domestic real estate whereas firms use both domestic real estate and physical capital as collateral. These features – together with the full characterization of trade balance and real exchange rate dynamics and with a rich array of financial shocks – allow to properly assessing domestic and cross-country macroeconomic effects of financial shocks. Our results support the views that (1) the business cycles in the EA can be driven not only by real shocks, but also by financial shocks, (2) the financial sector could amplify the transmission of (real) shocks, and (3) the financial/banking shocks and the banking sectors can be sources of business cycle asymmetries and spillovers across countries in a monetary union.
F45|The pre-Great Recession slowdown in productivity|In the years since the Great Recession, many observers have highlighted the slow pace of productivity growth around the world. For the United States and Europe, we highlight that this slow pace began prior to the Great Recession. The timing thus suggests that it is important to consider factors other than just the deep crisis itself or policy changes since the crisis. For the United States, at the frontier of knowledge, there was a burst of innovation and reallocation related to the production and use of information technology in the second half of the 1990s and the early 2000s. That burst ran its course prior to the Great Recession. Continental European economies were falling back relative to that frontier at varying rates since the mid-1990s. We provide VAR and panel-data evidence that changes in real interest rates have influenced productivity dynamics in this period. In particular, the sharp decline in real interest rates that took place in Italy and Spain seem to have triggered unfavorable resource reallocations that were large enough to reduce the level of total factor productivity, consistent with recent theories and firm-level evidence.
F45|How to Handle the Crisis in Greece? Empirical Evidence Based on a Survey of Economics Experts|We asked experts from 113 countries polled by the CESifo World Economic Survey for their opinions on how to handle the crisis in Greece. 61.9% of the experts surveyed were not in favour of Greece exiting the Eurozone in the course of the negotiations held in June and July 2015. However, experts in countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Denmark, and Slovakia were in favour of Greece exiting the Eurozone. The share of experts who were in favour of Greece staying in the Eurozone increased to 69.8% in October 2015. 72.4% of experts surveyed believed that the IMF should provide credit to Greece and 83.6% stated that the IMF should engage in economic reform programmes. Econometric evidence shows that experts from those Eurozone countries with high public debt-to-GDP-ratios were less likely to support the Grexit: when the debt-to-GDP-ratio increased by one percentage point, the likelihood of survey participants favouring the Grexit decreased by around 0.35 percentage points. Support for IMF reforms, by contrast, proved far less controversial.
F45|Euro-Area Fiscal Stance: From Theory to Practical Implementation|Despite large automatic stabilizers, the performance of the Euro area as a whole in terms of fiscal stabilization is relatively poor. This report argues that a meaningful fiscal stance for the Euro area should rely on the current account as a complement to the output gap, and be coordinated only in “exceptional” times, the usual bottom-up approach of fiscal policy remaining appropriate for “normal” times. In such setting, the European Fiscal Board would play a key role in advising the Commission on the existence of “exceptional” circumstances, on the adequate aggregate fiscal stance and on its desirable distribution across member states.
F45|Euro area imbalances|We argue that if currency union member states have different potential output per capita, output growth rates, or trade balances, the common monetary policy may not be optimal for all of them. Euro area imbalances for potential output and for trade balances are quite large, while output growth imbalances are more modest. Member states with larger imbalances of one type also have larger imbalances of both other types, but a decline of one imbalance need not coincide with a decline of the others. We also show that imbalances are fairly persistent, and are larger in poorer and smaller member states.
F45|A European Disease? Non-tradable Inflation and Real Interest Rate Divergence|This article studies the contribution of real interest rate divergence to the dynamics of the relative price of non-tradables within Europe. Extending the traditional Balassa–Samueslon effect, it shows that the real interest rate fall in the Euro area (EA) periphery following the single currency’s inception induced an increase in the relative price of non-tradable goods. Using a new data set, it documents the dynamics of the tradable and the non-tradable sectors over 1995–2013 and the expansion of the non-tradable sector in the periphery before the crisis. It then carries out an econometric estimation for 11 EA countries over 1995–2013 and quantifies the contribution of the pure Balassa–Samuelson effect and the impact of the interest rate on non-tradable relative prices. Diverging evolution in the interest rate impacted greatly the evolution of non-tradable relative prices within the EA over the period. In Greece, the fall in the real interest rate over 1995–2008 could explain almost half of the non-tradable price increase relative to the EA average, while in Germany the increase in the real interest rate might have contributed up to 7% of the decrease of the non-tradable price relative to the average of the EA.

F45|Divergence des prix relatifs : une maladie européenne ?|À l'introduction de l'euro, l’afflux de capitaux des pays les plus riches de la zone vers ceux en rattrapage s’est dirigé vers les secteurs les moins innovants. Cette mauvaise allocation des ressources a alimenté de fortes hausses de prix dans ces derniers et a contribué à la divergence des taux d’inflation entre les pays de la zone euro. Alors que les prix dans les secteurs fortement exposés à la concurrence internationale (comme les activités industrielles, le transport ou encore le tourisme) ont convergé dans la zone, les prix dans les secteurs qui en sont abrités (le secteur immobilier, la grande distribution ou la distribution d’eau et d’énergie notamment) ont fortement divergé. La périphérie a ainsi connu une très forte hausse des prix dans les secteurs abrités relativement aux secteurs exposés, dont les bulles immobilières n’expliquent qu’une partie. En cause, non seulement une perte de productivité relative, mais également la forte baisse des taux d’intérêt dans les pays périphériques.
F45|Drowned by Numbers? Designing an EU-wide Unemployment Insurance|The severity of the recent crisis has given rise to several proposals for the creation of a European unemployment insurance system. In this paper, we first explore the theoretical backgrounds of a common insurance system. We, then, analyze the main features of an EU-wide unemployment insurance, and explore its financial and political sustainability, under different scenarios, including a “US-equivalent” one. We finally highlight key issues with regard to implementation and potential undesirable effects.
F45|How Far From The Euro Area?|The article performs a comparative analysis between the European Union member states from Central and Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania) in terms of real economic convergence with the Euro area. Specifically, the paper emphasizes the assessment of the time required to catch up with the average level of GDP per capita in the euro area. To determine these developments, we use a system of chain indices, calculated based on the growth rate of the GDP per capita. Assuming that the average growth specific to the period 1999-2014 will continue in the future, the results illustrate that the shortest period of catching up belongs to Poland, while Croatia remains by far the most distant country from the euro area.
F45|La crisis del euro en perspectiva|Este artículo analiza la integración monetaria europea, los determinantes estructurales y los elementos disfuncionales de las instituciones de la Unión. Además, revisa dos lecturas que fallan al interpretar los acontecimientos: una interpretación ideológica que ve en la integración un proceso de convergencia que no se debe interferir, y una visión idealista que sostiene que la integración debe prevalecer sobre toda contradicción generada a nivel institucional. Su combinación sirvió para justificar las intervenciones poscrisis (la austeridad) y la construcción institucional posterior, que agravaron la inestabilidad macroeconómica en Europa.
F45|COEURE Survey: Fiscal and Monetary Policies after the Crises|We review the recent literature on macroeconomic stabilisation policy, with a particular focus on two major challenges that are particular to the post-crisis land- scape. These are, first, how to provide meaningful economic stimulus when the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is binding. Second, how to design a stabilisation policy for the Eurozone that will remedy the large macroeconomic imbalances among member states.
F45|Flexibility Versus Stability: A Difficult Tradeoff in the Eurozone|The optimal currency areas (OCA) theory has been influential in pushing eurozone countries towards structural reforms to make product and labour markets more flexible. The underlying assumption of the OCA prescription for structural reform is that asymmetric shocks are permanent. However, when shocks are temporary it does not follow that more flexibility is the answer. When shocks are the result of business cycle movements, the way to deal with them is by stabilisation efforts. We provide empirical evidence that suggests that the biggest shocks in the eurozone were the result of business cycle movements. These were relatively well synchronised, except for their amplitude. We argue that efforts to stabilise the business cycles should be strengthened relative to the efforts that have been made to impose structural reforms, and consider the implications for the governance of the eurozone.
F45|Sectoral allocation and macroeconomic imbalances in EMU|In the decade following the introduction of the euro, many Southern EMU members experienced sizeable capital inflows. We document how, instead of contributing to convergence, these flows mainly fueled growth of the nontradable sectors. We rationalize these developments using a tractable two-sector, two-region ('North' and 'South') model of a monetary union. We show how the sharp fall in Southern interest rates that occurred in the run-up to EMU, leads to a consumption boom, wage growth, growth of the nontradable sector, and a deteriorating external position. In the North, an opposite process occurs. As such, both real exchange rates and external positions of the two regions diverge. Including a third country with a flexible exchange rate vis-à-vis the euro amplifies the effects of monetary integration in the South, while dampening them in the North. Using a panel-BVAR, we confirm empirically that the euro area countries experiencing a fall in interest rates relative to the euro area average, experienced faster growth of the nontradable sector and a deteriorating current account balance. We investigate various policy reforms to speed up the necessary rebalancing process. A deepening of the European market shows most promise, boosting GDP growth while facilitating a rebalancing towards tradables.
F45|Euro Area Imbalances|We argue that if currency union member states have different potential output per capita, output growth rates, or trade balances, the common monetary policy may not be optimal for all of them. Euro area imbalances for potential output and for trade balances are quite large, while output growth imbalances are more modest. Member states with larger imbalances of one type also have larger imbalances of both other types, but a decline of one imbalance need not coincide with a decline of the others. We also show that imbalances are fairly persistent, and are larger in poorer and smaller member states.
