L59|Business Dynamics, Knowledge Economy, and the Economic Performance of African Countries|This paper develops a framework (a) to examine whether or not the African business environment hinders or promotes the knowledge economy (KE), (b) to determine how the KE affects economic performance, and (c) how economic performance relates to the inequality-adjusted human socioeconomic development (IHDI) of 53 African countries during the 1996-2010 time period. We estimate the linkages with three related equations. The results support a strong correlation between the dynamics of starting and doing business and variations in KE. The results also show that there exists a weak link between KE and economic performance. Nonetheless, KE-influenced performance plays a more important role in socioeconomic development than some of the conventional control variables like foreign direct investment (FDI), foreign aid, and even private investment.

L59|Using the Tools of Industrial Organization to Illuminate the Credit Rating Industry|Until slightly more than a decade ago, the credit rating industry was largely a little-recognized and little-understood part of the financial system â€œplumbingâ€ . This obscurity changed with the financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath. After a few years of intensive attention, however, the CRAs have retreated back to semi-obscurity and attract little media or political attention. The tools of industrial organization (IO) can help us understand this industry: its structure; its behavior; and its outcomes; and the public policies that are likely to improve its functioning.
L59|Challenges of Doing Business in Africa: A Systematic Review| This paper provides a systematic review of challenges to doing business in Africa. It complements the extant literature by answering two critical questions: what are the linkages between the ease of doing business and economic development; and what are the challenges to doing business in Africa? In providing answers to these questions, the nexus between the ease of doing business and economic development is discussed in six main strands, namely: wealth creation and sharing; opportunities of employment; balanced regional and economic development; Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and GDP per capita; standards of living and exports. Moreover, challenges to doing business are articulated along the following lines: (i) issues related to the cost of starting a business and doing business; (ii) shortage of energy and electricity; (iii) lack of access to finance; and (v) high taxes and low cross-border trade.
L59|Modified Genetic Algorithm Framework for Optimal Scheduling of Single Microgrid Combination with Distribution System Operator|In this paper, new reformed genetic algorithm (GA) according to the multicellular organism mechanism is developed for power management of single microgrid incorporation with the distribution system operator (DSO). Integration of single microgrid into the conventional grids cann enhance the complexity of the problem due to ability of disconnecting from the main grid as a standalone small electricity network. Hence, in this paper, a new evolutionary algorithm is developed to address the complexity of the problem. The main objective of the proposed model is to minimize the total operation cost of the microgrid in both utility connected and off utility connected modes; that means the objective is based on the economic consideration. To demonstrates the high performance and ability of the proposed method, a modified IEEE 33 distribution bus test network is selected and examined. Finally, the results are compared with the famous evolutionary algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO). In it worth noting that the results are only based on the economic consideration.
L59|Platform-mediated reputation systems in the sharing economy and incentives to provide service quality: the case of ridesharing services|Sharing economy platforms often use reputation systems to actively perform a ‘regulatory’/control role, by excluding from access to the platform users with ratings below a given threshold. We provide a multiple case study analysis of 9 platforms and investigate through a simple inter-temporal choice model the effect of the design of this specific application of online rating systems on users/providers’ incentives to ensure a high level of service quality. Compliance with the platform’s behavioural rules is imperfect even with perfect reviews and even if riders cannot switch across platforms. It can be increased by linking remuneration to performance and by increasing the opportunity cost of reintegrating the endowment of reputation, also by influencing providers’ perception of the magnitude of this cost. Thus, there may be an efficiency rationale for the controversial choice to willingly preserve riders’ uncertainty as to the operation of the algorithm and for portability of reputation.
L59|The Nature and Magnitude of the Effects of Asymmetric Regulation of Mobile Termination Rates on the Mexican Retail Prices|"In theory, network profits are independent of the reciprocal termination rates when operators charge nondiscriminatory call prices (Laffont, Rey and Tirole, 1998). Additionally, termination rates can be used to subsidize subscriber acquisition cost. This issue is typically known as a ""waterbed effect"", where a reduction (increase) in termination rates leads to corresponding increase (reduction) in subscription fees to consumers. We are using a practical case for testing the effects in the final prices for regulatory policy with several changes in mobile termination rates based on an asymmetric price access regulation. In our example, the termination rates have been part of a vertical restriction strategy. The observed network-base price discrimination implemented by the major network (Telcel) resulted in deadweight efficiencies lost and created barriers to new entrance and blocked growth for the small networks OECD (2012). Historically, profits margins and mobile prices comes down whenever regulator have reduced termination rates; following the income effects in subscription (Tangeras, 2014). Having in mind this fact, regulators would diminish termination rates in order to pushdown mobile prices and stimulate competition, rest on a cost-based asymmetric price regulation. The further research allows a statistical assessment of the asymmetric price regulation implemented by the Mexican regulatory authority during January 2013 to June 2017. This paper evaluates if asymmetric regulation brings a better impact in the Mexican consumer welfare, driving the retail prices of mobile services down, also the effectivity of this policy for the next years, taking in to account that there is not significant change in the market share among all mobile networks."
L59|Estimating the benefits of R&D subsidies for Germany|In Germany, R&D subsidies are an important tool to support innovation in the private sector. This paper studies the welfare effects of R&D subsidies distributed through the German federal government's thematic R&D programs between 1994 and 2011. The analysis is based on a structural model of the R&D subsidy process which allows to estimate the benefits of R&D subsides to the German economy. The model takes into account heterogeneous application costs of firms and identifies the effect of the subsidy on the federal government's utility as well as on firm profits. Assuming a welfare-maximizing federal government, the estimated average social rate of return is 34% for Germany in the period 1994 to 2011. Thereby effects on firm profits are similar to effects on spillovers to the rest of the German economy. Besides results show that the subsidy rate decision in Germany remained remarkably stable over time, and that application costs as well as the marginal profitability of subsidized R&D projects are lower after the year 2000 compared to the years before.
L59|Mobile Phone Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study assesses how knowledge diffusion modulates the effect of the mobile phone on entrepreneurship in Sub-Saharan Africa with data for the period 2000-2012.The empirical evidence is based on interactive Generalised Method of Moments in which mobile phones are interacted with three knowledge diffusion variables, namely: education, internet penetration and scientific output. Ten variables of entrepreneurship are used. The following three main findings are established. First, the net effects from interacting mobile phones with the internet and scientific publications are negative whereas the corresponding net impact from the interaction between mobile phones and education is positive on the cost of doing business. Second, the mobile phone interacts with education (the internet) to have a positive (negative) net effect on the time needed to construct a warehouse whereas, the corresponding interaction with the internet yields a net negative effect on the time to enforce a contract. Third, there is a positive net effect from the interaction of mobile phones with education on the time to start a business. Given the construction of the education variable, the positive net effects from education are consistent with corresponding negative net effects from the other knowledge diffusion variables. The main policy implication is that mobile phone innovation (by means of internet penetration, scientific output and quality education) decreases constraints of entrepreneurship. Suggestions on how to boost these knowledge diffusion channels are discussed. Other practical and theoretical implications are also covered. To the best our knowledge, this is the first inquiry to assess the relevance of mobile phone innovation in entrepreneurship in Sub-Saharan Africa.
L59|The role of mobile phones in governance-driven technology exports in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study assesses how the mobile phone influences governance to improve information and communication technology (ICT) exports in Sub-Saharan Africa with data from 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments and three main governance concepts are used, namely: (i) institutional (comprising the rule of law and corruption-control); (ii) political (involving political stability/no violence and voice & accountability) and (iii) economic (including regulation quality and government effectiveness) governance. The following findings are established. First, there are positive net effects on ICT goods exports from independent interactions between mobile phones and â€˜political stabilityâ€™ â€˜voice and accountabilityâ€™ and corruption-control. Second, significant net effects are not apparent from independent interactions between mobile phones and government effectiveness, regulation quality and the rule of law. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
L59|Mobile Phone Innovation and Technology-driven Exports in Sub-Saharan Africa|The study investigates how education, scientific output and the internet complement mobile phone penetration to affect technology commodity exports in Sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments. The following main findings are established. First, the internet complements the mobile phone to boost technology goods exports. Second, the internet also complements the mobile phone to boost technology service exports. Third, positive marginal effects are apparent in the roles of educational quality and scientific output on technology goods exports and technology service exports respectively while negative marginal impacts are apparent in the roles of scientific output and educational quality on technology goods exports and technology service exports respectively. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.
L59|The Role of Mobile Phones in Governance-Driven Technology Exports in Sub-Saharan Africa|Abstract This study assesses how the mobile phone influences governance to improve information and communication technology (ICT) exports in sub-Saharan Africa with data from 2000 to 2012. The empirical evidence is based on the generalised method of moments and three main governance concepts are used, namely (i) institutional (comprising the rule of law and corruption control), (ii) political (involving political stability/no violence and voice and accountability) and (iii) economic (including regulation quality and government effectiveness) governance. The following findings are established. First, there are positive net effects on ICT goods exports from independent interactions between mobile phones and ‘political stability’, ‘voice and accountability’ and corruption control. Second, significant net effects are not apparent from independent interactions between mobile phones and government effectiveness, regulation quality and the rule of law. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
L59|Minsky's Financial Fragility: An Empirical Analysis of Electricity Distribution Companies in Brazil (2007-15)|The present paper applies Hyman P. Minsky's insights on financial fragility in order to analyze the behavior of electricity distribution companies in Brazil from 2007 to 2015. More specifically, it builds an analytical framework to classify the firms operating in this sector into Minskyan risk categories and assess how financial fragility evolved over time, in each firm and in the sector as a whole. This work adapts Minsky's financial fragility indicators and taxonomy to the conditions of the electricity distribution sector and applies them to regulatory accounting data for more than 60 firms. This empirical application of Minsky's theory for analyzing firms engaged in the provision of public goods and services is a novelty. The results show an increase in the financial fragility of those firms (as well as the sector) throughout the period, especially between 2008 and 2013, even though the number of firms operating at the highest level of financial risk hardly changed.

L59|Why Geographic Dispersion Before Its Time: Industrial Policy and Economic Geography in the People’s Republic of China|We investigate the trends and determinants of geographic concentration and industrial specialization in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) using interprovincial panel data for the period from 1999 to 2010. It shows that, after 2005, both geographic concentration and industrial specialization began to decrease, resulting in an increased similarity of provincial industrial structure. Industrial policies of provincial governments cause geographic dispersion and inverse specialization. The result is robust when using instrumental variables to deal with possible reverse causality and omitted variable problems. The mechanism behind this is that central government industrial policy, which tends to last for several years, is an important reference document for each provincial planner. This causes the less-developed regions to deviate from their comparative advantages, resulting in a combination of insufficient geographic concentration and inverse specialization in the PRC.
L59|G20 safeguards digital economy vulnerabilities with financial sector focus|The G20 can ensure a secure, resilient, sustainable and responsible digital economy, especially in the financial sector, by removing vulnerabilities in Internet infrastructure, encouraging cross-border cooperation, providing guidance to telecommunications regulators and implementing norms regarding cyber-attacks.
L59|Mobile phones, institutional quality and entrepreneurship in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study investigates whether mobile phone penetration modulates the effect of different indicators of governance on some indicators of the ease of doing business in Sub-Saharan Africa with data from the period 2000–2012 by employing the Generalised Method of Moments. Three broad concepts of governance are explored: (i) political (comprising voice & accountability and political stability/no violence), (ii) economic (involving government effectiveness and regulation quality) and (iii) institutional (including corruption-control and rule of law). Ten dimensions of entrepreneurship are considered. Two main findings are established with respect to the net effects of the interaction between mobile phones and governance dynamics. They are (1) reduced cost of business start-up procedure, the time to build a warehouse and the time to resolve an insolvency and (2) increased time to enforce a contract, to register a property and to prepare and pay taxes. Implications for theory and policy are discussed. Some of the engaged policy implications include the following. (i) Measures on how to leverage on the potential of mobile phone penetration for entrepreneurship opportunities by addressing challenge of access to and affordability of mobile phones on the one hand and on the other hand, improving on the role of the mobile phone as a participative interface between emerging entrepreneurs and governance. (ii) The relevance of the mobile phone in mitigating information asymmetry between entrepreneurs and government institutions, notably by: reducing government inefficiency (which potentially represents an additional cost to doing business) and decreasing informational rents, bureaucracy and transaction costs.
L59|Baggage fees, operational performance and customer satisfaction in the US air transport industry|In recent years, there has been a â€œde-bundlingâ€ trend in the US airline industry, where specific services that used to be included in a ticket fare are now priced separately. Although a major reason for these fees is to raise revenues for the airlines, the fees may also impact the operations of carriers. Among the new fees implemented by most US carriers is a payment for checked baggage. This paper analyzes the association of baggage fees with airline operational service outcomes, as measured by flight delays, mishandled baggage rates and the rate of customer complaints. Using data from the US domestic air transport market over the period 2004â€“2012 and estimating a series of equations, our results show that, on average, an increase in baggage fees is associated with a decrease in the mishandled baggage rate and to a reduction in the percentage of delayed flights. No significant association is found between the fees and the rate of customer complaints.
L59|Evaluating the Regulatory Burden: Pollutant Release and Transfer Reporting Costs|Environmental information disclosure instruments inevitably also carry information costs. It is important to pay attention to these costs because of the competitiveness issues connected with the regulatory burden of the private sector or the overall cost-effectiveness of different types of environmental regulation from the public sector point of view. We undertake an ex-post analysis to quantify and analyse reporting costs of private sector induced by the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR). We focus on the case of the Czech Republic. The average annual reporting costs, additional to other reporting duties, are € 365 per facility. The Czech PRTR comprises 8 times more facilities than required by the European law, and thereby increases correspondingly the total reporting costs. The best predictor variable of the costs is the need for measuring or calculating additional releases or transfers beyond the information requirements of other registers.
L59|The Impact of Entrepreneurship on Knowledge Economy in Africa|Purpose - The paper assesses how entrepreneurship affects knowledge economy (KE) in Africa. Design/methodology/approach – Entrepreneurship is measured by indicators of starting, doing and ending business. The four dimensions of the World Bank’s index of KE are employed. Instrumental variable panel fixed effects are applied on a sampled of 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010. Findings –The following are some findings. First, creating an enabling environment for starting business can substantially boost most dimensions of KE. Second, doing business through mechanisms of trade globalisation has positive effects from sectors that are not ICT and High-tech oriented. Third, the time required to end business has negative effects on KE. Practical implications – Our findings confirm the narrative that the technology in African countries at the moment may be more imitative and adaptive for reverse-engineering in ICTs and high-tech products. Given the massive consumption of ICT and high-tech commodities in Africa, the continent has to start thinking of how to participate in the global value chain of producing what it consumes. Originality/value – This paper has a twofold motivation. First, given the ambitions of African countries of moving towards knowledge based economies, the line of inquiry is timely. Second, investigating the nexus may have substantial poverty mitigation and sustainable development implications. These entail inter alia: the development of technology with value-added services; enhancement of existing agricultural practices; promotion of conditions that are essential for competitiveness and adjustment of globalization challenges.
L59|The Role of Knowledge Economy in African Business|Abstract This paper assesses the role of knowledge economy (KE) in African business in 53 countries for the period 1996–2010. The four KE components of the World Bank are employed, notably: education, innovation, economic incentives and institutional regime, and information and communication technology. The business indicators are classified into starting, doing, and ending business. Principal component analysis and panel instrumental variable fixed effect approaches are employed as empirical strategies. The findings which are broadly consistent with intuition and the predictions of economic theory suggest that KE policies will substantially boost the starting and doing of business in Africa. This is relevant in fighting unemployment and improving African competitiveness in global value chains. Policy implications for the relevance of each specific KE dimension in African business are discussed with particular emphasis on the theoretical underpinnings of the study. The investigation is original in its contribution at the same time to the scarce literature on African KE and the growing challenges of improving the business climate of the continent by means of KE.
L59|Do Right to Work Laws Worsen Income Inequality? Evidence from the Last Five Decades| There is an ongoing debate about whether changes in labor regulations such as Right to Work (RTW) laws are contributing to the rising trend of income inequality in the U.S. We adopt Synthetic Control Method (SCM) for comparative case study to examine the impact of a state’s adoption of RTW law on its income inequality. We use a wide range of inequality measures for Idaho, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas, states that enacted RTW between the 1960s and the 2000s. We find that RTW did not impact income inequality in these states. This result is underpinned by additional finding of a lack of impact of RTW on unionization and investment.
L59|The tradeoff between ex ante and ex post transaction costs: Evidence from legal opinions|Business firms' formalization has been seen primarily as an entry barrier, which has often led to policies focused on simplifying formalities and creating minimalist company registries. This approach has been criticized on theoretical grounds for ignoring the tradeoff between ex ante registration and ex post transaction costs. This paper tests for the presence of this tradeoff in the context of company registries. In particular, using purpose-built indexes, we test for whether stronger registration requirements decrease the length of lawyer comments on model transactional legal opinions included in an authoritative report on legal opinions created by the International Bar Association. These lawyer comments proxy for due-diligence costs associated with executing large, cross-country company transactions. We confirm the presence of the tradeoff by finding that in countries with less stringent registration requirements, legal opinion comments are longer, even after controlling for the legal origin, European Union affiliation, and the log of per capita GDP.

L59|Does one more or one less mobile operator affect prices? A comprehensive ex-post evaluation of entries and mergers in European mobile telecommunication markets|This paper estimates the impact of entries and mergers on the price of mobile voice services in a panel database of 27 European Member States between 2003 and 2010. Our difference-in-differences econometric methodology exploits the variance in different structural changes between countries to separate the respective effects. Our results show that the effect of entry crucially depends on the number of active operators and the type of entrant, and not controlling for these differences might lead to misleading conclusions. We find no robust evidence that entry has a price-decreasing effect on markets with originally 2 operators. However, the entry of a 4th operator does have a price-decreasing effect, but with different dynamics concerning the entrant's type. When we separate entry effects for the subsequent years, we show that the significant price-decreasing effects for local operators entering occur only in the first year after entry, while the price-decreasing effects for multinational entries are significantly larger on the long-run. Last, we find no price-increasing effects of 5-to-4 mergers, but a long run price-increasing effect of a 4-to-3 merger.

L59|Economic Implications of Business Dynamics for KE-Associated Economic Growth and Inclusive Development in African Countries|This paper develops an empirically-relevant framework (a) to examine whether or not the African business environment hinders or promotes the knowledge economy (KE), (b) to determine how the KE which emerges from such an environment affects economic growth, and (c) how growth in turn relates to the ‘inclusive development’ of 53 African countries during the 1996-2010 time period. The framework provides a modest guide to policymaking about, and further research into, such relationships. We implement the framework by building a three-stage model and rationalizing it as five interrelated hypotheses. To allow greater concentration on the issues that are themselves already complex, our model is very simple, but clear. For example, we make neither an attempt to evaluate causality nor to test for it, even though we suspect the links to be multi-directional – opportunity costs are everywhere. Instead we focus on fundamental relationships between the dynamics of starting business and doing business as expressed in the state of KE, and through it to the inclusive development via the economic growth of those countries. Estimation results indicate that the dynamics of starting and doing business explain strongly a large part of variations in KE. The link between KE and economic growth exists, but it is weak, and we provide plausible reasons for such a result. Despite the weak association between KE and economic growth, KE-influenced growth plays a very important role in inclusive development. In fact, growth of this kind has stronger effects on inclusive development and by implication on poverty reduction, than some of conventional controls in this study such as FDI, foreign aid, and even private investment. There is clearly room for further research to improve the results, but just as clearly practical policy is best served by not neglecting the relationships examined in this paper.
L59|Open access to data: An ideal professed but not practised|Data-sharing is an essential tool for replication, validation and extension of empirical results. Using a hand-collected data set describing the data-sharing behaviour of 488 randomly selected empirical researchers, we provide evidence that most researchers in economics and management do not share their data voluntarily. We derive testable hypotheses based on the theoretical literature on information-sharing and relate data-sharing to observable characteristics of researchers. We find empirical support for the hypotheses that voluntary data-sharing significantly increases with (a) academic tenure, (b) the quality of researchers, (c) the share of published articles subject to a mandatory data-disclosure policy of journals, and (d) personal attitudes towards “open science” principles. On the basis of our empirical evidence, we discuss a set of policy recommendations.

L59|The Silence at the Stands: Agony in the Portuguese Market for Taxis|Taxis cannot come cheap. You are driven by a professional with all the flexibility of cars minus several inconveniences. And yet … why aren’t they? Drivers will grumble about prohibitive gas prices not covering lousy fares. The root, and truth, of the matter lies in service: clients, miles… and the dearth of them.The market fits a description of a free-entry cartel, run by associations, tolerated by a captured regulator, where neither entry nor exit budge price. For consumers, it is a raw deal. Meanwhile, monopoly profits are squandered among the maximum of deadbeats, who barely get by. Better if regulation evolved from the capture by the drivers’ organizations, towards price and licenses set according to traffic levels, after a clearing negative price shock. Does it matter? Taxis can be precious in bridging the gap between the shunned efficient public transports and environmentally unsound and pricey motoring.
L59|World Bank Doing Business Project and the statistical methods based on ranks: the paradox of the time indicator|The Doing Business (DB) Project of the World Bank has a large impact on media, policy makers and private sector and could have a significant influence on future policies implementation. For these reasons it would be important to better evaluate the rank criteria and avoid the choice of indicators that would possibly alter the nature of the empirical cases. After presenting the general principles of the percentile rank, we focus on the DB criteria for assigning the score to the time indicator. The paradox emerged from the analysis stresses the need of an empirical counterproof in order to avoid significant biases of the nature and the order of the considered phenomenon

This article gives a short insight into Luigi Bodio’s life and may be useful to the Italian and the International Communities interested in the history of statistics and in the origins of international statistical cooperation.
L59|The StoNED age: the departure into a new era of efficiency analysis? A monte carlo comparison of StoNED and the “oldies” (SFA and DEA)|Based on the seminal paper of Farrell (J R Stat Soc Ser A (General) 120(3):253–290, 1957 ), researchers have developed several methods for measuring efficiency. Nowadays, the most prominent representatives are nonparametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) and parametric stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), both introduced in the late 1970s. Researchers have been attempting to develop a method which combines the virtues—both nonparametric and stochastic—of these “oldies”. The recently introduced Stochastic non-smooth envelopment of data (StoNED) by Kuosmanen and Kortelainen (J Prod Anal 38(1):11–28, 2012 ) is such a promising method. This paper compares the StoNED method with the two “oldies” DEA and SFA and extends the initial Monte Carlo simulation of Kuosmanen and Kortelainen (J Prod Anal 38(1):11–28, 2012 ) in several directions. We show, among others, that, in scenarios without noise, the rivalry is still between the “oldies”, while in noisy scenarios, the nonparametric StoNED PL now constitutes a promising alternative to the SFA ML.

L59|Toward a Competitive Pakistan: The Role of Industrial Policy|This paper’s basic premise is that an improvement in Pakistan’s export performance is crucial to raising economic growth. After examining the reasons generally given for Pakistan’s poor export performance, we conclude that the country’s very slow productivity growth was the single most important factor that hurt competitiveness. We argue that a coherent and articulated industrial policy is required to overcome this disadvantage. While the experience of the East Asian economies offers useful lessons, Pakistan’s policy must accord with its own conditions, which are, in many ways, different. The formulation of industrial policy should involve key stakeholders, particularly the private sector. The paper identifies certain factors that should underpin the new industrial policy, notably the changed basis of international specialization and rules governing world trade.
L59|Open access to research data: Strategic delay and the ambiguous welfare effects of mandatory data disclosure|Mandatory disclosure of research data is an essential feature for credible empirical work but comes at a cost: First, authors might invest less in data generation if they are not the full residual claimants of their data after the first journal publication. Second, authors might “strategically delay” the time of submission of papers in order to fully exploit their data in subsequent research. We analyze a three-stage model of publication and data disclosure. We find that the welfare effects of universal mandatory data disclosure are ambiguous. The mere implementation of mandatory data disclosure policies may be welfare-reducing, unless accompanied by appropriate incentives which deter strategic delay.
L59|The Indicators of the Economic Burdens of Environmental Policy Design: Results from the OECD Questionnaire|Environmental policies seek to address market failures related to the protection of the environment. However, they may also increase barriers to entry and distort competition. If stringent environmental policies can be designed in a way that minimises such economic burdens, they can facilitate the achievement of economic and environmental goals and a cleaner growth model. This paper reports evidence on selected competition-relevant aspects of environmental policy design from a cross-country questionnaire. Information on administrative burdens related to environmental licenses, differential treatment among incumbents and new entrants and the procedures to evaluate economic effects of environmental policies are summarised in a set of indicators of the Burden on the Economy due to Environmental Policies (BEEP). The indicators allow for a set of tentative conclusions. Firstly, the BEEP captures information on anti-competitive regulations absent from the OECD’s product market regulation indicators (PMR). Secondly, though it is not yet possible to evaluate the economic impact of anti-competitive aspects of environmental policies, it is likely they impact well beyond the sectors directly concerned, hampering productivity growth, as shown for other product market regulations. Finally, the burdens of environmental policies are not related to their actual stringency, indicating that ambitious environmental targets can be pursued in ways that are more (or less) friendly to competition. Les indicateurs des charges économiques inhérentes à la conception des politiques environnementales : Résultats du questionnaire de l'OCDE Les politiques environnementales s’efforcent de remédier aux défaillances du marché en matière de protection de l’environnement. Il se peut cependant qu’elles renforcent aussi les obstacles à l’entrée et faussent la concurrence. Si des politiques environnementales strictes peuvent être conçues de telle façon que ces charges économiques soient réduites au minimum, elles pourront faciliter la réalisation des objectifs économiques et environnementaux et l’avènement d’un modèle de croissance plus propre. Ce document présente des données tirées d’un questionnaire transnational concernant certains aspects de la conception des politiques environnementales en rapport avec la concurrence. Les informations ayant trait aux charges administratives associées aux systèmes de licences environnementales, au traitement différentiel des acteurs en place et des nouveaux entrants, ainsi qu’aux procédures suivies pour évaluer l’impact économique des politiques d’environnement sont résumées dans un ensemble d’indicateurs BEEP (Burden on the Economy due to Environmental Policies). L’examen de ces indicateurs permet de tirer une série de conclusions préliminaires. Premièrement, malgré la montée des préoccupations concernant les aspects anticoncurrentiels de la réglementation des marchés de produits, les problèmes analogues associés aux politiques environnementales n’ont pas retenu la même attention. Deuxièmement, les données disponibles sur la réglementation des marchés de produits en général montrent que les gains procurés par les réglementations respectueuses de la concurrence sont importants, et qu’il en est probablement de même pour les politiques environnementales. Enfin, il n’y a pas de lien entre les charges associées aux politiques de l’environnement et le degré de rigueur de ces politiques, de sorte qu’il est possible de poursuivre d’ambitieux objectifs environnementaux de façon plus (ou moins) favorable à la concurrence.
L59|Investment in Fixed Broadband Networks and Access Regulation in Developed and Developing countries: Panel Data Applications|Since the USA Telecommunications Act of 1996, the regulatory frameworks, have led to the requirement of different policy practices in many countries across the world in order to establish sustainable competition in whole telecommunication markets. These regulatory reforms are the privatization of the telecom historical integrated monopoly (the incumbent), the independency of the regulatory authority, the obligation of transparency of the access price and agreements & the unbundling, the separation and the access pricing policies. This paper suggests an empirical investigation on both the individual, and the global impacts of these different regulatory policy practices on broadband deployment. To this end, we construct a panel data covering 107 developed and developing countries over the period of eight years from 2004 to 2011. Using the Instrumental variables (IV) & the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) with fixed effects and robust to heteroskedastic and autocorrelated errors, we show that the relationship between regulation and broadband investment is an inverted U shape in developed world while it takes a U form in developing countries. This means that in developed countries, a less restrictive regulatory policy spurs broadband deployment while more stringent policy discourages innovation in telecom industry. However, in the developing countries, the regulation has a strict negative impact on broadband deployment.
L59|Economic Implications of Business Dynamics for KE-Associated Economic Growth and Inclusive Development in African Countries|This paper develops an empirically-relevant framework (a) to examine whether or not the African business environment hinders or promotes the knowledge economy (KE), (b) to determine how the KE which emerges from such an environment affects economic growth, and (c) how growth in turn relates to the ‘inclusive development’ of 53 African countries during the 1996-2010 time period. The framework provides a modest guide to policymaking about, and further research into, such relationships. We implement the framework by building a three-stage model and rationalizing it as five interrelated hypotheses. To allow greater concentration on the issues that are themselves already complex, our model is very simple, but clear. For example, we make neither an attempt to evaluate causality nor to test for it, even though we suspect the links to be multi-directional – opportunity costs are everywhere. Instead we focus on fundamental relationships between the dynamics of starting business and doing business as expressed in the state of KE, and through it to the inclusive development via the economic growth of those countries. Estimation results indicate that the dynamics of starting and doing business explain strongly a large part of variations in KE. The link between KE and economic growth exists, but it is weak, and we provide plausible reasons for such a result. Despite the weak association between KE and economic growth, KE-influenced growth plays a very important role in inclusive development. In fact, growth of this kind has stronger effects on inclusive development and by implication on poverty reduction, than some of conventional controls in this study such as FDI, foreign aid, and even private investment. There is clearly room for further research to improve the results, but just as clearly practical policy is best served by not neglecting the relationships examined in this paper.
L59|Integrated Timetables for Railway Passenger Transport Services|Rail passenger transport services with integrated regular interval timetables (IRIT) offer passengers a regular interval timetable for services on the railway network. IRIT have the potential to increase the quality and attractiveness of railway passenger services in comparison to other transport modes. This article summarizes the advantages and challenges of an implementation of IRIT for railway passenger services and derives the main requirements for the successful introduction of IRIT. The comparison of the regulatory framework, the role of IRIT and the development of passenger railway services in CH, the NL and the UK, shows that in those countries, where either IRIT has been introduced (CH) or the high frequency of trains between cities provides for a system comparable to IRIT (NL), railway services play a more important role in the modal split. The successful introduction of IRIT requires a longrun implementation schedule which identifies the necessary investments in the railway infrastructure and points out the financial resources available to make those investments. Furthermore, IRIT requires a high level of punctuality of railway passenger services, the coordination between railway companies when designing the timetable and a priority rule for passenger railway services within IRIT when there are capacity restrictions on the railway network.
L59|Towards a green internal electricity market: The self-regulation of European Transmission System Operators for Electricity within EU multilevel governance|Due to the 3rd Energy Package of 2009 the regulation of European electricity transmission did change considerably. Before, cross-border electricity issues have been regulated by voluntary contractual agreements between Transmission System Operators. Now, the new-founded Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) are guiding this process together with the European Commission. Currently, these organizations are developing network codes to be implemented as binding EU electricity transmission regulation within the next years. This paper analyzes, if this new regulation process does promote the creation of an internal electricity market as well as a better integration of intermittent renewable ('green') energies due to the multilevel governance approach.
L59|Is Subsidizing Companies in Difficulties an Optimal Policy? An Empirical Study on the Effectiveness of State Aid in the European Union|Even though state aid in order to rescue or restructure ailing companies is regularly granted by European governments, it is often controversially discussed. The aims for rescuing companies are manifold and vary from social, industrial and even political considerations. Well-known examples are Austrian Airlines (Austria) or MG Rover (Great Britain). Yet, this study aims to answer the question whether state aid is used effectively and whether the initial aim why aid has been paid has been reached, i.e. the survival of the company. By using data on rescued companies in the EU and applying a survival analysis, this paper investigates the survival rates of these companies up to 15 years after the aid has been paid. In addition, the results are compared to the survival rates of non-rescued companies which have also been in difficulties. The results suggest that despite the financial support, business failure is often only post-poned; best survival rates have firms with long-term restructuring, enterprises in Eastern Europe, smaller firms and mature companies. However, non-funded companies have an even higher ratio to go bankrupt.
L59|Benchmarking and regulation|Benchmarking methods, and in particular Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), have become well-established and informative tools for economic regulation. DEA is now routinely used by European regulators to set reasonable revenue caps for energy transmission and distribution system operators. The application of benchmarking in regulation, however, requires specific steps in terms of data validation, model specification and outlier detection that are not systematically documented in open publications, leading to discussions about regulatory stability and economic feasibility of these techniques. In this paper, we review the modern foundations for frontier-based regulation and we discuss its actual use in several jurisdictions.
L59|Market failures and the additionality effects of public support to private R&D: Theory and empirical implications|We extend the theoretical basis of the empirical literature on the effects of R&D subsidies by providing an estimable model of strategic interaction among subsidy applicants, and public and private sector R&D financiers. Our model incorporates fixed R&D cost and a cost of external finance. We derive the optimal support rule. At the intensive (extensive) margin the costs of external funding reduce (increase) the optimal subsidy rate. We also establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of additionality. It turns out that additionality at the intensive margin is less likely with higher spillovers. Our results suggest that the relationship between additionality and welfare may not be straightforward.
L59|Innovation Policy and Economic Growth|This paper establishes theoretically a link between investments in economic growth and investments in R and D. This raises the importance of innovation policies as they are designed to narrow the gap between the socially optimal and the privately optimal levels of R and D. As innovation policies may be subject to crowding-out effects, we, second, empirically test whether R and D subsidies stimulate private investment in two countries of the European economic area. We employ Belgian and German firm level data for estimating treatment effects models. It turns out that public R and D grants stimulate private investments in both countries. Furthermore, the estimated treatment effects vary with the innovation experience of firms and their past labor productivity.
L59|“One more lie: the ‘Monday effect’ in Spain’s retail petrol market”|Empirical evidence drawn from the economic literature points to a low level of competition in the retail petrol market. Similar evidence can be found for the Spanish market. In fact, both Spain’s antitrust authority (Comisión Nacional de la Competencia) and its energy regulator (Comisión Nacional de la Energía) have recently initiated disciplinary proceedings against the majors on the grounds of suspected price manipulation in the retail petrol market. They are accused of cutting retail prices on Mondays so as to distort the rank position of Spain in European Union statistics in a practice that has received the name of the ‘Monday effect’. Here, we analyze this effect by constructing a database that includes daily retail prices for all petrol stations in Spain in the period 2009-2012, and a more detailed database for the city of Barcelona in 2013. Our estimations confirm that: i) in 2011 and 2012 prices fell on Mondays at retailers branded by majors; ii) prices were unchanged at stations in our two control groups; iii) prices were also seen to fall when a more detailed analysis was conducted, and this price cut was also found in 2013. In short, one more indicator of collusion in this sector and … one more lie.

L59|Estimating the Benefits of Targeted R&D Subsidies| We study the expected welfare effects of targeted R&D subsidies using project-level data from Finland. We model the application and R&D investment decisions of firms and the subsidy-granting decision of the public agency in charge of the program. Our model and institutional environment allow us to identify different benefits and costs of the R&D subsidy program. We find that expected effects of subsidies are very heterogeneous and estimated application costs low on average. The social rate of return on targeted subsidies is 30% to 50%, but spillover effects of subsidies are smaller than effects on firm profits. © 2013 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

L59|Does one more or one less mobile opertor affect prices? A comprehensive ex-post evaluation of entries and mergers in European mobile telecommunication markets|This paper estimates the impact of entries and mergers on the price of mobile voice services in a panel database of 27 European Member States between 2003 and 2010. Our difference-in-differences econometric methodology exploits the variance in different structural changes between countries to separate the respective effects. Our results show that the effect of entry crucially depends on the number of active operators and the type of entrant, and not controlling for these differences might lead to misleading conclusions. We find no robust evidence that entry has a price-decreasing effect on markets with originally 2 operators. However, the entry of a 4th operator does have a price-decreasing effect, but with different dynamics concerning the entrant's type. When we separate entry effects for the subsequent years, we show that the significant price-decreasing effects for local operators entering occur only in the first year after entry, while the price-decreasing effects for multinational entries are significantly larger on the long-run. Last, we find no price-increasing effects of 5-to-4 mergers, but a long run price-increasing effect of a 4-to-3 merger.

L59|The impact of airport competition on technical efficiency: A stochastic frontier analysis applied to Italian airport|We investigate how the intensity of competition among airports affects their technical efficiency by computing airportsâ€™ markets on the basis of a potential demand approach. We find that the intensity of competition has a negative impact on airportsâ€™ efficiency in Italy from 2005 to 2008. This implies that airports belonging to a local air transportation system where competition is strong exploit their inputs less intensively than do airports with local monopoly power. Further, we find that public airports are more efficient than private and mixed ones. Hence, policy makers should provide incentives to implement airportsâ€™ specialization in local systems where competition is strong and monitor the inputsâ€™ utilization rate even when private investors are involved.

L59|Does Rigidity of Prices Hide Collusion?|Cartel detection is one of the most basic and most complicated tasks of competition authorities. In recent years, however, variance filters have provided a fairly simple tool for rejecting the existence of price-fixing, with the added advantage that the methodology requires only a low volume of data. In this paper we analyze two aspects of variance filters: (i) the relationship that can be established between market structure and price rigidity, and (ii) the use of different benchmarks for implementing the filters. This paper addresses these two issues by applying a variance filter to a gasoline retail market that is characterized by a set of unique features. Our results confirm the positive relationship between monopoly and price rigidity, and confirm the variance filter’s ability to detect non-competitive behavior when an appropriate benchmark is used. Our findings should serve to promote the implementation of this methodology among competition authorities, albeit in the awareness that a more exhaustive complementary analysis is required.

L59|Analysys Of Employment Protection Legislation: A Model With Endogenous Labour Productivity|This paper analyses the effects of different labour market regimes on the workers choice on effort, emphasizing the role of the Employment Protection Legislation. The different EPL are modelled through an easy theoretical pattern, characterized by endogenous labour productivity. In particular, it is analysed how the labour productivity is influenced by the incentives that the different EPL give workers. The main results highlight that the recent labour market reforms produce only a positive temporary effect on the unemployment level, as confirmed by the empirical evidence. Finally, this paper analyses a new contractual regime in order to see if it could offer a better solution in term of structural employment respect to the standard regimes.
L59|Regulation and Investment in Network Industries: Evidence from European Telecoms|We provide evidence of an inherent trade-off between access regulation and investment incentives in telecommunications by using a comprehensive data set covering more than 70 fixed-line operators in 20 countries over 10 years. Our econometric model accommodates different investment incentives for incumbents and entrants, a strategic interaction of entrants' and incumbents' investments, and endogenous regulation. We find access regulation to have a negative effect on both total industry and individual carrier investment. Thus, promoting market entry by means of regulated access undermines incentives to invest in facilities-based competition. Moreover, we find evidence of a regulatory commitment problem: higher investments by incumbents encourage regulated access provision.
L59|Competition in Germany's Minute Reserve Power Market: An Econometric Analysis|The German reserve power market was subject to important regulatory changes in recent years. A new market design was created by synchronization and interconnection of the four control areas. In this paper, we analyze whether or not the reforms led to lower prices for minute reserve power (MRP). In contrast to existing papers, we use a unique panel dataset to account for unobserved heterogeneity between the four German regional markets. Moreover, we control for endogeneity by using weather data as instruments for electricity spot market prices. We find that the reforms were jointly successful in decreasing MRP prices leading to substantial cost savings for the transmission system operators.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L59|Industry Self-Governance and National Security: On the Private Control of Dual Use Technologies|Private sector firms frequently sell dual use products that can be used to develop either civilian goods or weapons of mass destruction. The global character of these markets makes traditional regulation and treaty solutions difficult. Some existing initiatives by manufacturers have established private regulations that are stronger than official US policy. This paper explores the economic conditions that make such strong, industry-wide agreements stable. We assume two risks due to the dual use nature. First, upstream firms face legal liability if their products lead to a disaster. Second, a disaster may produce regulatory backlash, i.e. excessive government regulation that make downstream production prohibitive costly. We find that regulatory backlash is never an adequate substitute for perfect (i.e. full) liability and even makes the situation worse. Second, industry regulation enforced by downstream firms and optimal regulation converge when the downstream firms have strong market power. Next, we analyze when and why large downstream firms are able to force their preference for high levels of regulation on upstream suppliers. Finally we show that upstream incumbents may be able to deter entry in adopting a high regulatory standard.

L59|Comment les quotas de diffusion radiophonique nuisent à la diversité|Most developed countries impose quotas of domestic contents in broadcasting. Their alleged aim is to promote diversity by fostering domestic content and hence a more diverse production. This reasoning ignores a possible trade-off between repetition and new program diffusion. When domestic and foreign contents are imperfectly substituable, a broadcaster confronted with a quota will find optimal to compensate for the reduction of foreign programming by increasing the number of diffusions of (imperfectly) substitutable domestic programs. Total broadcasting time being limited, this will force the broadcaster to abandon less popular types of programming, whereby reducing program diversity. Classification JEL : L59, L82, Z10

L59|Merger control regulation in Italy: what is part of an Undertaking?|La disciplina nazionale sul controllo delle concentrazioni prevede un obbligo di notifica quando il fatturato delle imprese interessate (ovverosia la somma del fatturato del gruppo acquirente e della società oggetto di acquisizione) supera la soglia di 472 milioni di euro realizzati in Italia o quando il fatturato dell'impresa oggetto di acquisizione sia pari o superiore a 47 milioni di euro realizzati sempre in ambito nazionale. Le due soglie sono alternative; pertanto se un'impresa che da sola realizza già 472 milioni, acquista un'altra impresa anche con fatturato minimo, saremmo in presenza di un obbligo di notifica: non sussiste, infatti, nel nostro ordinamento alcuna regola de minimis. La peculiarità del sistema di notifica nazionale rende dunque necessario definire con precisione un contenuto minimo della nozione di impresa (e dunque di parte d'impresa) per discernere, nelle situazioni limite, quando l'acquisizione di asset dialuogo o meno ad un obbligo di notifica (assumendo ovviamente il superamento delle soglie sopra descritte). Il presente lavoro si pone l'obiettivo di chiarire il contenuto minimo della nozione di «parte d'impresa» nel contesto della disciplina del controllo delle concentrazioni; a tal proposito, si è tenuto conto sia di una importante sentenza del Consiglio di Stato, sia degli orientamenti dell'Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato e della Commissione europea. Nell'ambito dell'articolo gli acquisti di asset soggetti ad obbligo di notifica vengono individuati non solo tenendo conto dell'intrinseca abilità di questi ultimi a realizzare un fatturato, ma anche valutando ulteriori fattori che rendono l'asset teoricamente idoneo a costituire e rafforzare una posizione dominante in uno specifico mercato; dunque, a titolo esemplificativo, beni che possono qualificarsi come essential facilities, concessioni che garantiscono mercati in tutto o in parte protetti, così come qualunque bene che, per tipologia, sia astrattamente idoneo a dar luogo a barriere all'accesso a danno dei concorrenti. Nell'articolo si propone, inoltre, una modifica dell'attuale formulario concentrazioni elaborato dall'Autorità, consigliando di fornire un quadro più certo in sede di definizione della nozione di parte di impresa, tenendo conto delle importanti novità introdotte sia dalla sentenza del Consiglio di Stato ampiamente commentata, sia dalle recenti linee guida elaborate dalla Commissione proprio in tema di controllo delle concentrazioni (ci riferiamo alla c.d. Consolidated Jurisdiction Notice). Si suggerisce, infine, che si adotti un criterio de minimis in sede di determinazione degli obblighi di notifica in ambito nazionale.
L59|Is using regular flexible leave associated with employee wellbeing?| The use of flexible arrangements will likely increase with the Labour government’s introduction of the National Employment Standards which provide employees with caring responsibilities the right to request flexible arrangements. Data come from a sample of public servants (n=2168) surveyed in 2008, providing a unique setting to investigate the implementation process associated with work life balance policy. Results showed that employees who regularly used flexible leave compared with non users reported lower work interference in home life. The study found some interesting differences among men and women. Men appeared to benefit more than women from these arrangements. Mothers benefit but not when they work long hours. Users compared to non users perceived a more supportive and equitable workplace culture, which were stronger predictors of wellbeing than utilisation alone, highlighting the importance of creating an inclusive workplace culture to obtain positive outcomes.
L59|Knock-on effect of non-manufacturing regulation on manufacturing sectors efficiency and productivity|Since the mid of nineties European countries are registering an anemic growth of economic activity, in large part due to the dynamic of productivity. In 2010 the European Council adopted a new Agenda, Euro2020, which aim is to boost growth also improving European competitiveness. Regulation is one of the main factors influencing competitiveness. This paper focuses on the determinants of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth in 13 manufacturing sectors in a panel of 18 OECD countries from 1975 to 2007. Using the Stochastic Frontier Approach applied to the EU-KLEMS and OECD’s Regulation Impact Indicator database I found that, given the strong negative relationship between regulation and Technical Efficiency, which is one of the drivers of TFP, countries with still tight regulation in services could/should reduced it in order to improve their economic performance without detriment for public finances.
L59|A conditional full frontier approach for investigating the Averch-Johnson effect|This paper applies a probabilistic approach in order to develop conditional and unconditional Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models for the measurement of sectors’ input oriented technical and scale efficiency levels for a sample of 23 Greek manufacturing sectors. In order to capture the Averch and Johnson effect (A-J effect), we measure sectors’ efficiency levels conditioned on the number of companies competing within the sectors. Particularly, various DEA models have been applied alongside with bootstrap techniques in order to determine the effect of competition conditions on sectors’ inefficiency levels. Additionally, this study illustrates how the recent developments in efficiency analysis and statistical inference can be applied when evaluating the effect of regulations in an industry. The results reveal that sectors with fewer numbers of companies appear to have greater scale and technical inefficiencies due to the existence of the A-J effect.
L59|Measuring the Extent of European State Aid Control: An Econometric Analysis of the European Commission Decisions|This paper provides an analysis of the European Commission (EC) decisions on state aid control using data on 550 state aid cases approved by the EC between 1998 and 2009. We measure the determinants of the duration of state aid, total budget of state aid and daily budget of state aid. By using these imperfect proxies, we try to identify the extent of European state aid control. Our results suggest that aid with multiple objectives to achieve has both longer durations and higher amounts of budget. We also find that for some aid objectives or industries, the EC approves cases of aid with both longer durations and higher levels of budget. On the other hand, for some class of aid objectives and industries, there is a trade-off between duration and the level of budget to counter-balance the undesired effects. The interpretation of the results implies that the European state aid control, which once was originally intended to address concerns about export subsidies and strategic trade, recently puts more emphasis on market failures mostly associated with externalities and public goods.

L59|Pitfalls to avoid when measuring institutions: Is Doing Business damaging business?|"Over recent years, both governments and international aid organizations have been devoting large amounts of resources to ""simplifying"" the procedures for setting up and formalizing firms. Many of these actions have focused on reducing the initial costs of setting up the firm, disregarding the more important role of business registers as a source of reliable information for judges, government departments and, above all, other firms. This reliable information is essential for reducing transaction costs in future dealings with all sorts of economic agents, both public and private. The priorities of reform policies should therefore be thoroughly reviewed, stressing the value of the legal institutions rather than trivializing them as is often the case.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
L59|The law of impersonal transactions|"Most economic interactions happen in a context of sequential exchange in which innocent third parties suffer information asymmetry with respect to previous ""originative"" contracts. The law reduces transaction costs by protecting these third parties but preserves some element of consent by property rightholders to avoid damaging property enforcement—e.g., it is they, as principals, who authorize agents in originative contracts. Judicial verifiability of these originative contracts is obtained either as an automatic byproduct of transactions or, when these would have remained private, by requiring them to be made public. Protecting third parties produces a legal commodity which is easy to trade impersonally, improving the allocation and specialization of resources. Historical delay in generalizing this legal commoditization paradigm is attributed to path dependency—the law first developed for personal trade—and an unbalance in vested interests, as luddite legal professionals face weak public bureaucracies."
L59|Institutional support of the firm: A theory of business registries|Registering originative business contracts allows entrepreneurs and creditors to choose, and courts to enforce market-friendly “contract” rules that protect innocent third parties when adjudicating disputes on subsequent contracts. This reduces information asymmetry for third parties, which enhances impersonal trade. It does so without seriously weakening property rights, because it is rightholders who choose or activate the legal rules and can, therefore, minimize the cost of any possible weakening. Registries are essential not only to make the chosen rules public but to ensure rightholders’ commitment and avoid rule-gaming, because independent registries make rightholders’ choices verifiable by courts. The theory is supported by comparative and historical analyses.

The model shows that reforms to limit non-economic losses make consumers unambiguously worse off ex ante. Although insurance premiums fall and these reductions are passed on to consumers in full, this gain is more than offset by the increased risk that consumers are forced to bear. In contrast, reforms for income‐related (i.e. economic) losses lead to ambiguous outcomes. The potential benefits from limits to economic loss arise due to the inability of insurers to price discriminate on the basis of income or expected loss. Because of this, there is an implicit cross subsidy from low‐ to high‐income consumers that is embedded in the insurance premium and relevant product price. Tort law reforms partially unwind this cross subsidy. The results presented in this article show that tort law reforms may achieve their stated goal, such as lowering monetary prices, but can still make consumers worse off by introducing an uninsurable risk. There is also an important difference between reforms that limit claims for economic and non‐economic losses. Insurance for economic loss will generally include an implicit cross subsidy and, as a consequence, reforms can alter the ex ante utility for different groups of consumers in different ways.
L59|Towards a framework for the evaluation of policies of cluster upgrading and innovation|In the current scenario, a large and growing number of policies for local development and cluster upgrading explicitly incorporate the idea of innovation as a systemic process, embedded in specific socio-cultural and institutional contexts and intermingled with international challenges, opportunities, and strategies. These policies bring new challenges to the activities of analysis and evaluation: despite the diffusion of a systemic approach both in innovation thinking and in innovation policies, a proper system-based framework for the analysis and evaluation of these policies is far from being achieved (Bellandi and Caloffi, 2010). Trying to advance our reflection on this field, we propose some exemplifications on a quite delimited set of contexts, i.e. those of industrial districts (Italian, in particular), characterized by SMEs clusters facing contemporary globalization challenges. Focusing on innovation policies aimed at supporting functional upgrading of districts and clusters soaked in changing international filières and value chains, the paper discusses the meaning of evaluation of industrial policies when a systemic perspective is considered. On such premises a couple of exemplifications are illustrated some features of appropriate evaluation methods. Finally, some methodological aspects concerning the design process of evaluation activities are discussed.
L59|The Impact of Mergers on the Degree of Competition in the Banking Industry|This paper analyses the relation between competition and concentration in the banking sector. The empirical answer is given by testing a monopolistic competition model of bank branching behaviour on individual bank data at county level (départements and provinces) in France and Italy. We propose a measure of the degree of competiveness in each local market that is function also of market structure indicators. We then use the econometric model to evaluate the impact of horizontal mergers among incumbent banks on competition and discuss when, depending on the pre-merger structure of the market and geographic distribution of branches, the merger is anti-competitive. The paper has implications for competition policy as it suggests an applied tool to evaluate the potential anti-competitive impact of mergers.
L59|Price rivalry in airline markets: a study of a successful strategy of a network carrier against a low-cost carrier|In the post-liberalization period, competition has increased in airline markets. In this context, network carriers have two alternative strategies to compete with low-cost carriers. First, they may establish a low-cost subsidiary. Second, they may try to reduce costs using the main brand. This paper examines a successful strategy of the first type implemented by Iberia in the Spanish domestic market. Our analysis of data and the estimation of a pricing equation show that Iberia has been able to charge lower prices than rivals with its low-cost subsidiary. The pricing policy of the Spanish network carrier has been particularly aggressive on less dense routes and shorter routes.
L59|Third-Degree Price Discrimination: Apology Not Necessary|Applied work in price discrimination often treats demand curves among multiple market segments as algebraically additive. Yet the welfare effects of multi-market (third degree) price discrimination depend on how the demand segments are added. Treating demands as geometrically additive yields the well known result that discrimination absent an increase in production diminishes Marshallian surplus. But if demands are treated as algebraically additive then discrimination increases welfare over uniform pricing. Quantity is identical in the three cases, so the effect is not due to market opening. Nor is the effect due to scale economies since marginal cost is assumed constant. Profit is always greater under discrimination, so the effect is due to distributional changes in consumer surplus. The model is restricted to linear demands and constant marginal cost but can be generalized for future work and policy analysis. Copyright International Atlantic Economic Society 2010

L59|How Broadcasting Quotas Harm Program Diversity|Broadcasting quotas of domestic contents are commonplace in developed countries. The core argument for them is to promote diversity by making more room for domestic content and hence foster a more diverse production. However, this intuitive reasoning ignores the trade-off between repetition (broadcasting more of the same) and new program diffusion. If each consumer cares only about a small fraction on the total contents of the program, a broadcaster confronted to a quota will find optimal to compensate for the reduction of foreign programming by increasing the number of diffusions of substitutable domestic programs. Total broadcasting time being limited, this will force the broadcaster to slash marginal (less popular) types of programming, whereby reducing program diversity. This mechanism applies both in a monopoly and an imperfectly competitive setting. It thus undermines one of the main rationales for quotas of domestic content.
L59|Institutional Support of the Firm: A Theory of Business Registries|"Registering originative business contracts allows entrepreneurs and creditors to choose, and courts to enforce market-friendly ""contract"" rules that protect innocent third parties when adjudicating disputes on subsequent contracts. This reduces information asymmetry for third parties, which enhances impersonal trade. It does so without seriously weakening property rights, because it is rightholders who choose or activate the legal rules and can, therefore, minimize the cost of any possible weakening. Registries are essential not only to make the chosen rules public but to ensure rightholders' commitment and avoid rule-gaming, because independent registries make rightholders' choices verifiable by courts. The theory is supported by comparative and historical analyses."
L59|Stochastic Income Statement Planning and Emissions Trading|Since the introduction of the European CO2 emissions trading system (EU ETS), the development of CO2 allowance prices is a new risk factor for enterprises taking part in this system. In this paper, we analyze how risk emerging from emissions trading can be considered in the stochastic profit and loss planning of corporations. Therefore we explore which planned figures are affected by emissions trading. Moreover, we show a way to model these positions in a planned profit and loss account accounting for uncertainties and dependencies. Consequently, this model provides a basis for risk assessment and investment decisions in the uncertain environment of CO2 emissions trading.
L59|Paying to remove advertisements|Media firms sometimes allow consumers to pay to remove advertisements from an ad-based product. We formally examine an ad-based monopolist's incentives to introduce this option. When deciding whether or not to introduce the option to pay, the monopolist compares the potential direct revenues from consumers who pay, with the lost advertising revenues resulting from the subsequent ad removal. If the pay alternative is introduced, the media firm increases advertising quantity to make the option to pay more attractive. This outcome hurts consumers but benefits the media firm and the advertisers. Total welfare may increase or decrease. Perhaps surprisingly, more annoying advertisements may lead to an increase in advertising quantity.

This fact turned the computational power of the new technologies essential, currently representing a significant weight in the budget of companies, the state and even the common households. Today, the world is positively condemned to focus itself on sustainability - conserving an ecological balance by avoiding depletion of natural resources. We can find the great world-wide leaders face to face with a great challenge - to contribute for the development of a sustainable world. It is important that these leaders are able to focus themselves on the economic development without forgetting important environmental and social matters that every time become more and more pertinent. Innovation in informatics and grid computing appears not only as a promising solution concerning this sustainable economic development but also as the best answer to the stagnation or contraction of the world-wide economy. Our paper presents some trends and examples of development of new systems that use in a sustainable way the computer energy available and contribute to more productive and powerful computer systems.

L59|Hurricane Insurance in Florida|This paper studies the evolution of hurricane insurance in Florida over the last decades. Hurricanes (and other natural catastrophes) are typically referred to as “uninsurable” risks. The more exposed property owners find it difficult to obtain insurance cover from the private market and/or can do so only at premiums that substantially exceed their expected claims costs. The state of Florida has reacted to the incapacity of the private sector to insure hurricane risks at reasonable premium levels with the creation of Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (an insurer of last resort) and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund. Their existence has resulted in substantial premium reductions for the Florida property owners. Both institutions have the possibility of spreading the costs of a major hurricane over a (very) large number of policy holders through after the event compulsory assessments. The risk borne by each individual property owner is thus reasonably small, with substantial benefits for consumers as a group. Looking forward the challenge to the policy maker will be to fine-tune the operation (premium structure) of these two institutions so as to increase their political acceptance. To this end it will be necessary to limit the implicit subsidy of the “bad risks” through the “good risks”.
L59|The Impacts of Airport Centrality in the EU Network and Inter- Airport Competition on Airport Efficiency|In this paper we study the relationship between airport efficiency and two factors: an airport’s centrality in the EU network, and the intensity of competition from alternative airports in the same catchment area. We apply a two-stage econometric model based on the Simar & Wilson (2007) bootstrap procedure to a balanced sample of 57 European airports. We also design and compute our own measures of airport centrality and competition. The results show that efficiency is positively related to centrality in the European network, as measured by a weighted sum of minimal paths passing through the airport in question. The intensity of competition between airports also has a positive effect on efficiency. Our analysis suggests that air transportation policies should focus on increasing competition within important catchment areas (e.g., by investing in infrastructure facilitating access to alternative airports) and enhancing the connectivity of the EU network (e.g., by subsidizing new point-to-point connections between airports with capacity to spare).

Para ello nos centramos en el mercado de las Islas Canarias porque ofrece dos ventajas inéditas respecto de otros mercados: la facilidad en la definición del mercado relevante (insular) y la existencia de mercados en monopolio y en oligopolio simultáneamente. Este último hecho permite estimar un modelo de variaciones conjeturales explicativo del comportamiento medio de las empresas en las islas en oligopolio en relación al comportamiento de las islas en monopolio. El trabajo presenta evidencia de que el grado de competencia promedio en el mercado de la gasolina en Canarias es bajo, a pesar de tener una mayor experiencia liberalizadora en este sector.

L59|(No)competition in the Spanish retailing gasoline market: a variance filter approach|Various methodologies in economic literature have been used to analyse the international hydrocarbon retail sector. Nevertheless at a Spanish level these studies are much more recent and most conclude that generally there is no effective competition present in this market, regardless of the approach used. In this paper, in order to analyse the price levels in the Spanish petrol market, our starting hypothesis is that in uncompetitive markets the prices are higher and the standard deviation is lower. We use weekly retail petrol price data from the ten biggest Spanish cities, and apply Markov chains to fill the missing values for petrol 95 and diesel, and we also employ a variance filter. We conclude that this market demonstrates reduced price dispersion, regardless of brand or city.
L59|The Efficiency of European Airports: Do the Importance in the EU Network and the Intensity of Competition Matter?|In this paper we study the efficiency of European airports by applying a DEA model to 57 airports. The sample covers 95% of all the airports with a traffic of at least 5 millions passengers (yearly). We find that largest airports (with more than 10 millions passengers) are more efficient, while airports classified by the European Commission as national have spare capacity and should improve their performances. Largest airports have decreasing returns to scale, while national ones will get a reduction in their average costs if they increase their size of operation. Moreover we investigated the determinants of the estimated efficiency scores. The Tobit regression shows that efficiency is positively related with airport’s connectivity index in the European network (i.e. airports with better connections at the network are more efficient) and with the intensity of competition between airports (i.e. airports with nearby competitors on several destinations tend to be more efficient). These results imply that policy makers (in regulating airports’ fares and subsidizing development plans) and managers (in evaluating their assets utilization) should take into account that a well connected destinations map and the presence of indirect competition coming from other airports can improve the performances in the management of European airports.
L59|Efficiency measurement and regulation in US telecommunications: A robustness analysis|The paper investigates the robustness of different efficiency measures that can support the implementation of diverse forms of incentive regulation in the context of US telecommunications. Comparisons, in terms of an output orientation, are considered for efficiency scores obtained from data envelopment analysis (DEA), distance function (with corrected ordinary least squares and a random effects model) and distance function embedded in a stochastic frontier framework (with time-invariant, time-varying efficiencies or with inefficiency effects). Similar to the previous empirical literature, one finds, in most cases, only a moderate consistency across the different approaches. In fact, the different spectrum of techniques imposed varied degrees of structure in the error term and indicated non-negligible discrepancies across the different measurement approaches in terms of the ranking structure, degree of persistence and best- and worst-practice patterns.

Thus, this relation is generated by some other mechanism, which is indeterminate, as no existing theory explains the nonlinear patterns of turnout in the data.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L59|Beyond the emission market: Kyoto and the international expansion of waste management firms|This paper analyses the participation of firms without GHG emission liabilities as technology providers in CDM and JI projects, the flexibility mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol. It argues that the motivations for those firms to engaging in CDM and JI projects is based on market stimuli beyond those related to the emission market itself. Instead, their motivations are largely associated with search for new markets where their technological resources and expertise can be exploited. The analysis is based on three firms from the Dutch waste management industry. These cases suggest that the Kyoto's mechanisms compensate to some extent the weakness of the underdeveloped waste management sector in developing and transition economies.

Unfortunately, the World Bank’s ""Doing Business"" project is harming such policies by promoting a reform agenda that gives them priority even in countries lacking functional business registers, so that the reformed registers keep producing valueless information, but faster. Its methodology also promotes biased measurements that impede proper consideration of the essential tradeoffs in the design of formalization institutions. If ""Doing Business"" is to stop jeopardizing its true objectives and contribute positively to scientific progress, institutional reform and economic development, then its aims, governance and methodology need to change."

Dieses Verhalten wird mit einem Mean-Reversion-Prozess modelliert. Aufgrund von Unsicherheiten bezüglich künftiger Umweltzustände ist jedoch zu vermuten, dass innerhalb einer Handelsperiode durch das Bekanntwerden neuer Informationen sprunghafte Veränderungen der erwarteten Grenzvermeidungskosten auftreten können, womit sprunghafte Verschiebungen des erwarteten Preisniveaus einhergehen. Neben der Parameter-Schätzung ist es daher auch ein Ziel der Arbeit, den Mean-Reversion-Prozess so zu modifizieren, dass solche sprunghaften Veränderungen des erwarteten Reversion-Niveaus abgebildet werden können.
L59|Is Wal-Mart Good for Competition? Evidence from Milk Prices|This article examines the impact of Wal-Mart Supercenters’ entry on incumbents’ pricing behavior and demand. Using a structural model and milk data from the Dallas/Fort Worth supermarket chains, empirical results show that an expansion of Supercenters caused incumbents to price milk significantly more competitively, dropping on average 22.5% between 1996 and 2002, in spite of declines in their milk demand. Furthermore, consumer gains exceeded incumbent losses, lending further support to the notion that Wal-Mart is good for competition and consumers.
L59|An Empirical Investigation on the Efficiency, Capacity and Ownership of Italian Airports|In this paper we study the efficiency of Italian airports applying a DEA model to a sample of 34 airports. We consider two outputs: aircraft movements and passengers. We find that large airports are more efficient that domestic and regional ones, i.e. small airports have spare capacity since they are, on average, more distant from the VRS frontier than large airports. Moreover, the latter are operating under decreasing returns to scale while increasing returns to scale arise in the small ones. These findings imply that further investments to develop large airports will lead to higher average costs. The Tobit regression on the estimated DEA scores shows that efficiency is positively related with the so—called hub premium (i.e. an airline dominates an airport) and with privatization, and it is negatively affected by military activities and season effects. Hence we suggest that airport’s privatization, incentives to invest in large airports (which are close to saturation of their capacity) and development plans to improve the activities in domestic and regional airports may form the benchmarks of air transportation policy in Italy at least in the short—run.

L59|Oil Price Indexing Of Natural Gas Prices: An Economic Analysis|Die Ölpreisbindung des Erdgaspreises ist ein hervorstechendes Merkmal des Gasmarktes in Deutschland und anderen europäischen Ländern. Diese Besonderheit ist eng verknüpft mit der Existenz lokaler Monopole (trotz Liberalisierung bestehen diese bislang zumindest in Deutschland de facto weiterhin) und sogenannter „take-or-pay” Verträge (TOP contracts), d. h. fixer Abnahmeverpflichtungen zu einem an die Entwicklung des Ölpreises gekoppelten Abnahmepreis. Nach einer Diskussion der Beziehung zwischen diesen drei Besonderheiten des Erdgasmarktes und der möglichen Gründe für die Ölpreisbindung analysieren wir diese Strategie in einem Oligopolmodell mit differenzierten Produkten mit einem monopolistischen Erdgasanbieter und einem oder mehreren konkurrierenden Ölhändlern. Zunächst zeigen wir im Rahmen einer symmetrischen Spezifikation auf, wie die Ölpreisbindung die Kollusion zwischen Erdgas- und Ölanbietern ermöglicht. Anschließend berücksichtigen wir mögliche Asymmetrien zwischen den beiden Energieformen. Dabei zeigt sich, dass das Ergebnis bei Symmetrie nicht robust ist und wir diskutieren im Detail wie die Auswirkung der Ölpreisbindung auf Preise, Gewinne und Wohlfahrt von der Art und vom Ausmaß der Asymmetrien abhängt.
L59|Extensive Capture: the rise of international industrial regulation|This research project tries to show that a unified discourse and a single global policy for liberalization and competition cuts across the economic and legal theory of transnational regulations of industry. The tension mediated by the concepts of harmonization, meaning that one regulation/standard is better that multiple regulations/standards, and the theory of international liberalization, meaning deregulation is better that regulation, brings many doubts about the phenomenon of international industrial regulation. The core of this project is to restate the problem of regulatory capture at a transnational level and show how it is possible, and profitable, for large corporations to capture transnational regulators with multilateral regulation or deregulation processes.
L59|Trademark Values in Corporate Restructuring|In corporate restructuring under Chapter 11, an asset valuation is a central task for both legal and financial reasons. In the area of intangible assets, however, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) do not reflect internally-generated assets such as brands, trademarks, and other intellectual property. In practice, arbitrary rules of thumb are used to fill this gap, and closure, liquidation, financing, and restructuring decisions are made on this basis. This paper reports the progress that has been made so far in developing theoretical and empirical bases to improve trademark valuation in corporate restructuring. The model and the applied results have been incorporated since 2006 in some of the most significant corporate restructuring cases in the U.S. The econometric study of trademark values in liquidation and reorganization presented is based on new data being generated as a result of self-regulatory changes in financial accounting –specifically those brought about over the last six years by FASB’s statements 141 and 142 (as well as the international IFRS-3 standard). The new accounting framework for business combinations requires acquiring entities to perform a detailed purchase price allocation that segregates the values attributable to trademarks and other IP from general Goodwill. Publicly traded companies generally disclose these itemized values in their SEC filings. Recently, we have begun building a database of pre-merger revenue information in combination with specific trademark value allocations from a variety of acquisitions occurring in both liquidation and going concern contexts. Our initial results are consistent with the severe reduction in value that has come to be expected, but reflect a statistically significant non-linearity that has substantial financial impact in large cases.

L59|Airline Deregulation, Competitive Environment and Safety|Air traffic has substantially increased since the introduction of deregulation in both the USA and the European Union. Moreover, aircraft accidents involving fatalities have exhibited a downward trend over time. Still, a series of recently publicized accidents has raised again a serious issue, namely whether cost reduction in a deregulated aviation environment is achieved at the expense of safety standards. To address this question, the paper proposes a mathematical model, which highlights the relationship between competitive behaviour and tort liability. The model has important policy implications suggesting that the level of airline penalisation should be reduced when market rivalry is relaxed and conversely.

L59|Role of Non-Performing Loads (NPLs) and Capital Adequacy in Banking Structure and Competition|This paper analyses the impact of the transition from price-cap regulation (deposit/loan rate control) to rate-of-return regulation (ROA, NP:s and/or BIS ratio) on banking industry structure. A simple theoretical model of banking competition suggests that the relative dominance of the two objective functions under different regulatory regimes affects the market structure. Imposing more stringent rate-of-return regulation, whilst relaxing price-cap regulation, reduces the equilibrium number of banks. The result from the theoretical model is also supported by empirical evidence from Korea, which has undergone substantial consolidation in recent years. The empirical analysis uses a unique data set of the entire commercial banking sector in Korea between 1976 and 2003, which covers both pre- and post-banking crisis periods.
L59|Good Intentions Gone Awry: A Policy Analysis of the SEC's Regulation of the Bond Rating Industry|This paper discusses the SEC's regulation of the bond rating industry. Until a few years ago this specific branch of SEC regulation was largely unknown outside the agency and the bond rating industry itself, even among knowledgeable Washington insiders. But the SEC has actually regulated the industry since 1975: by limiting entry, in an indirect but powerful way. As a consequence, incumbent bond rating firms are protected; potential entrants are impeded; and new ideas and technologies for assessing the riskiness of debt, and thereby the allocation of capital, may well be stifled. This entry regulation is an excellent example of good intentions having gone awry, via the 'law' of unintended consequences. The good intentions were to improve the safety-and-soundness regulation of financial institutions, and even to use 'market' information to do so. But the unfortunate result has been a distortionary entry restriction regime with respect to bond rating firms. Fortunately, there are better ways to achieve the desired goals – ways that would permit the SEC to cease these entry restrictions and nevertheless allow safety-and-soundness regulation of financial institutions to proceed in desirable directions. If the SEC were to exit from its role as the entry regulator of the bond rating industry, financial markets’ participants could then make their own decisions as to which firms and methods offer the best information as to the default probabilities and other relevant parameters with respect to debt issuances. This paper expands on these themes.

L59|Assessing effects of price regulation in retail payment systems|This paper considers effects of price regulation in retail payment systems by applying the model of telecommunications competition by Laffont-Rey-Tirole (1998).In our two-country model world there is one retail payment network located in each country and markets are segmented à la Hotelling.We show that the optimal price under price regulation is the weighted average of pre-regulation domestic and cross-border prices where the degree of home-bias in making payments serves as the weight.Furthermore, we find that the general welfare effects of price regulation are ambiguous: gross social welfare is higher under price discrimination than under price regulation in the special case where costs of access to banking services (transportation costs) are high.However, there also exist cases where prohibitively high transaction costs make price discrimination to reduce total welfare.Finally, if transportation costs are reduced sufficiently, segmentation of payment markets is eliminated.Markets then become fullyserved as in the original Laffont-Rey-Tirole model, suggesting that price discrimination would be beneficial for welfare.

L59|Collective Relationship Banking and Private Information Monitoring in Korea|The structure of conglomerates embedded in the strong vertical ownership network in East Asia was believed to be a driving force for the economic success but was also blamed for the recent financial crisis in Asia given the fallacy - too big to collapse. This paper introduces a notion of collective relationship banking (CRB) as a mechanism for monitoring private information and investigates the likelihood of such a banking relationship when the borrowing firms have heterogenous vertical ownership structure using a Korean firm level panel dataset. Policy concerns are then addressed since the post-crisis corporate restructuring may create a more concentrated banking relationship with a few dominant banks.
L59|Evolution of Banking Structure: Industrial Policy and Deregulation|This paper analyses the impact of various types of deregulation on banking industry structure. The empirical result is supported by evidence from Japan and Korea, which have undergone a substantial consolidation following a series of deregulation. The analysis is applied to a unique data set of the entire commercial banking sector in Japan and Korea, which covers both pre- and post- banking crisis periods. The paper also draws attention to the role of the banking sector in East Asian industrialisation, which influenced its idiosyncratic banking regulation and the evolution of the banking structure using the structure-performance relationship.
L59|Horizontal Differentiation and the survival of Train and Coach modes in medium range passenger transport, a welfare analysis comprising economies of scope and scale|The Portuguese transport system as a whole suffers from the dominance of personal transportation, this being generally less efficient. Coaches and trains struggle to stay in the business. This model explains the markets’ performance beyond price differentials, bundling the transport modes’ appeal in one index for each. The differentiated transport cost approach accounts for product differentiation, economies of scope accruing to the consumer, and allows for economies of scale, in the form of fixed costs, to be weighted in, as well as tax policies towards motoring. It goes further by building a general welfare function that permits all factors and competition regimes to be properly compared. These are a monopoly by cars, duopolies with cars and each of the public transports, and oligopolies with public transports either competing or colluding. Simulations are carried out, and discussed in light of swings in market share and changes in welfare, with a reasonable claim to plausibility. Both public transports make the public better off by staying in the market, although the coaches’ contribution is more decisive. Trains results are weighted down by heavy fixed costs, and the far reaching coach network of destinations offers the second best service (behind that of cars). Collusion in the public transports is a price worth paying, when compared with the car monopoly emerging from bankrupt operators.

L59|Les normes éthiques comme biens publics : la question du développement économique|The economic ethics tries to define common rules relative to the economic system. Thus, the ethics formalization is at issue, so that ethics can be integrated at firm level. Ethical standard, as a specific tool of formalization, compromises between a responsible behaviour, a state of technique and economic constraints. Ethical standard is relevant because it represents a particular way of economic coordination. Consequently, it is interesting to analyse standards' nature : ethical standards can be analysed as public goods, or more precisely as dual public goods. Then, this leads to study the impact of ethical standards in terms of development. Finally, it seems necessary to focus on the broader issue of ethical standards' legitimacy, at national and international level.
L59|Formalization of ethics : the issue of standardization|"Beyond the presupposed cleavage between economics and ethics, the institutional dimension of economic ethics is to the emphasized. The question is : how can we define collective legal rules which concern the whole society ? The other great issue of ethics formalization is then the implementation on the level of firms. The firm can use a large scope of instruments in order to formalize economic ethics. The asset of ethical standards is that they represent a specific way of coordination. They bring positive effects such as the fall of coordination cost and the reduction of uncertainty. Ethical standards can be regarded as a way to get information. They are also a way to formalize a "" common morality "", or even an universal morality in a Kantian conception. The central issue, regarding ethical standards, remains its origin and its construction."
L59|Cultural quotas in broadcasting I: a model|This paper develops a Hotelling location model in which two radio stations choose combinations of local and international content to play, given consumers with preferences distributed over those combinations. Station revenue derives from sales of advertising time, the demand for which depends negatively on the price and positively on the station’s market share and consumers get disutility from advertising and from a less-than-ideal broadcast mix of local and international content. In this setting we show that the laissez-faire solution involves less than (socially optimal) maximal differentiation
L59|Cultural quotas in broadcasting II: policy|This paper considers the application of ‘cultural quotas’ to radio broadcasting: a requirement that a minimum percentage of broadcast content be of local origin. Using a Hotelling location model derived in Richardson (2004) we show that, while the laissez-faire solution involves less than (socially optimal) maximal differentiation, a quota reduces the differentiation between the stations even further. While a cultural quota may raise consumer welfare, the reduced station diversity and advertising levels monotonically lower overall social welfare. We consider two other policies – a limit on advertising and a publicly provided non-commercial station – and show that both also reduce diversity, compared to the laissez-faire solution. An advertising cap is not as effective as the quota in achieving greater airplay for local content for least welfare cost but a public station can be, depending on the magnitude of its associated fixed costs
L59|Relationship Banking in Bilateral Oligopoly and Asymmetric Information| This paper investigates the economic principles underlying the relationship between the real sector (non-financial) and the banking sector structures. Most literature has so far focused on the structure of conglomerates (Keiretsu/Chaebol) in East Asia in explaining the fast economic growth and/or recent crisis in the region. Traditionally, the strong vertical relationship between core companies and their subsidiaries in the real sector was believed to be a driving force for the economic success in the region. However, the degree of vertical relationship varies depending upon macroeconomic fluctuations and subsequently affects their relationship banks. The paper analyses the information sharing in a bilateral oligopoly framework. When banks prefer strong collaterals and/or credible third party repayment guarantees, a weaker vertical relationship in the real sector should lead to a consolidation in the banking sector via mergers or exits. Empirical evidence from the panel data constructed for the top 10 Chaebols and their subsidiaries between 1994-2002 supports the argument
L59|La industria argentina en los ?90s y el discurso de la desimplicación estatal: explorando causas y efectos|Firstly, even though there was a successful differing international experience, in the present paper we intend to identify those elements that could explain why Argentine speeches and politics of the 90´s promoted the state?s withdrawal in the encouragement of the accumulation process, and particularly, in the industrial support. Secondly, our objective is to consider the effective introduction of ?selective non-implicated politics? of the state during those years, and to evaluate their effects over the national industry. The strong weakness and unsophistication of the domestic productive and industrial structure that show the test of the industrial texture, together with the worsening of the concentring and transnationalizing malformations that are observed at the morphological level of the sector, are showed like real bases to consider the impossibility of maintaining both: the economic and industrial process of growth and the accumulation and international insertion strategy developed during the mentioned decade.
L59|Explaining Individual Job Separations in a Segregated Labor Market|In this paper, individual job separations are analyzed using employer-employee data. The analysis is conducted within the framework of a simple theoretical model in which the value of the match between the worker and the firm is a function of the individual component and the firm component. This partition is important in an empirical context because of labor market segregation. In particular, we argue that failure to account for both the individual and the firm component simultaneously produce incorrect conclusions. One example is that in conventional studies, where only the individual component is included, women will have higher separation probabilities than men. However, when we take into account that women work in small low-paying firms, this result vanishes. To further investigate employment stability, information on the labor market states subsequent to a job separation is introduced. This additional information reveal that the population of currently working women relative to men is more likely to separate from a job, become unemployed, and leave the labor market because of less attractive match characteristics. A decomposition reveals that 25 percent of the gender stability gap is due to differences in the individual components and the remaining 75 percent can be attributed to differences in the firm component.
L59|Competition enhancings measures and scope economies: a welfare appraisal|This paper examines welfare changes before the introduction of more competition in technologically related markets. We develop a simple two-market duopoly with product differentiation where a multi-product firm competes with a different single-product firm in each market. Two competition enhancing measures are considered, divestiture of the multi-product firm and entry of single-product firms in one of the markets. The results obtained indicate that more competition may lead to a welfare reduction. Our analysis points out the relevance of the type and size of economies of scope, the particular way of introducing more competition and the degree of product differentiation.
L59|Utilities: deregulated or re-regulated?|This article addresses the restructuration of the utilities sector/industry, a process generally described as deregulation. At the core of deregulation processes, not only in the EU, but also in the US, lies the replacement of old-fashioned forms of state regulation based on ownership control by new forms of regulation based on the operation of an independent regulatory body. In Central and Eastern European countries undergoing economic transition, surviving communist-type behavior, along with half-implemented EU deregulation directives, have led to specifically re-regulated utility markets. The new forms of regulation applied in the process of deregulation have served only to preserve the market protection of former state monopolies. Regulators who manage deregulation processes in the EU style allocate benefits across organized producer and consumer groups, so that the regulators' total utility is maximized.

L59|Chasing Patents|We examine the problem faced by a company that wishes to purchase patents in the hands of two di¤erent patent owners. Complementarity of these patents in the production process of the company is a prime e¢ciency reason for them being owned (or licenced) by the company. We show that this very same complementarity can lead to patent owners behaving strategically in bargaining, and delaying their sale to the company. When the company is highly leveraged, such ine¢cient delay is limited. Comparative statics results are also obtained.

L59|A Model of Regulation in the Housing Market|"This paper develops a theoretical model to study the effects of regulation on the housing market. Our model emphasises the following specific features of the housing market : product heterogeneity plays an important role, search costs are high, switching (moving) costs are substantial, and the possibilities to price discriminate are important. We show that in an unregulated housing market rents will increase at the time of renegotiation as a result of the ""hold-up"" problem. A regulation which limits the owners' possibilities to increase his rents for a certain number of years leads to lower equilibrium rents and higher social welfare. Our model strongly suggests that a policy which consists of indexing rents may be socially preferable to a simple laissez-faire solution."
L59|Sunk Costs and Competitiveness of European Banks after Deregulation|This paper investigates the determinants of the structure of the banking industry by fitting a monopolistic competition model to a sample of banks drawn from eight EEC countries over 1989-1993. In the theoretical model, banks decide strategically both entry and the branching size of thier network. The estimation then measures the branching costs and a upper bound for the entry costs. It also assesses how these costs evolve over time and to what extent they are influenced by various European directives, aiming at deregulating the banking industry.

L59|The remains of regulation: airlines' profits after liberalization|This paper develops an empirical model of entry to analyze the effect of previous regulation on European airlines? post-liberalization profits. The author distinguishes between European flag carriers, which are hightly regulated at the beginning of the eighties, and independent airlines. It is found that the latter enjoy sunk cost advantages but get lower variable profits than the former. This means that possible efficiency disadvantages suffered by the flag carriers are more than offset by their higher perceived quality, leading to a situation in which they are less likely to enter a route, but also less likely to exit.
L59|Productivity differences in the airline industry: partial deregulation versus short-run protection|The paper specifies and estimates a production function for the airline industry, identifying firms' network characteristics and efficiency as the main determinants of their productivity. The application of this analysis to the European market shows that productivity differences among flag carriers could explain the governments' different views about deregulation at the beginning of the eighties. The introduction of liberal bilateral agreements by some European government has given their flag carriers incentives to start adjusting their structure in anticipation of future liberalization in the European market while other European flag carriers have delayed this adjustment.
L59|Privatization in Eastern Europe : Irreversibility and critical mass effects|This paper proposes a model to shed light on two important policy features of privatization in Central and Eastern Europe: the idea of a necessary critical mass of privatization on the one hand, and the difficulties encountered in the actual privatization process on the other, related to the government's inability to precommit to announced policies. The main ingredient of the model is the existence of a positive externality related to the size of the private sector, providing at the same time a rationale for the idea of a critical mass, but also creating a coordination problem generating multiple equilibria. This paper also shows how the distribution of free shares to the population currently advocated in Eastern Europe, may credibly make the privatizations irreversible, without completely solving the coordination problem, and even worsening in some cases, the welfare outcome.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from a<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
