H56|Dynamic Determinants of Access to Weapons: Global Evidence|This study investigates the determinants of and persistence in access to weapons using a global sample of 163 countries for the period 2010 to 2015. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments (GMM). Hysteresis in access to weapons is consistently more apparent in countries with below-median levels in access to weapons, compared to their counterparts with above-median levels in access to weapons. The hysteresis hypothesis within this context is the propensity of past values of access to weapons to influence future values of access to weapons. Factors that consistently drive access to weapons are: perceptions of crime; criminality; conflict intensity; political instability; military expenditure, violent demonstrations and terrorism. The effects of these drivers are contingent on initial levels of access to weapons. Policy recommendations for managing access to weapons are discussed.

H56|Global Tourism and Waves of Terror: Perspectives from Military Expenditure|This study complements existing literature by investigating how military expenditure can modulate the effect of terrorism externalities on tourism. The geographical and temporal scopes are 163 countries and the period 2010-2015. The empirical evidence is based on negative binomial regressions. Terrorism externalities are measured in terms of terror-related incidents, injuries, fatalities and damaged properties. We find that military expenditure significantly lessens the destructive impact of these terror-related incidents in order to induce positive net effects on tourism. This finding is robust to all measurements of terrorism. Homicides and violent demonstrations reduce tourists’ arrivals whereas the rate of incarceration of convicted offenders has the opposite effect. The analysis is extended to income levels and regions in order to provide more opportunities for policy implications. Justifications for differences in these comparative tendencies are discussed.
H56|Social Divisiveness and Conflicts: Grievances Matter!|Somehow paradoxically, it is common for research on the determinants of civil wars to conclude that social factors matter much less, if at all, than economic factors. We contribute to this debate by conducting an original empirical analysis in which we investigate whether the deliberate unequal treatment of groups of people by a government can give rise to movements opposing the current political system. In doing so, we significantly innovate on the existing literature exploring the links between grievances and civil war. We look at all forms of social conflict, violent and non-violent, high and low intensity. Our index of social divisiveness captures multiple dimensions of observed unequal group treatments and is not restricted to latent ethnic divisions. We control for time-invariant factors in a large sample of countries over a long period of time. We take into account measurement uncertainty, dynamics, cross-region heterogeneity, localised spatial effects, non-linearity of effects, and a potential endogeneity bias. Our results show that social divisiveness has a large, positive, and statistically significant robust effect on anti-system opposition. It also appears to be the main channel through which long-lasting ethnic polarisation influences the onset of civil wars.
H56|Projected Costs of U.S. Nuclear Forces, 2019 to 2028|The nationâ€™s nuclear forces are reaching the end of their service life. CBO estimates that the Administrationâ€™s current plans to operate, maintain, and modernize them would cost $494 billion over the 2019â€“2028 period, or about 6 percent of the total 10-year costs of the plans for national defense outlined in the Presidentâ€™s 2019 budget submission. The current estimate is 23 percent (or $94 billion) higher than CBOâ€™s 2017 estimate for the 2017â€“2026 period, largely because modernization programs are further along in their development and some new programs have been added.
H56|Long-Term Implications of the 2019 Future Years Defense Program|If the Department of Defense (DoD) implemented the plans described in its 2019 Future Years Defense Program, its base budget (which funds normal peacetime activities) would climb from the $617 billion requested for 2019 to $735 billion (in 2019 dollars) in 2033, CBO estimates. Most of that increase would result from increased costs for military personnel and operation and maintenance. Base-budget costs would substantially exceed the share of funding that DoD has previously received under the Budget Control Actâ€™s funding caps in both 2020 and 2021, the final years subject to those
H56|Costs of Submarine Maintenance at Public and Private Shipyards|Public shipyards, which are owned and operated by the Navy, conduct a large majority of all submarine maintenance. To reduce delays at public shipyards, the Navy sent 29 submarines to private shipyards for Docking Selected Restricted Availability (DSRA) overhauls between 1993 and 2017. During that period, 117 DSRA overhauls were done at public shipyards. The overhauls conducted at private shipyards have been 31 percent less expensive, on average, by CBOâ€™s estimate. That gap has narrowed in recent years, but CBOâ€™s data include only one overhaul at a private shipyard after 2010.
H56|The Personnel Requirements and Costs of New Military Space Organizations|In this report, CBO considers five ways in which the Department of Defense (DoD) might be reorganized to increase its focus on space.

Measured in 2018 dollars, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) spent $65 billion on about 1.6 million beneficiaries in the seven years from the lawâ€™s inception through 2016. In 2016 alone, VBA spent $11 billion, an average of $17,400 per beneficiary.
H56|The Cost of Replacing Todayâ€™s Army Aviation Fleet|The U.S. Army has about 4,300 piloted aircraft. The replacement of three large helicopter fleets (Apaches, Black Hawks, and Chinooks) dominates the Armyâ€™s future aviation procurement costs. Because the Army made considerable investments in aircraft between 2007 and 2016, CBO projects that the annual costs of replacing the aircraft in the Armyâ€™s current fleet would decline during the 2020s, from about $4 billion in 2018 to about $1.5 billion in 2027. It would then rise to a peak of about $4.7 billion in 2032 before drifting downward between 2035 and 2045.
H56|Long-Term Implications of the 2020 Future Years Defense Program|As part of the Presidentâ€™s budget request, the Department of Defense (DoD) develops a plan called the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) that reflects DoDâ€™s expectations about its programs and costs over the next five years. According to CBOâ€™s projections, if the plans described in the 2020 FYDP were implemented, DoDâ€™s costs would increase from the $718 billion requested for 2020 to $776 billion (in 2020 dollars) by 2034.
H56|Does a Change of Government Influence Compliance with International Agreements? Empirical Evidence for the NATO Two Percent Target|We examine whether changes of government influence compliance with international agreements. We investigate compliance with the NATO two percent target to which all NATO countries committed themselves during the NATO summit in Wales in 2014. The dataset includes the military expenditure by NATO countries over the period 2010–2018. The results suggest that countries that do not (yet) comply with the two percent target have smaller growth rates in military expenditure relative to GDP when they experienced a large change of government, e.g. a change from a rightwing to a leftwing government, than countries that did not experience such a large change of government since the NATO summit in 2014. Countries that experienced a large change of government are, thus, less likely to comply with the two percent target. Future research should examine the credibility problem of national governments in other international agreements too.

H56|Does development aid increase military expenditure?|The diversion of development aid to the recipient’s military may be one explanation why aid is often found to be ineffective in promoting economic growth and development. Previous studies have not derived the causal effects of development aid on military expenditure. Using a new instrumental variable strategy, we examine whether bilateral development aid increases military expenditure in recipient countries. The instrument is the interaction of donor government fractionalization and the probability of receiving aid. The dataset includes new data on military expenditure for 124 recipient countries over the 1975-2012 period. While development aid has a positive effect on military expenditure in the full sample, the effect vanishes when we exclude outliers. However, we find that aid provided by coordinated market economies increases military expenditure in the full sample of recipient countries, even after controlling for outliers. Coordinated market economies have been found to deliver more government-to-government aid, which has a higher risk of capture compared to aid delivered through non-state development actors.
H56|Arms Production, National Defense Spending and Arms Trade: Examining Supply and Demand|Scholars have estimated demand functions for national defense spending and investigated international arms trade for a long time. The relationship between supply and demand for military goods has, however, only been examined on aggregate level or in formal models yet. I investigate how the supply of military goods by arms-producing companies and the demand for military goods by both the national government and foreign governments are related by using a panel of up to 195 arms-producing companies in 21 countries for the period 2002-2016. The results show that if the demand for national defense spending increases by 1%, the arms sales by a country’s largest arms-producing companies increase by up to 1.2%. If exports of major conventional weapons increase by 1%, sales increase by up to 0.2%. Arms imports do not affect domestic arms sales because imported and domestically produced arms are complements, and countries mainly import those arms they do not produce themselves. Country-specific estimation results suggest that differences among countries in geopolitical conditions and international relations determine whether a country’s arms industry serves economic rather than security purposes.
H56|Contracting for Counterintelligence: the KGB and Soviet Informers of the 1960s and 1970s|The informer network was a part of the human capital of the communist police state, which had the property of dissolving the freestanding social capital of ordinary citizens. How was it built, and what was the agency of the informers in the process? A few documents from the archives of the Soviet security police allow us to see good practices as the KGB saw them. They show some of the routes by which informers came to the attention of the KGB, their varied motivations, and their social and psychological strengths and weaknesses. The pivot of the process was a contract for counter-intelligence services. The contract itself was partly written, partly verbal or implied, and highly incomplete. Before the contract, searching and due diligence were required to identify potential recruits. After the contract, to turn a recruit into a productive informer involved a further period of training and monitoring, often extending to renegotiation and further investments by both sides in the capabilities of the informer and the relationship of trust with the handler. Trust and deception were two sides of the informer’s coin.
H56|Can Workfare Programs Moderate Conflict? Evidence from India|Can public interventions persistently reduce conflict? Adverse weather shocks, through their impact on incomes, have been identified as robust drivers of conflict in many contexts. An effective social insurance system moderates the impact of adverse shocks on household incomes, and hence, could attenuate the link between these shocks and conflict. This paper shows that a public employment program in India, by providing an alternative source of income through a guarantee of 100 days of employment at minimum wages, effectively provides insurance. This has an indirect pacifying effect. By weakening the link between productivity shocks and incomes, the program uncouples productivity shocks from conflict, leading persistently lower conflict levels.
H56|Coca, Cocaine and Drug Trafficking|The increase in the area cultivated with coca in Colombia has cast doubt on the country’s anti-drug strategy and has encouraged skepticism about the possibility of a complete and definitive peace. Furthermore, this perception of failure has given rise to policy proposals based on the idea that illicit crops are a criminal issue, not a development one. This paper is a complete review of the available evidence and aims at organizing the information related to this debate and shedding light on the convenience or inconvenience of certain policies. There are six highly relevant facts: (i) With respect to reducing cocaine supply, the efforts in seizures and destruction of infrastructure are more efficient than the efforts in eradication. (ii) Seizures and destruction of infrastructure may help in reducing coca plantations. (iii) There is no evidence to support the hypothesis that the consumption of cocaine in Colombia has increased. (iv) Most regions of the country have seen a decrease in the amount of coca crops. However, at least one armed group is present in the regions where the cultivated area has increased. (v) Coca growing municipalities are, on average, poorer than the rest of the country. These municipalities have a low tax revenue, and reduced levels of connectivity and institutional development. (vi) The increase in the consumption of cocaine in the United States is concentrated in a specific age group and in certain states. This fact makes it difficult to relate the increase in consumption to an exogenous increase in the supply.
H56|Los legados del conflicto armado sobre la capacidad de los hogares para mitigar los choques económicos negativos: Evidencia para Colombia|Este artículo estudia los legados de las instituciones creadas en tiempos de guerra, medidas como rebelocracia, sobre la capacidad de los hogares para mitigar choques negativos de ingresos. La rebelocracia es el orden social establecido por los actores armados no estatales (AANE) en las comunidades que controlan (Arjona, 2016). Al proveer bienes públicos y unas reglas predecibles, la rebelocracia puede generar incentivos para que los hogares expandan su producción y acumulen riqueza. Esto los situaría en trayectorias de ingreso más alto frente a aquellos hogares que viven en zonas de conflicto, pero inmersas en la violencia y el caos. Si estas mejores condiciones persisten después de que los AANE abandonan el territorio, los hogares en áreas con una rebelocracia fuerte podrán mitigar mejor los choques negativos de ingreso. La estrategia empírica identifica las respuestas de los hogares rurales a choques climáticos aleatorios y estima su impacto heterogéneo respecto al nivel de rebelocracia. Con base en un panel de hogares en cuatro regiones de Colombia afectadas por el conflicto, las estimaciones controlan por variables no observables que no varían en el tiempo. El estudio encuentra que, en las regiones con una rebelocracia fuerte, los hogares mitigan mejor los impactos negativos de los choques climáticos comparados con aquellos que viven en regiones con una intervención limitada o nula de los AANE. Los primeros hogares sufren un impacto menor después de enfrentar un choque climático, y recurren menos a la migración de supervivencia. La provisión de bienes públicos explica una parte importante del efecto de la rebelocracia. Es fundamental aclarar que esto no implica que el conflicto tenga efectos positivos sobre la población. Los resultados sugieren que vivir con reglas claras en medio del conflicto es mejor que vivir en medio de la incertidumbre y el caos. Si bien este estudio no estima efectos causales, los coeficientes estimados son robustos a controlar por factores que pueden explicar la instauración de la rebelocracia.
H56|Café ¿alternativa para la sustitución de cultivos de uso ilícito?|Uno de los principales retos para la consolidación del Acuerdo Final entre la guerrilla de las FARC y el Gobierno de Colombia tiene que ver con la sustitución de cultivos de uso ilícito por otros que brinden mejores condiciones económicas, como el caso del café. El presente documento busca responder si cultivar café es una alternativa económicamente viable para la sustitución de dichos cultivos. Para ello, se usan datos cuantitativos que permiten realizar un análisis comparativo entre el cultivo del café y el cultivo de la coca. Los resultados muestran las fuertes dificultades que no solo afronta el café, sino cualquier otro cultivo, frente a la coca en cuanto a rendimientos y precio. Estas condiciones configuran un gran reto para el Gobierno Nacional en la consolidación y desempeño de la sustitución de cultivos ilícitos. *** One of the main challenges for the consolidation of the Final Agreement between FARC guerrillas and the Colombian Government has to do with the substitution of illicit crops by others that offer better economic conditions, such as coffee. This paper seeks to answer whether growing coffee is an economically viable alternative for the substitution of illicit crops. For this purpose, quantitative data is used to carry out a comparative analysis between coffee and coca. The results show the strong difficulties faced not only buy coffee but by any other crop, against coca in terms of yields and price. This conditions constitutes a great challenge for the National Government in the consolidation and performance of the substitution of illicit crops.
H56|Del papel a la sustitución de cultivos ilícitos: análisis de la implementación del punto 4 del Acuerdo de paz en el departamento del Cauca|El punto cuatro del Acuerdo de paz entre el Gobierno colombiano y las FARC-EP, que aborda la solución al problema de los cultivos ilícitos, no ha tenido un grado homogéneo de implementación a lo largo del territorio nacional. Este estudio analiza las propuestas realizadas antes y después de la firma del Acuerdo para dar solución a esta situación en el departamento del Cauca. Se encuentran tres aspectos principales. En primer lugar, existe un aparente fracaso en las políticas antidrogas implementadas hasta antes de los acuerdos de paz en el departamento, especialmente asociado a la ineficiencia de la aspersión aérea de glifosato. En segundo lugar, existe un bajo grado de implementación de las disposiciones del punto 4 en el territorio. En tercer lugar, existe una serie de violaciones sistemáticas de DD.HH a líderes sociales del Cauca, especialmente hacia aquellos que apoyan la sustitución voluntaria de cultivos ilícitos. *** Point four of the Peace Agreement between Colombian Government and the FARC-EP, which addresses problem of illicit crops, has not had a homogeneous degree of implementation throughout the national territory. This study analyzes the proposals made before and after the signing of the Agreement to solve this situation in the department of Cauca. There are three main aspects. First, there is an apparent failure in the anti-drug policies implemented in the department prior to the peace accords, especially associated with the inefficiency of aerial spray of glyphosate. Secondly, there is a low degree of implementation of the provisions of point 4 in the territory. Third, there is a series of systematic human rights violations against social leaders in Cauca, especially those that support the voluntary substitution of illegal crops.
H56|Trust in Government in Times of Crisis: A Quasi-Experiment During the Two World Wars|Do crises erode trust in government? To answer this question, we leverage the quasi-experimental setting of the sharply increased military threat to the neutral county of Switzerland during the two world wars as an exogenous shock. In doing so, we exploit a unique feature of Swiss politics: government issuance of pre-referenda voting recommendations. We use constitu ent adherence to government recommendations as a behaviour al proxy for trus t in government, measured in real time prior to, duri ng, and after the crisis. Our difference-in- differences estimates provide strong evidence that constituents are significantly less likely to follow governmental voting recommendations during wartime.
H56|The Day after the Bomb: Well-being Effects of Terrorist Attacks in Europe|We study the non-monetary costs of the terrorist attacks occurred in France, Belgium and Germany between 2010 and 2017. Using four waves of the European Social Survey, we find that individuals' well-being is significantly reduced in the aftermath of a terrorist attack. We explore possible mechanisms for this effect, finding that terrorist attacks determine a reduction in generalized trust, institutional trust, satisfaction with democracy and satisfaction with the government. Terrorist attacks are also found to increase negative attitudes towards migrants and perceived discrimination. However, contrary to expectations, the negative impact of terrorism on well-being is less strong for Muslim immigrants. We posit that this occurs because immigrants benefit more than natives from the institutional reaction following the attacks.

H56|Fiscal multipliers in advanced and developing countries: evidence from military spending|Using novel data on military spending for 129 countries in the period 1988–2013, this paper provides new evidence on the effects of government spending on output in advanced and developing countries. Identifying government-spending shocks with an exogenous variation in military spending, we estimate one-year fiscal multipliers in the range 0.75-0.85. The cumulative multipliers remain significantly different from zero within three years after the shock. We find substantial heterogeneity in the multipliers across groups of countries. We then explore three potential sources leading to heterogeneous effects of fiscal policy: the state of the economy, openness to trade, and the exchange-rate regime. We find that the multipliers are especially large in recessions, in closed economies, and under a fixed exchange rate. We also discuss other potential reasons for heterogeneous effects of fiscal policy, such as its implementation and coordination with the monetary authority. This paper is a significantly revised and extended version of Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Working Papers No. 15-9, circulated under the title “Output Response to Government Spending: Evidence from New International Military Spending Data.”
H56|Terror Externalities and Trade: An Empirical Analysis|We report robust evidence of adverse cross-border externalities from terrorism on trade for over 160 countries from 1976 to 2014. Terrorism in one country spills over to reduce trade in neighboring nations. These externalities arise from higher trade costs due to trade delays and macroeconomic uncertainty.
H56|Syria in the Dark: Estimating the Economic Consequences of the Civil War through Satellite-Derived Night Time Lights|The Syrian Civil War has begun in 2011 and is still wrecking enormous damages on the country's economy, with an impressive toll measured in deaths, migration, and the destruction of the Syrian historical heritage and physical infrastructure. This paper examines the impact of the War on Syria's economy from the perspective of outer space, to bypass the issue of data availability due to the inaccessibility of the war-ravaged territory. The estimates obtained in this way are more pessimistic than the ones reported by international organisations. Starting from our estimates, we provide long-term projections for the country's economy, and estimate the window for GDP recovery at the pre-war levels. We discuss geo-political implications which could prevent our projections from happening.
H56|Cyber-risk insurance — a big challenge facing contemporary economies|Cyber-security beyond the concept must be a product to be offered to modern society. We live in a complex world based on the digitization of products and services. Digitization also involves a complex system of associated risks. The road to the world of tomorrow goes through today's world and an analysis of the current situation in the contemporary economies about cyber risk insurance is only a first step that this article aims to achieve.The study aims to substantiate the need to formulate and assume policies and to support the regulation of cyber risk coverage by ensuring the need to support sectoral strategies to increase the level of maturity of companies from the perspective of protection against cyber threats. There is also a need to set up a cyber-risk reporting system, at least for critical and important infrastructures, the development and use by insurers of advisory and evaluation models based on standards and certifications recognized at the level of including the development of necessary skills for insurers to engineer these risks.
H56|The defense economics and the military reform in Russia in 2018|In 2018, the total strength of the Armed Forces (AF) of the Russian Federation did not change. Early in February 2018, the President of the Russian Federation increased by 200 persons to 10,740 persons the ultimate staff number of the Central Office of the Ministry of Defense (without the guarding and building maintenance personnel taken into account), which is not included in the strength of the Armed Forces.
H56|Episodes of War and Peace in an Estimated Open Economy Model|We analyze the effects of large war episodes (world wars) on the macroeconomic dynamics of four advanced countries (France, Germany, the UK and the U.S.) by means of an estimated open-economy model. The model allows wars to produce specific effects on the economy through capital depreciation, sovereign default and a military draft. These effects, together with large surges in public spending and debt, and significant drops in labor taxes, account for the bulk of fluctuations during wars. We also use our estimations to discuss the size and state-dependence of output multipliers, and the size of welfare losses from fluctuations.

H56|The Effect of Parental Job Loss on Child School Dropout: Evidence from the Occupied Palestinian Territories|This paper explores how negative economic shocks affect household schooling decisions in the context of a developing country. In particular, we study the effect of parental job loss on child school dropout using data from the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). Our analysis focuses on Palestinian workers employed in Israel during the Second Intifada (2000-2006), whose job separation is arguably involuntary as determined by the intensity of the conflict. We employ an instrumental variable strategy and use individual's exposure to conflict as a plausibly exogenous source of variation in the employment status. Our results show that parental job loss increases child school dropout probability by 9 percentage points. The effect varies with the gender and the academic ability of the child, with the level of parental education, and the number of children in the household. We find evidence suggesting that the effect operates through the job loss-induced reduction in household income. We exclude alternative mechanisms such as family disruption or household relocation.
H56|Military Intervention via Drone Strikes|We study the 420 US drone strikes in Pakistan from 2006-2016, isolating causal effects on terrorism, anti-US sentiment, and radicalization via an instrumental variable strategy based on wind. Drone strikes are suggested to encourage terrorism in Pakistan, bearing responsibility for 16 percent of all attacks or 2,964 terror deaths. Exploring mechanisms, we distinguish between insiders (members of terrorist organizations) and outsiders (the Pakistani populace). Analyzing data from a leading Pakistani newspaper, anti-US protests, and Google searches, drone strikes appear to increase anti-US sentiment and radicalization: Outsiders seem to sympathize with insiders because of drone strikes.
H56|Hurricanes, Flood Risk and the Economic Adaptation of Businesses|This paper argues that increases in perceived flood risk entail a negative and persistent shock to local economic activity. Our analysis is based on a rich administrative dataset that contains all business establishments in New York City around the time of hurricane Sandy. Our data also identifies exactly which buildings suffered flooding-related damage due to the hurricane. We find evidence of a persistent reduction in the employment and wage income of establishments that suffered damage, along with higher exit rates. The persistence of the effects is consistent with an upward revision of flood-risk beliefs triggered by the hurricane. These findings suggest that businesses are adapting to the higher flood-risk environment by shifting operations toward safer areas. This adjustment process may mitigate the city-wide costs associated to sea-level rise.
H56|Growing up in the Iran-Iraq War and Preferences for Strong Defense|The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of individuals’ memories of the Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988) during early adulthood (18-25 years) on their preference for strong national defense forces and their willingness to fight for Iran (in the event of another war). Using the World Value Survey (WVS) data, we provide evidence that Iranians who experienced the war during early adulthood give top priority to strong defense forces. However, we find that there is no significant association between individuals’ memories of the war during early adulthood and their willingness to fight for Iran. The results are robust, controlling for a set of individuals’ socioeconomic and political characteristics.
H56|Grande Guerra e Guerra Colonial: Quanto Custaram aos Cofres Portugueses?|A Grande Guerra (1914-1918) e a Guerra Colonial (1961-1974) foram, sem dúvida, os dois conflitos bélicos mais importantes para Portugal no seu passado recente, tendo a sua despesa militar atingido valores recorde durante esses acontecimentos. De acordo com as estimativas apresentadas no presente estudo, o Estado português terá despendido com estas guerras - a preços de hoje, e na moeda actual -, 26,5 mil milhões de euros. Deste montante, 82% terá sido gasto com a Guerra Colonial e 18% com a Grande Guerra. Ao se disponibilizarem pela primeira vez valores concretos sobre os custos dos dois principais conflitos militares em que Portugal se envolveu no século XX, espera-se oferecer um valioso contributo à História Contemporânea de Portugal e estimular outros trabalhos de investigação sobre estes temas.

H56|Did the War on Terror Ignite an Opioid Epidemic?|Grim national statistics about the U.S. opioid crisis are increasingly well known to the American public. Far less well known is that U.S. war veterans are at ground zero of the epidemic, facing an overdose rate twice that of civilians. Post-9/11 deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq have exposed servicemembers to injury-related chronic pain, psychological trauma, and cheap opium supplies, each of which may fuel opioid addiction. This study is the first to estimate the causal impact of combat deployments in the Global War on Terrorism on opioid abuse. We exploit a natural experiment in overseas deployment assignments and find that combat service substantially increased the risk of prescription painkiller abuse and illicit heroin use among active duty servicemen. War-related physical injuries, death-related battlefield trauma, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder emerge as primary mechanisms. The magnitudes of our estimates imply lower-bound combat exposure-induced health care costs of $1.04 billion per year for prescription painkiller abuse and $470 million per year for heroin use.

Can we learn from the ancient Greek federal experience?|In this paper we analyze in brief how two ancient Greek federations, the Boeotoian and the Achaean ones took decisions on two crucial issues that relate the balance of power between city-states- members within the federation and defense policy. We analyze why the Boeotoian Federation followed a wrong grand strategy whereas the Achaean one implemented a prudent strategy regarding the issue of federal principles. Lastly, we compare our findings with a series of decisions that were taken in the last years by the today’s European Union (EU) policy-makers, and we relate them to the issues of “mismanagement” of “solidarity” of economic policies among member-states and democratic decision-making.
H56|Terrorist attacks and public approval and confidence in the Russian president: Evidence from time series analysis|In this paper we apply time series analysis to examine weekly data of Vladimir Putin’s approval and confidence ratings and their dependence on terrorist attacks. We find that minor terrorist attacks with few or no mortal casualties in Chechnya, Ingushetia and Dagestan increase Putin’s ratings, while major terrorist attacks, with more than four mortal casualties, have a negative impact. There is also evidence that terrorist attacks in other Russian regions reduce Putin’s public approval; however, this evidence is weaker and depends on the model specification. The effects of terrorist attacks on the confidence rating are indistinguishable from the statistical noise. Furthermore, we control for main annual media events with President Putin’s participation: the television Q&A program `Direct Line with V. Putin', address to the Federal Assembly and a large annual conference. All three media events increase the president’s approval, with `Direct Line' having the least effect. Only the large annual conference has a significant positive impact on respondents’ confidence in Putin.
H56|Geopolitical Risk and R&D investment|Although most empirical studies conclude that uncertainty delays firms' investments based on real options theory, empirical evidence regarding the impact of uncertainty on innovation is mixed. This study examines the impact of geopolitical risk (GPR) on corporate research and development (R&D) investment using newly developed indices. We find a negative relationship between GPR and R&D investment. The R&D investment rapidly drops and rebounds several quarters after high GPR. The impact of GPR is most significant for high-tech firms, small firms, and firms with high growth options. However, when GPRs are realised, these significant and negative effects disappear. These results are shown to be robust after controlling for firm characteristics, macroeconomic environment, other uncertainty measures, time, and alternative GPR and R&D measures, as well as considering the simultaneity and endogeneity issues. Overall, our study suggests that GPR plays a key role in determining R&D investment.
H56|Alienating Marx(ists) from the Cold War into Surveillance Capitalism|Marx?s Machine Age theory of capitalism ascribes a unique driving role for alienation and argues new modes of production emerge from past modes of production. Presently so-called surveillance capitalism is superseding Machine Age capitalism and distributing wealth unequally to a 1% global elite. There are debates about what alienation is at work in this changed epoch. Premised on Marx?s idea that modes of production are born in the previous epoch along with the alienation that works with them, a hypothesis about how today?s Internet enables both endless free speech, while inversely and simultaneously, enabling endless spying with impunity is presented here. The hypothesis is a conceptualization of alienation labeled as ?known unknown.? The adaption of the term ?known unknown alienation? stems from the discourse in the film, ?The Unknown Known? which highlights aspects of known unknown alienation, in the form of so-called national security experts who are mentally divided about what they can and can not know (or talk about) and also the divide between the expert and the taxpayer, who does not qualify to have access to the same information that the expert has. This personal internal contradiction and social alienation is compounded because Americans are proud of US constitutionally protected free speech rights (which according to The Citizens United Act allows corporations to be individuals); these contradictions help drive surveillance capitalism. The historical-comparative argument is: ?Communist hunting? intelligence agents, scientists, and contractors, backed by neoliberal economists, built a military-industrial-complex that obligated them to both known and not know, or in the case of the CIA be ?witting? of national security secrets, which alienated them from US constitutional free speech. Their alienation manifest in their interactive inventions - the Internet, pc and cell phone - devices that today dialectically give customers the ability to express free speech endlessly in electronic memory form, while inversely giving spies unlimited access to that speech with impunity. This process works in tandem: enabling appropriation of data for government surveillance and service fee payments for corporations.
H56|Exploiting the ?Communist Threat?, for the Privatized Internet|Levine?s Surveillance Valley reports how the Internet was privatized without public debate or resistance but overlooks decades of neoliberal economic and anti-communist purging history that had chilling effects on public resistance to Internet privatization - that history gap is explored here. How did military-industrial-complex contractors, using neoliberal and Communist threat rational, incentivize Internet development, while lessening the possibility of public interference to Internet privatization? Weber?s special-skilled-occupational-status-group-theory is overlaid onto neoliberal economic and military-industrial-complex history to argue occupational-contractor-status-groups, with their monopoly access to early computer technology, fulfilled neoliberal doctrine by creating and protecting private markets for the Internet and exploited Communist threat rational to help clear the privatization path of people who might impede market plans.
H56|Mostly Harmless Simulations? Using Monte Carlo Studies for Estimator Selection|We consider two recent suggestions for how to perform an empirically motivated Monte Carlo study to help select a treatment effect estimator under unconfoundedness. We show theoretically that neither is likely to be informative except under restrictive conditions that are unlikely to be satisfied in many contexts. To test empirical relevance, we also apply the approaches to a real-world setting where estimator performance is known. Both approaches are worse than random at selecting estimators which minimise absolute bias. They are better when selecting estimators that minimise mean squared error. However, using a simple bootstrap is at least as good and often better. For now researchers would be best advised to use a range of estimators and compare estimates for robustness.
H56|Can Workfare Programs Moderate Conﬂict? Evidence from India|Can public interventions persistently reduce conﬂict? Adverse weather shocks, through their impact on incomes, have been identiﬁed as robust drivers of conﬂict in many contexts. An effective social insurance system moderates the impact of adverse shocks on house hold incomes, and hence,could attenuate the link between these shocks and conﬂict. This paper shows that a public employment program in India, by providing an alternative source of income through a guarantee of 100 days of employment at minimum wages, effectively provides insurance. This has an indirect pacifying effect. By weakening the link between productivity shocks and incomes, the program uncouples productivity shocks from conﬂict, leading persistently lower conﬂict levels
H56|Walls and Fences: A Journey Through History and Economics|Throughout history, border walls and fences have been built for defense, to claim land, to signal power, and to control migration. The costs of fortifications are large while the benefits are questionable. The recent trend of building walls and fences signals a paradox: In spite of the anti-immigration rhetoric of policymakers, there is little evidence that walls are effective in reducing terrorism, migration, and smuggling. Economic research suggests large benefits to open border policies in the face of increasing global migration pressures. Less restrictive migration policies should be accompanied by institutional changes aimed at increasing growth, improving security and reducing income inequality in poorer countries.
H56|The economic consequences of terrorism for the European Union|In recent years, a number of major terrorist attacks in EU member states has put the fight against homegrown and international terrorism at the top of the agenda of European policy-makers. This paper analyzes the costs of terrorism in the European Union from both a theoretical and empirical perspective in order to evaluate counter-terrorism policies by comparing their costs and benefits. Two important policy implications can be derived from our exercise. First, individuals' behavioral predispositions typically result in a biased perception of the risk of terrorism leading to too high a demand for counter-terrorism measures relative to what the objective probability of terrorist events suggests. This results in a tendency to favor repressive over preventive measures against terrorism. Second, uncoordinated European policies against terrorism have the potential to undermine the effectiveness of counter-terrorism measures. If there is a justification for the existence of the European Union (which an increasing number of populist parties in Europe seems to doubt), then it is to provide supranational answers to coordination failure in European counter-terrorism policies.
H56|You failed! Government satisfaction and party preferences facing Islamist terrorism|International crises like dramatic terror attacks leave their mark on society in various ways. According to the existing literature, some of these consequences include two seemingly conflicting responses: increasing as well as decreasing support for the incumbent government. To make sense of this seeming contradiction, this study combines these observations in one empirical framework. We investigate the effects of Islamist terrorism on citizens' evaluation of the national government by logistic regression analyses using data from the European Social Survey (ESS) for Germany from 2014 to 2017. Our analyses demonstrate that support for the government significantly increases in the aftermath of Islamist terror attacks. However, the intensity of such support decreases with repeated exposure to terror attacks, and these effects even reverse when a certain level of terror is reached. Further, we find that radical right parties benefit from the issues accentuated by terrorism.
H56|Determinants of International Arms Control Ratification|The paper analyses the determinants of ratification of international treaties concerning arms control. It theorizes that the ratification of an arms control treaty serves as a signal of a country’s intention to avoid arms races and wars. I argue that fast growing countries have a special incentive to send that signal in order to avoid aggression from declining powers. Also, democracies are hypothesised to support the underlying humanitarian norms of arms control treaties and therefore ratify arms control agreements more often. The theory is tested by panel ordered logit regression of the number of treaties ratified by a country and with panel logit estimation of treaty ratification. The data cover 186 countries over the period of 1975-2010. Results support the theory and suggest that especially treaties where compliance can be considered as cheap are ratified more often.
H56|Still Tools of Repression? Re-Assessing the Effect of Arms Imports on Physical Integrity Rights|Small arms and light weapons (SALWs) imports have been found to be linked to a worsening of human rights conditions in the importing state. In this paper, we reexamine the relationship of government’s SALW imports and the decision to engage in violations of physical integrity rights using updated and more reliable repression data as well as proposing a different estimation strategy. Analyzing physical integrity rights violations and SALW imports of 176 countries from 1991 to 2010, empirical results indicate that SALW imports have a negative impact on respect for physical integrity rights. When disaggregating findings by regime type, we find that SALW imports in autocracies are associated with more repression, while we have mixed results for democracies.
H56|Verteidigungsausgaben in der (wirtschafts)politischen Diskussion|Die deutschen Verteidigungsausgaben werden im Rahmen der NATO immer wieder als zu niedrig kritisiert, insbesondere von Seiten der US-Administration. Auch wenn die Bindungswirkung des Ziels für die Militärausgaben in Höhe von 2 Prozent des Bruttoinlandsprodukts strittig ist, hat es doch erhebliche politische Relevanz. Deutschland bewegt sich seit Jahren deutlich unter diesem Ziel und wird es auch nach den aktuellen Haushaltsplanungen in den nächsten Jahren nicht erreichen. Im Gegensatz zu anderen europäischen Ländern hat Deutschland seine Verteidigungsausgaben nach dem Ende des Kalten Krieges deutlich gesenkt und auf dem niedrigeren Niveau gehalten. In den Achtziger Jahren lagen die Ausgaben in Deutschland noch zwischen zwei und drei Prozent des BIP, heute sind es laut der NATO-Definition noch 1,2 Prozent. Die beiden europäischen Atommächte geben jährlich rund 2 Prozent ihrer Wirtschaftsleistung für die Landesverteidigung aus, nachdem es gegen Ende des Kalten Krieges bis zu fünf Prozent waren. Verglichen mit dem absoluten Niveau von 1990 konnte Deutschland eine Friedensdividende von über 400 Milliarden Dollar in Form von geringeren Ausgaben einfahren. Die aktuellen außenpolitischen Diskussionen, eine sich verändernde Sicherheitslage und vielfach beklagte Ausrüstungsmängel der Bundeswehr können zu steigenden Ausgaben und damit zu zusätzlichen Risiken für den Bundeshaushalt führen. Die bisherige Finanzplanung spiegelt dies nur eingeschränkt wider.
H56|Extractive Institutions, Choking Taxes, and War: On the (Beneficial) Impact of Inequality in Autocracies|We develop a framework for analyzing how the distribution of income-earning ability among citizens affects an autocrat’s extractive policies and her intended risk of war. Relying on a general equilibrium model, we show that (i) autocrats can utilize the military for redistribution and (ii) are most powerful for extreme un-/equal distributions. Consequently, ordinary citizens benefit from not-too-low inequality. Our model also implies that disastrous economic policies, characteristic for many kleptocratic autocracies, are not necessarily unintended side effects of rent-seeking but rationally chosen governance. Depending on the level of inequality, autocrats can deter foreign threats by choking the economy. This policy may prevent hostilities but also causes ordinary citizens to favor war since the autocrat would then loose her grip at home. Our results help to explain why some autocrats maintain far-too-great armies, while others suffocate their economies, and yet others were drawn into wars.
H56|Religion and Terrorism: Evidence from Ramadan Fasting|We study the effect of religion and intense religious experiences on terrorism by focusing on one of the five pillars of Islam: Ramadan fasting. For identification, we exploit two facts: First, daily fasting from dawn to sunset during Ramadan is considered mandatory for most Muslims. Second, the Islamic calendar is not synchronized with the solar cycle. We find a robust negative effect of more intense Ramadan fasting on terrorist events within districts and country-years in predominantly Muslim countries. This effect seems to operate partly through decreases in public support for terrorism and the operational capabilities of terrorist groups.
H56|Earthquakes and Terrorism: The Long Lasting Effect of Seismic Shocks|The literature on the effect of shocks on civil conflicts has grown rapidly over the last decade. In this paper, we study the relationship between earthquakes and terrorism. Medium intensity earthquakes can produce an inadequate response on the part of the government and generate, or exacerbate, previous grievances perceived by the population of the affected area. Since destruction of infrastructures in these cases would be limited, the state keeps most of its coercive capacity, which reduces the chances of full-fledged conflict but leaves open the possibility of low intensity rebellious acts such as terrorism. We propose a new algorithm to classify terrorism events as domestic or transnational, and we show that the likelihood of a domestic terrorist events increases with the previous occurrence of an earthquake. Using earthquakes as an instrument for income, we also show that development has a positive and significant effect on the likelihood of terrorist events.
H56|The Depot-Level Maintenance of DoD's Combat Aircraft: Insights for the F-35|Depot-level maintenance of military aircraft consists of in-depth maintenance that is beyond the capability of maintenance staff at an aircraftâ€™s operating location. Depot-level maintenance is essential to ensuring an aircraftâ€™s capability to perform missions and can influence whether an aircraftâ€™s life can be extended cost-effectively. This report focuses on depot-level maintenance practices for the Air Forceâ€™s and Navyâ€™s combat aircraft as sources of insights for the new F-35 fighter aircraft.
H56|Comparing a 355-Ship Fleet With Smaller Naval Forces|In 2016 the Navy released a new force structure assessment that called for a fleet of 355 ships. CBO has estimated the costs of achieving such a fleet under two alternative approaches and has compared those scenarios with alternatives involving a fleet of 280 ships or 230 ships in 2047. This report explores the effects on shipbuilding and operating costs, the composition and capabilities of the fleet, and the shipbuilding industry.
H56|A Historical Survey of Ship Reactivations|In December 2016, the Navy released a new force structure assessment that called for a ï¬‚eet of 355 shipsâ€”substantially larger than the current force of 283 ships. This report focuses on one of several approaches that the Navy could use to increase the size of its fleet: reactivating decommissioned ships. It draws insights from past experiences that might inform lawmakersâ€™ decisions about reactivating retired ships in the future.
H56|Funding for Overseas Contingency Operations and Its Impact on Defense Spending|Since 2001, the Department of Defense (DoD) has received about $2.2 trillion to supplement the base-budget funding provided in its regular, annual appropriationsâ€”amounting to about 20 percent of DoDâ€™s appropriations over that time. Almost all of that sum has been designated for overseas contingency operations (OCO) that began after 9/11.
H56|An Analysis of the Navy's Fiscal Year 2019 Shipbuilding Plan|Every year, the Navy submits a report that describes the planned inventory, purchases, deliveries, and retirements of the ships in its fleet for the next 30 years. The 2019 shipbuilding plan calls for expanding the fleet to 355 battle force ships. CBO estimates that the plan would cost an average of $28.9 billion per year (in 2018 dollars) over 30 yearsâ€”or 80 percent more than the $15.8 billion the Navy has received, on average, in annual appropriations in recent decades. CBOâ€™s estimate of the cost of the plan is higher than the Navyâ€™s.
H56|The Cost of Replacing Todayâ€™s Air Force Fleet|The U.S. Air Force has about 5,600 aircraft, which range in age from just-delivered to 60 years old. Many of those aircraft are nearing the end of their service life. In this report, CBO estimates that replacing those aircraft would cost an average of $15 billion a year in the 2020s. That figure would rise to $23 billion in the 2030s and then fall back to about $15 billion in the 2040s. In comparison, appropriations for procuring new aircraft averaged about $12 billion per year between 1980 and 2017 (in 2018 dollars).
H56|Funding for International Affairs Activities, Within and Outside Agenciesâ€™ Base Budgets|The Congress provides the State Department, the Agency for International Development (USAID), and other agencies a â€œbase budgetâ€ each year to fund ongoing activities related to international affairs. The agencies have received other â€œnonbaseâ€ funding in recent years, in the form of supplemental appropriations, emergency appropriations, and funding for overseas contingency operations. In this report, CBO analyzes the recent use of such nonbase appropriations for international affairs activities.
H56|Possible Higher Spending Paths for Veterans' Benefits|The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers a variety of programs for veterans and their families. Measured in 2018 dollars, VA spent $180 billion on those benefits in 2017, nearly triple what it spent in 2000 after removing the effects of inflation. To help policymakers assess the risks associated with higher costs, this report presents projections of VAâ€™s spending through 2028 under three scenarios, a modified version of CBOâ€™s baseline and two alternative scenarios involving more rapid spending growth.

H56|The Soviet economy: the late 1930s in historical perspective|This paper is draft of the concluding chapter of The industrialisation of Soviet Russia,vol.7:The Soviet economyand the approach of war,1937– 1939, in preparation for publication by Palgrave Macmillan. We consider the development of the Soviet economy over the period of the series, that is, from the launching of the first five-year plan and the collectivisation of agriculture to the outbreak of the Second World War. We review, in turn, the pattern of forced industrialisation, the measurement and mismeasurement of economic progress, the extraordinary militarisation of a mobilised society and economy, the emergence of the Soviet Union as a global military power, and the scope for reforms within the economic system that Stalin created and ruled over.

H56|Conflicto Armado, Estado y Homicidios en Colombia: Una Aproximación a Nivel Local|En este documento se estudian las relaciones causales entre conflicto armado, disuasión del crimen y violencia homicida. Se emplean datos de corte transversal a nivel municipal que comprenden el periodo del 2000 al 2014. El estudio utiliza una muestra que contiene aquellos municipios que tuvieron presencia del Estado en 1794 y a los municipios adyacentes. Lo anterior con el fin de tener una muestra más homogénea y realizar comparaciones entre municipios similares. La estrategia de identificación emplea efectos fijos de municipios vecinos, variable instrumental y análisis de mediación. Como variable instrumental se utiliza la distancia lineal de la cabecera municipal a la frontera de la zona de distensión, creada en 1998. Los resultados muestran que indicadores de disuasión del crimen, como fuerza policial y capturas, se afectan negativamente por la presencia del conflicto armado. Pero que este efecto negativo no es la causa de un aumento en los homicidios municipales. Por tanto, se muestra que la fuerza policial y las capturas no son canales a través de los cuales el conflicto afecta a los homicidios. Por último, se encuentran efectos heterogéneos de la presencia histórica de Estado. En aquellos municipios con una presencia más larga del Estado en el tiempo, el gobierno asigna mayor número de policías como respuesta al conflicto armado. Como consecuencia de esto, las tasas de homicidios en esos municipios disminuyen.
H56|Informe del gasto del gobierno de Colombia en lucha antidrogas 2013 - 2015. Informe final|El objetivo de este documento es responder a la siguiente pregunta: ¿Cuánto gasta el Estado colombiano en la lucha contra las drogas? La respuesta corta es que, excluyendo el gasto en seguridad y defensa, el Estado colombiano gastó en 2015 $970.480 millones de pesos en la lucha contra las drogas. En 2013 esa cifra fue de $1.174.651 millones y en 2014 de $1.140.019 millones. ¿Por qué es relevante responder a esta pregunta? Básicamente por dos razones: la primera es que se trata de un gasto importante, equivalente al 0,5% del gasto general de la Nación. La segunda es que la cifra hace parte del informe de seguimiento que periódicamente se remite al congreso de Estados Unidos y del cual depende en gran medida la aprobación de recursos de cooperación para Colombia.

H56|Responding to the SDG16 Measurement Challenge: The Governance, Peace and Security Survey Modules in Africa|This paper presents an ongoing initiative, built on a practical approach grounded in fieldwork, to produce harmonised statistics on governance, peace and security (GPS) at continental level in Africa. The methodology consists of adding standardised GPS modules to official socioeconomic household surveys. In keeping with the widely promoted principles of inclusiveness and participation, the use of statistical surveys of large, representative samples of the population is a good strategy for voicing citizens’ views and concerns. The adoption of the 2030 agenda, which positions institution‐building and governance issues as a cornerstone of sustainable development, provides a unique opportunity to consolidate this pioneering African experience. Institutionalisation of the production of GPS statistics by national statistics offices in the official statistics field offers a promising means to take up the Goal 16 measurement challenge. The paper describes the main methodological options for doing so and draws lessons and initial evidence from a dozen countries that have piloted the GPS survey module. Selected empirical results illustrate the analytical potential and policy relevance of this approach.
H56|Sous la crise anglophone au Cameroun: frustrations politiques et défiance à l’égard des autorités publiques|A l’aube d’un 7ème mandat présidentiel de Paul Biya, la situation politique s'est sévèrement dégradée au Cameroun depuis 2016, avec notamment la résurgence des velléités sécessionnistes des deux régions anglophones, le Nord-Ouest et le Sud-Ouest. Quelles sont les bases sociales et politiques des tensions qui parcourent ces deux régions ? Pour ce faire, nous mobilisons principalement une enquête statistique originale menée auprès de la population fin 2014 sur la Gouvernance, la Paix et la Sécurité (GPS-SHaSA), réalisée avec l’appui scientifique des auteurs. L’article montre que la situation n'est pas que le reflet de stratégies individuelles d’entrepreneurs politiques en mal d’assises électorales et sans ancrage populaire sérieux. La crise anglophone reflète bien des aspirations démocratiques d’une population qui se considère comme des citoyens de seconde zone. Certes, sur de nombreux aspects les Anglophones ne se distinguent pas substantiellement de leurs homologues francophones ; ils ne vivent pas des difficultés plus aigües au quotidien, ni ne se montrent forcément plus négatifs. En revanche, il est un domaine où la « question anglophone » prend corps : leur défiance massive à l’égard du pouvoir et des institutions publiques. _______english________ At the dawn of a 7th presidential term of Paul Biya, following the election of October 7, 2018, Cameroon’s political situation has deteriorated dramatically since 2016 largely due to the resurgence of separatist impulses in the two Anglophone Northwest and Southwest regions. What are the social and political causes of the unrest sweeping through these two regions? In answer to this question, we draw primarily on an original statistical survey of the population on Governance, Peace and Security (GPS-SHaSA) conducted with the authors’ scientific assistance in late 2014. The article shows that the situation is not merely the reflection of individual strategies by political entrepreneurs in need of an electoral base and with no serious popular support. The Anglophone crisis reflects many of the democratic aspirations of a population who see themselves as second-class citizens. In many ways, the English speakers are not so very different from their French-speaking counterparts; they neither experience more serious difficulties day to day nor are they necessarily more negative. However, there is one area in which the “Anglophone issue” really takes shape: their massive distrust of government and public institutions.

Par rapport aux autres sciences sociales, l’économie n’a que très récemment investi ce champ d’étude. Comme pour rattraper son retard, nous assistons depuis une vingtaine d’années à une effervescence de la recherche économétrique sur le sujet. Quelles conclusions tirer de ces travaux ? Ce document définit le périmètre d’analyse de ce champ d’étude en insistant sur trois mécanismes profonds à l’origine des comportements de prédation : les capacités de l’Etat, la valeur du gain issu de la capture de l’Etat et le coût d’opportunité d’entrer dans un groupe armé auquel les individus font face (i.e. l’arbitrage entre des activités de production ou de prédation). Il dresse également un bilan des contraintes et avancées récentes dans l’analyse causale des conflits internes. Il montre que l’amélioration des méthodes d’inférence causale, des outils économétriques et des méthodes de collecte de données dessine des perspectives de recherche prometteuses sur des sujets tels que le rôle de la cohésion sociale et les conséquences du changement climatique sur le risque de conflit.

H56|Measuring Geopolitical Risk|We present a monthly indicator of geopolitical risk based on a tally of newspaper articles covering geopolitical tensions, and examine its evolution and effects since 1985. The geopolitical risk (GPR) index spikes around the Gulf War, after 9/11, during the 2003 Iraq invasion, during the 2014 Russia-Ukraine crisis, and after the Paris terrorist attacks. High geopolitical risk leads to a decline in real activity, lower stock returns, and movements in capital flows away from emerging economies and towards advanced economies. When we decompose the index into threats and acts components, the adverse effects of geopolitical risk are mostly driven by the threat of adverse geopolitical events. Extending our index back to 1900, geopolitical risk rose dramatically during the World War I and World War II, was elevated in the early 1980s, and has drifted upward since the beginning of the 21st century.
H56|Military economy and military reform in Russia|The number of Russian Armed Forces (RFAF) authorized strength at year-end 2017 increased 17,387 to 1,903,758 on the back of disbandment of the Federal Special Construction Agency (Spetsstroy); therefore, the RFAF’s total authorized strength rose to 1,013,628 from 1 million.[1] That was the first time when data on RFAF’s authorized war strength (1,700,000) were published by mass media, posting a substantial decrease from 5 million reported prior to the military reform of 2008-2012.The Russian Defense Ministry did not publish 2017 year-end service personnel statistics like it did in previous years; therefore, the total accountable strength presumably decreased to 240,000 from previous year’s 270,000 as a result of a 35,000 (13 percent) decline in the number of conscript personnel. Overall, the 2017 total number of conscript personnel inflow stood at 276,000, or 31,000 (10 percent) less than in 2016 .
H56|Foreign Financial Flows and Terrorism In Developing Countries|This study examines the differential response of various international financial flows to post 9/11 episode of terrorism in developing countries. Using monthly data for the period from January 2003 to June 2013, we employ ARMAX technique to analyze the impact of terrorism in Pakistan on the inflows of foreign direct investments (FDI), portfolio investments, migrant remittances and exports receipts. We find that FDI falls substantially as a result of terrorist activity, whereas portfolio investments and exports show little change. In contrast, migrant remittances show a significant increase. These differences are also visible among financial flows coming from major source regions and countries. The results are robust to use of alternative definitions and indicators of terrorism as well as the inclusion of various macroeconomic variables. These findings indicate that foreign private capital flees an economy suffering from terrorism whereas domestic producers stay put. Migrant remittances, however, are the only financial flows that rise in the time of difficulty.
H56|Mass Atrocities and their Prevention|Counting conservatively, and ignoring physical injuries and mental trauma, data show about 100 million mass atrocity-related deaths since 1900. Occurring in war and in peacetime, and of enormous scale, severity, and brutality, they are geographically widespread, occur with surprising frequency, and can be long-lasting in their adverse effects on economic and human development, wellbeing, and wealth. As such, they are a major economic concern. This article synthesizes very diverse and widely dispersed theoretical and empirical literatures, addressing two gaps: a �mass atrocities gap� in the economics literature and an �economics gap� in mass atrocities scholarship. Our goals are, first, for noneconomists to learn how economic inquiry contributes to understanding the causes and conduct of mass atrocities and possibly to their mitigation and prevention and, second, to survey and synthesize for economists a broad sweep of literatures to serve as a common platform on which to base further work in this field.
H56|Seeking No War, Achieving No Peace: The Conflict over the Siachen Glacier|This paper models “no war, no peace” situations in a game theoretical framework where two countries are engaged in a standoff over a military sector. The first main objective is to identify rational grounds for such situations and, more precisely, explicit equilibria that leads to such situations. It is demonstrated that both countries get the same payoff from being in this continuous state of perpetual hostility and, moreover, that “no war, no peace” situations can be explained only if the countries perceive an equal measure of military advantage by controlling the area. Given this insight, the second objective of the paper is to provide insights about how “no war, no peace” situations can be resolved. Two different pathways are suggested. The first is idealistic and based on mutual trust whereas the second is based on deterrence meaning that both countries impose a threat of using armed force against the other country in their respective military doctrines.
H56|Violent Conflict and the Child Quantity-Quality Tradeoff|We show that the exposure to war-related violence increases the quantity of children temporarily, with permanent negative consequences for the quality of the current and previous cohorts. Our empirical evidence is based on Nepal, which experienced a ten year long civil conflict of varying intensity. We exploit that villages affected by the conflict had the same trend in fertility as non-affected villages prior to the onset of conflict and employ a difference-in-differences estimator. We find that women in affected villages increased their actual and desired fertility during the conflict by 22 percent, while child height-for-age declined by 11 to 13 percent. Supporting evidence suggests that the temporary fertility increase was the main pathway leading to reduced child height, as opposed to direct impacts of the conflict.
H56|Combat, Casualties, and Compensation: Evidence from Iraq and Afghanistan|Our research examines the effect of combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan on casualties. We use restricted data from the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) and Social Security Administration (SSA) to construct a panel of all U.S. Active Duty service members having served at some point during the years 2001-2012. Casualties disproportionately occur at higher rates among (i) young, white, males (ii) enlisted personnel (iii) less educated personnel (iv) and those in combat job types. Our estimates indicate that overall U.S. military personnel who deployed in an individual year to Iraq or Afghanistan had a 48 per 100,000 higher probability of death than non-deployed military personnel who remained stateside. The increased fatal injury risk of deployed U.S. military personnel is 15 times higher than the national average civilian workplace fatality rate, but roughly equal to the fatal injury risk faced in some of the most dangerous civilian occupations. Our estimates suggest a compensating wage differential equal to $808 per month would be appropriate, in comparison to the current status quo of $225 per month in danger pay (and additional tax benefits) provided to U.S. military personnel deployed into combat zones. The additional compensation should also be adjusted by service or job type.
H56|The Effects of Flood Insurance on Housing Markets|We analyze the role of flood insurance on the housing markets of coastal cities. To do so we have assembled a parcel-level dataset including the universe of residential sales for three coastal urban areas in the United States - Miami-Dade county (2008- 2015), New York city (2003-2016), and Virginia Beach (2000-2016) - matched with their FEMA flood maps, which characterize the flood risk level for each property. First, we compare trends in housing values and sales activity among properties on the floodplain, as defined by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), relative to properties located elsewhere within the same city. Despite the heightened flood risk in the last two decades, we did not find evidence of divergent trends, suggesting that flood insurance may have cushioned the effects of the increase in flood risk. Secondly, we analyze the effects of the recent reforms to the NFIP. In 2012 and 2014, Congress passed legislation that led to important increases in insurance premia and updates of flood maps. We fail to find an effect of increases in premia on the values of floodplain properties in Virginia Beach and Miami-Dade, but we do find evidence of an effect in New York coinciding with the aftermath of hurricane Sandy. We also find some evidence of price changes for properties that experienced a change in risk classification in the new FEMA flood maps. We conclude that the full effects of the 2012-2014 flood insurance reforms have not yet taken place but will probably materialize in the future.
H56|Violent Conflict and the Child Quantity-Quality Tradeoff|We show that the exposure to war-related violence increases the quantity of children temporarily, with permanent negative consequences for the quality of the current and previous cohort of children. Our empirical evidence is based on Nepal, which experienced a ten year long civil conflict of varying intensity. Our difference-in-differences analysis shows that women in villages affected by civil conflict increased their actual and desired fertility during the conflict by 22 percent, while child height-for-age declined by 11 to 13 percent. Supporting evidence suggests that the temporary fertility increase was the main pathway leading to reduced child height, as opposed to direct impacts of the conflict. This likely occurred because there were more mouths to feed in these households.
H56|The Economics of Peace and War: An Overview|Violence and conflicts have caused suffering throughout history. Moreover, the arrival of nuclear weapons even raised concerns about the survival of humankind. This special issue analyzes the causes and consequences of violence and conflict. It covers wars, civil wars, and terrorism, as well as organization of the military and its effects on the rest of the society.
H56|Should they stay or should they go? Climate Migrants and Local Conflicts|"There is extensive evidence that higher temperature increases the probability of local conflict. There is also some evidence that emigration represents an important margin of adaptation to climatic change. In this paper we analyse whether migration influences the link between warming and conflicts by either attenuating the effects in countries of origin and/or by spreading them to countries of destination. We find that in countries where emigration propensity, as measured by past diaspora, was higher, increases in temperature had a smaller effects on conflict probability, consistent with emigration functioning as ""escape valve"" for local tensions. We find no evidence that climate-induced migration increased the probability of conflict in receiving countries."
H56|The Impact of Industry Consolidation on Government Procurement: Evidence from Department of Defense Contracting|We study the relationship between market structure and public procurement outcomes. In particular, we ask whether and to what extent consolidation-driven increases in industry concentration affect the way in which the government procures its goods and services. We focus on the defense industry, by far the largest contributor to federal procurement spending in the U.S. This industry experienced a sharp increase in the level of concentration during the 1990s, driven by a series of large mergers between defense contractors. Using detailed microdata on Department of Defense (DoD) contract awards, we estimate the causal effect of industry concentration on a series of procurement outcomes, leveraging the differential impact of these mergers across product markets. We find that market concentration caused the procurement process to become less competitive, with an increase in the share of spending awarded without competition, or via single-bid solicitations. Increased concentration also induced a shift from the use of fixed-price contracts towards cost-plus contracts. However, we find no evidence that consolidation led to a significant increase in acquisition costs of large weapon systems, nor to increased spending at the product market level. We infer that the government’s buyer power, especially relevant in this context given the government is often the only purchaser, constrained firms from exercising any additional market power gained by consolidation.
H56|Defying the odds? Nigerien responses to foreign and domestic security challenges|The objective of this paper is to identify the manifold security threats confronting the Republic of Niger. It examines if and how various domestic and external actors may exploit Niger’s adverse structural conditions to their benefit and derives possible future scenarios and recommendations for policymakers. Foreign-based jihadist groups such as Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Boko Haram will continue to threaten Niger’s domestic stability. However, these groups are unlikely to make further inroads into Nigerien territory. The Tuareg community and conservative Sunni groups are unlikely to rise up against the state as both are well integrated into the political and societal landscape. The most viable threat to Niger’s stability is the continued inability of the current administration to translate macroeconomic gains and donor support into pro-poor growth and social inclusion. The increasing use of authoritarian measures against citizens and journalists has the potential to escalate further and to undermine the legitimacy of the government in the long-term.
H56|The unstable foundations of political stability in Chad|Chad has emerged as an important counter-terrorism partner in the Lake Chad Basin and the broader Sahel-Sahara region due to its recent political stability and military contribution to security efforts in these troubled zones. However, a closer look at developments in domestic politics, notably the continued and increasingly severe repression of the political opposition and civil society, suggests that this stability may not be built on solid foundations. This paper considers the role Chad has played in the fight against Boko Haram and other forms of regional violent extremism in an effort to take stock of the current threats the Chadian government faces from external actors. It then investigates growing domestic grievances due to an ongoing fiscal crisis, attacks on civil liberties, and a disrupted electoral calendar which risk escalating and destabilising the current government. The paper argues that the mitigation of these diverse and multi-dimensional security threats, particularly at the domestic level, would benefit from an environment that is more supportive of democratic institutions and the rule of law, thus enhancing the country’s prospects for stability in the short- and long-term.
H56|Defense spending and fiscal multipliers: it's all in the variance|"We provide estimates of U.S. government expenditure multipliers for defense and non-defense spending over 1939-2014, using a fairly standard DSGE model that includes anticipated military spending changes (""war news shocks""), and find the following. First, our model's war news shocks compare favorably to Ramey's (2011) narrative-based ""defense news"" shocks. Second, war news shocks have little effect on model variables regardless of the period under examination. Unanticipated military expenditure accounts for substantial movements in output, but only when observations from 1939 to 1954 are considered. Apart from that, movements in output are entirely driven by total factor productivity shocks. Third, our structural model can generate defense expenditure multipliers above unity under two conditions: (i) the multiplier is calculated using the peak of the impulse-response function and (ii) a large number of observations before and up to the Korean War are included. When multipliers are calculated according to Mountford and Uhlig's (2009) present-value definition, they never exceed unity, regardless of the sample under analysis."
H56|Military Expenditures and Income Inequality Evidence from a Panel of Transition Countries (1990-2015)|This paper contributes to the literature on military spending by analyzing the relationship between military spending and income inequality in a panel of transition economies over the period 1990-2015. In particular, we exploit three different measures of military expenditures: (i) the military spending in absolute terms; (ii) the military expenditures per capita; (iii) the military burden, namely the ratio between military expenditure and GDP. Findings highlight a positive relationship between military expenditures and income inequality captured by means of three different measures of inequality. Results are also confirmed after we performed a variety of robustness tests. However, other results are worth noting and contradictory. For example, military conscription appears to have a redistributional effect and when considering a non-linearity the results show that there could be a concave relationship between military spending and income inequality. In addition, when testing for the â€˜crowding-out argumentâ€™ results show that expenditures for subsidies are negatively influenced by military spending so confirming the crowding-out argument but there is no significant evidence when considering education and health expenditures.
H56|Der Wohlfahrtstaat als Grundbestandteil des modernen demokratischen Staatsgefüges<BR>[The welfare state as a basic component of the modern democratic state structure]|Defining the welfare state is not a simpleminded task. Actually, there are numerous definitions which try to reflect at least some of the basic characteristics of the welfare state or its objectives and its functions. For some, there is primarily an institutional parameter, for others there are functional issues which have to be firstly indicated and for others, the ideological and political factors determine the definition and the attitude towards the welfare state. Apart from all these crucial ascertainments, there are some basic fundamental characteristics and values of the welfare state which render it as a precondition of the existence of the modern state. Unquestionably, it reflects a distinct part of the state but most importantly, it comprises a prerequisite for its existence. This is the exact aim of this paper; to surpass the theoretical diversifications and to find the fundamental common ground which forms the indispensability for the existence of the welfare state.

H56|Statistik und Organisation der NS-Kriegswirtschaft und der DDR-Planwirtschaft 1933-1949/50<BR>[Statistics and Organization of the NS-War Economy and the East-German Planned Economy 1933-1949/50]|Abstract: NS-War Economy 1933-1945 and Abstract: The Emergence of the Planned Economy in East-Germany 1945-1949/50 The major part deals with economic statistics as an instrument for warfare and war preparation. Firstly, the involvement of German Statistical Office (Statistisches Reichsamt) is described and analyzed: as soon as in 1934, plans emerged in the Office to conduct periodical industrial censuses as a means of a statistical information system to meet the demands of a planned or commanded economy for warfare. The comprehensive industrial census of 1936 became the main source for this purpose. Secondly, the statistical information is put forward. It was increasingly provided by mandatory reporting of private industrial firms and their organizations, which became instrumental in steering the German economy. Officially and privately organized economic statistics finally merged: during the war, the Ministry of Economics set up a statistical information system based on the collaboration between the German Statistical Office and the German Institute for Economic Research (Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung). In 1943, the responsible department of the Ministry of Economics was incorporated into the Planning Office (Planungsamt) of Speer´s Ministry for Armament. Within this centre of economic command economic statistics became an essential tool for running the German economy during the last years of the war. In a separate chapter, plans of the Ministry of Economics during the last months of the war are highlighted which aimed at designing an institutional framework for centralizing and centrally steering German empirical economic research and economic statistics after the war. Finally, the use of the NS-statistics after the war is touched upon, thus forming a bridging chapter to East-Germany setting up its planned economy. A separate case study deals with a report of the Statistical Office asked for by the Ministry of Economics in 1936 to estimate the assets of German Jews. Immediately after the war, the commands of Soviet Military Administration for Germany (SMAD) endeavoured to re-establish and increase production in the Soviet Zone of Occupation (SBZ). For short term economic planning, they required regular statistical reports from business firms. Not before 1948, however, did the Central Statistical Office (StZA) founded in the fall of 1945 succeed in standardizing and centralizing the statistics reported by business firms. The federal structure of the SBZ with its strong position of the independent statistical offices of the individual states was to blame for the delay. It was finally overcome when the StZA became a major department of the newly created German Economic Commission (DWK), the centralized governmental body of the SBZ. Right from the beginning, the StZA drew on economic statistics of NS-Germany to obtain a basis for steering and planning the East German economy. Above all in 1947/48, the original files of the Industrial Census of 1936 were rearranged and evaluated for the Two-Years-Plan of 1949/50, the first elaborate planning scheme of the GDR. Until then the insufficient statistical reporting system of East Germany had not allowed such a planning.
H56|Conflict Heterogeneity in Africa|One of the Sustainable Development Goals is to significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere. The economic development literature widely concurs that conflicts have adverse economic consequences that contribute to poverty, disinvestment, and lower human capital leading to widespread inequality and lower economic growth. As such, understanding the nature of conflict has been an important focus for political leaders, policymakers and researchers alike. However, the existing literature does not typically distinguish between the types of conflict, and empirical evidence relies on the assumption that effects are similar across the world. Using panel data analysis and a comprehensive disaggregated georeferenced conflict dataset from 1997 to 2016, we find significant evidence of heterogeneity in the predictors' effects on different types of conflicts in Africa.
H56|Transportation Mode Choice and International Fragmentation of Production: Evidence from a Developing Country|Developments in transportation technologies have facilitated and encouraged the international fragmentation of production by reducing transportation costs and ensuring that parts and components are delivered safely and timely within global production networks. The fact that the stages of the fragmented production processes have been placed in different distance and geographical locations created a demand for alternative modes of transportation. The objective of this study is to analyze the effects of fragmentation of production measured by parts and components trade on the choice of transportation mode including air, sea and road. By doing that, the paper attempts to account for the advantages/disadvantages of alternative transportation modes in short-medium-long distance trade. Using a detailed data set (HS-12 digit product level statistics for the 2000-2014 period and 188 countries) of Turkey’s machinery exports, we show that fragmentation of production plays a significant role in the selection of transportation mode. In particular, road transportation with good infrastructure is a significant trade facilitating mode of transportation to nearby trade partners, when trade involves P&C and light products.
H56|Decentralized Terrorism and Social Identity|This paper oï¬€ers a theory of decentralized, non-state-sponsored terrorism that is characteristic of contemporary reality, and that explains the rise of homegrown terrorism. We argue that the sense of social identity is a prime motivator of non-strategic terrorist activities, and we investigate its consequences and implications for defence against terrorism. Terrorist responses to perceived aï¬€ronts to identity increase with altruism towards in-groups and with endogenous intensity of hate towards out-groups. We show that, while out-group spite is the more essential feature of identity pertinent to decentralized terrorism, the intensity of terrorist actions is magniï¬ ed by in-group altruism because it plays an important role in overcoming the potential free-riding of terrorists. This makes individual terrorist activities possible without coordination. We use our formulation to provide an alternative explanation for why counterterrorism measures often fail, and frequently can have a backlash eï¬€ect of increasing terrorism. Our results point to the need for western democracies to reformulate their foreign policies to take account of the role these policies play in instigating contemporary terrorism.

H56|Mapping Enforcement Agency Integrity: Evidence from the Royal Malaysian Police (RMP)|"""Objective – The purpose of this research is to map the level of ethics and integrity practices in the Royal Malaysian Police (RMP) using the Global Ethics and Integrity Benchmark. Methodology/Technique – A survey questionnaire method was adopted where it was distributed randomly to 100 police personnel. The respondents score ethics and integrity practices in the organization based on the five factors or categories namely Leadership, Organization Culture, Infrastructure, Legal Compliance, Policies & Rules and Individual. Findings – Results indicate that RMP officers practice integrity in discharging their duty and the organization establishes its own integrity module. They are also willing to admit their mistake and perceive the organization promote integrity practices at the workplace. The officers are also transparent in declaring their assets. Construct E11 to E14 which mean scores ranging from 1.46 to 1.81 indicates that RMP officers agreed that life pressure cause them to compromise integrity practices. Novelty – This study contributes RMP to improve and to move forward to become integrity champion among enforcement agency in Malaysia."""
H56|The Economics of Empire-Building: Predatory and Price Competitions|"We build a theoretical framework consistent with historical evidence in which empire-building is explained by price and predatory competitions on the market for protection. We explore how the assets structure possessed by the buyers of protection influences the nature of protection and in fine the size of empires. Our main contribution is to introduce a distinction between two types of rent, namely an ""absolute"" and a ""differential"" one. The first corresponds to rents extracted by empires using threats and coercion; the second, to economic advantages conferred on subjects of an empire."
H56|The Economic Origins of Conflict in Africa|We study the impact of plausibly exogenous global food price shocks on local violence across the African continent. In food-producing areas, higher food prices reduce conflict over the control of territory (what we call “factor conflict”) and increase conflict over the appropriation of surplus (“output conflict”). We argue that this difference arises because higher prices raise the opportunity cost of soldiering for producers, while simultaneously inducing net consumers to appropriate increasingly valuable surplus as their real wages fall. In regions without crop agriculture, higher food prices increase both factor conflict and output conflict. We validate local-level findings on output conflict using geocoded survey data on interpersonal theft and violence against commercial farmers and traders. Ignoring the distinction between producer and consumer effects leads to attenuated estimates. Our findings help reconcile a growing but ambiguous literature on the economic roots of conflict.
H56|We Don’t Need No Education: Reconstruction and Conflict across Afghanistan|Field interviews conducted by the author in Afghanistan suggest current theories linking conﬂict to development do not adequately account for ideological drivers of resistance. We present a model demonstrating how reconstruction/development led by a foreign occupier can exacerbate violence through popular discontent, if projects are ideologically controversial. We test the model using detailed data on military-led reconstruction and public opinion from NATO, and a US-Government violence log covering Afghanistan from 2005 until 2009. We ﬁnd projects in the health sector successfully alleviate violence, whereas those in the education sector actually provoke conﬂict. The destabilizing effects of education projects are strongest in conservative areas, where public opinion polls suggest education projects breed antipathy towards international forces. Further underscoring the role of local perceptions, project-driven violence appears to be homegrown, rather than sourced externally. Our ﬁndings do not support competing theories; are not driven by reverse causation; and are robust when considering many sources of endogeneity.
H56|Geopolitics and Asia’s little divergence: State building in China and Japan after 1850|We provide a new framework to account for the diverging paths of political development in China and Japan during the late nineteenth century. The arrival of Western powers not only brought opportunities to adopt new technologies, but also fundamentally threatened the sovereignty of both countries. These threats and opportunities produce an unambiguous impetus toward centralization and modernization for small states, but place conflicting demands on larger states. We use our theory to study why China, which had been centralized for much of its history, experienced gradual disintegration upon the Western arrival, and how Japan rapidly unified and modernized.
H56|Brothers in Arms: Spillovers from a Draft Lottery|Family members tend to have similar labor market outcomes, but measuring the contribution of behavioral spillovers is difficult. To identify spillovers between brothers, we exploit Denmark's largest random assignment – of young men to 8 months of military service – where service status of brothers is correlated but draft lottery numbers are not. We find average spillovers of elder brother service on younger brother service of 7 percent, and as high as 55 percent for closely spaced brothers without sisters. Elder brother military service affects his own occupational choice and his younger brother's service through private information, thereby encouraging volunteering.
H56|An Injury to One Is an Injury to All: Terrorism's Spillover Effects on Bilateral Trade|In this paper we investigate whether the effects of terrorism in one country spillover to affect trade in neighboring nations. Using a sample of more than 160 countries from 1976 to 2014, we report robust evidence that terrorist attacks in a nation's contiguous neighbors significantly reduce bilateral trade. Each additional terrorist attack in a neighboring country reduces bilateral trade by nearly 0.013% on average, which translates into a reduction of about $6.4 million USD in total trade. Trade effects from terrorist incidents are higher in sub-Sahara. Adverse trade effects hold for different flow and stock measures of terrorism, and even for terrorist incidents with zero casualties. Spillovers from terrorism are relatively long-lived, depressing bilateral trade up to five years after a terrorist event. Our findings are consistent with terrorism adversely impacting bilateral trade through several channels: psychological distress, higher trade costs arising from increased trade insecurity and regulatory burden, and adverse effects on income and trade reform.
H56|Provoking insurgency in a federal state: theory and application to India|Abstract This paper presents a model of provocation in a federation, wherein the state government triggers an insurgency with a view toward acquiring control of some economic assets with the help of the central government. Some econometric support for this model is found using data on the Naxalite conflict in eight states of India. The tests performed control for endogeneity of the state government’s police force interventions. They suggest that the latter are meant to trigger the violent activity of the insurgents, so as to lure the central government into intervening and helping clear the ground for mining purposes in the lands of tribal people.
H56|The Economic Origins of Conflict in Africa|We study the impact of plausibly exogenous global food price shocks on local violence across the African continent. In food-producing areas, higher food prices reduce conflict over the control of territory (what we call “factor conflict”) and increase conflict over the appropriation of surplus (“output conflict”). We argue that this difference arises because higher prices raise the opportunity cost of soldiering for producers, while simultaneously inducing net consumers to appropriate increasingly valuable surplus as their real wages fall. In regions without crop agriculture, higher food prices increase both factor conflict and output conflict, as poor consumers turn to soldiering and appropriation in order to maintain a minimum consumption target. We validate local-level findings on output conflict using geocoded survey data on interpersonal theft and violence against commercial farmers and traders. Ignoring the distinction between producer and consumer effects leads to attenuated estimates. Our findings help reconcile a growing but ambiguous literature on the economic roots of conflict.
H56|The Political Economy of Heterogeneity and Conflict|In this paper we present a conceptual framework linking cultural heterogeneity to inter-group conflict. When conflict is about control of public goods, more heterogeneous groups are expected to fight more with each other. In contrast, when conflict is about rival goods, more similar groups are more likely to engage in war with each other. We formalize these ideas within an analytical model and discuss recent empirical studies that are consistent with the model's implications.
H56|The Effect of Stress on Later-Life Health: Evidence from the Vietnam Draft|A substantial literature has examined the impact of stress during early childhood on later-life health. This paper contributes to that literature by examining the later-life health impact of stress during adolescence and early adulthood, using a novel proxy for stress: risk of military induction during the Vietnam War. We estimate that a 10 percentage point (2 standard deviation) increase in induction risk in young adulthood is associated with a 1.5 percentage point (8%) increase in the probability of being obese and a 1 percentage point (10%) increase in the probability of being in fair or poor health later in life. This does not appear to be due to cohort effects; these associations exist only for men who did not serve in the war, and are not present for women or men who did serve. These findings add to the evidence on the lasting consequences of stress, and also indicate that induction risk during Vietnam may, in certain contexts, be an invalid instrument for education or marriage because it appears to have a direct impact on health.
H56|Queens|Are states led by women less prone to conflict than states led by men? We answer this question by examining the effect of female rule on war among European polities over the 15th-20th centuries. We utilize gender of the first born and presence of a female sibling among previous monarchs as instruments for queenly rule. We find that polities led by queens were more likely to engage in war than polities led by kings. Moreover, the tendency of queens to engage as aggressors varied by marital status. Among unmarried monarchs, queens were more likely to be attacked than kings. Among married monarchs, queens were more likely to participate as attackers than kings, and, more likely to fight alongside allies. These results are consistent with an account in which marriages strengthened queenly reigns because married queens were more likely to secure alliances and enlist their spouses to help them rule. Married kings, in contrast, were less inclined to utilize a similar division of labor. These asymmetries, which reflected prevailing gender norms, ultimately enabled queens to pursue more aggressive war policies.
H56|Averting Catastrophes that Kill|"We face a variety of potential catastrophes; nuclear or bioterrorism, a climate catastrophe, and a ""mega-virus"" are examples. Martin and Pindyck (AER 2015) showed that decisions to avert such catastrophes are interdependent, so that simple cost-benefit analysis breaks down. They assumed that catastrophic events cause ""destruction,"" i.e., a reduction in the stream of consumption. But some catastrophes cause death instead of, or in addition to, destruction. Here we incorporate death in a model of catastrophe avoidance, and show how it affects the interdependence of catastrophic events and the ""willingness to pay"" to avoid those events."
H56|The arsenal of democracy: Production and politics during WWII|We study the geographic distribution of military supply contracts during World War II. This is a unique case, where $3 trillion current day dollars was spent. We find robust evidence consistent with the hypothesis that economic factors dominated the allocation of supply contracts, and that political factors—or at least winning the 1944 presidential election—were at best of secondary importance. General industrial capacity in 1939, as well as specialized industrial capacity for aircraft production, are strong predictors of contract spending across states. Electoral college pivot probabilities are weak predictors of contract (and new facilities) spending, and under the most plausible assumptions they are essentially unrelated to spending. This is true over the entire period 1940–1944, and also for shorter periods leading up to the election in November 1944. That is, we find no evidence of an electoral cycle in the distribution of funds.
H56|Wars and Conflicts in the Sahara-Sahel|The Sahel and the Sahara are faced with exceptional political instability involving a combination of rebellions, jihadist insurgencies, coups d’état, protest movements and illegal trafficking. The backdrop to this accumulated violence is a globalised security environment, which blurs the traditional lines between what is local and global, military and civilian, domestic and international, politics and identity. The purpose of this paper is to analyse these patterns of violence. The first section presents the geographic distribution and development over time of the main sources of violence in North and West Africa before examining the events behind the increase in political violence in the Sahel and the Sahara. The second section analyses the patterns of violence, and focuses on the geographic scales thereof and the strategies of the warring parties. In its conclusion, the paper highlights the need to strengthen regional co-operation, restore the legitimacy of governments, and establish inclusive governance solutions in conflict zones.
H56|The Wave of Jihadist Insurgency in West Africa: Global Ideology, Local Context, Individual Motivations|The recent rise of jihadist movements in West Africa, including Boko Haram in the Lake Chad region and Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and its affiliates in the Sahel-Saharan region, has puzzled many observers. The easy spread of the jihadist ideology, the jihadist movements’ success in massively recruiting followers among local populations as well as their ability to conquer and administer territories, are unprecedented in the region’s contemporary history. This paper sheds light on the factors and processes that contribute to the emergence of these movements. It argues that the phenomenon of jihadist insurgencies in West Africa emerges as a result of a series of processes at the global, local, and individual level. At the global level, there is the formation and dissemination of the global ideology of jihadism, conceptualised by Muslim activists and scholars based on a particular understanding of Islam and the challenges that are facing contemporary Muslim societies. At the local level, the appropriation of jihadist ideologies by “Muslim activists” who then use it to formulate a discourse which taps into local social and political demands in order to mobilise followers, is key. For a wide range of reasons, certain regions of Africa have experienced weakened state capacity and increased local conflict, and it is in these areas that jihadist insurgencies have emerged. At the individual level, the process by which African individuals decide to enrol in jihadist groups include ideological, situational, and strategic motivations, and these have all been facilitated by deteriorating conditions of life in marginalised areas.
H56|Agricultural market activity and Boko Haram attacks in northeastern Nigeria|This paper examines the linkages between Boko Haram activities in northeastern Nigeria and declined activities in regional agricultural markets. Building on data from both the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) and the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), the paper first considers the geographic distribution of Boko Haram events with respect to market towns and discusses whether there is evidence of Boko Haram activities near markets having influence on declined market operations. Next, it examines the temporal character of market operations and the timing of their changes in their operational status, including market closures, with respect to the seasonality of agricultural production and land use in northeastern Nigeria. The paper measures the frequency of changes in regional market activities and considers spatial relationships and temporal correlations with Boko Haram activities in the region over twelve periods from late 2014 through the end of 2016. Finally, the paper formulates policy recommendations for assessing and mitigating coupled challenges of human and environmental security.
H56|Guerres et conflits au Sahara-Sahel|Le Sahel et le Sahara sont confrontés à une instabilité politique exceptionnelle mêlant rébellions, insurrections jihadistes, coups d’État, mouvements contestataires et trafics illicites. Cette combinaison de violences s’exprime aujourd’hui dans un environnement sécuritaire mondialisé, qui brouille les distinctions habituelles entre le local et le global, le militaire et le civil, la sphère domestique et la sphère internationale, la politique et l’identité. L’objectif de cette note est d’analyser ces dynamiques de violence. La première section décrit la distribution géographique et l’évolution temporelle des principaux foyers de violence d’Afrique du Nord et de l’Ouest. Elle discute ensuite les événements à l’origine de l’intensification de la violence politique au Sahel et au Sahara.La seconde section analyse ces dynamiques de violence, en s’attardant sur les échelles géographiques et les stratégies des belligérants. La note souligne en conclusion la nécessité de renforcer la coopération régionale, restaurer la légitimité des États et établir des solutions de gouvernance inclusives dans les zones de conflit.
H56|Insurrections jihadistes en Afrique de l’Ouest : Idéologie mondiale, contexte local, motivations individuelles|La récente montée en puissance de mouvements jihadistes en Afrique de l’Ouest, comme Boko Haram dans la région du lac Tchad et Al-Qaïda au Maghreb islamique et ses affiliés dans la région sahélo-saharienne, a surpris les observateurs. La propagation de l’idéologie jihadiste, la facilité de recrutement au sein des populations locales, de même que la capacité à conquérir et administrer des territoires sont des phénomènes sans précédent. La note éclaire sur les facteurs et processus qui contribuent à l’émergence de ces mouvements. Ce travail avance que les insurrections jihadistes en Afrique de l’Ouest découlent de processus à l’oeuvre aux niveaux mondial, local et individuel. Au niveau mondial, une idéologie internationale du jihadisme s’est formée et propagée, conceptualiséepar des activistes musulmans et des théologiens tenant d’une interprétation particulière de l’islam. Au niveau local, l’appropriation de l’idéologie jihadiste par des « islamistes » et son utilisation au service d’un discours qui instrumentalise des revendications sociales et politiques sont un facteur clé. L’affaiblissement des capacités de l’État et les conflits locaux créent des conditions propices à l’émergence de mouvements d’insurrection jihadistes. Au niveau individuel, le processus par lequel des Africains décident de rejoindre des groupes jihadistes relève de motivations idéologiques, stratégiques ou conjoncturelles, favorisées par la détérioration des conditions de vie dans des régions en marge.
H56|Benefit and Cost of Visa relaxation -Empirical Analysis on the Impact of Visa waiver-|In spite of a heated debate over immigration policies in the world, the effects of visa, which is one of the representative tool for immigration control, are uncertain for some aspects. This paper analyzes whether visa relaxation has impacts on both legal foreign visitors and illegally overstayed foreigners focusing on Japanese visa waiver program. The empirical analyses show that visa waiver will increase both legal travelers and illegally overstayed foreigners while it may have a bigger effect on legal visitors than overstayed foreigners.
H56|Military expenditures and shadow economy in the Baltic States: Is there a link?|The main goal of our paper is to determine the existence of a link between government (military) expenditures and the shadow economy in the Baltic States. The empirical investigation is done over the years 2003-2014 for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. We showed that there is a highly statistically significant positive dependence between the size of the shadow economy and military expenditures in the Baltic States. Our conclusion is that higher military expenditures indeed lead to a higher shadow economy and this result is robust to different model specifications. In order to demonstrate the importance of our highly statistically significant results we undertook a simulation where we calculated how much the size of the shadow economy would increase if the size of military expenditure as a percentage of GDP doubled: In Estonia such an expansion would have led to an increase in the size of the shadow economy from 27.1% to 30.1%, in Latvia from 24.7% to 26.1% and in Lithuania from 27.1% to 28.4% in 2014.
H56|War and Conflict in Economics: Theories, Applications, and Recent Trends|We review the main economic models of war and conflict. These models vary in details, but their implications are qualitatively consistent, highlighting key commonalities across a variety of conflict settings. Recent empirical literature, employing both laboratory and field data, in many cases confirms the basic implications of conflict theory. However, this literature also presents important challenges to the way economists traditionally model conflict. We finish our review by suggesting ways to address these challenges.
H56|Demand for Military Spending: The case of the MENA Region|Arab Spring and the domestic unrest and the threat of terrorism that followed are not the main causes of the recent spike in military spending in the region, as the bulk of arms purchases have largely been conventional heavy weaponry, such as combat aircraft, armored vehicles, and missile systems. The results indicate that military spending in the MENA region does exhibit high income elasticity and status is further signaled through regional clubs such as the Arab League. MENA countries face substantial opportunity cost of military spending and only weakly respond to local threats. The so-called ‘resource curse’ is not a strong indicator of military posture in MENA especially within the neoclassical demand model setting and robust estimation that account for dynamics and endogeneity.
H56|Geopolitical risks and the oil-stock nexus over 1899–2016|Markets are invariably influenced and affected not only by the usual array of economic and financial factors, but also by uncertainty inducing shocks. Using monthly stock and oil data that spans over a century, this study takes a long historical perspective on whether the time-varying stock–oil covariance, their returns and their variances are affected by geopolitical risk, as encapsulated and quantified by a recently developed index (Caldara and Iacoviello, 2016). The results reveal that geopolitical risk triggers a negative effect, mainly on oil returns and volatility, and to a smaller degree on the covariance between the two markets.

H56|Defence expenditure and economic growth in Latin American countries: evidence from linear and nonlinear causality tests|Abstract Using SIPRI’s new consistent database on military expenditures, the paper examines the economic effects of such spending in the case of the 13 Latin American countries. Employing both linear and nonlinear tests, the nexus between defence spending, economic growth, and investment is investigated for the period 1961–2014. Findings reported herein are not uniformed across all countries included in the sample. However, as a broad tentative generalization, they seem to be pointing to the absence of a strong and robust nexus between the variables examined.
H56|Dynamics of Military Expenditure and Income Inequality in Pakistan|Abstract This study investigates the impact of military expenditures on income inequality in Pakistan using data over the period of 1972–2012. For this purpose, we applied the ARDL bounds testing cointegration approach which confirmed the presence of long-run equilibrium relationship between military expenditure and income inequality. Furthermore, empirical analysis indicates that military spending has a positive impact on income inequality. The analysis of Granger causality, Toda–Yamamoto Modified Wald test and variance decomposition approaches confirm the presence of unidirectional causality running from military expenditure to income inequality. The findings of our study suggest that higher military expenditure leads to higher income inequality in Pakistan. Therefore, we advise the policy makers to focus more on the policies which can increase the economic activities in the country and eventually reduce income inequality.
H56|The Rise and Fall of Armies|For a thousand years, income growth was associated with a rising military employment share. But this share peaked in the early 20th century, after which military employment shares fell with income growth. I argue that rising military shares were driven by structural change out of agriculture, and the recent declines are driven by substitution from soldiers towards military goods. I document evidence for this substitution effect: as countries' incomes rise, the ratio of their military expenditure share to their military employment share rises too. I introduce a game theoretic model of growth and warfare that reproduces the time series patterns of military expenditure and employment. The model also correctly predicts the cross-sectional pattern, that military employment and expenditure shares are decreasing in income during wars. Finally, I show that faster economic growth can reduce military expenditure in the long run.
H56|I hope I die before I get old: The supply side of the market for suicide bombers|"We explore the supply side of the market for suicide bombers. While the strategic edge of suicide attacks for certain terrorist organizations has been thoroughly explored, the motivation of the suppliers remains quite mysterious. Following a review of existing theoretical approaches and empirical findings we develop a model of the supply of suicide bombing, the motivation of which is expressive but time inconsistent. The model implies terrorist organizations to provide a commitment device in exchange for the ""services'' of those suicide bombers' that do not suffer from any mental or physical burden of life. By contrast, suicide attackers that do suffer from some sufficiently severe burden of life are not reliant on any commitment device and should therefore be expected to more frequently act as lonesome-wolf attackers."
H56|Migration and social mobility within and between countries and its economic consequences in the period of globalization|Ethnic and international conflicts have turned into a real headache for the modern world. The confrontations that have begun between the nations have escalated into serious conflicts that take the lives of thousands of innocent children, women and old people every year. Such conflicts create significant problems not only at the social level, but also at the political and economic level. If a decisive measure to resolve such conflicts has not been taken in a timely manner, the damage may prove irreparable. Our Institute of Global Economic Problems, represented by Natig Shirinzade, Ph.D. and Masters in Economics, Founder and Head of the Institute of Global Economic Problems decided to address this issue in greater detail and highlight the problem of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Being citizens of the Republic of Azerbaijan, we are well acquainted with all the problems caused by interethnic conflicts and the subsequent flow of refugees and temporarily resettled. And therefore, we consider it our duty to cover such topics and bring them to the public court. This is one of the reasons for creating this organization - to provide people with reliable and verified information in order to help them overcome the difficulties of the Epoch of Globalization.
H56|The impact of oil rents on military spending: Does corruption matter?|This study shows that the level of corruption matters in how oil rents affect the military spending within countries. Using panel data covering the 1984–2014 period for the Middle East and North Africa countries, we find that the effect of oil rents on military budget depends on the extent of political corruption. Oil wealth boosts military spending when corruption (measured by the re-scaled ICRG index) exceeds a critical score of 5 (out of 6) in the MENA region.
H56|Defense Spending and Unemployment. Evidence from Southern European Countries|This paper applies the ARDL approach to cointegration in order to address the defense unemployment nexus. We use information on Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain for the period 1960–2015. Our main results suggest that: (i) there is a stable long-run relationship between the variables under consideration for Portugal, Greece and Spain. (ii) Defense spending decreases (increases) unemployment for the case of Portugal and Greece (Spain), (iii) the impact of non-defense spending is weaker than that of defense spending and (iv) Okun’s law is validated for Portugal, Greece and Spain. (v) These results are robust to the use of heterogeneous panel cointegration and causality analysis.
H56|Energy and the Military: Convergence of Security, Economic, and Environmental Decision-Making|Energy considerations are core to mission delivery of armed forces worldwide. The interaction between military energy issues and non-military energy issues is not often explicitly treated in the literature or media, although in the last decade there has been some increase driven especially by the issues of clean energy. It is recognized that the military has for more than a hundred years taken a leadership role in terms on research and development (R&D) of specific energy technologies - most commonly where they are applicable in theater. More recently that R&D leadership has moved to the energy efficiency of home-country bases, and the development of renewable energy projects for areas as diverse as mini-grids for in-country installations, to alternative fuels for submarines and jets. Nevertheless, the military in most major countries tends to see energy issues as a matter of mission delivery or conversely the denial of enemy energy supply chains as a source of advantage. In this paper we explore the evolving relationship between energy issues and defense planning, and show how these developments have implications for military tactics and strategy and for civil energy policy.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H56|Costs of Building a 355-Ship Navy|CBO estimates that construction costs to build a fleet of 355 ships would average $26.6 billion (in 2017 dollars) per year over the next 30 years, which is 60 percent more than what the Navy has spent on average over the past 30 years. In addition, operating costs for a larger fleet would increase substantially compared with those of todayâ€™s Navy.
H56|Approaches to Changing Military Health Care|The Department of Defense (DoD) spends about $50 billion annually to provide health care to more than 9 million beneficiaries through a program known as TRICARE. CBO examined several illustrative approaches that might reduce DoDâ€™s rising health care costs, improve the quality of care provided at its facilities, or strengthen how well the departmentâ€™s medical establishment prepares for wartime missions. The report also describes the estimated budgetary effects of two specific options for making changes to TRICARE.
H56|Trends in the Department of Defenseâ€™s Support Costs|From the mid-1980s to the early 1990s, the Department of Defenseâ€™s (DoDâ€™s) funding for support functions rose substantially relative to funding for forces. Four types of support functions experienced the largest increases: health care, DoD-wide management, communications and information infrastructure, and DoDâ€™s science and technology program. Increased spending in some of these areas may have improved efficiency (by helping meet military needs, boosting productivity, or reducing costs in other areas) but some increases may not have done so.
H56|Approaches for Managing the Costs of U.S. Nuclear Forces, 2017 to 2046|The Obama Administrationâ€™s 2017 plans for nuclear forces would cost about $1.2 trillion (in 2017 dollars) over the 2017â€“2046 period, CBO estimates. About $400 billion of that total would pay for modernization, according to CBOâ€™s assessment of the most recent detailed plans for the Departments of Defense and Energy. CBO analyzed nine options that would reduce the 30-year costs of nuclear forces by between 2 percent and 11 percent if they were implemented for the next generation of systems (and more if they were implemented now).
H56|Analysis of the Long-Term Costs of the Administrationâ€™s Goals for the Military|CBO estimates that the inflation-adjusted costs for the Department of Defense would climb steadily from the $575 billion requested for the base budget in 2018 to $688 billion in 2027 if DoD pursues goals that Administration officials have articulated for improving readiness, modernizing equipment, and increasing the number of military personnel. Total costs for 2018 through 2027 would be nearly $700 billion more than CBOâ€™s projection of the Obama Administrationâ€™s final Future Years Defense Program.
H56|Cyber Technology and Arms Race|Cyber technology represents digital military capability with the purpose of causing damage to the military strength and the social infrastructure of a potential enemy. War using conventional weapons may be preceded by or combined with a war using cyber technology. This paper introduces such technology into the theory of conflicts, suggesting the striking proposal that the expected return on cyber investment is convex. It is shown that an asymmetric successful cyber program results in an option for a pre-emptive cyber attack. These features of the model make the cyber technology a first-ranked military investment. The optimal scale of a cyber program of a country expected to have access to a superior cyber capability is derived. It is shown that the asymmetric cyber capability reduces the international arms race but nevertheless raises the likelihood of a war reducing the deterrence.
H56|Offset Contracts as an Insurance Device in Building the National Security| A dynamic multi-stage decision-theoretic approach is introduced to establish the optimal offset and its incidence, the contract price arising from bargaining, and the scale of the acquisition. A new rationale is suggested for offsets in terms of their role as an insurance devise. Results are derived for the pricing of delivery contracts subject to offset claims and their national security implications. It is shown that the national security is strictly convex in the offset transaction. As to the incidence of the offset, the offset claim is shown to be capitalised in the delivery price. The bargaining price is shown to depend on the value of the product to be delivered for the national security, the relative negotiation power of the contracting partners and the social cost of public funds. The analysis highlights the expectation effects of offsets on the bargaining price and the scale of delivery. The results aid in explaining why offsets are widely used in procurement contracts for defence materiel. As they contribute to the national security, they should be allowed to survive and not be denied under competition laws.
H56|El Gasto Fiscal de la Guerra contra los Portadores y Traficantes de Drogas Ilícitas: Una Aproximación para Colombia|Colombia concentra grandes esfuerzos fiscales a la persecución del delito de porte, fabricación y tráfico de estupefacientes. Estos costos no son siempre visibles, en tanto corresponden al costo de oportunidad de una gran cantidad de funcionarios que intervienen en el ciclo criminal. En este artículo estimamos el costo esperado por una captura motivada por este delito, y a partir de ello calculamos los costos anuales del esfuerzo fiscal. Discutimos si este gasto se justifica por la persecución al tráfico internacional de drogas ilícitas, al crimen asociado al micro-tráfico y mercados locales, o a un esfuerzo para disuadir consumidores. Concluimos que ninguna de estas motivaciones justifica este esfuerzo fiscal, y que más bien parece relacionarse con incompatibilidad de incentivos en la policía.
H56|Financial inclusion of the poor and money laundering indicators: empirical evidence for Colombia|Taking advantage of the largest financial inclusion program in Colombia, we estimate how increasing the access to such services for the poor impacts money laundering indicators in the country. We find that eventhough, on average, government’s indicators of money laundering activities in Colombia decreased, complex and heterogeneous impacts across the country and in time are observed. While money laundering indicators decreased in areas with high historic values of this crime, indicators in areas with medium historic levels increased. The evidence suggests that after the bancarization process a fragmentation and expansion of money laundering indicators across municipalities in Colombia took place, diminishing the accuracy of the alerts that the financial institutions provide to the government in order to fight this crime.
H56|Violencia, Procesos de Paz e Inversión Industrial en Colombia|El acuerdo de paz entre el gobierno de Colombia y el grupo guerrillero de las FARC alcanzado en noviembre de 2016 ha despertado interés académico desde diferentes áreas del conocimiento. Desde la economía, en particular, surgen preguntas acerca de los posibles efectos del acuerdo de paz sobre la productividad, la asignación de factores y el crecimiento económico. Con el objeto de contribuir a la identificación de los efectos económicos de los procesos de paz y de la violencia, en este documento se investiga el efecto de los procesos del Caguán (1999-2002), Santa Fe de Ralito (2003-2006) y de los actos violentos sobre la inversión privada en Colombia. Con este propósito, se analiza la inversión anual bruta en activos fijos de las firmas manufactureras de todo el país en un periodo de tiempo caracterizado por el recrudecimiento del conflicto armado, por un posterior descenso en los niveles de violencia y por dos negociaciones de paz. Los resultados sugieren que: (i) la presencia de las FARC tiene un efecto negativo en la inversión manufacturera, (ii) la presencia de las AUC genera un aumento de la inversión, (iii) las tácticas ofensivas de las FARC generan caídas significativas en la inversión de la industria, (iv) ataques a la propiedad privada llevadas a cabo por las AUC producen reducciones en la inversión y v) ninguno de los dos procesos de paz generó un efecto significativo en la toma de decisiones de inversión.
H56|Coca, cocaína y narcotráfico|El aumento en el área cultivada con coca en Colombia ha generado dudas con respecto a la estrategia antinarcóticos del país, y ha estimulado el escepticismo con respecto a las posibilidades de lograr una paz completa y definitiva. Asimismo, la percepción de fracaso ha dado pie a propuestas de política basadas en la idea de que los cultivos ilícitos son un problema de criminalidad y no de desarrollo. En este documento, se hace una revisión completa de la evidencia disponible con el fin de ordenar la información asociada a este debate y arrojar luces acerca de la conveniencia o inconveniencia de algunas medidas de política. En particular, hay seis hechos de alta relevancia: (i) Para educir la oferta de cocaína son más eficientes los esfuerzos en incautaciones y destrucción de infraestructura que los esfuerzos en erradicación. (ii) Asimismo, las incautaciones y la destrucción de infraestructura también ayudan a reducir los cultivos de coca. (iii) No hay evidencia que apoye la hipótesis de que el consumo nacional de cocaína ha aumentado. (iv) En la mayoría de las regiones del país han caído los cultivos de coca. No obstante, las regiones donde ha aumentado el área cultivada tienen presencia de uno o más grupos armados. (v) Los municipios cocaleros son, en promedio, más pobres que el resto de municipios del país. Estos municipios tienen ingresos tributarios bajos, bajos niveles de conectividad y bajos niveles de desarrollo institucional. (vi) El aumento del consumo de cocaína en Estados Unidos está concentrado en un grupo etario y en algunos estados. Este hecho hace difícil relacionar el aumento en consumo con un aumento exógeno en la oferta.
H56|An Uphill Battle: The Relationship Between Geography and Terrorism|Regarding the effect of geography on social violent behavior, this study introduces the idea that Geographic Fragmentation is associated with more terrorism, given its close relationship with the role of the government and socioeconomic conditions of people. We consider a panel of 128 countries between 1971 and 2005 using count data methodologies. This allows us to provide robust evidence for a consistent effect, even when different controls are included. Our baseline estimate indicates that one country with a 1% higher measure of Geographic Fragmentation is associated with an increment of 1.38 in the number of terrorist attacks on average.
H56|Guns and butter? Fighting violence with the promise of development|There is growing awareness that development-oriented government policies may be an important counterinsurgency strategy, but existing papers are usually unable to disentangle various mechanisms. Using a regression-discontinuity design, we analyze the impact of one of the world's largest anti-poverty programs, India's NREGS, on the intensity of Maoist conflict. We find short-run increases of insurgency-related violence, police-initiated attacks, and insurgent attacks on civilians. We discuss how these results relate to established theories in the literature. One mechanism consistent with the empirical patterns is that NREGS induces civilians to share more information with the state, improving police effectiveness.

H56|The European military helicopter industry: Trends and perspectives|This article discusses the European military helicopter market. It first recalls historical antecedents in the structural development of the main helicopter programs that helped to consolidate the industry and then reviews the industry’s current major trends. A paradoxical situation is identified: While European countries presently are able to cope with both, the growing needs in helicopter capabilities and the maintenance of ageing fleets, no large helicopter programs for the future have been launched. Some uncertainties regarding how future helicopter procurement will be organized are identified. The current situation underlines the challenges that European states will face to maintain both industrial skills in the industry and sovereignty in military helicopter capabilities. A number of industry options are discussed: more exports, more cooperation, more dual use, and more reliance on support and service sales.
H56|Global perspectives on the European arms industries|The authors of this article offer perspectives on the symposium on the European arms industries published in volume 12, number 1 of The Economics of Peace and Security Journal. The symposium contributions cover the history, current situation, and likely future prospects of the European naval, land armaments, military helicopter, aerospace, and outer space industries. The perspectives then comment on the articles as a group and do so from a global vantage point inasmuch as the commentators constitute a group of prominent researchers and policy analysts drawn from around the world.
H56|Against the odds: The evolution of the European naval shipbuilding industry|Despite a low volume of production at national levels, the European naval industry remains quite fragmented 25 years after the end of the cold war. Contrary to what might be expected from an industrial or budgetary perspective, neither cross-border consolidation nor cooperative programs have resulted in European restructuring. The sovereign nature of shipyards has led to the promotion of a domestically-centered industry transformation. Again, contrary to what might be expected, this appears to be a potentially sustainable approach due to the long-term relationship between navies and their domestic industrial partners. Even so, one can question the sustainability of the current economic model, reliant as it is on export contracts and insufficient margins to manoeuver.
H56|Terms-of-Trade and Counterterrorism Externalities|This paper investigates the interplay of trade and terrorism externalities under free trade between a developed nation that exports a manufactured good to and imports a primary product from a developing nation. A terrorist organization targets both nations and reduces its attacks in response to a nation’s defensive counterterrorism efforts, while transferring some of its attacks abroad. Terms-of-trade considerations lead the developed nation to raise its counterterrorism level beyond the “small-country” level, thus compounding its over provision of these measures. By contrast, the developing nation limits its defensive countermeasures below that of the small-country level. The analysis is extended to include proactive countermeasures to weaken the terrorist group. Again, the developed country raises its efforts owing to the terms-of-trade externality, which now opposes the under provision associated with proactive efforts. A second extension allows for several developing country exporters of the primary product.
H56|Defense economy and military reform in Russia in 2016|In 2016, the main provisions of the military reform started in 2008 and approved by the Executive Order of President Vladimir Putin[1] of May 2012 were successfully realized as a whole.
H56|Military and financial policy|In administrating the 2016 federal budget, a single adjustment was made in November. Under the Law on the 2016 Federal Budget, allocations on the “National Defense” section of the budget expenditures were initially set at RUB 3,149 trillion, or RUB 32bn (1%) less than actual expenditures a year before. In November, allocations on the National Defense grew to RUB 3,895 trillion (an increase of RUB 746bn or 23.5%)[1] due to the government’s decision to repay ahead of schedule a portion of commercial loans taken against state guarantees for financing the state defense order in 2011–2016. Compared to 2015, allocations on the National Defense grew by 22.4% in nominal terms .
H56|The Schneider company as a key actor of the industrial war in 1914-1918|At the heart of the economic war and as leverage to the military war, some companies asserted themselves as essential suppliers of the armies. They constituted poles of investment, innovation, and production, that complied to the ever growing orders of the state. Schneider reinforced therefore its equipments in Le Creusot, in Normandy and in Gironde, supported by the banks, in particular for its purchases in the United-States. It also the head of a cluster, of a group of companies cooperating for the main orders. As a hub-firm, it mobilised thus dozens of suppliers and sub-contractors. It earmarked it portfolios of skills to the arts of steel-working, metal-working, and mechanics (artillery, tanks, etc.). Throughout these developments it had to reinvent its management and follow new tracks for efficiency.
H56|Impact of Environmental Factors on Selection of Defence Services Officers|"""Objective – “Change is the only constant” is a cliché but it is important to identify the factors which are changing to emerge as challenges before the military leadership of tomorrow. The societies are bound to be affected by the changes taking place in the environment. Generally, every society is affected by the four types of environmental factors. These are political, social, economic and technological. Since in India, democracy is deep rooted and the philosophy of the defence forces is same and has neither changed nor is likely to change, this factor is not under study here. So, the purpose is to study the impact of other environmental factors on selection of Defence Services Officers. Methodology/Technique – The study has been carried out by personally visiting all the Service Selection Centres of the Indian Armed Forces and presenting a questionnaire to large number of junior, middle and senior level serving and retired officers at various places. Only 449 officers responded which included 190 junior officers, 133 middle-level officers and 126 senior officers. The response was put through SPSS software system and analysed. Findings – The analysis clearly revealed that environmental changes in the society over a period of time do impact the qualities in the youth which have direct bearing on their selection for officers in the armed forces. Since the selection is based on finding the officers like qualities available or trainable in the youth, the impact of environmental factors is directly affecting the intake of the youth resulting in deficiency of officers’ cadre in the armed forces. Novelty – The research contributes to develop scientific knowledge in environmental change effect on selection of defence officers."""
H56|Political Economy of Redistribution in the United States in the Aftermath of World War II--Evidence and Theory|We present legislative, historical and statistical evidence of a substantial upward ratchet in transfers and taxes in the US due to World War II. This finding is explained within a political-economy framework with defense spending responding to a war threat and a median voter in the population who interacts with a (richer) agenda setter in Congress in setting redistribution. While the setter managed to cap redistribution before the War, the War itself raised the status quo tax burden and improved tax collection technology, strengthening the bargaining power of the median voter as defense spending receded. This permanently raised the level of redistribution.
H56|Climate-induced International Migration and Conflicts|Population movements will help people cope with the impacts of climate change. However, large-scale displacements may also produce security risks for receiving areas. If climate change intensifies the process of out-migration, destination countries may face waves of migrants so large and fast that integration becomes increasingly hard. The objective of this article is to empirically estimate if the inflows of climate-induced migrants increase the risk of conflicts in receiving areas. Using data from 1960 to 2000, we show that climate-induced migrants are not an additional determinant of civil conflicts and civil wars in receiving areas.
H56|The Arab and Post-Communist Transitions: Similarities, Differences, and Common Lessons|At the onset of the mass protests in 2010–2011, many politicians and experts suggested that Arab countries could learn from the experiences of the post-communist transition of the early 1990s. However, the geopolitical, historical, and socio-economic context of the Arab transition was different in many respects from that of the former Soviet bloc countries 20 years earlier. These differences became even more obvious five years later, in early 2016, when most Arab transition attempts ended either in a new wave of authoritarianism, or protracted bloody conflicts. Nonetheless, there are some common lessons to be learnt from the history of both transitions. They concern interrelations between the political and economic transition, the role of institutional checks and balances and the rule of law, the speed of reforms, the dangers of ethnic and sectarian conflicts, and the role of external support.
H56|The nexus of economic growth, military expenditures, and income inequality|Abstract This paper examines the effect of military expenditures on economic growth by utilizing dynamic panel data analysis for 82 countries for the period of 1988–2008. Considering the possible effect of inequality on the military expenditures–economic growth nexus, this paper incorporates inequality along with its interaction with human capital into an augmented Solow growth model. The general finding is that military expenditures have a negative impact on economic growth, valid for several model specifications and sensitivity analyses. The negative impact holds when heterogeneity stemming from different country groups (e.g., development level, arms trade, fuel dependency) is considered. Also, the findings show that negative impact of military expenditure on growth for arms exporter and/or arms importer countries is weaker than those for other countries. Regarding income inequality and human capital, the findings suggest that human capital has a positive effect on growth, as expected. Income inequality on the other hand, has negative direct effect on economic growth. Considering these two variables together, the findings show that income inequality deteriorates growth for lower levels of human capital, whereas the impact of inequality on growth turns out to be positive for higher levels of human capital.
H56|Does Development Aid Increase Military Expenditure?|The diversion of development aid to the recipient’s military may be one explanation why aid is often found to be ineffective in promoting economic growth and development. Previous studies have not derived the causal effects of development aid on military expenditure. Using a new instrumental variable strategy, we examine whether bilateral development aid increases military expenditure in recipient countries. The instrument is the interaction of donor government fractionalization and the probability of receiving aid. The dataset includes new data on military expenditure for 124 recipient countries over the 1975-2012 period. While development aid has a positive effect on military expenditure in the full sample, the effect vanishes when we exclude outliers. However, we find that aid provided by coordinated market economies increases military expenditure in the full sample of recipient countries, even after controlling for outliers. Coordinated market economies have been found to deliver more government-to-government aid, which has a higher risk of capture compared to aid delivered through non-state development actors.
H56|Factor Models in Panels with Cross-sectional Dependence: An Application to the Extended SIPRI Military Expenditure Data| Strategic interactions between countries, such as arms races, alliances and wider economic and political shocks, can induce strong cross-sectional dependence in panel data models of military expenditure. If the assumption of cross-sectional independence fails, standard panel estimators such as fixed or random effects can lead to misleading inference. This paper shows how to improve estimation of dynamic, heterogenous, panel models of the demand for military expenditure allowing for cross-sectional dependence in errors using two approaches: Principal Components and Common Correlated Effect estimators. Our results show that it is crucial to allow for cross-sectional dependence, that the bulk of the effect is regional and there are large gains in fit by allowing for both dynamics and between country heterogeneity in models of the demand for military expenditures.
H56|The dynamic effects of public expenditure shocks in the United States|This paper estimates the dynamic aggregate effects of exogenous shocks to two key components of public expenditure in the United States, government income transfers and government spending. The identification strategy positions the structural shocks to public expenditure in an SVAR framework with exogenous measures of public expenditure changes. Transfers shocks are based on a new narrative variable of legislated increases in U.S. social security benefits. I demonstrate that shocks to different types of public expenditure do not have the same macroeconomic impact. The estimated government spending multiplier is between 0 and 1, while increases in transfers generate a multiplier effect above 1.
H56|The cycle of violence in the Second Intifada: Causality in nonlinear vector autoregressive models| We contest Jaeger and Paserman's claim (Jaeger and Paserman , 2008. The cycle of violence? An empirical analysis of fatalities in the Palestinian–Israeli conflict. American Economic Review 98 (4): 1591–1604) that Palestinians did not react to Israeli aggression during Intifada 2. We address the differences between the two sides in terms of the timing and intensity of violence, estimate nonlinear vector autoregression models that are suitable when the linear vector autoregression innovations are not normally distributed, identify causal effects rather than Granger causality using the principle of weak exogeneity, and introduce the “kill‐ratio” as a concept for testing hypotheses about the cycle of violence. The Israelis killed 1.28 Palestinians for every killed Israeli, whereas the Palestinians killed only 0.09 Israelis for every killed Palestinian.
H56|The Effect of Terrorist Incidents on Capital Flows|Current literature shows a significant negative impact of terrorism on countries economies. We explore this relationship in more detail. Using an unbalanced panel of over 160 countries for up to 25 years and the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) we show a decrease in FDI as a consequence of terrorism. We also find evidence that FDI flows are more sensitive to terrorism than either portfolio investments or external debt flows. Finally, we test the hypothesis that terrorism has negative spill-over effects on FDI flows into neighboring countries and find evidence that cultural but not geographical closeness matters.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H56|Sickness Absence and Local Benefit Cultures| In many countries, sickness absence financed by generous insurance benefits is an important concern in the policy debate. There are strong variations in absence behavior among local geographical areas. Such variations are difficult to explain in terms of observable socioeconomic factors. In this paper, we investigate whether such variations are related to group effects in the form of social interaction among individuals within neighborhoods. Well-known methodological problems arise when trying to answer this question. A special feature of our efforts to deal with these problems is that we adopt several alternative approaches to identify group effects. Our study is based on a rich set of Swedish panel data, and we find indications of group effects in each of our approaches.
H56|Reading Between the Lines: Prediction of Political Violence Using Newspaper Text|This article provides a new methodology to predict armed conflict by using newspaper text. Through machine learning, vast quantities of newspaper text are reduced to interpretable topics. We propose the use of the within-country variation of these topics to predict the timing of conflict. This allows us to avoid the tendency of predicting conflict only in countries where it occurred before. We show that the within-country variation of topics is an extremely robust predictor of conflict and becomes particularly useful when new conflict risks arise. Two aspects seem to be responsible for these features. Topics provide depth because they consist of changing, long lists of terms which makes them able to capture the changing context of conflict. At the same time topics provide width because they summarize all text, including coverage of stabilizing factors.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H56|Corruption and political stability: Does the youth bulge matter?|This study shows that the relative size of the youth bulge matters in how corruption affects the internal stability of a political system. Using panel data covering the 1984–2012 period for more than 100 countries, we find that the effect of corruption on political stability depends on the youth bulge. Corruption is a destabilizing factor for political systems when the share of the youth population in the adult population exceeds a critical level of approximately 20%. The moderating effect of the youth bulge in the stability–corruption nexus is robust, controlling for country and year fixed effects, a set of control variables that may affect internal political stability, an alternative operationalization of the youth bulge, corruption, and a dynamic panel estimation method.
H56|When to expect a coup d’état? An extreme bounds analysis of coup determinants|Abstract Over the last several decades, both economists and political scientists have shown interest in coups d’état. Numerous studies have been dedicated to understanding the causes of coups. However, model uncertainty still looms large. About one hundred potential determinants of coups have been proposed, but no consensus has emerged on an established baseline model for analyzing coups. We address this problem by testing the sensitivity of inferences to over three million model permutations in an extreme bounds analysis. Overall, we test the robustness of 66 factors proposed in the empirical literature based on a monthly sample of 164 countries that covers the years 1952–2011. We find that slow economic growth rates, previous coup experiences, and other forms of political violence to be particularly conducive to inciting coups.
H56|The impact of Syrian refugees on the labor market in neighboring countries: empirical evidence from Jordan| This paper analyzes time-sensitive data on a humanitarian crisis in the Middle East. It aims to assess the impact of the steep influx of Syrian refugees into Jordan on the country’s labor market since the onset of the conflict in Syria (March 2011). As of August 2014, nearly three million registered Syrians have sought refuge in neighboring countries (Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Turkey), according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Jordan and Lebanon are hosting the majority of them. This paper utilizes data regarding unemployment rates, employment rates, labor force participation, the number of refugees, and economic activity at the level of governorates. The vector autoregressive methodology is used to examine time series data from the most affected governorates in Jordan. The empirical results of Granger causality tests and impulse response functions show that there is no relationship between the influx of Syrian refugees and the Jordanian labor market. Our results are verified through a set of robustness checks.
H56|The Causal Effect of Military Conscription on Crime and the Labor Market|This paper uses detailed individual register data to identify the causal effect of mandatory peacetime military conscription in Sweden on the lives of young men born in the 1970s and 80s. Because draftees are positively selected into service based on their draft board test performance, our primary identification strategy uses the random assignment of potential conscripts to draft board officiators who have relatively high or low tendencies to place draftees into service in an instrumental variable framework. We find that military service significantly increases post-service crime (overall and across multiple crime categories) between ages 23 and 30. These results are driven primarily by young men with pre-service criminal histories and who come from low socioeconomic status households. Though we find evidence of an incapacitation effect concurrent with conscription, it is unfortunately not enough to break a cycle of crime that has already begun prior to service. Analyses of labor market outcomes tell similar post-service stories: individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds have significantly lower income, and are more likely to receive unemployment and welfare benefits, as a result of service, while service significantly increases income and does not impact welfare and unemployment for those at the other end of the distribution. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence that peer effects may play an important role in explaining the unintended negative impacts of military service.
H56|Can War Foster Cooperation?|"In the past decade, nearly 20 studies have found a strong, persistent pattern in surveys and behavioral experiments from over 40 countries: individual exposure to war violence tends to increase social cooperation at the local level, including community participation and prosocial behavior. Thus while war has many negative legacies for individuals and societies, it appears to leave a positive legacy in terms of local cooperation and civic engagement. We discuss, synthesize, and reanalyze the emerging body of evidence and weigh alternative explanations. There is some indication that war violence enhances in-group or ""parochial"" norms and preferences especially, a finding that, if true, suggests that the rising social cohesion we document need not promote broader peace."
H56|The Relationship Between Globalization And Military Expenditures In G7 Countries: Evidence From A Panel Data Analysis|This study explores the causal linkages between military expenditure and globalization in G7 countries (i.e. Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the USA) by analyzing data for the period 1988-2011. Panel causality was examined to explain dependency and heterogeneity across countries. The results of one-way Granger causality show that globalization influenced military expenditures in Germany, and Japan. Moreover, there was no evidence that military expenditures caused globalization in any G7 country. The evidence from Italy shows interaction causality between globalization and military expenditure. Bootstrap panel Granger causality tests show that the causality between globalization and military expenditure varies across countries with different conditions. The findings of this study could provide important policy implications for the G7 countries under study.
H56|Recollection Bias and Its Underpinnings: Lessons from Terrorism Risk Assessments|Recollection bias is the phenomenon whereby people who observe a highly unexpected event hold current risk beliefs about a similar event that are no higher than their recollection of their prior beliefs. This article replicates and extends the authorsâ€™ previous study of recollection bias in relation to individualsâ€™ perceptions of the risks of terrorism attacks. Over 60% of respondents in a national U.S. sample of over 900 adults believe that the current risk of a future terrorist attack by either an airplane or in a public setting is no higher than they recall having believed, respectively, before the 9/11 attack and before the Boston Marathon bombing. By contrast, a rational Bayesian model would update to a higher currently assessed risk of these previously uncontemplated events. Recollection bias is a persistent trait: individuals who exhibited this bias for the 9/11 attack exhibited it for the Boston Marathon bombing. Only oneâ€ fifth of respondents are free of any type of recollection bias. Recollection bias is negatively correlated with absolute levels of risk belief. Recollection bias in relation to highly unexpected terrorist eventsâ€”the belief that perceived risks did not increase after the surprise occurrenceâ€”dampens support for a variety of antiâ€ terrorism measures, controlling for the level of risk beliefs and demographic factors. Persistent recollection bias for both 9/11 and the Boston Marathon bombing is especially influential in diminishing support for protective policy measures, such as surveillance cameras in public places. Given that public attitudes influence policy, educating the public about risk is critical.
H56|Conflict, Defense Spending and Economic Growth in the Middle East: A Panel Data Analysis|The relationship between defense spending and economic growth is an active topic of debate for a long time. Defense spending may have negative consequences on the growth performance of developing countries in such conflict-ridden areas as the Middle East. This study is conducted to investigate the effects of defense spending on economic growth in a panel of twelve Middle Eastern countries over the period 1998-2012. The approach suggested by Swamy and Arora (1972) was employed for the empirical study. Findings of the empirical study suggest that defense spending has a negative effect on economic growth, which aggravates during times of internal and external conflicts
H56|The Interactional Impact of Defense Expenditure and Arms Importation on Economic Growth in Nigeria: An Autoregressive Approach|Little is done on the empirical analyses of the impact of defense expenditure on arms and economic growth. The few conducted concentrated on developed countries, which are exporters of arms. This study examines the short-run and long-run impact of arms importation on the economic growth in Nigeria, using autoregressive distributed lag model. Literature on defense expenditure and economic growth are often conflicting and inconclusive. These outcomes are due to the non-linear growth effects of defense and incorrect model specifications. The crucial growth effects of defense expenditure can be traced by properly controlling the interaction term. This paper examines the defense-arms interaction on Nigeria in the context of Aizeiman and Glick (2006) models. The result reveals that defense-arms interaction in Nigeria exerts negatively on the economic growth. It therefore recommends that defense R and D as well Defense Industrial Cooperation of Nigeria should be properly financed and managed for efficiency and self-reliability
H56|The geographical spillover of armed conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa|Anecdotal accounts of the geographical spread of war inevitably involve Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. But is conflict spillover effectively stronger in SSA than elsewhere? To answer this question, we estimate models of civil war onset comparing SSA against the rest of the world (RoW). We find that in SSA a neighbour at war increases the probability of civil war onset by at least 1%. This is not negligible, considering that the unconditional probability of civil war onset is 1.1% in the global sample and 1.5% in the SSA sample. The spillover effect in the RoW is three times smaller than in SSA and, in general, statistically not different from zero. The results are robust to changes in the definition of neighbourhood and the inclusion of regional variables in the estimating equations to account for clustering effects. Finally, we provide evidence that refugee inflows and the artificial separation of ethnic groups explain part, but not all, of the spillover effect in SSA.
H56|The effect of military deployment on mental health|Public concern about soldiers’ mental health has increased over the last decade. Yet the large literature on the mental health problems of returning soldiers relies primarily on self-reported measures that may suffer from non-response bias, usually refers to older conflicts, and focuses mainly on specific diagnoses such as PTSD. Another challenge is that the differences between soldiers and non-soldiers are not necessarily causal, instead possibly reflecting an underlying propensity towards active military service. Using the objective measures of hospitalizations and the purchase of mental health medication, this paper is the first to investigate the effect of recent military deployments on a broader measure of mental health, for a full population of Danish soldiers and a comparison group of eligible men. We exploit a panel of Danish health administrative records and use propensity score matching process, using unique observables such as ability tests. Matching is helpful in both reducing the selection bias from observables and determining pre- and post-deployment period for the comparison group. Then, we estimate the effect of deployment in a difference-in-differences setting, controlling for time trends and other omitted variables affecting both groups. Overall, we find a significant and long-lasting adverse effect of military deployment on soldiers’ mental health, regardless of the comparison groups and underlying assumptions.
H56|Military spending, fiscal capacity and the democracy puzzle|This article elucidates the complex and occasionally counter-intuitive effects of the twin phenomena of democratization and modernization on the path of military spending between 1880 and 1938 by analyzing the relationship between various traits of democracy and the state's fiscal capacity. The conclusion, in the spirit of Kant, is that it is political participation which is most effective in reducing military spending. Other elements of democracy play a distant secondary role. In addition, fiscal capacity, which often emerges and increases in tandem with democratization, is identified as one of the major determinants of defense outlays, although its impact decreased between the two World Wars.
H56|Trading hard hats for combat helmets: The economics of rebellion in eastern Ukraine|Using new micro-level data on violence in Eastern Ukraine, this paper evaluates the relative merits of ‘identity-based’ and ‘economic’ explanations of civil conflict. The first view expects rebellion to be most likely in areas home to the geographic concentration of ethnolinguistic minorities. The second expects more rebel activity where the opportunity costs of insurrection are low. Evidence from the armed conflict in Ukraine supports the second view more than the first. A municipality’s prewar employment mix is a more robust predictor of rebel activity than local ethnolinguistic composition. Municipalities more exposed to trade shocks with Russia experienced a higher intensity of rebel violence throughout the conflict. Such localities also fell under rebel control earlier – and took longer for the government to liberate – than municipalities where the labor force was less dependent on exports to Russia.
H56|Violent conflict and online segregation: An analysis of social network communication across Ukraine's regions|Does the intensity of a social conflict affect political division? Traditionally, social cleavages are seen as the underlying cause of political conflicts. It is clear, however, that a violent conflict itself can shape partisan, social, and national identities. In this paper, we ask whether social conflicts unite or divide the society by studying the effects of Ukraine's military conflict with Russia on online social ties between Ukrainian provinces (oblasts). In order to do that, we collected original data on the cross-regional structure of politically relevant online communication among users of VKontakte social networking site. We analyze the panel of provinces spanning the most active phases of domestic protests and military conflict and isolate the effects of province-specific war casualties on the nature of inter-provincial online communication. The results show that war casualties entice strong emotional response in the corresponding provinces, but do not necessarily increase the level of social cohesion in inter-provincial online communication. We find that the intensity of military conflict entices online activism, but activates regional rather than nation-wide network connections. We also find that military conflict tends to polarize some regions of Ukraine, especially in the East. Our research brings attention to the underexplored areas in the study of civil conflict and political identities by documenting the ways the former may affect the latter.
H56|Long-term health effects of Vietnam-era military service: A quasi-experiment using Australian conscription lotteries|This paper estimates the long-term health effects of Vietnam-era military service using Australia's National conscription lotteries for identification. Our primary contribution is the quality and breadth of our health outcomes. We use several administrative sources, containing a near-universe of records on mortality (1994–2011), cancer diagnoses (1982–2008), and emergency hospital presentations (2005–2010). We also analyse a range of self-reported morbidity indicators (2006–2009). We find no significant long-term effects on mortality, cancer or emergency hospital visits. In contrast, we find significant detrimental effects on a number of morbidity measures. Hearing and mental health appear to be particularly affected.
H56|Does military expenditure hinder economic growth? Evidence from Greece and Turkey|The relationship between economic growth and military expenditure has been extensively studied but its findings are inconclusive and contradictory. The primary reasons behind such disparities include the linear and nonlinear behavior of military expenditure on economic growth and the analysis of different techniques. This study examines the effect of military expenditure on economic growth in Greece and Turkey, which have higher military expenditure burden among the NATO11NATO – North Atlantic Treaty Organization. countries using a modified Barro model. The autoregressive distributive lag bounds testing (ARDL) for cointegration is used to determine the long run effect. A vector error correction model (VECM) has been used to analyze the short run effect between the variables. The military expenditure displays a significant negative effect on economic growth for Turkey for both short and long run. In contrast, there is no significant military expenditure effect on economic growth for Greece.
H56|Political conflict and foreign portfolio investment: Evidence from North Korean attacks|We examine the response of foreign investors to escalating political conflict and its impact on the South Korean stock market surrounding 13 North Korean military attacks between 1999 and 2010. Using domestic institutions and domestic individuals as benchmarks, we evaluate the trading behavior and performance of foreign investors. Following attacks, foreigners increase their holdings of Korean stocks and buy more shares of risky stocks. Performance results show foreigners maintain their pre-attack level of performance while domestic individuals, who make the overwhelming majority of domestic trades, perform worse. In addition, domestic institutions improve their performance. Overall, the results are consistent with the predictions based on the benefits of international diversification. Unlike domestic individuals, foreigners trade more shares than usual and deviate from their general strategy of positive feedback trading.
H56|The economic effects of a counterinsurgency policy in India: A synthetic control analysis|Using the synthetic control method, we analyze the economic effects of a unique counterinsurgency response to the Naxalite insurgency in India. Of all the states affected by Naxalite violence, only one state, Andhra Pradesh, raised a specially trained and equipped police force in 1989 known as the Greyhounds, dedicated to combating the Naxalite insurgency. Compared to a synthetic control region constructed from states affected by Naxalite violence that did not raise a similar police force, we find that the per capita NSDP of Andhra Pradesh increased significantly over the period 1989–2000. Further, we find that the effects on the manufacturing sector are particularly strong. Placebo tests indicate that these results are credible and various difference-in-difference specifications using state and industry level panel data further corroborate these findings.
H56|The effects of announcement of green policies on equity portfolios: Evidence from the United Kingdom|Purpose - – This paper aims to investigate the impact of 75 announcements of environmental policies on British equities over the period 2003 to 2012. In particular, the research has the following specific objectives: finding out whether there is wealth creation/destruction for investors as a result of the announcements of green policies and identifying changes in risk structure following the introduction of green policies. Design/methodology/approach - – Using event study methodology and non-parametric tests, the authors attempt to find out whether announcements of environmental/sustainability policies are value constructive or destructive for equity investors. The CAPM is fitted with interaction variables to measure the change in systematic risk following announcements. Findings - – The results show that the UK market is particularly sensitive to domestic, international and nuclear announcements. Cumulative abnormal returns in the range of 30-40 per cent were recorded in certain sectors. Consistent with the emerging literature, the authors observe that environmental policies induce changes in the systematic risk of businesses, both in the short run and the long run. Originality/value - – To the best of authors’ knowledge, the literature does not provide any answer as to how the risk and return of British equity portfolios change following the announcement of green policies in the aftermath of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. Furthermore, the literature does not differentiate among various categories of announcements (domestic, international and nuclear). Therefore, this paper bridges the gap in the literature on these two grounds.
H56|The evolution of concentration in the arms market|This article examines the evolution of concentration in the global arms market, or industry, over the period 1990-2013 and considers its prospects. Using data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) list of the largest 100 arms producing firms, it finds that within the international arms industry, there has been change but also continuity, particularly in the nature of the markets and the relations between the main producers and governments. While the changes that have taken place are important, it is still political rather than economic logic that shapes the evolution of the market. Certainly the arms industry remains relatively unconcentrated compared to other industries probably because of the domestic preferences in procurement by national governments. Countries do not like monopoly arms producers, but there is no western country other than the United States that can currently support more than one competitor, although in the near future Russia could and China may provide serious international competition to the U.S. What is clear is that there are economic forces pushing for increased competition, but the final outcome will be determined by political forces, and transparency and governance will become increasingly important issues.
H56|The role of military expenditure and arms imports in the Greek debt crisis|Despite the vast amount of empirical work performed on the defense–growth relationship, the impact of military expenditure on public debt is a largely neglected topic. The recent Greek debt crisis brought to the forefront the role of military expenditure as well as the inefficiencies and the inability of the EU to deal with the European debt crisis. This article investigates the role of military expenditure (among other factors) in the evolution of the Greek debt over the period 1970-2011. Greece is a particularly interesting case in this regard, given its high military burden since 1974 and the recent debt crisis that led the country to sign a bail-out package presented by the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, which involves extreme austerity measures and cuts in public spending. Employing the ARDL approach to cointegration, this article concludes that military expenditure and arms imports have had an adverse (i.e., increasing) effect on Greek public debt in the short-run, while investment has helped to reduce debt both in the short- and the long-run.
H56|Military expenditure in Greece: Security challenges and economic constraints|Against the backdrop of significant political, economic, and security-related changes that have taken place over the past two decades or so, this article examines the factors that affect military expenditure in Greece. Invariably ranked among the countries with the highest defense burden in the EU and NATO, it would appear that such budgetary outlays have mostly been driven by the ability of the economy to allocate scarce resources to national defense and less so by external security considerations.
H56|Turkey’s changing security perceptions and expenditures in the 2000s: Substitutes or complements?|This article explains changes in Turkey’s security perceptions after the current ruling party, the AKP, came to power. It focuses on how Turkey tried to change the structure of conflictual relations with countries it has long viewed as sources of threat. Focusing on Syria, especially, the article delineates economic tools for conflict reduction and regional integration employed by Turkey and analyzes the challenges and main obstacles that the Turkish government has faced, especially after the Arab spring upheavals. The article then devotes attention to Turkey’s military modernization efforts launched to cope with the new threat environment and from there moves on to elaborate on the effect of security policy preferences and design on Turkish security-related resource allocation since the early 2000s. The intermingled nature of internal and external security policies calls for broadening the context of the economic aspects of security to include police, gendarmerie, and coast guard services along with the military. Descriptive analysis of on-budget components and off-budget facilities shed light on Turkey’s recent position in the international arena as an important military spender and arms importer.
H56|Some exercises with SIPRI’s military expenditure alpha data: Same story for Greece and Turkey?|The purpose of this article is to assess the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute’s (SIPRI) updated military expenditure data for Greece and Turkey. Testing for data reliability involves two stages. First, for 1949–2014, the time pattern of Turkish military expenditure is explored by comparing national military budget data with the updated SIPRI data. Second, the new data for 1980–2001 are used to replicate an earlier study on possible action-reaction military spending behavior between Greece and Turkey. The findings still hold when the analysis is based on SIPRI’s updated data.
H56|Greece, Portugal, Spain: New evidence on the economic effects of military expenditure using the new SIPRI data|This article first compares old with newly updated and extended SIPRI military expenditure data for Greece, Portugal, and Spain. Using the new data to confirm or reject earlier findings, it then replicates a Solow growth model application employed in a 2012 study by Dunne and Nikolaidou. In addition, the article provides new evidence on the military expenditure–economic growth nexus for these three countries using the extended data that now cover the post-global financial crisis and European debt crisis years. The use of the new SIPRI data does not lead to rejection of the earlier findings for Greece and Portugal but does reject the formerly negative and statistically significant effect of military burden on growth for the case of Spain.
