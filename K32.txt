K32|The Impact of Car Pollution on Infant and Child Health: Evidence from Emissions Cheating|Car exhaust is a major source of air pollution, but little is known about its impacts on population health. We exploit the dispersion of emissions-cheating diesel cars—which secretly polluted up to 150 times as much as gasoline cars—across the United States from 2008-2015 as a natural experiment to measure the health impact of car pollution. Using the universe of vehicle registrations, we demonstrate that a 10 percent cheating-induced increase in car exhaust increases rates of low birth weight and acute asthma attacks among children by 1.9 and 8.0 percent, respectively. These health impacts occur at all pollution levels and across the entire socioeconomic spectrum.
K32|Defeating Crime? An Economic Analysis of Cannabis Legalization Policies|Can legalization of cannabis eliminate related organized crime? We model consumer choices for cannabis in a risky environment and determine the provision of cannabis, under prohibition and legalization. Although a legalization policy may crumble the profits from illegal providers driving them out of business, it also increases cannabis use. In contrast, repression decreases cannabis consumption but strengthens the cartelization of criminal networks. Combining legalization with repression can strangle the black market while controlling the demand for cannabis. Based on evidence from the US, policy simulations are used to compute the price of legal cannabis that would achieve this dual objective and highlight the complementarities between repression and legalization. For example, with a 1% probability of arrest and a USD 2000 fine for illegal purchase, a legal price around USD 439 per ounce would evict illegal suppliers and increase the consumption by less that 25%. If the probability of arrest reaches 2%, the eviction price can go up to USD 622 and overall consumption increases by no more than 5:5%.

K32|Burden of Inspection Costs and Effectiveness of Environmental Regulations|Using a laboratory experimental approach, this study examines the effect of institutional changes in the responsibility for paying inspection costs for environmental regulations on the behavior of polluters and authorities. In particular, we compare two schemes: one is that authorities always bear the inspection cost and the other is that polluters bear the cost in a given situation. We find that polluters comply with regulations more frequently in the latter than the former scheme, while the inspection behavior of authorities does not change significantly. Moreover, the cost-bearing change in the scheme induces income redistribution between polluters and authorities (pollutees or society). In addition, we introduce uncertainty about the occurrence of environmental damage, and find that the frequency of inspection is greater in the latter than the former scheme. Because both inspection and compliance costs increase, total payoff may decrease by the partial shift of responsibility for inspection cost from authorities to polluters.
K32|Economic growth, Environmental degradation and business cycles in Eswatini|This study investigates the impact of the business cycle on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) for the Eswatini Kingdom over the period 1970 – 2014. To this end, we employ the nonlinear autoregressive distributive lag (NARDL) model to capture the long-run and short-run cointegration effects between economic activity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over different phases of the business cycle. Our findings reveal that economic activity only degrades the environment during upswing of the economic cycle whilst this relationship is insignificant during downswing of the cycle. We specifically compute a value of $3.57 worth of output been gained at the cost of a metric unit of emissions during economic expansionary phases. Altogether, these results insinuate much needed government intervention in the market for emissions via environmental tax reforms (ETR) which should be designed with countercyclical bias towards upswing the business cycle.
K32|Addressing Climate Change through Price and Non-Price Interventions|Recognizing the importance of the second-best nature of economies, the Stern-Stiglitz report on carbon pricing departed from the recommendation of a single carbon price for all uses at all places and times. This paper provides some of the analytics behind these recommendations. First, I analyze the circumstances in which distributional concerns make desirable a tax or regulation inducing significant reductions in carbon usage in a carbon-intensive sector for which consumers are disproportionately rich. Such policies allow lower carbon prices elsewhere without exceeding carbon emission targets. The cost of the resulting production inefficiency may, under the identified circumstances, be less than the distributional benefits. The paper considers the circumstances in which such differential policies may be best implemented through regulation vs. differential pricing, as well as differential effects on political economy and norm setting. Second, I consider the effect of carbon price trajectories on induced innovation, providing general conditions under which the optimal carbon path should, at least eventually, be falling over time. Finally, I revisit the price-versus-quantity debate and highlight important aspects of the dynamic nature of the problem.
K32|US Water Pollution Regulation over the Last Half Century: Burning Waters to Crystal Springs?|In the half century since the founding of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, public and private U.S. sources have spent nearly $5 trillion ($2017) to provide clean rivers, lakes, and drinking water, or annual spending of 0.8 percent of U.S. GDP in most years. Yet over half of rivers and substantial shares of drinking water systems violate standards, and polls for decades have listed water pollution as Americans’ number one environmental concern. We assess the history, effectiveness, and efficiency of the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act, and obtain four main conclusions. First, water pollution has fallen since these laws, in part due to their interventions. Second, investments made under these laws could be more cost-effective. Third, most recent studies estimate benefits of cleaning up pollution in rivers and lakes which are less than their costs, though these studies may under-count several potentially important types of benefits. Analysis finds more positive net benefits of drinking water quality investments. Fourth, economic research and teaching on water pollution is relatively uncommon, as measured by samples of publications, conference presentations, and textbooks.
K32|On the Redesign of Accident Liability for the World of Autonomous Vehicles|This article studies a model of liability for automobile accidents in the coming world in which automobiles will be autonomous. In that world, travelers will not be drivers, rendering liability premised on driver fault irrelevant as a means of reducing accident dangers. Moreover, no other conventional principle of individual or of manufacturer liability would serve well to do so. Indeed, in the model considered, strict manufacturer liability, recommended by many commentators, would actually tend to leave accident risks unchanged from their levels in the absence of liability. However, a new form of strict liability––the hallmark of which is that damages would be paid to the state––would be superior to conventional rules of liability in alleviating accident risks and would be easy to administer.
K32|The influence of environment regulation on marine economy efficiency: evidence from China|With the depletion of terrestrial resources and the development of marine science and technology, marine economy has become a new growth pole in the world economic development. After more than ten years of hard work, many coastal areas have seen significant improvements in their ecological environment. As an important marine country, China is not an exception. To analyze the influence of eco-environment governance policies on marine economy, this paper quantifies the relationship between environmental regulation and marine economic efficiency for 11 provinces (or municipalities) in China's coastal areas. The Super-Efficiency Slacks-Based Measure (SE-SBM) model is used to illustrate the marine economic efficiency considering undesired outputs. The results of the system Generalized Moment Method (GMM) regression support a U-shaped relationship between the two variables, with one threshold effect of the environmental regulation intensity. It is also verified the implementation of the environmental regulation policy has a time-lag effect. During the process of implementation, industrial structure optimization, scientific and technological innovation have different impacts on marine economy. The paper concludes with detailed explanation for the effects of environmental regulation and policy on marine economy development in China. Policymakers can use these insights to formulate appropriate environment policies that aim to realize marine ecological civilization.
K32|Crime and Economic Growth: A Case Study of Manaus, Brazil|Due to economic and social advances since the 1990s, Brazil became the 7th largest economy in the world in 2012. However, crime rates have not stopped rising since the beginning of the last decade, with Brazil having the 11th largest homicide rate on the planet in that year (UN). In this paper we estimate how much crime harms economic activity from a case study of the city of Manaus, where in 2007 the organized crime group known as â€œFamÃ­lia do Norteâ€ was created. We analyzed the effects on Manausâ€™ GDP per capita using the synthetic control method. The comparison between Manaus and its synthetic control in the period after the creation of the criminal group showed that the presence of the criminal faction diminished the cityâ€™s GDP by 3% per year. Robustness checks confirmed this result, showing how organized crime can disrupt the countryâ€™s economic advances.
K32|Discretionary Exemptions from Environmental Regulation: Flexibility for Good or for Ill|"We develop a model of firm and regulator behavior to examine theoretically the use and consequences of discretionary exemptions (also known as variances, waivers, or exceptions) in environmental regulation. Many environmental protection laws, such as the Clean Water Act, impose limits on harmful activities yet include ""safety valve"" provisions giving the regulator discretion to grant full or partial exemptions that provide permanent or temporary relief from these limits. This discretion begets flexibility over the stringency of environmental protection laws. Our model places a profit-maximizing discharger of pollution under the purview of a fully informed regulator who may seek to maximize social welfare by imposing limits. We show that when a regulation does not otherwise allow flexibility, an exemption that relaxes the limit for firms with high abatement costs can improve social welfare by reducing the costs of achieving the given level of environmental quality. We further demonstrate that if the effectiveness of abatement technology improves over time, a temporary exemption can increase social welfare by adjusting allowable pollution in response to these dynamic conditions. We also show that if the labor market is sticky, exemptions can benefit workers. Driven by an unequally weighted social welfare function, the regulator may use exemptions to meet redistributive ends. However, these beneficial impacts of exemptions rely on a fully informed and benevolent regulator; otherwise, the discretionary nature of exemptions leaves them open to abuse. A regulator who is captured by industry, focused only on her own jurisdiction or answerable only to a set of elites, can abuse exemptions in ways that reduce social welfare, such as allowing inefficiently high pollution or inducing a cost-ineffective pattern of abatement."
K32|Do-It-Yourself medicine? The impact of light cannabis liberalization on prescription drugs|This paper provides the first analysis of â€œDo-it-Yourself Medicineâ€ concerning marijuana consumption by studying the effects of the unintended liberalization of light cannabis that took place in Italy in 2016 on prescription drugs sales. Using a unique and high-frequency dataset on monthly sales of drugs and the location of light cannabis retailers and adopting a staggered DiD research design, we find that the local market accessibility of light cannabis led to a reduction in dispensed packets of opioids, anxiolytics, sedatives, anti-migraines, antiepileptics, anti-depressives and anti-psychotics. This calls for an effective regulation of the market and a proper evaluation of the use of light cannabis for medical purposes.
K32|"Can APPealing and more informative bills ""nudge"" individuals into conserving electricity?"|We use a field experiment on energy billing in a German region to evaluate the effect of two behavioral nudges (consumption feedback and social comparison) on electricity consumption. Similar experiments have revealed significant treatment effects, yet the individual variance has proven to be substantial. On grounds of these heterogeneous treatment effects and the possibility of cross-country behavioral differences, additional experiments are warranted. For our German participants with low pretreatment consumption compared to many other countries, we find no treatment effects. From this, we deduce that the effect of consumption feedback and social comparison is highly context dependent.
K32|CO2-orientierte Bepreisung der Energieträger - Handlungsoptionen, Kompensationsmöglichkeiten und ihre rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen|Der klimapolitische Handlungsdruck hat eine Instrumentendiskussion entfacht. So plausibel die Forderung nach CO2-Bepreisung der Energieträger zu sein scheint, so heterogen ist das Spektrum möglicher Regelungsansätze. Die Vielzahl wirtschaftspolitischer Empfehlungen hat den Rechtsrahmen, in dem sich die Instrumentendiskussion bewegt, bislang kaum in den Blick genommen. Dieser Beitrag diskutiert Möglichkeiten und Grenzen der Instrumente nach Maßgabe der steuer-, haushalts-, finanzverfassungs- und europarechtlichen Vorgaben. Es zeigt sich, dass die aktuell diskutierten Reformschritte zur CO2-Bepreisung überwiegend im Einklang mit den Rechtsrahmen ausgestaltet werden könnten. Bei den Kompensationsmaßnahmen verengen sich die zur Verfügung stehenden Optionen unter rechtlichen und praktischen Gesichtspunkten.

K32|Legal and Political Agreements for Sharing International Rivers with Water Shortage|We develop normative investigation of sharing international rivers. First, we propose the model of water problems in the situation where a river flows through several states with the possibility of water shortage. We derive claims problems from the water problems. We axiomatize the family of convex combinations of the proportional and the equal awards rules for water claims problems. Using a unique claim vector constrained by geographic factors of a watercourse and the majority voting rule, we demonstrate how to determine the legal and political agreement of water problems.
K32|Douglass C. North: Transaction Costs, Property Rights, and Economic Outcomes|Douglass North asked why some societies historically and contemporarily have rising per-capita incomes and individual welfare, whereas others do not? He argued that successful economies had property rights that encouraged markets, trade, and investment in new production and organizational methods. In other economies, transaction costs, especially those due to the political process, blocked more efficient property rights. Property rights grant decision making over valuable resources and are the basis for investment, and market exchange. They mold the economy and the distribution of wealth and political power. Politicians and coalitions of privileged elites with stakes in the status quo join to preserve it. Inefficiencies create their own constituencies. There is no clear remedy for general citizens in North’s cases. Despite the power of North’s argument, transaction costs are not clear in aggregate studies of economies. They are more apparent in US common-pool resource problems with large, continuing losses in resource rents. This evidence runs counter to the facile arguments in the welfare and environmental economics literatures for addressing externalities that are reminiscent of the simplistic recommendations in the growth and economic history literatures that North challenged. If the observed costly political response to open access losses is characteristic of regulation in general, then welfare losses permeate developed economies as well and are more pervasive than the dramatic examples of development failure examined by North and others. Mitigation requires competitive interest groups that benefit from more secure property rights and greater resource rents to offset powerful elites that align with politicians and capture bureaucratic agencies to achieve particularistic benefits that undermine general welfare.
K32|The Problem of Data Quality in Analyses of Opioid Regulation: The Case of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs|States, which have the primary legal role in regulating the prescribing and dispensing of prescription medications, have created Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP) to try to reduce inappropriate prescribing, dispensing, and related harm. Research assessing whether these interventions are effective has produced inconclusive and contradictory results. Here we examine whether different data sources may have contributed to the varying results. Specifically, we: 1) identify the decisions inherent in creating such a dataset; 2) discuss the public data sources used by researchers in previous work; 3) develop and apply a detailed research protocol to create a novel PDMP law dataset; and 4) to illustrate potential consequences of data choice, apply various data sources to analyze the relationship between PDMP laws and prescribing and dispensing of opioids among disabled Medicare beneficiaries. We find that our dates differ from those in existing datasets, sometimes by many years. The regression analyses generated a twofold difference in point estimates, as well as different signed estimates, depending on the data used. We conclude that the lack of transparency about data assembly in existing datasets, differences among dates by source, and the regression results raise concerns for PDMP researchers and policymakers.

K32|Penalty-Point System, Deterrence and Road Safety: An Empirical Approach|Using a quasi-experimental approach, we study the causal effect of introducing a penalty-point system (PPS) on drivers, accidents, injuries and fatalities. We find that the PPS decreased the number of traffic offenders by 13.8%. In addition, the deterrence effect was directly related to the size of the point loss. The PPS reform also curbed PPS-related accidents, injuries and fatalities by 14,2%, 15.1% and 16.1%, respectively. These findings are robust to a battery of tests, including a placebo test with a fictitious reform date. Crucially, the timing of the PPS implementation had no effect on road incidents unrelated to PPS regulations.
K32|Time Trends Matter: The Case of Medical Cannabis Laws and Opioid Overdose Mortality|Mortality due to opioid overdoses has been growing rapidly in the U.S., with some states experiencing much steeper increases than others. Legalizing medical cannabis could reduce opioid-related mortality if potential opioid users substitute towards cannabis as a safer alternative. I show, however, that a substantial reduction in opioid-related mortality associated with the implementation of medical cannabis laws can be explained by selection bias. States that legalized medical cannabis exhibit lower pre-existing mortality trends. Accordingly, the mitigating effect of medical cannabis laws on opioid-related mortality vanishes when I include state-specific time trends in state-year-level difference-in-differences regressions.
K32|Assessment of waste dumping practices in mountain creeks|The paper examines the exposure of mountain creeks towards illegal waste disposal practices related to the lack of waste collection services in rural areas of Romania prior to EU accession and the low waste collection efficiency following the closure of rural wild dumps in 2009-2010. The paper estimates the amounts of household waste uncollected and disposed in selected small Carpathian rivers in the North-East development region. The expansion of built-up areas along the water courses leads to waste dumping practices across mountain villages in the context of poor waste management facilities. Particular morphology of villages and hydrological characteristics of the creeks may influence the magnitude of such bad practices. The paper points out the role of flash floods in cleaning upstream catchments from debris, thus, polluting the downstream rivers and human settlements. An efficient waste collection system in mountain areas has a crucial role to play in mitigating and ultimately preventing the waste dumping practices in water bodies.

K32|Inspection regimes and regulatory compliance: How important is the element of surprise?|Regulatory compliance is often promoted via unannounced inspections where firms found to be in violation of environmental, health, or safety regulations face punishments. When compliance is costly to firms, a key aspect of this approach is that the timing of inspections is unannounced and difficult to anticipate, lest firms comply only when they believe an inspection is likely. With data from Los Angeles (LA) County food-service health inspections, I estimate how the (in)ability to anticipate inspection timing affects compliance using a novel approach. Many facilities such as hotels, grocery stores, or food courts, consist of multiple food-service establishments sharing a single physical location. Multiple establishments within a single facility are commonly, though not always, inspected on the same day; meaning all but one of the establishments involved likely anticipate the timing of their next inspection to a considerable extent. Within such facilities, I show that establishments perform significantly worse on days in which they receive the sole inspection conducted at their facility. These sole inspections detect 7.75% more violations, 9.1% more inspection score point deductions, and 16.3% more major critical violations (the most severe violations of the county health code).
K32|The Effect of Medical Cannabis Dispensaries on Opioid and Heroin Overdose Mortality|Opioid overdose is the most common cause of accidental death in the United States and no policy response has been able to contain this epidemic to date. We examine whether local access to medical cannabis can reduce opioid-related mortality. Using a unique data set of medical cannabis dispensaries combined with county-level mortality data, we estimate the effect of dispensaries operating in a county on the number of overdose deaths. We find that counties with dispensaries experience 6% to 8% fewer opioid-related deaths among non-Hispanic white men. Mortality involving heroin declines by approximately 10% following the opening of a dispensary.
K32|Environmental Risks between Conceptualization and Action|Changes in the contemporary world materialized in particular through population growth and mobility, urbanization, and economic expansion also result in an increased exposure of people and assets to extreme events and impose, implicitly, adequate management of induced risks. The occurrence of natural and anthropogenic risk phenomena, known as hazards, puts a heavy tribute on disaster-sensitive human communities regardless of their level of development. The magnitude of the disasters and their increasing frequency and severity imply the need for their approach by the entire world community and for global action. Knowledge of risks becomes a sine qua condition in carrying out impact studies, risk prevention plans, spatial planning plans, and, in general, a condition for effective management of natural resources or sustainable development projects.

K32|Privacy as a Key Factor of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) Development in Health Care|"The transfer of a large part of activities to the cyberspace has made the society heavily depended on ICT. Internet of Things has been created due to the appearance of smart devices. IoT generates a new dimension of the network. Its use has ceased to be the domain of man. Communication only between devices has become possible, posing new challenges, directly related to security threats and a lot of new opportunities for unauthorised data. While there is a common awareness of the potential risks in using computers or networks, the use of intelligent things is wrongly seen as making life easier and paradoxically more secure.It is extremely important to notice seemingly unimportant behaviour, but likely to cause harm. In a world with ""smart? things, there are threats such as permanent surveillance, incessant and uncontrolled data leaks or identity theft. The challenge is to set up and formulate norms and enabling legislative processes to keep pace with the technology advancement.The use of ICT, especially in science and industry, changes everyday life already today. Society aging and increase in health care expenditure makes it imperative to expand the use of ICT in health care, where a revolution is expected with the use of intelligent diagnostic support systems, current health state monitoring and specialised technologies enabling remote medical procedures adaptation. But there are dangers associated with IoT use in health care requiring clearly defined criteria. Patients must be able to expect privacy and medical data safety.Even seemingly indispensable necessity to ensure the safety of medical data is not obvious.. Utilising ICT in the health sector will ensure change in approach towards patients and increased productivity. The need for privacy should be considered at the stage of technology design and implementation. Ensuring medical data security is paramount. Otherwise, social resistance and costs resulting from i.e. leakage of medical data and use of such data in an unlawful or even threatening manner will be very high."
K32|Understanding of the sustainable developmnet principle in Polish Law|Sustainable Development when discussed on the ground of legal science is first of all the subject of environmental law but also constitutional law and the theory of law. It is possible to say that its legal status is specified by terms used by the theory of law, its importance by the EU primary law and on polish grounds ? in polish constitution. The scope of its realization is a subject of studies of environmental law. The paper will discuss the problem of understanding the principle in Polish law. The main aim is to show the dilemma of location of the sustainable development principle in the first chapter of Polish Constitution and the consequences of that fact.
K32|Cr isotopes as a valuable tracer of Cr(VI) reduction in polluted (ground)waters|Chromium stable isotopes are of interest in many geochemical studies as a tool to identify Cr(VI) reduction in groundwater aquifers. At four industrial sites in the Czech Republic, we evaluated the extent of spontaneous removal of toxic Cr(VI) contaminated by Cr-plating baths. Prior to field studies we tested the short-term stability of Cr(VI) in groundwater samples. We follow conventional methods for Cr(VI) stabilization given by US EPA and APHA-AWWA-WEF protocols. We found significant Fe, Mn-induced Cr(VI) reduction in anthropogenically contaminated groundwater samples regardless of the sample treatment (alkalization, pH>8 and lower temperature,
K32|Optimal timing of harzardous waste clean-up under an environmental bond an a strict liability rule|Inadequate site clean-up and restoration by resource extraction firms leave a toxic legacy which must be dealt with by governments. This study compares the impacts of an environmental bond and a strict liability rule on a firm's incentives for cleaning up hazardous waste during resource extraction and upon termination. The firm's problem is modelled as a stochastic optimal control problem that results in a system of Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equations. The model is applied to a typical copper mine in Canada. The resource price is modelled as a stochastic differential equation, which is calibrated to copper futures prices using a Kalman filtering approach. A numerical solution is implemented to determine the optimal abatement and extraction rates as well as the critical levels of copper prices that would motivate a firm to clean up the accumulated waste under each policy. The paper demonstrates that an environmental bond provides stronger waste abatement incentives, implying that the waste is more likely to be cleaned up under the bond than the liability. The strict liability rule imposes sunk costs on a firm upon termination which would motivate it to remain inactive as a way to escape clean-up costs. However, the environmental bond raises funds ex ante for future clean-up costs and thus encourages site restoration.
K32|Energy Efficiency of Residential Buildings in the European Union – An Exploratory Analysis of Cross-Country Consumption Patterns|Despite a common EU directive on energy efficiency in residential buildings, levels of energy efficiency differ vastly across European countries. This article analyses these differences and investigates the effectiveness of different energy efficiency policies in place in those countries. We firstly use panel data to explain average yearly energy consumption per dwelling and country by observable characteristics such as climatic conditions, energy prices, income, and floor area. We then use the unexplained variation by sorting between-country differences as well as plotting within-country changes over time to identify better performing countries. These countries are analysed qualitatively in a second step. We conduct expert interviews and examine the legal rules regarding building energy efficiency. Based on our exploratory analysis we generate a number of hypotheses. First, we suggest that regulatory standards, in conjunction with increased construction activity, can be effective in the long run. Second, the results suggest that carbon taxation represents an effective means for energy efficiency.
K32|Tobacco Control Policies and Smoking Behavior in Europe: More Than Trends?|In many European countries, there is an unmissable trend towards stricter tobacco control policies and a parallel reduction in the prevalence of smoking. The extent to which policies promote this latter trend, however, is less clear. We therefore analyze the staggered introductions of smoking bans and the variation in cigarette taxes over more than twenty years. After taking into account unobserved country- and time-specic eects as well as country-specic trends, we nd no clear evidence that smoking bans are associated with lower levels of smoking. In contrast, higher cigarette prices tend to be negatively related to smoking, in particular for men and people under the age of 30. However, price elasticities are small. Overall, the results suggest that only about one sixth of the decline in the prevalence of smoking in Europe can be explained by our policy variables.
K32|Are Emission Performance Standards Effective in Pollution Control? Evidence from the EU's Large Combustion Plant Directive|This paper explores the extent to which emissions limits on stack concentrations under the Large Combustion Plant (LCP) Directive succeeded in mitigating local air pollutants from thermal power stations in the European Union. We take advantage of the discontinuities in regulation status to show that the emission performance standards led to sizeable declines in concentrations of SO2 , NOx, and particulate matter from the oldest fleet of combustion plants. We also find that the average response from the existing old plants was stronger than that from the relatively new existing fleet. Taking into account that new plants were not myopic in complying to the standards, we estimate the treatment effect close to the regulation discontinuity date – showing that more stringent performance standards were effective. Finally, those that opted-out were not more likely to retire than similar combustion plants that chose to comply with standards - some evidence of grandfathering-induced shutdown delays.
K32|How to Counter Fake News? A Taxonomy of Anti-Fake News Approaches|Fake news is a symptom of deeper structural problems in our societies and media environments. To counter it, policymakers need to take into account the underlying, self-reinforcing mechanisms that make this old phenomenon so pervasive today. Only by taking a step back can we examine the vulnerabilities these fake news narratives exploit. This article provides a first taxonomy of anti-fake news approaches. It argues that proposed anti-fake news laws focus on the trees rather than the forest. As such, they will not only remain irrelevant but also aggravate the root causes fueling the fake news phenomenon.
K32|Data for Good: Unlocking Privately-Held Data to the Benefit of the Many|It is almost a truism to argue that data holds a great promise of transformative resources for social good, by helping to address a complex range of societal issues, ranging from saving lives in the aftermath of a natural disaster to predicting teen suicides. Yet it is not public authorities who hold this real-time data, but private entities, such as mobile network operators and business card companies, and - with even greater detail - tech firms such as Google through its globally-dominant search engine, and, in particular, social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. Besides a few isolated and self-proclaimed ‘data philanthropy’ initiatives and other corporate data-sharing collaborations, data-rich companies have historically shown resistance to not only share this data for the public good, but also to identify its inherent social, non-commercial benefit. How to explain to citizens across the world that their own data - which has been aggressively harvested over time - can’t be used, and not even in emergency situations? Responding to this unsettling question entails a fascinating research journey for anyone interested in how the promises of big data could deliver for society as a whole. In the absence of a plausible solution, the number of societal problems that won’t be solved unless firms like Facebook, Google and Apple start coughing up more data-based evidence will increase exponentially, as well as societal rejection of their underlying business models. This article identifies the major challenges of unlocking private-held data to the benefit of society and sketches a research agenda for scholars interested in collaborative and regulatory solutions aimed at unlocking privately-held data for good.
K32|Better Regulation: Holding the European Commission Accountable?|This article examines what difference – if any – the renewed EU Better Regulation Agenda has made for the EU Commission in terms of its own accountability and policy outcomes. Emboldened by the Spitzenkandidaten process – which established for the first time a link between the outcome of the EU elections and the presidency of the EU Commission –, the Juncker Commission emerged as the most political yet. To shrug off the label of technocratic institution – historically insulated from citizens’ preferences –, the new Commission asked EU citizens to judge its operation by its ability ‘to deliver solutions to the big issues that cannot be addressed by the Member States alone’. By embracing such a panem et circenses approach to EU democracy – as such not too dissimilar from the Santer’s and Barroso’s previous administrations – the Juncker Commission raised new expectations. This is true not only in terms of output legitimacy – which was meant to become the privileged benchmark against which to measure the Commission’s success –, but also in terms of its own democratic and political accountability vis-à-vis EU citizens. Indeed, although unintelligible to the many, the Spitzenkandidaten logic entails that EU citizens contributed for the first time with their vote to shape the political orientation of this Commission and – as a result – could hold it accountable. While the very notion of political accountability is foreign to the EU constitutional setting – as citizens don’t have the possibility to replace the Commission if this does not meet their hopes –, the Juncker Commission has strived to frame its mandate as if such an oversight existed. This article concludes that at the very same time the Juncker Commission has been striving to develop its own, autonomous democratic credentials, its choice to embrace a set of well-defined institutional mechanisms that reward expert judgment over political adjudication appears at odds with its newly-acquired political nature.
K32|From residential energy demand to fuel poverty: income-induced non-linearities in the reactions of households to energy price fluctuations|The residential energy demand is growing steadily and the trend is expected to continue in the near future. At the same time, under the impulse of economic crises and environmental and energy policies, many households have experienced reductions in real income and higher energy prices. In the residential sector, the number of fuel-poor households is thus expected to rise. A better understanding of the determinants of residential energy demand, in particular of the role of income and the sensitivity of households to changes in energy prices, is crucial in the context of recurrent debates on energy efficiency and fuel poverty. We propose a panel threshold regression (PTR) model to empirically test the sensitivity of French households to energy price fluctuations Ð as measured by the elasticity of residential heating energy prices Ð and to analyze the overlap between their income and fuel poverty profiles. The PTR model allows to test for the non-linear effect of income on the reactions of households to fluctuations in energy prices. Thus, it can identify specific regimes differing by their level of estimated price elasticities. Each regime represents an elasticity-homogeneous group of households. The number of these regimes is determined based on an endogenously PTR-fixed income threshold. Thereafter, we analyze the composition of the regimes (i.e. groups) to locate the dominant proportion of fuel-poor households and analyse their monetary poverty characteristics. Results show that, depending on the income level, we can identify two groups of households that react differently to residential energy price fluctuations and that fuel-poor households belong mostly to the group of households with the highest elasticity. By extension, results also show that income poverty does not necessarily mean fuel poverty. In terms of public policy, we suggest focusing on income heterogeneity by considering different groups of households separately when defining energy efficiency measures. We also suggest paying particular attention to targeting fuel-poor households by examining the overlap between fuel and income poverty.
K32|Competitive advantage in the renewable energy industry: Evidence from a gravity model|Pioneering domestic environmental regulation may foster the creation of new eco-industries. These industries could benefit from a competitive advantage in the global market place. This article examines empirical evidence of the impact of domestic renewable energy policies on the export performance of renewable energy products (wind and solar PV). We use a gravity model of international trade with a balanced dataset of 49 (for wind) and 40 (for PV) countries covering the period 1995–2013. The stringency of renewable energy policies is proxied by installed capacities. Our econometric model shows evidence of competitive advantage positively correlated with domestic renewable energy policies, sustained in the wind industry but brief in the solar PV industry. We suggest that the reason for the dynamic difference lies in the underlying technologies involved in the two industries.
K32|Firm's Protection against Disasters: Are Investment and Insurance Substitutes or Complements?|We use a controlled laboratory experiment to study firm's and insurer's behavior when the firm can protect itself against potential technological damages. The probability of a catastrophic event is objective, and the firm's costly investment in safety reduces it. The firm can also buy an insurance with full or partial refund against the consequences of the catastrophic event, which ultimately reduces the variance of the firm's investment-in-safety lottery. In the insurer-firm game, first the insurer decides which contract to propose to the firm, then the firm simultaneously decides whether or not to buy this contract and whether or not to invest in the reduction of the probability of the catastrophic events. We parametrize the insurer-firm game such that: (i) a risk-neutral insurer maximizes his expected profit by o↵ering an actuarially fair contract with full insurance; (ii) a risk-neutral firm is indi↵erent between investing in safety and accepting a fair insurance contract. We aim at understanding whether investment in safety and insurance are substitutes or complements in the firm's risk management of catastrophic events. In line with our predictions, the experimental results suggest that they are substitutes rather than complements: the firm's investment in safety measures is a↵ected by the insurer's proposed contract, the latter usually involving only partial insurance.
K32|Rethinking nudge: not one but three concepts|Nudge is a concept of policy intervention that originates in Thaler and Sunstein's (2008) popular eponymous book. Following their own hints, we distinguish three properties of nudge interventions: they redirect individual choices by only slightly altering choice conditions (here nudge 1), they use rationality failures instrumentally (here nudge 2), and they alleviate the unfavourable effects of these failures (here nudge 3). We explore each property in semantic detail and show that no entailment relation holds between them. This calls into question the theoretical unity of nudge, as intended by Thaler and Sunstein and most followers. We eventually recommend pursuing each property separately, both in policy research and at the foundational level. We particularly emphasize the need of reconsidering the respective roles of decision theory and behavioural economics to delineate nudge 2 correctly. The paper differs from most of the literature in focusing on the definitional rather than the normative problems of nudge.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K32|Impact of the Clean Air Act on Air Pollution and Infant Health: Evidence from South Korea|This paper examines the extent to which the 2005 Clean Air Act introduced in South Korea affected air pollution and infant health. To identify the causal effect, we exploit the time and geographical variations in the adoption of the Act between 2003 and 2006. During this period, the Clean Air Act indeed significantly reduced air pollutants. For example, the PM10 level was reduced by 9 percent. However, the Act's impact on infant mortality was not statistically significant.
K32|The benefits of avoiding cancer (or dying from cancer): Evidence from a four- country study|We use stated-preference methods to estimate the cancer Value per Statistical Life (VSL) and Value per Statistical Case (VSCC) from a representative sample of 45–60-year olds in four countries in Europe. We ask respondents to report information about their willingness to pay for health risk reductions that are different from those used in earlier valuation work because they are comprised of two probabilities—that of getting cancer, and that of dying from it (conditional on getting it in the first place). The product of these two probabilities is the unconditional cancer mortality risk. Our hypothetical risk reductions also include two severity-related attributes—quality-of-life impacts and pain. The results show that respondents did appear to have an intuitive grasp of compound probabilities, and took into account each component of the unconditional cancer mortality risk when answering the valuation questions. We estimate the cancer VSL to be between approximately € 2 and 5.950 million, depending on whether the (unconditional) mortality risk was reduced by lowering the chance of getting cancer, increasing the chance of surviving cancer, or both. The VSCC is estimated to be up to € 0.578 million euro, and its magnitude depends on the initial (conditional) cancer mortality and on the improvement in survival. The survey responses show that our measures of cancer severity—impacts on daily activities and pain—have little or no effect on the WTP to reduce the adverse health risks.
K32|Regulatory protective measures and risky behavior: Evidence from ice hockey|We provide evidence supporting the Peltzman effect, by which individuals required to wear protective gear end up taking additional risks that potentially offset the intended aim of the device. We take advantage of the fact that wearing a visor—a protective device in Ice Hockey—is mandatory in European, minor, and junior leagues but not in the NHL. This allows us to estimate the impact of wearing a visor by comparing the behavior in the NHL and other leagues of players who always wear a visor with that of players who wear one only when it is required. We find that when players are forced to wear a visor their behavior becomes more risky, earning an additional 0.19 penalty in minutes per game (compared to the average 1.14 penalty in minutes in our sample). We estimate an even larger effect of visors when we focus on players who were forced to use one during the 2004 season, when the NHL canceled its regular season and players had to move to European leagues temporarily. These estimates are not driven by players' observable attributes, playing style, or other differences across leagues.
K32|The Nuclear Safety Authority in France: A Dogma of “Independence” and Institutional Fragility|The fragility of the independence of the Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) is underlined by demonstrating the inadequacy of the parameters which are intended to protect it. Secondly, the focus is placed on transparency, presented by the safety authority as an acquired value. This transparency is in fact very limited. But, in particular, the “provision of information” is not a sufficient condition of transparency. Finally, by using the illustrative case of the mine tailings census (Borloo circular, 2009), it is assumed that the economic logic strongly limits the conditions of production of technical knowledge for information purposes.

K32|Exploring the nexus between certainty in injury compensation and treatment selection|We study the effect of reduced medical liability due to the implementation of scheduled damages on the overuse of cesarean sections. Using data from inpatient discharge records on deliveries in Italy, we exploit the fact that hospitals are distributed across court districts and that only some courts introduced schedules during the period of observation. This allows us to identify the effect of a decrease in liability using a difference-in-difference approach while minimizing the heterogeneities between treated and control hospitals. We show that decreased medical liability increases the incidence of unnecessary cesarean sections by 7 percentage points, which corresponds to a 20% increase at the mean of cesarean sections. The magnitude of the response is higher for hospitals with lower quality and that are far from consumer association headquarters. Lower schedules and higher levels of reimbursements per delivery also increase the overuse of cesarean section. The analysis of the response times, combining the difference-in-difference approach with a regression discontinuity design, shows that the response to decreased liability is already detectable in the short run. Our findings are robust to several sets of robustness checks and are not driven by anticipatory effects or a change in the composition of the treated patients.
K32|Is Pollution Value-Maximizing? The DuPont Case|DuPont, one of the most respectable U.S. companies, caused environmental damage that ended up costing the company around a billion dollars. By using internal company documents disclosed in trials we rule out the possibilities that this bad outcome was due to ignorance, an unexpected realization, or a problem of bad governance. The documents rather suggest that the polluting was a rational decision: under reasonable probabilities of detection, polluting was ex-ante optimal from the company’s perspective, even if the cost of preventing pollution was lower than the cost of the health damages produced. We then examine why different mechanisms of control – legal liability, regulation, and reputation – all failed to deter a behavior that was inefficient from a social point of view. One common reason for the failures of deterrence mechanisms is that the company controls most of the information and its release. We then sketch potential ways to mitigate this problem.
K32|Compulsory insurance and voluntary self-insurance: substitutes or complements? A matter of risk attitudes|Based on Ehrlich and Becker’s model (1972) on insurance and self-insurance substitutability, we study the effects of a compulsory partial insurance on self-insurance decisions of both risk-averters and (mixed) risk-lovers. We show that when insurance is compulsory, risk-averters adjust (by substituting) their self-insurance behavior to compensate for the level (too high or too low) of the compulsory coverage level. By contrast, even though they would refuse to invest in any voluntarily hedging scheme, (mixed) risk-lovers freely invest in self-insurance to complete a compulsory partial insurance coverage. Moreover, we prove that for a (mixed) risk-lover, an increase in the partial compulsory insurance coverage induces simultaneously a rise of the self-insurance marginal benefit and a decrease of its marginal cost. Therefore, while compulsory insurance and self-insurance are substitutes for risk-averters, they are complements for (mixed) risk-lovers. This last result brings an unexpected justification for compulsory insurance policies.
K32|Earnings expectations and employee safety|We examine the relation between workplace safety and managers’ attempts to meet earnings expectations. Using establishment-level data on workplace safety from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, we document significantly higher injury/illness rates in firms that meet or just beat analyst forecasts compared to firms that miss or comfortably beat analyst forecasts. The higher injury/illness rates in firms that meet or just beat analyst forecasts are associated with both increases in employee workloads and in abnormal reductions of discretionary expenses. The relation between benchmark beating and workplace safety is stronger when there is less union presence, when workers’ compensation premiums are less sensitive to injury claims, and among firms with less government business. Our findings highlight a specific consequence of managers’ attempts to meet earnings expectations through real activities management.
K32|Temporal displacement of environmental crime: Evidence from marine oil pollution|We provide evidence for temporal displacement of illegal discharges of oil from shipping, a major source of ocean pollution, in response to a monitoring technology that features variation in the probability of conviction by time of day. During the nighttime, evidence collected by Coast Guard aircraft using radar becomes contestable in court because the nature of an identified spot cannot be verified visually by an observer on board of the aircraft. Seasonal variation in time of sunset is used to distinguish evasive behavior from daily routines on board. Using data from surveillance flights above the Dutch part of the North Sea during 1992–2011, we provide evidence for a sudden increase in illegal discharges after sunset across the year. Our results show that even a tiny chance of getting caught and a mild punishment can have a major impact on behavior.
K32|Damage caps and defensive medicine, revisited|Does tort reform reduce defensive medicine and thus healthcare spending? Several (though not all) prior studies, using a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach, find lower Medicare spending for hospital care after states adopt caps on non-economic or total damages (“damage caps”), during the “second” reform wave of the mid-1980s. We re-examine this issue in several ways. We study the nine states that adopted caps during the “third reform wave,” from 2002 to 2005. We find that damage caps have no significant impact on Medicare Part A spending, but predict roughly 4% higher Medicare Part B spending. We then revisit the 1980s caps, and find no evidence of a post-adoption drop (or rise) in spending for these caps.
K32|Un modèle d'accident unilatéral: incertitude non-radicale et estimations différenciées|Cet article reconsidère le modèle d'accident unilatéral standard en univers probabiliste (hors incertitude radicale). Contrairement à ce dernier, les agents (porteur de préjudice et victime) forment des estimations différentes sur la distribution de probabilité d’accident et l'évaluation des dommages. En conséquence, le coût social d'un accident varie suivant le type de responsabilité civile (invariable dans le modèle standard). La correspondance entre les régimes de la responsabilité sans faute et la règle de la négligence n'existe plus sauf dans l’hypothèse où le pollueur estime les coûts des dommages à un niveau supérieur à celui de la victime.
K32|Lenders and Risky Activities: Strict Liability or Negligence Rule?|The amendments made to CERCLA in 1996 reinforced the exemption of lenders that finance ultra-hazardous activities. Then, they become involved in liability only if they manage or own polluting activities. The paper compares strict liability and negligence rule in an agency model of vicarious liability type, and proposes to restore lenders as principal by applying negligence rules to them while operators would resort to a strict liability rule. This scheme leads the lender to propose to the borrower the most favorable loan level that induces the latter to provide the socially optimal security level.
K32|Optimization of Exclusive Economic Zone to Maintain and Protect Marine Natural Resources for the Welfare of the People of Indonesia|"""Objective – The purpose of the present study is to determine Indonesia’s efforts to maintain and protect the fishery resources. Methodology/Technique – The present study used the normative juridical research method by researching the literature available. Findings – As stipulated in UNCLOS, the coastal states have rights, jurisdiction and obligations in the exclusive economic zone. Those rights are the rights to exploration and exploitation, conservation and management of natural resources, both living and non-living, of its waters. Novelty – The present study employed the law approach by examining all laws and regulations relating to the legal issues studied. The study suggests that Indonesia can implement and provide legal certainty with regard to maintaining and protecting marine natural (fishery) resources to support the life of the world community, especially the people of Indonesia to achieve social welfare."""
K32|Waste collection in rural communities: challenges under EU regulations. A Case study of Neamt County, Romania|The paper aims to examine the changes in the rural waste management sector at regional scale since the Romania adhesion to the EU in 2007. Traditional waste management based on the mixed waste collection and waste disposal often on improper sites prevailed in municipal waste management options of transitional economies across the globe. The lack of formal waste collection services in rural areas has encouraged the open dumping or backyard burning. The paper analyses the improvements and challenges of local authorities in order to fulfill the new EU requirements in this sector supported by data analysis at local administrative unit levels and field observations. Geographical analysis is compulsory in order to reveal the local disparities. The paper performs an assessment of waste collection issues across 78 rural municipalities within Neamt County. This sector is emerging in rural areas of Eastern Europe, but is far from an efficient municipal waste management system based on the waste hierarchy concept.
K32|Contribution Of High-Level Structures For Management Integration, Aportes De La Estructura De Alto Nivel En La Gestion Integrada|"This article presents the results of a study analyzing the contributions of the high-level structure proposed by the International Organization for Standardization ISO. The goal is to meet the requirements on quality management and management of health and safety working in private sector organizations. To do this, the scientific literature was consulted. This search was performed using the key terms ""integrated management"", ""integration of management systems"" and ""High-level structure. Additionally, an iterative search of the publications of the two main authors took place. Further, the current legal regulations in Colombia were analyzed on applicable management companies analyzed. The texts that met the criteria were retrieved and analyzed following the methodology of critical reading on the proposal for Alvarado 2012. They were subsequently contrasted with Annex SL directives of ISO / IEC. We concluded that highlevel structure facilitates the integrated quality management and safety and health at work and optimizes resources to achieve the objectives organizational"
K32|Involuntary job loss and changes in personality traits|Economists consider personality traits to be stable, particularly throughout adulthood. However, evidence from psychological studies suggests that the stability assumption may not always be valid, as personality traits can respond to certain life events. Our paper analyzes whether and to what extent personality traits are malleable over a time span of eight years for a sample of working individuals. Furthermore, we specifically look at changes in personality traits after a major adverse life event: involuntary job loss. We use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) from 2004 to 2014 – a period over which individuals’ Big Five personality inventory was measured three times. Our dataset allows us to exploit detailed employment information, particularly reasons for job termination and unemployment spells. We focus solely on plant closures as a reason for job termination. Job loss due to plant closure is widely used as a relatively exogenous event to identify causal effects. Our results suggest that personality traits are indeed malleable during adulthood. Although the Big Five measures are relatively stable within the overall population of workers, we find an increase in openness, that is, the willingness to seek new experiences, for the average displaced worker. This increase, however, is fully driven by individuals with high educational attainment and by those who find a new job immediately after dismissal. The other dimensions of the Big Five personality inventory remain nearly unchanged after an involuntary job loss. Our findings hold for a number of robustness checks and are supported by the results of a falsification test using a placebo treatment.
K32|Do Environmental Regulations Effect FDI decisions? The Pollution Haven Hypothesis Revisited|In an attempt to verify the pollution haven hypothesis, this study investigates the impact of environmental regulations on foreign direct investment (FDI). We use Korean outward FDI data covering the manufacturing sector for 2009-15. The study not only considers the stringency but also the enforcement of environmental regulations when measuring the degree of the host country’s environmental regulations. Since the pollution haven’s effects indicate moving the polluting production stages from the home country to other (host) countries, we distinguish between investments in the ‘production’ part from that in the non-production part using location information about the host country. The main results of the estimation of a FDI model show that the stricter the regulations in host countries in Asia the lower the FDI both intensively and extensively to those countries. This supports the prevalence of the effects of pollution havens. However, before we separate the FDI into the production part, the effect of environmental regulations on FDI is hindered by the FDI in the non-production part. The results indicate that environmental regulations are determinants of FDI in the production part, while environmental regulations do not have a significant effect on FDI decisions when the entire FDI is considered.
K32|Products with nutrition and health claims in the Western Balkans: labelling behaviour, regulation and policy implications|Abstract This paper analyses food industry labelling behaviour in regulated and unregulated markets of products with nutrition and health claims (N&H claims) in the Western Balkans. The aim is to find out whether the intervention of the lawmakers in the form of labelling regulation improves transparency of labelling behaviour and facilitates a more informed consumer choice. The analysis is based on a shop survey of 475 products with N&H claims, conducted in six Western Balkan countries (WBC). Statistical inference is derived from the results of the Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric tests as well as the Dunn post-test for all pairwise comparisons as a form of simultaneous nonparametric inference. Differences among the countries constituting the region are significant. In comparison with regulated markets in the region, unregulated WBC markets are characterized by a higher level of “spurious” statements dominated by regional/domestic producers not obliged to use scientifically-approved claims in their corporate practices. In these conditions, differences in labelling behaviour are expected as well, which is only partly confirmed by our testing results.
K32|The Effect of Workplace Inspections on Worker Safety|The Occupation Safety and Health Administration enforces safety regulations through workplace inspections. To identify the effect of inspections on worker safety, this study exploits quasi-experimental variation in inspections due to OSHA’s Site Specific Targeting plan. The SST plan used establishment-level data on accidents and injuries to target establishments for inspection. The primary inspection list consisted of establishments with case rates exceeding a cutoff. This cutoff generated a discontinuous increase in inspections, which is used to identify the effect of inspections on worker safety. Using the fuzzy regression discontinuity design and local linear regression, the estimated effect of an inspection on cases involving days away from work, job restrictions, and job transfers is -1.607 per 100 full-time equivalent workers. The effect is most pronounced among manufacturing establishments below the 90th percentile of the case-rate distribution.
K32|Regressive Sin Taxes|A common objection to “sin taxes”—corrective taxes on goods like cigarettes, alcohol, and sugary drinks, which are believed to be over-consumed—is that they fall disproportionately on low-income consumers. This paper studies the interaction between corrective and redistributive motives in a general optimal taxation framework. On the one hand, redistributive concerns amplify the corrective benefits of a sin tax when sin good consumption is concentrated on the poor, even when bias and demand elasticities are constant across incomes. On the other hand, a sin tax can generate regressivity costs, raising more revenue from the poor than from the rich. Sin tax regressivity can be offset by targeted transfers or income tax reforms if differences in sin good consumption are driven by income effects, but not if they are driven by preference heterogeneity, and not if the indirect incentives the sin tax generates for labor supply decisions are not salient. The price elasticity of demand determines the extent to which corrective benefits versus regressivity costs determine the size of the optimal tax. We implement our optimal tax formulas in a calibrated model of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption for a range of parameter values suggested by empirical work.
K32|Is Pollution Value-Maximizing? The DuPont Case|DuPont, one of the most respectable U.S. companies, caused environmental damage that ended up costing the company around a billion dollars. By using internal company documents disclosed in trials we rule out the possibilities that this bad outcome was due to ignorance, an unexpected realization, or a problem of bad governance. The documents rather suggest that the harmful pollution was a rational decision: under reasonable probabilities of detection, polluting was ex-ante optimal from the company's perspective, albeit a very harmful decision from a societal perspective. We then examine why different mechanisms of control - legal liability, regulation, and reputation - all failed to deter socially harmful behavior. One common reason for the failures of deterrence mechanisms is that the company controls most of the information and its release. We then sketch potential ways to mitigate this problem.
K32|Optimal Regulation with Exemptions|Despite decades of research on mechanism design and on many practical aspects of cost-benefit analysis, one of the most basic and ubiquitous features of regulation as actually implemented throughout the world has received little theoretical attention: exemptions for small firms. These firms may generate a disproportionate share of harm due to their being exempt and because exemption induces additional harmful activity to be channeled their way. This article analyzes optimal regulation with exemptions where firms have different productivities that are unobservable to the regulator, regulated and unregulated output each cause harm although at different levels, and the regulatory regime affects entry as well as the output choices of regulated and unregulated firms. In many settings, optimal schemes involve subtle effects and have counterintuitive features: for example, higher regulatory costs need not favor higher exemptions, and the incentives of firms to drop output to become exempt can be too weak as well as too strong. A final section examines the optimal use of output taxation alongside regulation, which illustrates the contrast with the mechanism design approach that analyzes the optimal use of instruments of a type that are not in widespread use.
K32|Measuring the economic value of the effects of chemicals on ecological systems and human health|This paper reviews and discusses the existing methods for placing a value on the effects of chemicals on human health and the environment. It surveys both methods and non-market methods, discussing their advantage and limitations. For example, when valuing non-fatal illnesses, the cost-of-illness approaches captures labour income lost to illness and medical expenditures undertaken to mitigate the illness, but fails to account for the value of the disutility of the illnesses. The paper also discusses mortality risk valuation, and the widely used metric termed the Value of a Statistical Life, the difficulties associated with estimating it, and the appropriateness of any adjustments for futurity, age, and the nature of the risk itself. Finally, the paper takes up the issue whether the source of the health risks (e.g., chemicals versus other forms of pollution versus others) affects how much the public values reducing those risks.
K32|Viewpoints On Justice, Democracy And Global Climate Change|The article serves as an introduction to the anthropogenic environmental change, comprehended as the progressing and complex example of changes in the organization of the world's air emerging from human action, which has lately incited a reexamining of the degree and substance of equity. At present, the exact way of our atmosphere related commitments, and additionally general society and ecological approaches these commitments involve, stays misty, as do the ramifications of environmental change for our present comprehension of majority rules system and the institutional requests with which is related. Based on the approach presented, one clarification for this unclarity is that certified endeavors to connect logically hearty records of majority rule government and equity from one viewpoint, and solid inquiries of policymaking and vote based consideration on the other, have just as of late been pending. It can be concluded that by acquiring the majority of the exemplary issues of worldwide and intergenerational equity, and including new concerns, for example, the questionable long haul impacts of atmospheric change, climate justice is a truly complex enterprise.
K32|Eu Environmental Crimes And Marine Pollution Framework: Beyond Theorical Approach Erika And Prestige Case Law|The present research offers an overview of the main instruments and measures foreseen by the European legislation on environmental crime and marine pollution aiming to make greater efforts to combat against environmental crime and marine pollution in the European zone. Criminal law and procedural criminal law, are generally deemed basic segments of State sovereignty, thus, there are some main difficulties in transposing EU and international law. In this context, the need of harmonization between international, EU and domestic criminal and procedural provisions, especially in the case of trans-boundary criminal offences like marine pollution, will be underlined. This aspect is evident if we assume that the general environmental standards on marine pollution are enacted, respectively, by international organizations like the United Nations, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the European Union and by single States. Consequently, a coherency among these sources of law has to be found when a decision on a single case has to be taken. The research concludes with a reference to the sinking of the oil-tankers Erika and Prestige. These accidents (I) highlight the complexities and the difficulties that emerged in the investigation phase and in the judgments adopted, (II) and stress that a lack of harmonization and the failure to develop a definition of pollution crime and penalties are still persistent. Thus, the present paper provides a useful guide on key issues pertaining marine pollution by conducting a brief analysis of the main relevant theoretical and practical instruments.
K32|Парниковый Эффект И Рыночные Механизмы Киотского Протокола<BR>[Greenhouse Effect and Mechanisms of Kyoto Protocol]|Russian Abstract. Рассматривается проблема парниковых газов (ПГ), и сокращения их выбросов. Эмиссия ПГ считается одной из главных антропогенных причин роста концентрации углерода в атмосфере, и глобальных климатических перемен. Борьба с атмосферным загрязнением пока шла тремя путями: административное регулирование, экономические механизмы и формирование рыночных отношений. Во второй половине XX века для решения проблем были предложены многие схемы создания рыночного механизма, считающегося более подходящим во многих отношениях. Эти усилия увеличились в 1990х г., и наконец Киотский протокол поддержал гибкие механизмы: торговля квотами (квотирование и торговля), проекты совместного осуществления и механизмы чистого развития, разработаные в 2001 году. Но, несмотря на все эти усилия, в течение первого периода их применения (2008–2012) выбросы углерода в атмосферу возросли. Теперь мировой «углеродный» рынок идёт к развитию национальных, региональных и субрегиональных систем регулирования, но при сохранении международного сегмента (системы РКИК ООН). Конференция в 2012 году уточнила условия, в которых Стороны Конвенции будут выстраивать свою климатическую политику в будущем. Ведущая тенденция (акценты на региональные, субрегиональные и национальные системы регулирования) сохранилась, но сохранилась и «киотская» система, которая на новом этапе будет переходной на пути к новому ожидающемуся глобальному соглашению. English Abstract. This article considers the problem of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and its reduction. These missions are observed as one of the main anthropogenic causes of the increasing carbon concentration in the atmosphere, and the global climate change. The fight against atmosphere pollution goes in three directions: administrative regulations, economic mechanisms and market relations building. In the second half of the XX century many schemes for involving the market mechanism in solving these problems were proposed. These efforts increased in the 1990s and finally the Kyoto Protocol supported flexible mechanisms (trade of quotas – cap and trade, joint implementation projects and clean development mechanisms), as a solution to these problems, explained in 2001. In spite of all these efforts, during the first period of its implementation (2008– 2012) the emissions of carbon increased. Today, the world «carbon» market is moving to the development of national, regional and subregional regulation systems while keeping its international level (system UNFCCC). The Conference held in 2012 precised the conditions upon which the convention parties would define its climate policies in future. The leading tendency (transition to regional, subregional and national regulation systems) was maintained, as well as the «Kyoto» system, which in the new stage would play a transitional role on the road to a new expected global agreement.
K32|The Effect of Information Salience on Product Quality: Louisville Restaurant Hygiene and Yelp.com|In late June 2013, the city of Louisville, Kentucky, announced plans to provide restaurant health inspection data to Yelp.com for publication on their popular online consumer-review forum. These data were already publicly available on the city's website. I utilize this partnership to test whether an increase in the salience of disclosed quality information on a particular product attribute, induces sellers to improve product quality along that dimension. Consumers use Yelp to gather information on many characteristics of a restaurant's product. Consumers depend less on Yelp to learn about chain-affiliated restaurants, because much of this information is conveyed through the chain's reputation. Using data from over 11,000 Louisville restaurant health inspections, I compare health inspection performance for independent and chain-affiliated restaurants, before and after the announcement of the partnership. Controlling for a variety of factors, I estimate that this increased salience caused substantial improvement in independent restaurant hygiene. The average treatment effect is estimated to be a 12-14% decrease in health score point deductions, and a 29-37% decrease in critical violations (those deemed to be the greatest public health risk), per inspection. The effect of the Louisville-Yelp partnership on health score point deductions is entirely evident in restaurants' first inspections following its announcement, where the estimated effect is a 14-16% relative decrease.

K32|Mandatory Disclosure, Letter-Grade Systems, and Corruption: The Case of Los Angeles County Restaurant Inspections|In 1998, Los Angeles (LA) County adopted a mandatory disclosure policy aimed at inducing restaurant hygiene improvements. LA County restaurants receive numeric scores during unannounced hygiene inspections and then post letter grades in their windows based on broad intervals to which their inspection scores belong. This letter-grade system generates: relatively weak incentives for hygiene improvement at letter-grade thresholds, and relatively strong incentives for score manipulation below those thresholds. Using over 140,000 LA County restaurant inspections spanning October 2014 to September 2016, I test for manipulation by exploiting a feature of the county's scoring criteria. The violation of most health codes carries a prescribed 1, 2, or 4-point deduction. However, there are eleven health code violations where, depending on severity, 2 or 4 points may be deducted. Even when compared with inspections exhibiting better overall hygiene quality, restaurants on the margin of a higher letter grade are 28-40% more likely to receive the lesser point deduction on these violations. Restaurants on the margin are significantly more likely to receive the lesser deduction across all eleven violation types. That, and other characteristics of the data, suggest that these results do not reflect restaurants electively bunching at letter-grade thresholds. I find that scores were manipulated to improve letter grades in as many as 5,921 inspections (4.2% of the sample, and 26.56% of inspections where scoring decisions had letter-grade implications).
K32|Ganga Action Plan(GAP): The Challenge of ‘Regulatory Quality’|The largest river basin of India, the Ganges (locally referred as Ganga) is one of the most important river systems in the world. It is home to almost one tenth of the world’s population. Billions of litres of sewage, industrial waste, thousands of animal and human corpses are also released into the river every day. Consequently, the Ganga Action Plan (GAP) was launched in 1985 for pollution abatement as a Federal and state sponsored scheme and till date, three phases have been implemented. Even after establishing numerous institutional arrangements under the GAP and investing billions of dollars there has been no major improvement in the Ganges river water quality, in fact it has further deteriorated. Clearly governmental intervention through pollution control policies, specifically regulation has failed miserably. Therefore, an attempt has been made to analyse empirically, the legal and institutional framework of the GAP using the transdisciplinary method ‘economic analysis of law’. The results reveal that the chief underlying reason for ineffective GAP regulations is lack of a well-defined legal basis.
K32|Региональные Схемы Рыночных Механизмов Регулирования Выбросов Парниковых Газов: Опыт И Перспективы<BR>[Regional Schemes of Market Mechanisms of Greenhouse Gases Emission: Experiences and Perspectives]|English. The article considers the problem of pollution and destruction of environment, especially the pollution of atmosphere. Within these, problems of the carbon concentration, i.e. greenhouse gases, are considered as one of the main results of the anthropogenic activities, and consequently one of the main causes of the global climate change. In the second half of the XX century many schemes for involving market mechanism in solving these problems were proposed. These efforts especially increased in the last decade of XX century and finally the Kyoto Protocol supported many flexible mechanisms, as a solution for these problems. In spite of all these efforts, during the first period of its implementation (2008–2012) the emissions of carbon were increased. Experiences with market, not only in this sector, leave the problem unresolved: is the market universal solution. Russian. В статье рассматриваются проблемы загрязнения и разрушения природной среды, особенно атмосферы. Следовательно, проблемы концентрации углерода, т.е. парниковых газов рассматриваются как одно из основных последствий антропогенной деятельности, а также одной из основных причин глобального изменения климата. Во второй половине 20-го века было предложено применение многих схем создания рыночних механизмов решения этих проблем. Несмотря на все эти усилия, в течение первого периода их осуществления (2008-2012 годы) выброс углерода вырос. Прошлый опыт, не только в этой области, оставляет открытым вопрос: является ли рынок универсальним решением.
K32|Ефекат Стакленика, Глобално Загревање И Кјотски Протокол<BR>[Greenhouse Effect, Global Warming and Kyoto Protocol]|Serbian. У раду се разматра проблем стакленичких гасова (СГ), и акције и механизми за смањење њихове емисије. Емисија таквих гасова, пре свега угљен-диоксида, сматра се за један од главних антропогених узрока раста концентрације угљеника у атмосфери, и последично глобалних климатских промена. Од времена Индустријске револуције емисија СГ у атмосферу достигла је 300 гигатона угљеника. Борба с атмосферским загађењем до сада је ишла у три правца: административно регулисање, систем економских механизама и формирање тржишних односа. У другој половини 20. века за решавање проблема предложене су многе шеме стварања тржишног механизма, који се сматра повољнијим у више праваца. Ти напори посебно су се увећали у последњој деценији 20. века, и најзад је Кјотски протокол 1997. године подржао неколико такозваних еластичних механизама: трговина квотама (квотирање и трговина), пројекти заједничког остваривања и механизми чистог развоја, који су били разрађени 2001. године у Маракешу. Али, без обзира на све те напоре, током првог периода њихове примене (2008–2012) емисије угљеника у атмосферу су порасле. Данас се светско тржиште угљеника креће ка развоју националних, регионалних и субрегионалних система регулисања, али уз очување међународног сегмента (системи ОКИК ОУН). Конференција у Дохи 2012. године допунила је и прецизирала услове у којима ће Стране Конвенције изграђивати своју климатску политику у следећим годинама. Водећа тенденција (пренос акцената на регионалне, субрегионалне и националне системе регулисања) је сачувана, али сачуван је и „кјотски” систем, који ће у новој етапи имати улогу прелазног на путу ка новом очекиваном глобалном споразуму. English. This article considers the problem of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and actions and mechanisms for its reduction. Emissions of the GHG are observed as one of the main anthropogenic causes of the increasing carbon concentration in the atmosphere, and consequently the global climate change. Until the Industrial Revolution, the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere amounted to 300 gigatonnes of carbon. The fight against atmosphere pollution goes in three directions: administrative regulations, a system of economic mechanisms and market relations building. In the second half of the XX century many schemes for involving the market mechanism in solving these problems were proposed. These efforts especially increased in the last decade of XX century and finally the Kyoto Protocol 1997 supported many flexible mechanisms (trade of quotas – cap and trade, joint implementation projects and clean development mechanisms), as a solution to these problems, which was explained in 2001 in Marrakesh. In spite of all these efforts, during the first period of its implementation (2008–2012) the emissions of carbon increased. Today, the world “carbon” market is moving to the development of national, regional and subregional regulation systems while keeping its international level (system UNFCCC). The Doha Conference held in 2012 precised the conditions upon which the convention parties would define its climate policies in the next years. The leading tendency (transition to regional, subregional and national regulation systems) was maintained, as well as the “Kyoto” system, which in the new stage would play a transitional role on the road to a new expected global agreement.
K32|A study on environmental infractions for Brazilian municipalities: a spatial dynamic panel approach|This paper presents novel evidence for environmental offenses in Brazil. IBAMA's strategy to deter violations is based on large operations and on decapitalizing offenders to signal its will to monitor and enforce the law. We want to answer the following questions: Do the sanctions applied by IBAMA, especially sanction charges, deter actual and potential offenders? Are there any spatial or temporal patterns affecting violations? We use data on offenses against flora and applied fines for Brazilian municipalities between 1998-2015. We contribute to the existing research by providing evidence for Brazil and by incorporating spatial controls in a dynamic panel approach to explain infractions against the environment. We develop and apply a Spatial LIML estimator that accounts for the endogeneity of sanction charges to estimate our panel models. Results show that there is a pedagogic deterrent effect associated with applied fine values. Sanction charges are important to discourage new offenses.
K32|Comparison of liability sharing rules for environmental damage: An experiment with different levels of solvency|Civil liability is the legal requirement to compensate victims when damage is caused. When two firms jointly cause environmental damage, their liability depends on the applicable liability rule and on the solvency level of each firm. Under non-joint liability, each injurer is liable for part of the damage up to its financial capacity. Under joint and several liability, if damages cannot be recovered from one in jurer for insolvency reasons, they are borne by the other one to the extent that it is solvent. We theoretically and experimentally investigate the impact of these two liability rules in terms of incentives to care, varying according to the degree of (in)solvency of each firm. We show that when there is (at least) one insolvent firm, non-joint liability leads to higher social welfare than joint and several liability, whereas the latter should be preferred in the presence of solvent firms only.
K32|The Externalities of a Deforestation Control Policy in Infant Health: Evidence from Brazil|The burning of forest releases a wide range of contaminants, some of which are known to be hazardous for health. Traditional estimates of the costs of deforestation rarely incorporate the health effects of pollution generated by deforestation. This paper provides the first estimates of the local externalities of deforestation in infant health. Our approach exploits a conservation policy that generated a sharp drop in deforestation across municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon. The core findings are that deforestation control policy led to reductions in the incidence of very low birth weight and extreme prematurity, especially for boys. Collectively, these findings provide additional justification for controlling deforestation.
K32|Exploring the Nexus between Certainty in Injury Compensation and Treatment Selection|We study how legal and financial incentives affect medical decisions. Using patient-level data, we identify the effect of a change in medical liability pressure exploiting the geographical distribution of hospitals across court districts, where some districts improve the certainty of expected damages per injury while others do not. As certainty increases, unnecessary c-sections increase by 20%. This increase is higher for hospitals with lower quality, farther from consumers associations, facing lower expected damages, and paid more per c-section. Combining the difference-in- difference with a regression discontinuity design, we show that the effect is already detectable in the short-run.
K32|Do Environmental Regulations Effect FDI Decisions? The Pollution Haven Hypothesis Revisited|In an attempt to verify the pollution haven hypothesis, this study investigates the impact of environmental regulations on foreign direct investment (FDI). We use Korean outward FDI data covering the manufacturing sector for 2009-15. The study not only considers the stringency but also the enforcement of environmental regulations when measuring the degree of the host country's environmental regulations. Since the pollution haven's effects indicate moving the polluting production stages from the home country to other (host) countries, we distinguish between investments in the 'production' part from that in the non-production part using location information about the host country. The main results of the estimation of a FDI model show that the stricter the regulations in host countries in Asia the lower the FDI both intensively and extensively to those countries. This supports the prevalence of the effects of pollution havens. However, before we separate the FDI into the production part, the effect of environmental regulations on FDI is hindered by the FDI in the non-production part. The results indicate that environmental regulations are determinants of FDI in the production part, while environmental regulations do not have a significant effect on FDI decisions when the entire FDI is considered.
K32|Joint Use of Liability and Regulation in Environmental Law|In this paper, we argue that the joint use of ex-ante regulation and ex-post liability rules is efficient when there are uncertainty surrounding causal investigations and regulatory myopia. As these conditions are generally met in environmental cases, we provide an explanation for the frequent coexistence of these two instruments to control activities that create a risk for the environment. Moreover, we suggest that a joint use of liability and regulation should more frequently be optimal at the European (Federal) level than at the Country (State) level.
K32|A comprehensive evaluation of the EU's biofuel policy: From biofuels to agrofuels|During a time in which the subject of climate change is deemed high on the list of priorities of many governments, it is important to assess to what extent policies in this field are achieving meaningful results. The link between energy usage and global warming is clear and today in the European Union the use of renewable resources is being promoted more than ever before. The move towards a renewables based economy has clear benefits over a fossil fuel based one with regards to climate change and the environment, however if the implementation of renewables is not monitored and regulated then this is not a given by any means. Of the renewable resources, bioenergy has a high level of importance in the EU. For this reason, this paper will make a comprehensive evaluation of the EU's biofuel policy in order to assess what the driving forces behind the regulation of this resource are, and how they affect to what extent it is successful or not. In order to do this, firstly the impacts of current EU bioenergy consumption will be assessed, to determine whether it is achieving the stated and desired climate goals or not. Findings will show that in fact the current formulation of Europe's Renewable Strategy creates pressure to meet binding targets for renewable usage and the resultant rapid increase in the demand for bioenergy has caused a number of negative social and ecological impacts to arise. Therefore in light of this, the current systems in place at the EU level meant to regulate the use of bioenergy and ensure it is implemented in a sustainable way will be critically analysed in order to find out how such negative impacts have been able to occur. The final section will then look into the driving forces responsible for regulation of this kind through a case study of Germany and Indonesia.
K32|The role of the Eastern member states in the European Union's energy and climate policy|The European Union has been prizing itself for being the global leader in terms of climate change; its triptych approach and the 20-20-20 targets were certainly an enviable effort prior to the United Nations Convention. However, with the economic crisis having left its mark, there has been a decrease in ambitiousness and the paradigm is now dominated by competitiveness. The 2014 energy and climate package and its 2030 targets were therefore not only comparably unambitious but also nonbinding, with only GHG emission reduction being set. With the eastern countries traditionally being not very fond of climate policies, the thesis especially concentrates on where Poland and its coal-based energy system have stood as things developed and therefore assesses the role the country and the broader Visegrad Group had. Asking questions that get at the underlying reasons, the liberal intergovernmental framework is chosen to analyze how domestic preference building in Poland takes place, finding that the conventional energy sector has a tremendous impact on policy making. While Poland absorbed the directives to fit them into existing practices, without causing substantial structural changes, it applied a much more aggressive approach in the run up to the 2030 process, sending clear signals and thereby significantly contributing to the lowered ambitiousness of EU policies. Stemming not exclusively from a turn in the international environment, the learning process of the eastern Member States in the post-accession period played a decisive role in this development.
K32|Accidents caused by kerosene lamps: New evidence from African household data|The use of kerosene for lighting, cooking, and heating in developing countries is often considered a major health threat as it can cause accidents like thermal injuries, poisonings, fires or explosions. A number of hospital surveys emphasize this threat but evidence from household data is extremely scarce and mostly outdated. The present paper is one of the first to investigate the link between kerosene-based lighting and accidents at the household level. We use survey data from 3,326 non-electrified households in Burkina Faso, Rwanda, Senegal, and Zambia and observe very heterogeneous kerosene lamp usage rates. In some regions, accidents with kerosene lamps occur in a substantial share of the population, but the absolute incidence is rather low.
K32|The causal effect of wrong-hand drive vehicles on road safety|Left-hand drive (LHD) vehicles share higher road accident risks under left-hand traffic because of blind spot areas. Due to low import prices, the number of wrong-hand drive vehicles skyrockets in emerging countries like Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and Russia. I identify the causal effect of wrong-hand drive vehicles on road safety employing a new “backward version” of the synthetic control method. Sweden switched from left-hand to right-hand traffic in 1967. Before 1967, however, almost all Swedish vehicles were LHD for reasons of international trade and Swedish customer demand. I match on accident figures in the period after 1967, when both Sweden and other European countries drove on the right and used LHD vehicles. Results show that right-hand traffic decreased road fatality, injury and accident risk in Sweden by approximately 30%. An earlier switch would have saved more than 4000 lives between 1953 and 1966.
K32|A resolution of emissions-estimate confusion for informing flight choice|Air transport Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions estimates differ greatly, depending on the calculation method employed. Among the IPCC, ICAO, DEFRA, and BrighterPlanet calculation methods, the largest estimate may be up to 4.5 times larger than the smallest. Such heterogeneity -- and ambiguity over the true estimate -- confuses the consumer, undermining the credibility of emissions estimates in general. Consequently, GHG emissions estimates do not currently appear on the front page of flight search-engine results. Even where there are differences between alternative flights' emissions, this information is unavailable to consumers at the point of choice. When external considerations rule out alternative travel-modes, the relative ranking of flight options' GHG emissions is sufficient to inform consumers' decision making. Whereas widespread agreement on a gold standard remains elusive, the present study shows that the principal GHG emissions calculation methods produce consistent rankings within specific route-structure classes. Hence, for many consumers, the question of which calculation method to employ is largely irrelevant. But unless GHG emissions information is displayed at the point of decision, it cannot enter into consumers' decision making. A credible and ambiguity-free alternative would thus be to display GHG ranking information on the front page of flight search-engine results.

K32|Bayesian Learning and Regulatory Deterrence: Evidence from Oil and Gas Production|This paper proposes a Bayesian learning model of regulatory enforcement. Firms exert compliance effort based on their belief about a regulator's effort level. Firms use regulatory actions to learn about the regulator and update their own compliance efforts accordingly. This theoretical model suggests that deterrence will be most effective when regulators have discretion or when firms are inexperienced. Econometric analysis of inspections of Pennsylvania oil and gas wells supports these hypothesis. This work provides a causal mechanism for the commonly observed phenomenon of general deterrence in which regulatory actions towards one firm lead other fims to increase their own compliance.
K32|Coasean Bargaining to Address Environmental Externalities|I examine Ronald Coase’s criticism of standard regulatory and tax policies to address environmental externalities. I elaborate some of Coase’s key points and discuss opportunities for Coasean exchange as an alternative mitigation approach. Regulation, tax, and Coasean exchange, such as through cap-and-trade regimes, are presented as substitutes, based on the relative transaction costs involved. Transaction costs are those of information, bounding, enforcing, and exchanging property rights. In general, transaction costs are not examined in depth in the environmental economics literature. This is particularly the case for the costs of political bargaining and lobbying that arise from implementing and administering government regulation and tax policies, although these costs have received somewhat more attention with cap and trade regimes. Coasean exchange and important market design issues are illustrated with examples.
K32|The Over Time Impacts Of Smoke Free Air Ordinances In Texas|We examine an untested hypothesis that posits that null results in early studies examining the economic impacts of smoking bans were driven by sample selection. Early adopters could better absorb the shock of bans, but among worse selected late adopters bans would adversely impact bars and restaurants. We exploit variation in the timing of ban institution among Texas municipalities and track their impact over time. We find similar adjustments trajectories between late and early adopters, but late adopters appear unaffected by bans in the long-term. Consistent with earlier studies, bans do not significantly affect bar and restaurant sales or establishment level alcohol tax expenditures.
K32|Direct-to-Consumer Advertising and Online Search|Beginning in 1997, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed television advertisements to make major statements about a prescription drug, while referring to detailed drug information on the internet (FDA 1997; 2015). The hope was that consumers would seek additional information online to fully understand the risks and benefits of taking the medication. To better understand the effects of the policy, we analyze direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) and search engine click-through data on a set of drugs over a three-year period. Regression analysis shows that advertising on a prescription drug serves to increase the frequency of online search and subsequent clicks for that drug, as well as search for other drugs in the same class. We find the relationship between DTCA and search is stronger for younger drugs, for those drugs that treat acute conditions, those drugs that are less likely to be covered by insurance, and those whose searcher population tends to be older. These findings suggest that DTCA motivates consumers to search online for drug information, but the magnitude of the effect is heterogeneous and potentially associated with clicks on websites that are more promotional in nature.
K32|Efficiency-Morality Trade-Offs in Repugnant Transactions: A Choice Experiment|Societies prohibit many transactions considered morally repugnant, although potentially efficiency-enhancing. We conducted an online choice experiment to characterize preferences for the morality and efficiency of payments to kidney donors. Preferences were heterogeneous, ranging from deontological to strongly consequentialist; the median respondent would support payments by a public agency if they increased the annual kidney supply by six percentage points, and private transactions for a thirty percentage-point increase. Fairness concerns drive this difference. Our findings suggest that cost-benefit considerations affect the acceptance of morally controversial transactions, and imply that trial studies of the effects of payments would inform the public debate.
K32|Incentives and Ethics in the Economics of Body Parts|Research shows that properly devised economic incentives increase the supply of blood without hampering its safety; similar effects may be expected also for other body parts such as bone marrow and organs. These positive effects alone, however, do not necessarily justify the introduction of payments for supplying body parts; these activities concern contested commodities or repugnant transactions, i.e. societies may want to prevent certain ways to regulate a transaction even if they increased supply, because of ethical concerns. When transactions concern contested commodities, therefore, societies often face trade-offs between the efficiency-enhancing effects of trades mediated by a monetary price, and the moral opposition to the provision of these payments. In this essay, I first describe and discuss the current debate on the role of moral repugnance in controversial markets, with a focus on markets for organs, tissues, blood and plasma. I then report on recent studies focused on understanding the trade-offs that individuals face when forming their opinions about how a society should organize certain transactions.
K32|Crises, Human Rights and Legal Challenges|The purpose of this study is to ponder on – and provide assistance in tackling – the latest challenges affecting individual lives and human rights. The three most severe crises of our days are global-scale social inequality; declining populations in rich economies and overpopulation in poor countries; and the threat of a climate change disaster. These three crises aggravate each other, and their negative effects combine and materialise concurrently. The key question is how social sciences – especially economics and legal sciences – respond to the symptoms of these crises and whether they can offer an accurate diagnosis or recommend a possible therapy. Do they need to exercise self-criticism and bring their scientific truths more in line with reality? It is crucial to seek answers to these questions for the sake of sustainability and future generations.
K32|Importance Of Ethics And Responsibility In Health Services In Serbia|"The health care system should be seen as the foundation of human society. Laws and ethics of health care substantially coincide. Important role in the struggle against negative phenomenon in Serbia have also numerous ethical codes of healthcare personnel in our country. There are: Code of Professional Ethics of the Serbian Medical Association (”Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia“, no. 121/2007), the Ethical Code of Dental Doctors (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia“, no. 14/2008), The Ethical Code of Pharmacists of Serbia (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia“, no. 6/2007), Ethical Code of the Serbian Association of Nurses and Medical Technicians (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia“, no. 67/2007). The basic ethical principles in performing professional duties and the rules of conduct of their members are established, with aim to preserve reputation and dignity of the health service. The basic principle of all modern legal systems is integrity. Patient safety is dependent on the independence of doctors who decide on their treatment. Respect of personal integrity and the principle of good faith should be a measure of treatment in all matters, and the behavior of health workers should reflect concern for the welfare, dignity and health of each individual. In Rome in 2002 the European Charter of Patients' Rights known as the ""Rome Charter"" was created, and that was ratified in Brussels in November the same year, and thus became the basic document for healthcare reform in the countries of the European Union."
K32|Professional Experience Of Clinical Studies On Patients With Diseases Representing Public Health Problems (Diabetes Mellitus And Hypertension)|Diabetes mellitus and hypertension represent major health care problems worldwide. Most diabetic patients present associated pathology, especially cardiovascular complications. Enrollment of them for clinical studies is crucial, providing useful new information for investigation and treatment. Purpose: This work focused on attitude of patients selected for trials and the knowledge of them and their physicians regarding medical ethics. Materials, methods: Information regarding the patients were obtained during presentation of the study protocol and discussing about their consent. Data regarding the physicians were collected directly during an interview by the main investigator. Results: Studies were carried out between October 2013 - July 2016, the average age of patients was over 60 years. Patients from urban areas requested more detailed information about the study compared to rural subjects. The rejection rate for enrollment was low. Doctors having previous experience with trials were aware of medical laws and ethical standards, other physisians were not so well informed, but didn’t disagree with our studies. All of them requested for the laboratory results of their enrolled patients. Conclusions: Subjects had generally positive attitude for enrollment to trials, all physicians appreciated our effort and were willing to use the results for the benefit of their patients.
K32|The Development Of The Emissions Trading Scheme And Of Its Regulation|Nowadays the role of the environmental protection is increasingly becoming one of the main topics in the politics and the economic instruments, in particular the emission trading systems have key role in the regulation. The aim of the study is to point out the importance of the economic instruments in the system. The study analyses the historical background and the various methods of the field of the market of the pollution rights. The emission trading system of the European Union has a particular importance, it became a reference model to the other countries all around the world. The study presents the system of the EU as well the the countries adopted the EU’s system. The functioning of the emission trading systems arre not without problems, the aim of the authors is to highlight these relating problems too. These problems are for example the participation, the distribution of the pollution rights and the use of incomes. It is clear that the emission trading systems have to face with several difficulties, but this system can be a solution for the environmental problems.
K32|E-waste management as a global Challenge (introductory chapter)|Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment management (E-waste or WEEE) is a crucial issue in the solid waste management sector with global interconnections between well-developed, transitional and developing countries. Consumption society and addiction to technology dictate the daily life in high and middle-income countries where population consumes large amounts of EEE products (electrical and electronic equipment) which sooner become e-waste. This fraction is a fast-growing waste stream which needs special treatment and management due to the toxic potential of public health and environment. On the other hand, the e-waste contains valuable materials which may be recovered (precious metals, Cu) reused and recycled (metals, plastics) by various industries mitigating the consumption of natural resources.

K32|Assessment of biowaste losses through unsound waste management practices in rural areas and the role of home composting|The paper examines the biowaste management issues across rural areas of Romania in the context of poor waste management infrastructure in the last decade (2003-2012). Biowaste is the main fraction of municipal waste, thus a proper management is a key challenge in order to sustain a bioeconomy in the near future. The amount of biowaste generated and uncollected by waste operators is generally uncontrolled disposed if not recovered through home composting. The paper points out the role of home composting in diverting the biowaste from wild dumps and landfills for the regions covered or not by waste collection services. Home composting and the biowaste losses are further assessed based on several scenarios (worse-case, pessimistic, realistic, optimistic) where the net loads of greenhouse gasses (GHG) are calculated at national and regional levels. The transition of home composting techniques, from open piles to plastic bins with respect to standard guidelines will improve the home composting performance in terms of compost quality and net GHG’s savings, supporting a bio-based economy which will lead towards a sustainable rural development. Regional disparities are revealed across Romanian counties and the paper opens new research perspectives regarding which options should be adopted by counties and rural municipalities in the biowaste management process.
K32|Complementary Health Insurance in France, the “Mutuelle” Institute and Its Terminology|The aim of the paper is to characterise the system of social insurance in France and to show the role of combined social and health care insurance companies called “mutuelles” in the framework of compulsory complementary health insurance in France. Historical roots of this non-profit organisation based on a system of solidarity, participation in expenses and management are mentioned, a wide range of coverage of health care as well as the way of reimbursement of expenses for care provided for their members are described, and its future prospects are outlined. The paper tries to point out the differences in terminology and content as there are analogical institutions with a different role or only partial content equivalence besides specific legal institutions. This relates to different social traditions in the given communities during their development. The goal is to bring operation of French institutions closer to the Czech legal system.
K32|Towards Sustainable Building: Case Study on Romania|The purpose of this article is to analyze the actual situation of the green buildings in our country but also the degree in which the real estate developers are involved in such projects. The study was conducted by combining a wide variety of sources, such as regulations, position papers, as well as articles and research reports. The results of the research show that the market for green buildings in Romania is at an early stage of development however, there are prerequisites for its development. In the future, green building will become the standard in the construction industry.
K32|Économie politique des services écosystémiques : de l’analyse économique aux évolutions juridiques|Ecosystem services progressively became the standard concept of renewed discourses and debates on sustainability. The paper suggests some institutionalist arguments for a critical assessment of the scientific and political processes which led to proclaimed changes within the mainstream framework. We focus on the interactions between theoretical arguments and institutional changes involved by the integration of ecosystem services within policy and law. The political economy of ecosystem services appeared to be dual: on the one hand it could be a seminal framework to implement new strategies to overcome the failures of our development models; but, on the other hand, the strength of epistemological principles inherited from mainstream economics could enforce the processes of commodification through radical changes concerning the Humans and Nature relationships. The demonstration originally integrates law and economics to encompass the different aspects of the institutional changes.

The paper is devoted to the current state and the problems of formation of the fnancial mechanism of environmental protection. The authors identifed main sources of costs for environmental purposes and analyzed the trend of reducing the fscal costs of environmental protection. Particular emphasis is placed on the legal aspects of the use of payments for negative impact on the environment, including the abandonment of the use of funds to the budget as the price of a negative impact on the environment. The reasons for the ineffcient use of budget funds allocated for environmental purposes are analyzed. The importance of environmental funds in the fnancing of environmental activities is shown, It suggested to restore this element of the fnancial mechanism of environmental regulation in Russia. The importance of programmer – oriented approach to solving environmental problems is marked. The possible elements of the fnancial mechanism for the implementation of environmental protection measures are proposed. The main diffculties including stimulating effect in the economic mechanism of nature conservation and environmental protection are marked.
K32|Emerging Avenues Of Space And International Law|This paper will address legal approaches to a number of new ventures that will be carried out in outer space in the near future and that will likely require major changes to the way nations will approach space law. Today we tend to view activities in space from an individual program or project perspective and we tend to analyze the engineering, social, and legal issues very narrowly and separately for each proposed venture. However, four current government and commercial activities: active debris removal, satellite servicing, diverting near earth objects, and resource extraction and processing all raise similar major and unresolved legal issues. These issues should be considered together in a consistent, logical, and rational way, insuring that solutions are coordinated and uniform. All of these activities involve attaching to an orbiting natural or human object and then working on or with that object. Issues raised range from definitions to property rights to weaponization. All will require new approaches to regulatory areas such as safety, the environment, transparency, liability, indemnification, and dispute resolution. Our current legal system in space is oriented toward launch and satellite operations, not towards active private sector initiatives in space and on celestial bodies such as the Moon and asteroids. It is clear that a balance between governmental objectives and commercial assurances on financing and profits will have to be made. Similarly, the dual-use nature of space will have to balance national security with business risktaking. An ad hoc national or international legal regime will not serve any nation or company well. This paper will suggest ways to approach these required changes in international space law that will be evolutionary and consistent with the current space treaties and international law.
K32|Designing Tax Policy to Promote Agricultural Cooperatives and Environmental Protection in China|The Chinese government has among its critical policies two clear policy imperatives ? 1. to protect and improve its natural environment and 2. to encourage membership of agricultural cooperatives and ensure their development. On one hand, there can be a tension between these two objectives, as an increase in agricultural cooperatives could lead to greater environmental degradation through more damaging farming methods such as greater mechanisation and increased use of chemical fertilisers. On the other hand, there are potential synergies between the two goals as well-operated cooperatives can bring environmental benefits through such improvements as efficiencies of scale, more sophisticated farming practices and greater education on soil and water conservation. This paper examines, with a primary focus on tax policy, the Chinese government?s role in setting where the balance between these two potential outcomes ? tension or synergy - will ultimately fall. The paper describes the history of agricultural cooperatives in China and considers why the Chinese government would wish to encourage their development. It then, with a view to identifying what incentives the government might offer, considers what factors motivate farmers to join cooperatives. It considers the role of tax policies, drawing on case studies from three provinces at different stages of development for insights on the impact of local variations, and examines the recently introduced draft Environmental Tax Law and considers what part it could play in the role of agricultural cooperatives in environmental protection.
K32|Islamic conscious capitalism: a ‘Third Way’ in light of classical scripture|"The economic paradigm and framework advocated for in Islam is one that entails a unique combination of various socio–economic philosophies. This article advances the notion that Islam promotes a capitalistic economic model wrapped in its own garment of understanding—fashioned with threads of equity and stitched in patterns of benevolence and justice. This article examines the Islamic theological framework relating to the profit incentive and its spiritually–conscious methodology of capital procurement. The Qur’an contains around 370 references in regard to commerce, from which much of Islamic law relating to lending, banking and trading originates (Heck in Muhammad and the Arab roots of capitalism (Studien zur Geschichte und Kultur des Islamichen Orients)—Band 18. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, p 5, 85, 2006 ). This article intends to explore the potential that these teachings have for an Islamic ‘Third Way’ (i.e. an Islamic contribution to economic philosophy and discourse that is in-between of, or an alternative to, both the purely individualistic primary concerns on prices, profits, and private property inherent in ""pure"" capitalism, and the purely communal command economics of communism, which often negates or discourages the promotion of self-interests). Part I of this paper intends to introduce the reader to the various sources of Islamic ‘law’ and its scope. In doing so, the philosophical nature and objectives of the Shariah will become evident, through the exploration of specific theological economic teachings. Part II intends to study Islam’s theological attitude toward entrepreneurship and the profit incentive, as well as the concept of the potential for salvation through ethical profits. Part III explores, in light of classical Islamic scripture, the various prohibitions within the Islamic concept of the economy. In doing so, the paper shall explore how values and theories found in classical Islamic scripture have found contemporary application within the growing modern Islamic finance industry, for example, through Shariah ‘screens’ applied on market indicies, such as the Dow Jones Islamic Market Index. Part III shall also explore Islamic edicts with regards to business practices, as well as environmental ethics. In doing so, Part IV concludes that there can indeed be such an Islamic ‘Third Way’, drawn along similar shared values found amongst other world religions.

K32|Risk Beliefs and Preferences for E-cigarettes|Drawing on evidence from a new nationally representative survey, this article examines several measures of risk beliefs for e-cigarettes. For both lung cancer mortality risks and total smoking mortality risks, respondents believe that e-cigarettes pose risks that are lower than the risks of conventional tobacco cigarettes. However, people greatly overestimate the risk levels of e-cigarettes compared with the actual risk levels. Risk beliefs for conventional cigarettes receive at least a two-thirds informational weight in the formation of e-cigarette risk beliefs. Public perceptions of nicotine levels of e-cigarettes are closer to the beliefs for conventional cigarettes than are their health risk perceptions. Consumers’ desired uses of e-cigarettes are more strongly related to health risk perceptions than perceived e-cigarette nicotine levels. The overestimation of e-cigarette risks establishes a potential role for informational policies.
K32|The Efficiency of (strict) Liability Rules revised in Risk and Ambiguity|In this paper we revise the results about the efficiency of (strict) unlimited, then limited liability in inducing optimal investment in prevention by injurers. Risk and ambiguity are considered. We assume that the potential injurer whose activities cause a risk of environmental accident can reduce the probability of accident by investing in prevention. In the risky model, we recover that limited liability does not always induce low prevention. Contrary to the arguments enhanced by Beard (1990) and Lipowski-Posey (1993), outside lending, absent from our model, does not explain this result. In the ambiguous context, we implement the Non-Extreme Outcome (NEO) expected utility model (Chateauneuf et al., 2007) to represent the injurer’s beliefs and decisions. When ambiguity matters and prevention also affects the injurer’s subjective beliefs, none of the results with risk hold. In particular, the injurer can overinvest in prevention under both unlimited and limited liability.
K32|Challenges in achieving the Sustainable Development Goal on good health and well-being: global governance as an issue for the means of implementation|To formulate health development policy and strategies aimed at the Sustainable Development Goal 3, which seeks to ensuring health and well-being for all, it is indispensable to revisit the issue of global health governance in the wake of the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa. The issue of global health governance is also relevant in the Asia- Pacific region, where Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), influenza A (H1N1) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were health security threats. The failure to respond timely and effectively to the health crisis was derived from a few factors that are relevant to the means of implementation necessary to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. During ordinary times, efforts to enhance health systems should include building the core capacities of the International Health Regulations (IHR), which should be supported not only by the World Health Organization (WHO), but also through coordination among diverse multilateral and bilateral organizations as part of their health development cooperation programmes associated with achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. To enhance preparedness for handling health crises, the organizational capacities of WHO and its regional offices need to be strengthened. In addition, coordination among WHO and other actors should be facilitated in accordance with the situational categories based on the combination of (a) the capacity of the country where an outbreak of an infectious disease is occurring and (b) the severity and magnitude of that infectious disease.
K32|"The ""Flock"" Phenomenon of the Sydney Lockout Laws: Dual Effects on Rental Prices"|Geographically targeted crime control is a controversial attempt to alleviate crime by targeting “hot spots”, which risks the potential displacement of crime into bordering areas. The 2014 Sydney lockout laws have severely decreased the nightlife economy in the once bustling entertainment district of the CBD, and there have been reports of increased violence in displacement, or “flock”, areas. These laws have also displaced attractive nightlife entertainment hubs into neighbouring suburbs, which may contribute to the land value of the displacement areas. To address the paucity of empirical evidence for the displacement effect of geographical alcohol regulations, this paper investigates the effect of the Sydney lockout laws on rental prices in the displacement areas. We find differential “flock effects”: a negative effect on small dwellings and a positive effect on large dwellings. The former effect is relatively weak and short-lived, while the latter is persistent, indicating that the positive effect dominates in the long run. We speculate that the differential effect arises because of difference in the locations of small and large dwellings. Our results suggest that well-designed geographically targeted alcohol control can enhance social welfare not only in targeted areas but also in surrounding areas.
K32|High times: The effect of medical marijuana laws on student time use|Medical marijuana laws (MMLs) represent a major change of marijuana policy in the U.S. Previous research shows that these laws increase marijuana use among adults. In this paper, we estimate the effects of MMLs on secondary and post-secondary students’ time use using data from the American Time Use Survey. We apply a difference-in-differences research design and estimate flexible fixed effects models that condition on state fixed effects and state-specific time trends. We find no effect of MMLs on secondary students’ time use. However, we find that college students in MML states spend approximately 20% less time on education-related activities and 20% more time on leisure activities than their counterparts in non-MML states. These behavioral responses largely occur during weekends and summer when students have more spare time. Finally, the impacts of MMLs are heterogeneous and stronger among part-time college students, who are more likely to be first-generation college goers and to come from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.
K32|Breaking The Link Between Legal Access To Alcohol And Motor Vehicle Accidents: Evidence From New South Wales|A large literature has documented signi cant public health bene ts associated with the minimum legal drinking age in the United States, particularly because of the resulting e ects on motor vehicle accidents. These bene ts form the primary basis for continued e orts to restrict youth access to alcohol. It is important to keep in mind, though, that policymakers have a wide variety of alcohol-control options available to them, and understanding how these policies may complement or substitute for one another can improve policy making moving forward. Towards this end, we propose that investigating the causal e ects of the minimum legal drinking age in New South Wales, Australia provides a particularly informative case study, because Australian states are among the world leaders in their e orts against drunk driving. Using an age-based regression-discontinuity design applied to restricted-use data from several sources, we nd no evidence that legal access to alcohol has e ects on motor vehicle accidents of any type in New South Wales, despite having large e ects on drinking and on hospitalizations due to alcohol abuse.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

K32|Do smoking bans always hurt the gaming industry? Differentiated impacts on the market value of casino firms in Macao (China)|The gaming economy has expanded rapidly in East Asia during the past decade. Despite the public health hazards of Second Hand Smoking (SHS), smoking bans in casinos remain controversial due to concerns over potential economic losses for casino firms. Applying an event study method, the authors examine the abnormal returns of casino stocks in response to three unexpected announcements of smoking bans in casinos from 2011 to 2015 in Macao. The analysis reveals that the announcements were associated with differentiated abnormal returns of casino stocks. The stocks of the traditional casinos in Macao suffered significant cumulative abnormal losses of 1% to 6%, while the Las Vegas themed casinos in Macao enjoyed significant cumulative abnormal excess returns of 1.4% to 4.8%. Furthermore, the authors find that the low air quality in gaming venues and high dependence on gaming revenues are associated with abnormal losses, while positive management initiatives are significant correlated with positive abnormal returns. This study provides a full picture of the impacts of smoking bans on casinos and will thus be a useful policy reference for the Macao government, as well as for the rapidly growing gaming industry in Asia and other developing economies.

K32|Truth-telling and the regulator: Evidence from a field experiment with commercial fishermen|Understanding what determines the extent to which economic agents tell the truth to their regulating authority is of major economic importance, from banking to environmental protection. To this end, we examine truth-telling of German commercial fishermen in an artefactual field experiment. Their regulator, the European Union (EU), has recently enacted a ban on discarding unwanted fish catches to the sea, without yet increasing monitoring activities. The regulator thus depends on fishermen's truth-telling, while standard economic theory predicts substantial self-serving dishonesty. Using a coin- tossing task, we test whether truth-telling in a baseline setting differs from behavior in two treatments that exploit fishermen's widespread ill-regard of the EU. We find that fishermen misreport coin tosses to their advantage, albeit to a lesser extent than standard theory predicts. Misreporting is stronger among fishermen in a treatment where they are faced with the EU flag, suggesting that lying towards their ill-regarded regulator is more substantial. Yet, some fishermen are more honest in a control treatment where the source of EU research funding is revealed additionally. Our findings imply that regulators can influence truth-telling behavior by means of their regulatory approaches and communication strategies.
K32|"""GMO"" maize and public health. A little case of Schumpeterian policy in the EU"| EU lawmakers have been successfully struggling for a quarter of a century to refuse the cultivation of “Genetically Modified Organisms” on the Old Continent. A clear example is given by the revision of the accepted level of contaminants in maize: rather than admitting that Bt maize is safer than “non-GMO” varieties, and therefore European farmers should be allowed not only to import it, but also to produce it, politicians have raised the threshold of the poisonous fumonisins that may be legally present in food and feed. This decision is an example of a “Schumpeterian” approach to policy, where public choices are not inspired by a science-based mind-set, but are substantially dictated by a calculus of consent: most probably, EU politicians reckoned that an adjustment of the legal level of food poison would have cost them less than the possible outrage deriving from encouraging “GMO” cultivation.
K32|Sea Level Rise, Radical Uncertainties and Decision-Maker’s Liability: The European Coastal Airports Case|Until now, most of the growing climate legal litigations mainly concern environmental associations or victims against energy of energy-users firms or States. However, in a near future, because of exacerbating sudden floods linked to climate change, future litigations could (will) concern infrastructure governance versus private companies. Indeed, sues would (will) concern the financial losses these last ones would (will) endure because the infrastructure managers did not made convenient protection choices in due time. This paper particularly investigates the case of coastal airports at the European level. It insists on the importance of climate scientists divergent opinions about the sea level rise and its consequences for decision-takers concerning their potential legal liability for negligence.
K32|A Valuable Natural Area As A Place For Implementing Innovative Health Forms Of Tourism – Forest Therapy| Subject and purpose of work: The focus of the present study are valuable natural areas, and its purpose is to present the beneficial effects of the forest environment in these areas on the human body. Materials and methods: The study has analysed the results of research by various, mainly foreign, authors concerning the treatment of the forest environment in Poland referred to as “forest therapy”, “sylwotherapy.” Results : Research has shown that being in a forest environment helps to preserve mental balance, strengthens the immune system and stimulates organism’s regeneration. Differences in the impact of different types of forests were also observed. Pine forests calm down, lower blood pressure and help the respiratory system. Broadleaved forests stimulate, improve mood and enhance the ability to concentrate by affecting various aspects of human life. Conclusion : The results of the analyses show that in Poland the interest in forest therapy could be another form of raising public awareness by informing people how important is the role of the forest, not only in nature but also for human health.-----Przedmiot i cel pracy: Przedmiotem pracy są obszary przyrodniczo cenne, a celem zaprezentowanie korzystnego działania środowiska leśnego tych obszarów na organizm człowieka. Materiały i metody: W pracy przeanalizowano wyniki badań różnych autorów, głównie obcojęzycznych, dotyczących leczenia środowiskiem leśnym, w Polsce zwanym lasoterapią, sylwoterapią. Wyniki : Badania udowodniły, że przebywanie w środowisku leśnym pozwala zachować równowagę psychiczną, wzmacnia układ odpornościowy i pobudza organizm do odnowy. Zaobserwowano również różnice w oddziaływaniu poszczególnych typów lasów. Bory sosnowe działają uspokajająco, obniżają ciśnienie i wspomagają układ oddechowy. Liściaste grądy działają pobudzająco, poprawiają nastrój i wspomagają zdolność koncentracji oddziałując na różne aspekty życia człowieka. Wnioski : Wyniki analiz ukazują, iż w Polsce, zainteresowanie lasoterapii mogłoby stanowić kolejną formę dotarcia do świadomości społeczeństwa z informacjami, jak ważną rolę pełni las, nie tylko w przyrodzie, ale także dla zdrowia człowieka.
K32|Bio-ethical principles of medical law with an emphasis on the law of Iran|There has been many talks about the necessity of ethics in all affairs, especially medical affairs which deal with the lives of individuals and the society expects Medical Group to be abide by morals more than laws. This matter indicates on the fact that the society considers ethics as a stronger enforcement of the law and deplores a doctor who has ignored ethics in the medical profession. Thus, they blamed the doctor from ethical aspect more than deploring him from a legal aspect (civil or criminal liability). The legislator is also influenced by public in anticipation of responsibility (both criminal and civil) for doctors and imposes legal rules on this basis. The concept of this article has an extremely close relationship with three concepts of morality, professional ethics and law. Initially first two concepts will be defined and separated and then the relation between professional ethics and medical laws will be expressed. Then, the relation between two concepts of medical ethics and bioethics ethics will be evaluated. Two religion or secularism basis have been taken for medical rights and strengths and weaknesses of each are discussed and the approach of the Iranian legal system will also be mentioned with evaluation of controversial medical samples.
K32|Investigating possession of human blood as a property in Iran’s law with regard to legal and Islamic jurisprudential commentaries on organ transplant|A question that most of jurists are faced with is, whether human blood is basically a property or not and is human the owner of his blood? Moreover, what is the difference between blood and other organs of the body from the viewpoint of ownership? If blood is a property, why human is not the owner? Unlike blood, there have been legal discussions on organ sale, where blood can be retrieved by the body while segregated organs are not retrievable by the body. Investigating various views about ownership of organs of the body, one can conclude that blood is a property owned by humans.
K32|Youth Response to State Cyberbullying Laws|Cyberbullying is a large social concern among youth in the US. This is the first empirical study to examine how high-school teenagers respond to cyberbullying laws that require schools to enact effective guidelines to reduce cyberbullying. The analysis utilizes nationally representative samples of high-school students from Youth Risk Behavior Surveys and incorporates state and time variation in the implementation of cyberbullying laws to estimate the causal impacts of the law in a difference-in-differences framework. Key results indicate that adoption of cyberbullying law is related to statistically significant increases in the likelihood that students report experiences of being victimized by various forms of school violence. Further empirical tests reveal (to some degree) that the state laws are potentiallymore likely to promote victims’ reporting of school violence/ cyberbullying victimization experiences. Finally, evaluation of important components of the state laws indicate that compared to other legislative provisions, criminal sanctions are more likely to increase victims’ reporting of school violence victimization. The regression estimates are robust to the inclusion of multiple sensitivity checks.
K32|Securing Property Rights|A central challenge in securing property rights is the subversion of justice through legal skill, bribery, or physical force by the strong?the state or its powerful citizens?against the weak. We present evidence that the less educated and poorer citizens in many countries feel their property rights are least secure. We then present a model of a farmer and a mine which can pollute his farm in a jurisdiction where the mine can subvert law enforcement. We show that, in this model, injunctions or other forms of property rules work better than compensation for damage or liability rules. The equivalences of the Coase Theorem break down in realistic ways. The case for injunctions is even stronger when parties can invest in power. Our approach sheds light on several controversies in law and economics, but also applies to practical problems in developing countries, such as low demand for formality, law enforcement under uncertain property rights, and unresolved conflicts between environmental damage and development.
K32|Do Constitutions Matter? The Effects of Constitutional Environmental Rights Provisions on Environmental Outcomes|We use a novel data set within an instrumental variables framework to test whether the presence and legal strength of constitutional environmental rights are related to environmental outcomes. The outcome variables include Yale’s Environmental Performance Index and some of its components. The analysis accounts for the possibility that a country which takes steps to protect the environment might also be more likely to constitutionalize environmental rights. Controls include: (1) gross domestic product per capita (2) whether the country is a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights; (3) rule of law; (4) population density; and (5) exogenous geographic effects. The inclusion of income means that our study is directly related to the Environmental Kuznets Curve literature. We find that constitutions do indeed matter for positive environmental outcomes, which suggests that we should not only pay attention to the incentives confronting polluters and resource users, but also to the incentives and constraints confronting those policymakers who initiate, monitor, and enforce environmental policies.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K32|Regulations to Supplement Weak Environmental Liability|Liability for environmental harm is often capped when precaution meets a minimum requirement and is often applied in conjunction with regulations. The correct setting for such regulations depends on the approach that courts take to evaluating the minimum requirement. It may also depend on which of the minimum requirement and capped liability is the more pressing consideration for the firm. Regulatory design is more straightforward when it is capped liability that is more pressing.
K32|Assessing Risk Attitude: The Benefits of Pooling Measures|In Germany and many other countries, financial advisors are required by law to assess their clients’ risk preferences in order to help them make informed and appropriate investment decisions. Most institutions that provide financial advice - banks, for instance - carry out this assessment using just one type of risk measure. Financial advisors might ask clients to answer a question about their attitudes towards risk, for example, or to choose one option among several more or less risky alternatives. Our study finds, however, that employing only one type of risk measure may result in an inaccurate assessment of risk aversion - and if the underlying information is unreliable, the corresponding investment decision will also be flawed. Based on empirical data comprising an unusually broad set of seven different risk measures, we suggest a more robust risk assessment model that combines various methods. Since our results indicate that these multiple-item risk measures usually outperform single-item measures, we recommend combining two or even three items to obtain more reliable risk attitude profiles. A higher level of accuracy could in turn lead to better investment advice.
K32|Hospital-Level Policy Can Affect Physician Behavior and Reduce C-Section Rates|The past few decades have seen a considerable increase in caesarean section rates, which have now reached unprecedented levels. Concerns have been raised about the possibility of medically unnecessary procedures having negative consequences for mothers and infants (WHO, 2015). The aim of this report is to show that a properly implemented hospital-level policy may be a powerful tool for reducing the rates of unnecessary C-sections without inflicting harm on mothers or newborns. Reducing the rates of unnecessary procedures helps lower the excessive healthcare costs that present a major concern for public policy. This report analyzes the implications of a 2005 reform introduced in the Italian region of Piedmont that increased malpractice pressure and reduced C-section rates. Empirical evidence indicates that this reform led to a 2.3 percentage point (approximately seven percent at the mean of C-sections) reduction in the use of C-sections in treated hospitals. This suggests that physicians will also alter their behavior in response to hospital-level policies - even though such policies do not directly influence individual insurance liability. Presuming that C-section rates in Germany are partially influenced by economic and legal incentives, the Italian findings imply that increased malpractice pressure may also reduce the C-section rates in Germany, which currently exceed 30 percent - a share that is ten points higher than it was in the early 2000s. Should Germany implement a similar reform to the one introduced in Piedmont, one might expect positive effects in terms of reducing healthcare costs without affecting healthcare outcomes. This expectation presumes that there are a sufficient number of practitioners who can competently assist in a natural delivery.

Die Kaiserschnittrate ist in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten stark gestiegen: Heute werden weltweit mehr Kinder per Kaiserschnitt entbunden als je zuvor. Zunehmend werden Bedenken laut, dass sich medizinisch unnötige Eingriffe negativ auf die Gesundheit von Müttern und Kindern auswirken könnten (WHO, 2015). Der vorliegende Bericht zeigt, dass eine richtig implementierte Haftpflichtregelung auf Krankenhausebene ein wirksames Instrument sein kann, um die Rate unnötiger Kaiserschnitte zu senken, ohne dabei Müttern und Neugeborenen zu schaden. Wenn unnötige Eingriffe reduziert werden, senkt das die hohen Gesundheitskosten, was ein zentrales gesundheitspolitisches Ziel ist. In diesem Beitrag werden die Implikationen einer im Jahr 2005 im italienischen Piemont eingeführten Reform diskutiert, die den Haftungsdruck bei Behandlungsfehlern erhöhte und damit die Kaiserschnittrate senkte. Empirische Befunde zeigen, dass die Kaiserschnittrate durch diese Reform um 2,3 Prozentpunkte abnahm. Dies deutet darauf hin, dass Ärzte und Ärztinnen ihr Verhalten auch als Reaktion auf Regelungen auf Krankenhausebene ändern – selbst wenn sich diese nicht unmittelbar auf ihre persönliche Haftpflicht auswirken. Es ist davon auszugehen, dass auch die hohe Kaiserschnittrate in Deutschland teils durch ökonomische und rechtliche Anreize beeinflusst ist. Die Befunde aus Italien implizieren, dass ein erhöhter Haftungsdruck auch in Deutschland die Rate senken könnte, die aktuell bei über 30 Prozent und damit um zehn Punkte höher liegt als zu Beginn der 2000er Jahre. Sollte hiereine ähnliche Reform eingeführt werden wie in Italien, dürfte sich das positiv auf die hohen Gesundheitskosten auswirken, ohne negative gesundheitliche Folgen für die Betroffenen. Ein positiver Effekt setzt voraus, dass es ausreichend viele Geburtshelferinnen und -helfer gibt, die eine natürliche Entbindung kompetent begleiten können.
K32|U.S. Child Safety Seat Laws: Are they Effective, and Who Complies?| This paper assesses the effectiveness of child safety seat laws in the United States. Over the past 35 years, these laws have steadily increased mandatory child safety seat restraint ages. We exploit state‐year level variation in the age until which children are required to ride in child safety seats to estimate triple difference models using Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data from 1975 to 2011. Our findings show that increasing the age thresholds is effective in increasing the actual age of children in safety seats. Across the child‐age distribution, restraint rates increase by between 10 and 30 percentage points or by between 50 and 170 percent, in the long run. We also estimate the impact of the child safety seat laws on the likelihood that a child dies in a fatal accident. We find that the laws saved up to 39 children per year. Finally, we find that the laws primarily induce compliant parents to switch from traditional seatbelt use to child safety seat use, with only small effects among parents who do not restrain their children.
K32|Balancing Free Movement and Public Health: The Case of Minimum Unit Pricing of Alcohol in Scotch Whisky|Scotland is the first jurisdiction in the world to introduce a minimum price per unit of alcohol to reduce consumption. The relevant industry did not hesitate to challenge this new alcohol control policy before courts. The ensuing judgment contains a wealth of insights stemming from regulatory autonomy to proportionality review. What is the role of a national court in the review of national measures restricting free movement? In particular, how should it review the proportionality of those measures when adopted on public health grounds, and on the basis of what evidence? What is the burden of proof that the relevant Member State must discharge? Those are essentially the questions referred by a Scottish court to the Court of Justice when called upon to determine the compatibility with EU law of Minimum Unit Prices for alcohol introduced by the Scottish Government. Although rather recurrent in the Court’s free movement case law, the question of the standard of review, and corresponding burden of proof epitomises the struggle currently faced by national courts in striking the right balance between the proper functioning of the market and due recognition and protection of national regulatory autonomy. As such, this preliminary reference offered an opportunity to address “the information gap on what the Court of Justice expects defendant States to establish” in order to justify their measures under the proportionality stages of free movement analysis. But there is more. This case also raises deeper epistemic and methodological questions faced by any court of law when asked to review the proportionality, and in particular the necessity, of an individual policy intervention that belongs to a wider ‘political strategy’. Indeed, those strategies – as exemplified in the present case by the Scottish policy designed to combat the devastating effects of alcohol – generally entail the enactment of a full ‘regulatory mix’ of policy interventions. In those circumstances, how can we pinpoint the effect of a given policy option when it is part of a set of measures? How can we distinguish the effect, in terms of health gains deriving from a drop in alcohol consumption, to be ascribed to the introduction of MUP when such a measure coexists with other measures (more than 40 in Scotland) that have been introduced? And what when the contested measure has never been tested before? While this judgment confirms the gradual empirical turn made by the Court in its own review of the proportionality of national restrictive measures, it also provides some pragmatic guidance on how national courts may realistically engage in that review. Given the growing number of Member States ready to experiment with new policies aimed at tackling inter alia lifestyle risk factors, such as tobacco use, harmful consumption of alcohol and unhealthy diets, this appears as welcome development. Ultimately, the ensuing number of national restrictive measures of trade enacted on public health grounds, such as the UK standardised packaging for cigarettes, its sugar tax or the Hungarian ‘fat tax’, is set to put to test the Court’s approach towards both the qualification of those measures as restrictions and their justification under EU law.
K32|Double-edged torts|Many tort cases are characterized by two interrelated elements: “role uncertainty”, which occurs when individuals take precautions ignorant of their roles in future accidents and availability of “dual-effect precautions”, which reduce both the probability of an individual becoming an injurer and the probability that the same individual will become a victim of someone else's negligence. In this paper, we extend the traditional model to account for role-uncertainty and dual-effect precautions. We find that in these situations, the traditional formulation of Negligence fails to incentivize efficient precautions, inducing excessive role-specific precautions and insufficient dual-effect precautions. For such cases, we argue for a modification of the standard of due care that accounts for the full benefit of dual-effect precautions, in order to incentivize efficient precautionary efforts.
K32|The fatality and morbidity components of the value of statistical life|The fatality risk–money tradeoff that is the value of a statistical life (VSL) may vary with the nature of the fatality event. While all fatalities involve loss of future life expectancy, the morbidity effects and their duration may differ. This article analyzes fatality risks accompanied by morbidity effects of different duration to disentangle the mortality and morbidity components of VSL using data from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI). The VSL is comprised of the sum of the value of the fatality risk and the value of the morbidity risk. Labor market valuations of morbidity risks are positive, even for fatalities that are caused by traumatic injuries. The value of the fatality risk is the dominant component of VSL, rather than the value of the morbidity risk.
K32|Donor registries, first-person consent legislation, and the supply of deceased organ donors|In this paper, we exploit the varied timing in state adoption of organ donor registries and first-person consent (FPC) legislation to examine corresponding changes in the supply of deceased organ donors. Results indicate that the establishment of a state organ donor registry leads to an increase in donation rates of approximately 8%, while the adoption of FPC legislation has no effect on the supply of organ donors. These results reinforce the need to encourage individuals to communicate their donation preferences, either explicitly via a registry or by discussing them with family.
K32|On the emissions–inequality and emissions–welfare trade-offs in energy taxation: Evidence on the German car fuels tax|By using estimates from a Demographically-Scaled Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (DQUAIDS), we investigate how the German car fuels tax changes the private households’ CO2 emissions, living standards, and post-tax income distribution. Our results show that the tax implies a trade-off between the aim to reduce emissions and vertical equity, which refers to the idea that people with a greater ability to pay taxes should pay more.
K32|Una valutazione degli effetti della legge Sirchia sull’attitudine al fumo degli italiani|Il presente rapporto analizza l’impatto dell’interdizione al fumo introdotta a gennaio 2005 (la cosiddetta Legge Sirchia) sulla propensione a fumare degli italiani. L’evidenza empirica esistente supporta l’ipotesi che la propensione a fumare e il numero di sigarette fumate dagli italiani si siano ridotte dopo l’introduzione del divieto. Questo risultato è tuttavia in contrasto con quanto trovato in altri paesi europei. La nostra analisi mostra che l’apparente successo della legge Sirchia mostrato negli studi esistenti deriva dal fatto di non aver tenuto in conto le differenze stagionali nel consumo di sigarette. Usando i dati trimestrali ottenuti dall’Indagine Multiscopo Condizioni di salute e ricorso ai servizi sanitari per gli anni 1999/2000 e 2004/2005 e adottando un approccio delle differenze-nelledifferenze che permette di depurare le variazioni mensili nel consumo di sigarette dalla componente stagionale mostriamo che la proibizione al fumo nei luoghi pubblici e di lavoro non ha avuto in generale alcun impatto sull’attitudine al fumo degli italiani e solo effetti di lieve entità per alcuni sottogruppi della popolazione.
K32|The Negligence Rule Specificity under Radical Uncertainty|This article is an attempt to reassess the relationships between the strict liability regime and the negligence rule under radical uncertainty (ambiguity theory). In an accident model two representative agents (potential injurer and victim) form divergent beliefs about the probability distribution of an accident and the potential damage scale. It issues on the following results: 1) When the injurer's wealth cover the damage cost, then the socially first-best level of care is established by the injurer under strict liability only. When, the injurer's wealth is insufficient, this level is not reach (capped strict liability regime for instance). 2) Under negligence, the authorities (Regulator or Court) can choose as first best level of care either the level that favors the injurer's interests or the victim ones of. No rational rule can justify a choice rather than the other. 3) The efficiency of both regimes cannot be compared because they obey to different logics.
K32|Do good deeds make bad people?|Abstract According to the so-called ‘self-licensing effect’, committing to a virtuous act in a preceding choice may lead to behave less virtuously in the succeeding decision. Consequently, well-intentioned policies can lead to overall counter-productive effects by licensing people to behave badly in related behaviors. On the other side, motivational crowding theory argues that constraining people to adopt a desirable behavior can backfire. We use of a classroom experiment to test whether a regulatory framework to incentivize individuals to adopt pro-environmental behavior generate similar spillovers in terms of licensing effect than a non-regulatory framework. We show that the way the good deed is caused doesn’t seem to influence the licensing effect. Nevertheless, we found that business- and environmental-orientated majors react adversely to the regulatory framework. We show that environmental-orientated students exhibit higher intrinsically motivations than business-orientated ones. Accordingly, we suggest that the licensing effect is more likely to arise when the preceding ‘virtuous’ act is freely chosen (respectively regulatory caused) for non-intrinsically (respectively intrinsically) motivated individuals.
K32|Executive Compensation and Environmental Harm|We explore the relationship between managerial incentives and environmental harm. We find that high-powered executive compensation packages can increase the odds of environmental law-breaking by 40-60% and the magnitude of environmental harm by over 100%. We document similar results for the setting of executive compensation and financial accounting misconduct. Finally, we outline some managerial and policy implications to blunt these adverse incentive effects.
K32|Relative performance of liability rules: experimental evidence|We compare the performance of liability rules for managing environmental disasters when third parties are harmed and cannot always be compensated. A firm can invest in safety to reduce the likelihood of accidents. The firm’s investment is unobservable to authorities. The presence of externalities and asymmetric information call for public intervention in order to define rules aimed at increasing prevention. We determine the investments in safety under No Liability, Strict Liability, and Negligence rules, and compare these to the first best. Additionally, we investigate how the (dis)ability of the firm to fully cover potential damage affects the firm’s behavior. An experiment tests the theoretical predictions. In line with theory, Strict Liability and Negligence are equally effective; both perform better than No Liability; investment in safety is not sensitive to the ability of the firm to compensate potential victims. In contrast with theory, however, prevention rates absent liability are much higher and liability is much less effective. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
K32|Privatizing sick pay: Does it work?|Public schemes for sickness benefits and disability insurance are often criticized for the lack of incentive they provide for preventive and reintegration activities by employers. To stimulate the interest of employers in engaging with these schemes, several modes of privatization could be considered, including the provision of sickness benefits by employers, “experience rating” of disability insurance costs, employer self-insurance, or insurance by private insurance providers. These types of employer incentives seem to lower sickness rates, but they also come at the risk of increased under-reporting and less employment opportunities for workers with disabilities or bad health conditions. Policymakers should be aware of this trade-off.
K32|On compensation schemes for data sharing within the European REACH legislation|Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 concerns the sharing of data between users of a chemical substance. We study this bargaining problem by means of a special class of games in coalitional form called data games (Dehez and Tellone in J Public Econ Theory 15:654–673, 2013 ). For such problems, compensation schemes specify how the data owners should be compensated by the agents in needs of data. On the class of data games, the Core, the Nucleolus and the Shapley value provide relevant compensation schemes. We provide four comparable axiomatic characterizations of the set of all (additive) compensation schemes belonging to the Core, of the Nucleolus, of the Shapley value and of the Full compensation mechanism, a compensation scheme exclusively designed for data sharing problems. The axioms reflects principles of various theories of justice. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016
K32|Flexibility and Stringency in Greenhouse Gas Regulations|Abstract The Clean Air Act provides the regulatory framework for climate policy in the United States. Emissions rate performance standards are the metric identified for regulation of the electricity sector, the most important source of emissions. Rates for existing sources could be averaged to achieve flexibility in compliance, although the stringency of policies is ambiguous when flexibility is introduced. For example, a specific emissions rate improvement averaged over a larger set of generators may reduce the actual emissions change. We evaluate three policy designs according to emissions rate, emissions and marginal cost and show how a marginal abatement cost criterion can be applied within a technology-based regulation. This approach can quadruple the emissions reductions that are achieved, with net social benefits exceeding $25 billion in 2020, and with a 1.3 % electricity price increase. Over half of the benefits stem from improvements in conventional air quality.
K32|The impact of monitoring and enforcement on air pollutant emissions|Abstract Monitoring and enforcement are an important part of any regulatory regime, and the costs of such regulatory actions should be justified by improvements in environmental performance. Among air pollutants, particulate matter has the greatest health impacts: the EPA estimates that reductions in ambient particulate matter will have prevented 195,500 cases of premature mortality by 2020. This article is the first to study the impact of monitoring and enforcement actions on emissions of criteria pollutants, which are commonly found air pollutants such as ozone and particulate matter. Previous research on criteria pollutants has been limited as data are not easily available. This article studies both specific and general deterrence. It shows that penalties produce a small but statistically significant specific deterrence impact and inspections produce a general deterrence impact: increasing the average number of inspections at other facilities in the same county by one decreases emissions by 2.7 %.
K32|Location choice of FDI firms and environmental regulation reforms in China|Abstract By examining the data on 13,663 newly established FDI firms and the environmental regulation reforms between 2000 and 2010, this paper studies whether foreign investors in China exhibit pollution haven behavior. Our analyses indicate that fewer FDI firms locate in provinces with more stringent environmental regulations (i.e., with higher pollution levy rates). Consistent results are found when we examine the individual firm’s location choice decision. We further find that firms’ location patterns respond to the changes in environmental regulations. In particular, their pollution haven behavior becomes more significant when the changes bring greater inter-provincial differences in environmental stringency.
K32|Climate Clubs: Overcoming Free-Riding in International Climate Policy|Notwithstanding great progress in scientific and economic understanding of climate change, it has proven difficult to forge international agreements because of free-riding, as seen in the defunct Kyoto Protocol. This study examines the club as a model for international climate policy. Based on economic theory and empirical modeling, it finds that without sanctions against non-participants there are no stable coalitions other than those with minimal abatement. By contrast, a regime with small trade penalties on non-participants, a Climate Club, can induce a large stable coalition with high levels of abatement. (JEL Q54, Q58, K32, K33)

K32|Comparison Of The Recycling Performance And The Waste Legislation In Hungary And Germany| The European waste management principles are laid down in EU documents. They also include specific targets that Member States have to fulfil within a certain period of time. The three most important documents in this field are the Waste Framework Directive, the Landfill Directive and the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive. The provisions for municipal waste are defined in the Waste Framework Directive that sets the tasks to be completed by 2020. The comparison of performance indicators of Member States shows that there are significant differences. Having examined the relevant statistics, it is visible that the Central European countries (Visegrad4 countries) have similar performance. Their indexes are considerably below the top performers' ones. Therefore, it is useful to compare the public service waste management system of two groups above (top performers and V4 countries), because the municipal solid waste produces the most significant quantity and the most complex waste stream. The national waste management systems must conform to EU legislation; however there is a possibility for a free choice in the detailed rules. Through the comparison of the respective waste management systems the similarities and differences are analyzed in this paper.
K32|Is Medical Marijuana a Gateway Drug?: The Effect of Medical Marijuana Legalization on Heroin Use Rates| The United States is presently going through two substantial changes as it relates to drug use—more states are legalizing marijuana for the purposes of medical treatment and prescription opioid abuse is on the rise, resulting in heroin use rates nearly quadrupling over the past fifteen years. Historically, marijuana has been viewed as a gateway drug. Recent research suggests that medical marijuana legalization has decreased incidence of prescription and other opioid use and overdose. Examining heroin use data and other control variables, we test the effect of medical marijuana legalization on heroin use to determine whether medical marijuana is a gateway drug or substitute for heroin. We find that medical marijuana legalization has a generally negative, but statistically insignificant effect on heroin use rates. This suggests that while the legalization of medical marijuana will not lead to a reduction in heroin use, medical marijuana is not a gateway drug for heroin.
K32|Evaluating regulatory approaches to mine closure in Kenya, Western Australia and Queensland| Many countries have been burdened with a legacy of unplanned mine closure. Inadequate and ineffective regulatory approaches to mine closure have resulted in legacy of abandoned mine sites, which rehabilitation costs are substantial liabilities to governments and communities. Although governments have been reviewing mine closure regulations to enhance their effectiveness, achievement of successful closure outcomes still remains a challenge. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how well existing regulatory approaches for Kenya, Western Australia and Queensland incorporate various aspects of mine closure. This is the first study to do this type of evaluation for regulatory approaches to mine closure. This study reviewed published literature to identify characteristics of mine closure success, and subsequently developed an analytical framework based on this review. Regulatory documents such as Acts, Bills, regulations, policies, guidelines and government reports were then assessed for inclusion of these characteristics in each case study area. The study found that regulatory approaches in the three case study areas do not incorporate all the aspects identified as requirements for successful mine closure. The study found that Western Australia and Queensland regulations were more comprehensive than Kenya. In addition, requirements that address socio-economic impacts of mine closure need to be incorporated in regulatory approaches in all study areas. This study indicates there is need to improve the existing regulatory approaches to mine closure in each study area, particularly Kenya, so that the regulation is more likely to have the desired effect of improved mine closure outcomes and success.

K32|Do Cell Phone Bans Change Driver Behavior?| In response to concerns that distracted driving due to cell phone use has become a threat to roadway safety, many states have passed laws that prohibit drivers from texting and talking on handheld cell phones. In light of recent evidence that these bans do not reduce traffic accidents, this article asks whether this is because the laws are ineffective in reducing usage. Using data on observed driver cell phone usage combined with a difference-in-differences approach that exploits the within-state variation in the adoption of bans, I find that prohibiting drivers from texting and talking on handheld cell phones reduces each by 60% and 50%, respectively. This suggests the policy is effective at reducing the targeted behavior, which leads me to discuss other factors and behavioral responses that may counteract the reduction in observed usage ( JEL K32, D04, R41).

K32|The Structure of Fines in the Light of Political Competition|Why infractions to some environmental legislations (protection of natural habitats) or antitrust law (collusion) are punished with fines based on damages, while other kinds of offenses (lack of adequate permits; cartels) are punished per se? This paper analyzes the determinants of public law enforcement policies when citizens vote for the timing and level of fines. We consider situations where citizens and politicians disagree on the value of the expected social harm associated with some activities. We find that a strong law enforcement equilibrium (high level of deterrence) emerges when citizens expect a high level of harm. On the reverse, a weak law enforcement equilibrium emerges when citizens expect a low level of harm. Furthermore, citizens vote for act-based (respectively harm-based) sanctions when they expect a level of harm lower than that of the government (respectively higher).
K32|Does Experience Rating Improve Obstetric Practices? Evidence From Geographical Discontinuities in Italy|Using data from 2002 to 2009 inpatient discharge records on deliveries in the Italian region of Piedmont, we assess the impact of an increase in malpractice pressure on obstetric practices, as identified by the introduction of experience-rated malpractice liability insurance. Our identification strategy exploits the exogenous location of public hospitals in court districts with and without schedules for noneconomic damages. We perform difference-in-differences and difference-in-discontinuities analyses. We find that the increase in medical malpractice pressure is associated with a decrease in the probability of performing a C-section from 2.3 to 3.7 percentage points (7% to 11.6% at the mean value of C-section) with no consequences for a broadly defined measure of complications or neonatal outcomes. We show that these results are robust to the different methodologies and can be explained by a reduction in the discretion of obstetric decision making rather than by patient cream skimming.
K32|Climate Change and Firm Valuation: Evidence from a Quasi-Natural Experiment|In this paper, I estimate the effect of mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions disclosure on corporate value. Using the introduction of mandatory GHG emissions reporting for firms listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange as a source of exogenous variation, I find that firms most heavily affected by the regulation experience significantly positive valuation effects. Increases in value are strongest for large firms and for firms from carbon intensive industries (e.g., oil and gas). Valuation increases are driven by capital market effects such as higher liquidity and lower bid -- ask spreads for the most affected firms.
K32|Biased Judges: Evidence from French Environmental Cases|Using an original database of 614 judgements in the French supreme courts from 1956 to 2010, we test for possible biases in judges' decisions in the field of environmental accidents, focusing on a difference in treatment between private parties and the government as litigant. Two separate institutions deal with environmental cases in France, namely the Conseil d'Etat (Supreme Administrative Tribunal) for public utilities and central and local government, and the Cour de cassation (Supreme Civil Court) for private firms. We run bivariate Probit regressions to explain pro-defendant decisions and reversals of decisions. Overall, courts treat plaintiffs and defendants differently. A pro-defendant decision and a reversal of decision are less likely to occur: (i) when the appeal is initiated by the defendant rather than by the plaintiff; (ii) in the Conseil d'Etat ´ rather than in the Cour de cassation. The Conseil d'Etat ´ is harsher with defendants than the Cour de cassation. These results could be indicative of a bias of the lower administrative tribunals in favor of public utilities and/or the government.
K32|Embracing Diversity: Plurilateral Agreements and the Trading System|Plurilateral agreements in the WTO context allow sub-sets of countries to agree to commitments in specific policy areas that only apply to signatories, and thus allow for ‘variable geometry’ in the WTO. Current WTO rules make it much more difficult to pursue the plurilateral route than to negotiate a preferential trade agreement outside the WTO. We argue that this is inefficient from a global welfare and trading system perspective and that WTO Members should facilitate the negotiation of new plurilateral agreements on regulatory matters.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K32|Non-economic Damages in Medical Malpractice Appeals: Does the Jurisdiction Make a Difference?|This article assesses predictors of payouts and non-economic damages in medical malpractice cases decided by the Spanish Supreme Court from 2006 until 2010. Medical malpractice cases can be judged in administrative or civil courts, and this distinction heavily relies on the type of hospital where the medical accident took place (in general terms, administrative courts judge cases involving public hospitals and civil courts judge cases involving private hospitals). I find that cases decided by the Administrative Section of the Supreme Court are not more likely to receive damages than cases decided by the Civil Section. The probability of receiving compensation is significantly higher among cases involving permanent major/grave injuries. With respect to non-economic compensation amounts, there are no significant differences between Administrative and Civil cases. This result is confirmed by matching estimation and simulation exercises. There is evidence of vertical inequality according to the level of harm: cases involving permanent grave injuries are those receiving the highest non-economic damages, followed by permanent major, death, permanent minor and temporary /emotional cases. Differences in compensation awards between Administrative and Civil courts has been one argument widely used against the current separation of jurisdictions in many civil law tradition countries. The results found in this paper do not support this claim.
K32|The Emergence of Law and Behavioural Science: A European Perspective|Nudge and the Law explores the legal implications of the emergent phenomenon of behaviourally informed intervention. It focuses on the challenges and opportunities it may offer to the policymaking of the European Union. This dual focus on law and on Europe characterises our endeavour. This volume has been structured by taking as a point of the departure the current nudging debate, which mainly comprises two strands of enquiry: when is it legitimate for States to use psychology to inform policy? (the legitimacy debate) and, to the extent that it is legitimate, how can behavioural insights in practice be incorporated into the decision making processes? (the practicability debate). Against this backdrop we brought together scholars who could analyse what behavioural insights might bring to EU law, both at a horizontal level and at a sectoral level. This volume endeavours to present the results of their research in a manner that is accessible both to EU law specialists who are not yet familiar with behavioural sciences and to behavioural lawyers who are not specialists in EU law.
K32|How Much Better Is Better Regulation? Assessing the Impact of the Better Regulation Package on the European Union – A Research Agenda|Emboldened by the Spitzenkandidaten process, the new European Commission emerges as the most political yet. The Commission asks EU citizens to judge its operation by its ability ‘to deliver solutions to the big issues that cannot be addressed by the Member States alone’. The Better Regulation Package translates this political commitment into an actionable approach assuring EU citizens that the Commission will remain ‘big on big things, small on small things’. To deliver on this promise, the Commission extends the Impact Assessment system, renews its consultation procedures and adds a few institutional mechanisms so as to enhance its ‘ability to deliver’ throughout the policy cycle. But in order to do so the Commission needs to bind – and somehow control – the European Parliament and the Council, on the one hand, and the Member States, on the other, in relation to their commitment to openness, participation and evidence-based policymaking. While legitimate, this attempt raises serious doubts about the compatibility of this reform with the principle of separation of powers and, in particular, that of institutional balance.
K32|Patient mobility in the context of austerity and an enlarged EU: The European Court of Justice's ruling in the Petru Case|Since 1998, the European Court of Justice (EUCJ) has established a set of principles concerning patient mobility across Member States. At present, these principles are challenged against a new background, i.e., an enlarged EU and austerity-driven measures in the field of healthcare. This is even more relevant in view of the significant differences between countries and between services on healthcare access. In the Petru case, a Romanian woman sought healthcare in Germany due to an alleged lack of basic infrastructure in her local Romanian hospital. A crucial question arises in this context of whether the patient′s interests (i.e., right to cross-border healthcare) or the Member State′s interests (i.e., financial stability of the healthcare system) prevail. We analyse this case and its implications for future patient mobility. From the point of view of patients, the EUCJ′s decision implies that also a lack of medication and basic medical supplies can be claimed as “undue delay”, however for Member States it is sufficient to provide quality treatments in at least one hospital. Although the Court has provided a solution for the Petru case, we argue that major challenges remain, such as the definition of the international state-of-the-art or other limitations to reductions of the health basket.
K32|The effect of medical marijuana laws on adolescent and adult use of marijuana, alcohol, and other substances|We estimate the effect of medical marijuana laws (MMLs) in ten states between 2004 and 2012 on adolescent and adult use of marijuana, alcohol, and other psychoactive substances. We find increases in the probability of current marijuana use, regular marijuana use and marijuana abuse/dependence among those aged 21 or above. We also find an increase in marijuana use initiation among those aged 12–20. For those aged 21 or above, MMLs further increase the frequency of binge drinking. MMLs have no discernible impact on drinking behavior for those aged 12–20, or the use of other psychoactive substances in either age group.
K32|Financial incentives for kidney donation: A comparative case study using synthetic controls|Although many commentators called for increased efforts to incentivize organ donations, theorists and some evidence suggest these efforts will be ineffective. Studies examining the impact of tax incentives generally report zero/negative coefficients, but these studies incorrectly define their tax variables and rely on difference-in-differences despite likely failures of the parallel trends assumption. We identify the causal effect of tax legislation to serve as an organ donor on living kidney donation rates in the U.S. states using more precise tax data and allowing for heterogeneous time-variant causal effects. Employing a synthetic control method, we find that the passage of tax incentive legislation increased living unrelated kidney donation rates by 52 percent in New York relative to a comparable synthetic New York in the absence of legislation. It is possible that New York is unique, but our methodology does not allow us to measure accurately effects in other states.
K32|Environmental regulation and competitiveness in the mining industry: Permitting processes with special focus on Finland, Sweden and Russia|This paper investigates to what extent and under what circumstances environmental regulation can be designed and implemented to jointly achieve positive environmental outcomes and sustained competitive strength in the mining industry. First the paper provides a conceptual analysis of the impacts of environmental regulations on mining competitiveness, including a discussion of how the environmental-competitiveness trade-off can be affected by various regulatory design and implementation strategies. Methodologically we distinguish between the flexibility, predictability and stringency of the regulations, and in a second step these analytical concepts are illustrated in the empirical context of the environmental permitting processes in Finland, Sweden and Russia. An important result is that in these countries there has been a lack of timeliness and predictability in the environmental regulations (e.g., uncertainty about the interpretation of the legislation, delays due to appeals etc.). These problems can in part be addressed by, for instance: (a) allocating more resources to the regulatory authorities; (b) establishing more consensus-based regulatory interactions between the mining industry and the authorities; and (c) introducing more standardized procedures and road maps for environmental impact assessments, permit applications and not the least for how to interpret specific legal rules in the context of mining.

Tali forme organizzative costringono il giuslavorista a rivalutare e adattare il campo di applicazione del diritto del lavoro, e a riflettere sui criteri di imputazione delle posizioni giuridiche. Nel presente contributo, l’autrice fornisce alcuni esempi di come le regole di diritto della sicurezza sul lavoro debbano essere applicate alle imprese unite da un contratto di rete, e sulle modalità di imputazione degli obblighi di sicurezza tra i diversi soggetti che partecipano al programma di rete.
K32|Economic Value of Water Quality Improvement by One Grade Level in Erhai Lake: A Willingness-to-Pay Survey and a Benefit-Transfer Study|Water quality in China has seriously deteriorated in recent years. However, very few valuation studies have been conducted to estimate the monetary values associated with water quality changes. As a result, the decision makers can hardly make rational choices with regard to investments in water quality improvement. This paper presents a valuation study conducted in Dali, Yunnan Province, which aims to estimate the total economic value of improving the water quality of Erhai Lake by one grade level. Both the contingent valuation method and the benefit transfer approach are employed in this study. The contingent valuation estimation strategy reveals that, on average, a household located in Dali is willing to pay about 27 yuan per month continuously for 5 years for the water quality improvement, equivalent to 1.7% of the household monthly income. The elasticity of willingness-to-pay with respect to income is estimated to be 0.28. The internal rate of economic return of the proposed pollution control project is estimated to be 13%. The benefit transfer exercise produces a similar estimation on willingness to pay (WTP) values, with a difference of less than 2% compared with the contingent valuation approach. The results indicate the potential reliability of using the benefit transfer approach for valuation estimations in Chinese provinces.
K32|Civil Liability, Knight’s Uncertainty and Non-Dictatorial Regulator|This paper reviews the foundations of the unilateral standard accident model under Knightian uncertainty. It extends the Teitelbaum (2007)’s seminal article (who introduces radical uncertainty) by expanding it from producers to victims and from the probability distribution of accidents to the scale of damage. Mainly, it also considers a regulator who aggregates the agents’ preferences (Neghisi (1960) type). Under the condition that the troublemakers’ resources are sufficient to cover the damage, the article shows that uncertainty does not preclude, first, the determination of a socially optimal level of care, and second, whatever the civil liability regime (strict liability or negligence) it shows that they determine the same level of socially first-best care. The solution is inefficient only when the polluter’s wealth is insufficient to repair the victim’s losses.
K32|Spatio-temporal analysis of Romania's rural population access to sanitation services in the context of EU accession|This paper analysis the disparities between Romanian Counties regarding the spatio-temporal evolution of rural population access to sanitation services for pre-accession period (2003-2006) and the first two years since Romania is part of the EU-27 (2007-2008) highlighting positive or negative changes occurred in this period.Romanian counties were mapped and divided into five typological classes,using multivariate analysis such as hierarchical cluster analysis method.Each class has different values of rural population served by waste collection services related to the Romania average (expressed in standard deviations).Limited access to sanitation services from rural areas lead to uncontrolled waste disposal.Despite improvement of public access to sanitation services in rural areas compared to 2003 most of population still lack access to waste collection services in 2008.In this context, implementation of the acquis communautaire on municipal waste management is difficult to achieve in rural territory.
K32|Physician–patient relationship and medical accident victim compensation: some insights into the French regulatory system|Given the growing amount of medical litigation heard by courts, the 2002 Kouchner law in France has created the Office National d’Indemnisation des Accidents Médicaux (ONIAM), whose main aim is to encourage out-of-court settlements when a conflict between a physician and the victim of a medical accident occurs. More than 10 years after the implementation of this law, the statistics analysing its effectiveness are contradictory, which raises the question of the potential negative effects of the ONIAM on the compensation system. In order to address this question, the article analyses the impact of the ONIAM on the nature of settlement negotiations between the physician and the victim. Using a dynamic game within incomplete information, we develop a comparative analysis of two types of compensation systems in case of medical accidents: socialised financing granted by the ONIAM and private financing provided by the physician. We show that the ONIAM could encourage out-of-court settlements provided that the hypothesis of judicial error is relevant. On the contrary, in the case of a low probability of judicial errors, the ONIAM could be effective only for severe medical accidents. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
K32|Spatial distribution of rural dumpsites parameters in Romania|Poor waste management facilities led to uncontrolled waste disposal on improper sites in the proximity of human settlements particularly in rural areas. This bad practice prevailed in all rural regions until 16 July 2009 when these garbage dumps should be closed and rehabilitated according to Government Decision number 345/2005 which comply the Landfill Directive 1999/31/EC. The paper aims a spatial analysis of waste indicators concerning the rural dumpsites at administrative territorial units on national, regional and local scale. These data are correlated to geographical conditions reflecting spatial patterns in their distribution across and within Romanian counties. The role of geographical conditions is revealed at local scales in these spatial patterns due to a low coverage rate of rural communities to waste collection services. Such analysis supported by field observations is necessary for a proper understanding of illegal waste disposal issue. Rural regions are still exposed to such bad practices polluting the local environment
K32|Accessibility of waste collection services in Romania: a multi-scale analysis in EU context using thematic cartography|Low coverage of urban and rural population to waste collection services leads to various environmental threats caused by uncontrolled waste disposal. New EU regulations on waste management issues transposed into national laws have improved this sector, but, the population access to such services is still low compared to others new EU members. A multi-scale approach of this indicator is a necessary tool for a proper analysis of this environmental issue. The maps reveal that Romanian development regions (NUTS 2) have the lowest coverage rates at EU level in 2010. Furthermore, major disparities are reflected between Romanian counties in 2010. Thematic maps outline a comparative analysis at national and regional scale (Romanian counties & cities and communes of North-East Region) between urban vs rural areas in 2010. These geographical approaches are necessary for a better monitoring process of waste management sector.
K32|Social justice in the construction of the acceptability judgment. Analysis of the farmers’ reactions to different groundwater sharing rules|Cet article analyse les discours des agriculteurs en réaction à différents modes de calcul de quotas individuels, pouvant être utilisés pour la mise en place de la loi sur l'eau de 2006. La démarche consiste à articuler deux types d'approches : l'évaluation de l'acceptabilité de ces règles et l'analyse des principes de justice sociale sous-jacents aux argumentaires. Cette problématique est abordée à travers une revue de la littérature et une étude empirique, consistant à soumettre neuf scénarios d'allocation à 76 agriculteurs sélectionnés dans cinq terrains en France. Cet article contribue à la littérature sur la justice sociale dans la gestion de l'eau, en combinant différents cadres d'analyse ; il donne également des outils pour la mise en place d'une gestion quantitative, en proposant une méthode d'évaluation a priori de l'acceptabilité des modes de calculs des quotas. MOTS-CLÉS : acceptabilité, justice sociale, loi sur l'eau, politiques publiques, irrigation Social justice in the construction of the acceptability judgment. Analysis of the farmers' reactions to different groundwater sharing rules This article analyses farmers' answers to different water allocation rules which could be used to implement the 2006 French Water Law. We develop an analytical framework which combines an evaluation of overall acceptability of these rules with an analysis of the underlying principles of social justice. This framework is applied through conducting a survey in five French case studies. Nine allocation rules are presented to 76 irrigating farmers and their preferences analyzed. This article contributes to literature on social justice by articulating different analysis framework, and gives tools to quantitative management implementation, by proposing an assessment method on calculation quotas acceptability.

K32|Biodiversity conservation through private initiative: the case of Earth Sanctuaries Ltd|The article adds empirical content to transaction costs concepts by analyzing the design and implementation of the first publicly listed company in Australia, Earth Sanctuaries Limited, devoted to protecting biodiversity. The venture was successful on some ecological criteria, but ultimately failed financially. This case study looks at the regulatory, legal and institutional arrangements that impeded its success. It shows how public sector activities can inadvertently restrict and crowd out private sector activities, and demonstrates the importance of reducing unnecessarily high transactions costs to facilitate private sector success in biodiversity conservation. It also develops a new argument related to status reversal to explain resistance to institutional change. It illustrates how private sector conservation initiatives may complement, and sometimes even substitute for, conservation activities by the public sector, thus allowing the public sector to focus its attention and resources on other purposes.

K32|Sea Level Rise, Radical Uncertainties and Decision-Maker's Liability: The European Coastal Airports Case|Until now, most of the growing climate legal litigations mainly concern environmental associations or victims against energy of energy-users firms or States. However, in a near future, because of exacerbating sudden floods linked to climate change, future litigations could (will) concern infrastructure governance versus private companies. Indeed, sues would (will) concern the financial losses these last ones would (will) endure because the infrastructure managers did not made convenient protection choices in due time. This paper particularly investigates the case of coastal airports at the European level. It insists on the importance of climate scientists divergent opinions about the sea level rise and its consequences for decision-takers concerning their potential legal liability for negligence.
K32|Biased Judges: Evidence from French Environmental Cases|Using an original database of 614 judgements in the French supreme courts from 1956 to 2010, we test for possible biases in judges’ decisions in the field of environmental accidents, focusing on a difference in treatment between private parties and the government as litigant. Two separate institutions deal with environmental cases in France, namely the Conseil d’E´tat (Supreme Administrative Tribunal) for public utilities and central and local government, and the Cour de cassation (Supreme Civil Court) for private firms. We run bivariate Probit regressions to explain pro-defendant decisions and reversals of decisions. Overall, courts treat plaintiffs and defendants differently. A pro-defendant decision and a reversal of decision are less likely to occur: (i) when the appeal is initiated by the defendant rather than by the plaintiff; (ii) in the Conseil d’Etat rather than in the Cour de cassation. The Conseil d’Etat is harsher with defendants than the Cour de cassation. These results could be indicative of a bias of the lower administrative tribunals in favor of public utilities and/or the government.
K32|Executive Women And Work-Family Interaction: Evidence In Mexico Mujeres Ejecutivas E Interaccion Trabajofamilia: Evidencias En Mexico|The access of women to high positions in organizations has been limited by some difficulties originate by the culture, that institutionalizes discrimination, subordination and inequity between men and women. These problems make evident the need for structural changes in the family, the state and the labor market. This paper is a gender view to the interaction family-work; analyzes executive women in the cities of Durango and Aguascalientes. The strategy was a survey conducted 58 interviews with women executives. Comparison of findings from three studies on executive is also made. (Griselda MartÃ­nez VÃ¡zquez, 1997; Adriana Gallegos, 2004 and MarÃ­a del Carmen Bernal and Enrique Taracena, 2012). Looking for the construction of a new gender identity for this group of workers, is possible show some findings: women still perceived themselves as responsible for the private world, and there is not a substantial change in terms of new female identity, because women executives have reconciled work and family but feelings of guilt persist; although they show egalitarian relationships with their husbands with whom they share the parenting.
K32|Water use in maize crop on sloping soils from S-V region of Romania|The research carried out during 2012-2013 in Agricultural Research and Development Station Oradea in the plots placed on the hill with 10% slope show the important differences between the yield obtained in the top of the hill and base of the hill both in the maize seeded on the level curves direction (1700 kg/ha in 2012 and 1950 kg/ha in 2013) and, especially in the maize seeded from top to valley (2460 kg/ha in 2012 and 2410 kg/ha in 2013). As consequence the maize grains quantity obtained for every 1m3 of water consumed is bigger at the base of the hill in comparison with the top of the hill; the bigger differences were registered in the variant with maize seeded from top to valley.
K32|In vitro alteration of some taxoni in danger of extinction from protected areas from Bihor country (drosera rotundifolia huds.)|"The study highlighted the conservation of the species Drosera rotundifolia Huds. ""dew of heaven"", with vitro propagation, geoelement with poor populations, critically endangered (CR), seen in Romania only in Transylvania. This species is considered a rarity, beeing of science-academic importance, (carnivora) and decorative. The juvenile bud explant of drosera was inoculated onto Murashige and Skoog environment, 1962 (MS), with four variants. Development in vitro is favored by the presence of cytokinins in the environment, for this experiment benzylaminopurine (BA) and zeatin (Z) being recommended in moderate doses (1 mg / l BA or Z) combined with an auxin in small doses (0.5mg / l ANA)"
K32|Impact of some technological elements on cucumber production in solars|The research was carried out in 2014 in the conditions from Husasau de Tinca from North Western part of Romania under polyetilene tunnel conditions. Were studied four cultivars: Szatmar, Crispina, Pasalimo, and Mirabelle. The earlier higher yield of cucumber was obtained at the cultivar Mirabelle. The total yield obtained was of 3,55 kg/m2 at cultivar Szatmar, 3,29 kg/m2 at Mirabelle, 3,12 kg/m2 at Crispina and 3,07 kg/m2 at cultivar Pasalimo. The researches emphasized the need of studying regarding the cultivars behaviour in cucumber crop under polyetilene tunnel conditions because there are important differences at crop yield.
K32|The impact of irrigation system on soybean production from CriÅŸ plain|The research were carried out during 2012-2013 at the Agricultural Research Station Oradea in the fallowing variants: V1 â€“ Irrigated, without irrigation suspending; V2 - Irrigated, with irrigation suspending in May; V3 - Irrigated, with irrigation suspending in June; V4 - Irrigated, with irrigation suspending in July; V5 - Irrigated, with irrigation suspending in August; V6 â€“ Unirrigated. In unirrigated conditions, the decrease of the soil water reserve on 0-75 cm depthe bellow easily available water content was registered every year. the soil water reserve decresed bellow wilting point too. In comparison with the variant without irrigation suspending the yield losses were registered; the biggest yiel losses were registered in the variant with irrigation suspending Ã®n August.
K32|Impact of soil-water-atmosphere system in crops of peppers, cabbage and watermelons from the CriÅŸ plain|This paper is based on several research conducted on preluvisol at the Oradea Agricultural Research Resort during 2012-2013. In our research we have analyzed 12 varieties of peppers: the highest production was obtained by MureÅŸ variety and the variety of Syria recorded the lowest production. In the field of autumn cabbage crop, our research results showed: Socodor variety recorded the biggest production and BuzÄƒu variety recoded the smallest production. At the culture of watermelons, the highest production was recorded by Roxana variety, and the smallest one by Charlestone Gray variety. Our research shows the importance of studying the behavior of vegetables and fruit varieties in order to obtain the best use of the soilwater-plant-atmosphere ecosystem in different regions from Romania.
K32|The Emissions Reduction Effect And Economic Impact Of An Energy Tax Vs. A Carbon Tax In China: A Dynamic Cge Model Analysis|Carbon tax and energy tax are among the hot discussions in China. This study conducts simulation studies on them with a CGE model and analyzes their economic impacts, especially on the energy-intensive sectors. The Chinese economy is affected at an acceptable level by the two taxes in different scenarios. The import and export of energy-intensive industries are changed, leading to improved domestic competitiveness. Compared with implementing a single tax, a combined carbon-energy tax reduces more emissions with relatively smaller economic costs. For China, the sooner such taxes are launched, the smaller the economic costs and the more significant emission reductions.
K32|Announcing is Bad, Delaying is Worse: Another Pitfall in Well-intended Climate Policy|It is frequently observed that the implementation of green policies is delayed compared to the initial announcement. Considering a setting with a representative monopolist extracting a nonrenewable resource, we demonstrate that announcing a green policy, but then delaying its implementation, is associated with a larger cumulative extraction at any point in time than announcing a late implementation of this policy at the outset.
K32|The design flaw of the displacement principle of clean development mechanism: the neglect of electricity shortage|This study addresses a methodology flaw of Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) that neglects the wide-spread electricity shortage in the developing countries. The impact of this neglect is huge: about half of the annual carbon credits from the projects registered by 2010 are from the on-grid electricity displacement projects, and the majority of them had concentrated in several countries where electricity shortage remains severe and lasting. In the context of widespread energy shortage, the extra electricity produced by the CDM projects is more likely to be used to provide extra electricity supply rather than substitute the Business-as-usual (BAU) electricity supply. Hence, the neglect of the wide-spread energy shortage in the CDM methods puts the integrity of a critical amount of the CDM carbon credit in question.

K32|A Proximate Mirror: Greenhouse Gas Rules and Strategic Behavior Under the US Clean Air Act|The development of climate policy in the United States mirrors international developments, with efforts to initiate a coordinated approach giving way to jurisdictions separately taking actions. The centerpiece of US policy is regulation in the electricity sector that identifies a carbon emissions rate standard (intensity standard) for each state but leaves to states the design of policies, including potentially the use of technology policies, emissions rate averaging, or cap and trade. Differences in policies among states within the same power market could promote predatory behavior resulting in a geographic shift in generation and investment in new resources. This paper examines the coordination problem using a detailed partial equilibrium model of operations and investment. We demonstrate that leading jurisdictions have available a rich set of design options including targetted output based allocation that would impose costs on neighbors and may protect against strategic predation.

K32|Environmental technology transfer and emission standards for industry in China|In this article, we provide a structure story about how an incomplete public policy has affected technology transfer. In China, the entire system of industrial water emission standards has evolved though different phases over the past 40 years, however, still national uniform standards for specific industrial categories has not been able to fit specific economic development levels and water quality. Because the uniform standard have not considered the differences of the position and facility scales. In regards to environmental technology R&D, we found that there are no clear signs that the technology is changing in most emission standards’ review process, so we could see all industrial area don’t have enough and reasonable expectation for emission standards and technology R&D investment. Then we reviewed the technology choice in the determination process of water emission standards in all industrial areas. It is obvious that the limitation levels are subjective. Based on two typical cases, we conclude that incomplete enacting and reviewing mechanisms lead to unexpected R&D, and the unexpected R&D leads to considerable abnormal domestic and international transfers.

K32|The Precautionary Principle as a Heuristic Patch|In this paper we attempt to recover an integrated conception of the Precautionary Principle (PP). The alpha=0.05$ inferential-threshold convention widely employed in science is ill-suited to the requirements of policy decision making because it is fixed and unresponsive to the cost trade-offs that are the defining concern of policy decision making. Statistical decision theory -- particularly in its Signal-Detection Theory (SDT) variant -- provides a standard framework within which to incorporate the (mis)classification costs associated with deciding between intervention and non-intervention. We show that the PP implements preventive intervention in precisely those circumstances where the SDT-based model yields a (1,1) corner solution. Thus the PP can be understood as a heuristic variant of the SDT corner solution, which in turn serves to patch the incongruity between the inferential practices of science and the inferential requirements of policy decision making. Furthermore, SDT's analytical structure directs attention to a small number of variables -- (mis)classification costs and prior probabilities -- as determinants of the (1,1) corner solution. Subjective biases impinging upon these variables -- omission bias, protected values, and the affect heuristic in particular, moderated by the decision maker's industry-aligned (insider) or industry-opposed (outsider) status -- combine within SDT to successfully retrodict features of the PP previously considered puzzling, if not inconsistent or incoherent. These psychological biases do not exclude, and may in part reflect, the decision maker's deontological moral beliefs, or indeed social norms embodied in the nation's legal system (common law vs. civil law).
K32|Sacred Values? The Effect of Information on Attitudes toward Payments for Human Organs|Are attitudes about morally controversial (and often prohibited) market transactions affected by information about their costs and benefits? We address this question for the case of payments for human organs. We find in a survey experiment with US residents (N=3,417) that providing information on the potential efficiency benefits of a regulated price mechanism for organs significantly increased support for payments from a baseline of 52 percent to 71 percent. The survey was devised to minimize social desirability biases in responses, and additional analyses validate the interpretation that subjects were reflecting on the case-specific details provided, rather than just reacting to any information.
K32|Extent of Cooperative Enforcement: Effect of the Regulator-Regulated Facility Relationship on Audit Frequency|A spirited debate explores the comparative merits of two different approaches to the enforcement of environmental law: the noncooperative approach, which emphasizes the deterrence of noncompliance through inflexibly imposed sanctions, and the cooperative approach, which emphasizes the inducement of compliance through flexibility and assistance. Both scholarly and policymaking communities are interested in this topic of enforcement approach within the realms of finance, tax compliance, occupational safety, food and drug safety, consumer product safety, and environmental protection, among others. To inform this debate, our study explores enforcement of environmental protection laws where the debate has been especially spirited yet lacking in much empirical evidence. Specifically, our study empirically analyzes the effect of enforcement approach on the frequency of self-audits linked to compliance with wastewater discharge limits imposed on chemical manufacturing facilities. For this analysis, we view the enforcement approach as representing a relationship between a regulator and a regulated facility that is measured in multiple dimensions. The empirical results reveal that, in general, a cooperative relationship induces more frequent auditing and, in particular, a more stable and higher quality relationship increases audit frequency, while a completely fair relationship yields less frequent auditing. However, these conclusions may depend on the extent of regulatory monitoring and enforcement. Specifically, they rely on sufficiently lower monitoring and enforcement. Once the extent of monitoring and enforcement becomes sufficiently strong, the empirical results appear to support the opposite conclusions.
K32|Policy Monitor—Bonding Requirements for U.S. Natural Gas Producers|Natural gas producers are constantly making tradeoffs between money, time, and environmental risk. The private costs and benefits of drilling are realized immediately, but the external costs are not. This means that by the time external costs are well understood, producers may no longer exist or may not have sufficient resources to finance necessary cleanups or to compensate those who have been adversely affected. Because producers do not face the total cost of potential external damages, they may take too many risks. This article discusses alternative regulatory approaches for mitigating moral hazard in U.S. natural gas production. Particular emphasis is given to bonding requirements, which have tended to receive less attention from policy makers than other approaches but have a long history. Although the use of bonding has important limitations, this approach is quite well suited to addressing many of the environmental risks in this market. (JEL: K32, L71, Q48, Q58)
K32|Offshore Oil and Gas Drilling: A Review of Regulatory Regimes in the United States, United Kingdom, and Norway|This article investigates the regulatory regimes for offshore oil and gas in the United States (U.S.), United Kingdom (U.K.), and Norway from both a positive and normative perspective. The positive analysis reveals that all three countries are converging on a similar regulatory system that combines strict liability, command-and-control, and management-based regulations for controlling site-specific risks. The timing of the adoption of each element in this regulatory system varies across the three countries and has been driven largely by accidents along the individual country’s continental shelf. In particular, the adoption of the management-based approach occurred after a significant accident revealed the weaknesses of a one-size-fits–all set of prescriptive rules. Although the normative analysis reveals theoretical support for the use of both liability and management-based approaches, the empirical data are limited, and the data that do exist call into question the superiority of the management-based approach over command-and-control. More research is needed that develops and systematically evaluates incentive-compatible regulatory regimes. (JEL: Q38, Q40, Q48, K32)
K32|Energy Taxation And Its Problems Of Regulation|The study analyses the questions of the energy taxation within the environmental tax regulation, as a special area of the environmental politics regulation. The author demonstrates the development and the role of the energy tax in the environmental policy. The energy tax is one of the most harmonizated spheres of the European taxation rules. The harmonization with the single directive of the European Union come true not a long time ago, that is why the analysis of the experiences is important before the introduction of the regulation. Certain countries have applied the energy tax before the introduction of the directive. The study pans out about the experiences of regulation up to the present and the prospective changes of the regulation in the future.
K32|Health – A Human Right Issue|The right to „the highest level of health” means the right of each individual to health itself and includes, besides the health services provided by the health care system, the provission of essential conditions for a good health such as: clean water, adequate food, sanitation and shelter. This right includes the access to quality and affordable health services, as well as the acces to information on health issues. The public health care system represents the guarantee of the life quality and one of the most important political commitment the guvernors have to assume to ensure the high standards of the population they represent.
K32|Pouring oil over the Balearic tourism industry|This study aims to predict the possible negative effects on the Balearic tourism economy of the exploitation of marine oil fields near its coastline. We describe the current business structure of the islands’ tourism industry and then focus on the various kinds of spills that might affect it. Our conclusion is that the exploitation of the oil fields will significantly damage the tourism industry: a series of small-scale accidents followed by a large spill could destroy the complex structure of Balearic tourism, and would have severe repercussions for the economy of the archipelago.
