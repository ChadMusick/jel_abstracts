O35|Sources and determinants of responsible innovations: occupational health and safety in italian firms|This paper provides a micro-econometric analysis of the factors facilitating the introduction of responsible innovations by firms, with a focus on those aimed at improving occupational health and safety. These innovations have been rarely investigated with quantitative methods, especially if compared to those aimed at protecting the environment. Accordingly, we also assess whether firms pursuing health and safety innovations are also those ascribing high importance to the reduction of environmental impacts. The evidence provided by using firm-level data taken from the Italian Community Innovation Surveys highlights the key role played by some external sources of knowledge and internal human resource practices for the achievement of responsible innovations. Many similarities but also important differences between firms emerge, according to whether they are committed to health and safety or environmental innovation.
O35|FinTechs and the Market for Financial Analysis|Market intelligence FinTechs aggregate many data sources, including nontraditional ones, and synthesize such data using artificial intelligence to make investment recommendations. Using data from a market intelligence FinTech, we evaluate the relationship between the FinTech data coverage and market efficiency. We find an increase in price informativeness for stocks with higher FinTech coverage and that traditional sources of information have less impact on prices for those stocks. Consistent with FinTechs changing investors' behavior, we show a substitution between traditional information sources and FinTechs using internet click data. Overall, our results suggest the rise in FinTechs for investment recommendations benefits investors.
O35|The Role of Electoral Incentives for Policy Innovation: Evidence from the U.S. Welfare Reform|We investigate whether the decision to experiment with novel policies is influenced by electoral incentives. Our empirical setting is the U.S. welfare reform in 1996, which marked the most dramatic shift in social policy since the New Deal. We find that electoral incentives matter: governors with strong electoral support are less likely to experiment with policies than governors with little electoral support. Yet, governors who cannot be reelected experiment more than governors striving for reelection. The importance of electoral incentives is robust to controlling for governor ideology, voter preferences for redistribution, the influence of the legislature, or for learning among states. A comparison of the role of governor ideology and electoral incentives reveals that both contribute about equally to policy experimentation.
O35|Rôle de l’Innovation Sociale dans le Développement Socioéconomique au Maroc : Premières Constatations à partir de la Littérature, et Etude de Cas de 4 Associations Socialement Innovantes|Role of Social Innovation in Socioeconomic Development in Morocco: First Findings from the Literature, and 4 Case Studies of Socially Innovative Associations Innovation has always been a concept related to science and technology. For Schumpeter, the founding father of innovation, it is a means at the service of economic performance in businesses. He also considers that any innovation, even scientific or technological, has a social character. This character has grown over the decades, as innovation has also become capable of addressing social, human and 5 environmental challenges. This “Socialization” process of innovation gave birth to Social Innovation in the 1970s in an environment characterized by new social demands and profound economic and political changes. The goal of Social Innovation is to find new ways (goods, services, ideas ...) to satisfy social needs unmet by the market and / or the State, for the benefit of disadvantaged individuals and groups. In Morocco, the situation is not better. The country is currently suffering from serious problems in all domains: growing social inequalities, progressive reduction of the State's efforts in some important social domains like education and health… which lead to several claims and citizens movements that sometimes express new social demands. These claims, if not taken seriously into consideration, can destabilize the country and put in danger its social cohesion already in a breakdown. Therefore, it is a question of appealing to new alternative models of territorial development, and to base them on principles and practices of Social Innovation. In this context, we will try to know what role Social Innovation plays in socio-economic development in Morocco, from the exploration of the existing literature, and the realization of 4 case studies of socially innovative associations in Morocco.
O35|ICT and Ethical Finance: Fostering Social Innovation and Financial Inclusion|This paper describes the links between ethical and responsible finance and social innovation. The two have long been in a close relationship. Ethical and responsible finance has traditionally supported projects that face difficulties in the mainstream banking sector, fostering experimental approaches (to give but an example) to market failures of traditional welfare. Moreover, ethical and responsible finance is interested not only on the economic viability of a project to fund, but also its social and/or environmental impact.The additional dimension brought about by the impact of the activities of ethical and responsible finance is social innovation. This potentially encompass several disciplines, phenomena and social constructs, which makes it difficult to analyse. However, interest in social innovation is increasing, especially concerning digital social innovation. After the theoretical analysis, the focus shifts to the PROFIT platform, presented as a practical example of ICT response to the need for improving the financial knowledge and literacy of the citizens for better decision-making and social resilience. During the creation of the platform, its creators have taken the diversity of the potential beneficiaries into account, in order to be useful for as many social groups as possible. The paper concludes with an analysis of the digital social innovation potential of the PROFIT platform.
O35|Escaping from the poverty trap with social innovation: a social microcredit programme in Hungary|This paper describes a Hungarian social microcredit programme, called Kiútprogram and discusses the major lessons drawn from its operation. It was launched some 10 years ago as an adaptation of the Grameen model to the Hungarian circumstances to decrease the level of prejudice and discrimination against the Roma and improve their living conditions in the most remote, deprived areas of Hungary; microlending has been understood and introduced as a device to achieve these aims –and not as a profit-seeking business activity.During the almost ten-year long learning process, from the simple adaptation of the Grameen model the Kiútprogram has arrived to the denial of the most important features of joint liability in group lending, namely the application of the devices of social collateral. Experience has also shown that a loan itself is not sufficient to assist escaping fromthe poverty trap. Without knowledge transfer and without inter-community connection building –at least in the case of discriminated minorities –the effect of the loan may even be detrimental. In a modern society not only physical, but also social and cultural capital is needed to run a successful business in the formal sector of the economy.In the Kiútprogram’s model the loan plays a crucial role in escaping from the aspiration trap, and thus helps overcome learned helplessness. Loans without any –financial or social –collateral signal that the lender trusts the client, not only in her honesty, but also in her abilities. This method of lending strongly suggests to the clients the conviction that she is able of achieving a business success. Neither financial aid, nor loan with (social) collateral is suitable to reach this effect.
O35|The Four Motives Of Educational Innovators|Education systems across the world are experiencing significant transformations. Grassroots innovators play an important role in these changes. To stimulate the development of grassroots innovations it is important to understand the mechanisms that underlie their creation. This paper investigates the motivation of individuals who initialize innovative projects in education. The approach to measuring motivation was adopted from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED) initially developed for social and commercial entrepreneurs. The Russian version of the methodology was elaborated and validated to study educational innovators. The sample consists of 437 participants of the Competition for Innovation in Education (KIVO). Four types of motivation are identified: social, self-realization, status, financial. They are explained within the self-determination theory (SDT) and grassroots innovations. The social and self-realization motives are inherent in all the actors, while the other two vary among innovators. This motivational structure allows the authors to differentiate between specific types of innovators – social entrepreneurs and ‘non-entrepreneurs’. The discussion, following the conclusion in this article, focuses on which environment would be favorable for developing innovations, considering the personal motives for innovative activity. The results can be valuable for education policy.
O35|Motivating Bureaucrats through Social Recognition: External Validity — A Tale of Two States|Bureaucratic performance is a crucial determinant of economic growth, but little real-world evidence exists on how to improve it, especially in resource-constrained settings. We conducted a field experiment of a social recognition intervention to improve record keeping in health facilities in two Nigerian states, replicating the intervention - implemented by a single organization - on bureaucrats performing identical tasks. Social recognition improved performance in one state but had no effect in the other, highlighting both the potential benefits and also the sometimes-limited generalizability of behavioral interventions. Furthermore, differences in facility-level observables did not explain cross-state differences in impacts, suggesting that it may often be difficult to predict external validity.
O35|Digital economy and development: an empirical study on motorcycle driver jobs in Uganda|This study investigates how the digital economy benefits motorcycle taxi drivers in Uganda. It focuses on three motorcycle related businesses connected the digital economy and studies the impact of the digital economy on drivers’ gross profit. The results show that the digital economy directly enhances the financial capability of motorcycle drivers and their work efficiency. Likewise, it indirectly creates greater demand for motorcycle drivers in the market, including for motorcycle taxi drivers connected to motorcycle taxi app platforms and e-commerce motorcycle delivery drivers. Another crucial point for the motorcycle taxi drivers to benefit from the digital economy is the enhancement of their employability skills.
O35|Sustainable Finance for Sustainable Development|The paper explores how ethical and sustainable oriented finance is key to reach sustainable development by tackling environmental risk through green finance and showing empirical evidence on the link between finance and inequality. The theory provided puts in the right mind frame to analyze markets, intermediaries and instruments with a sustainable lens to focus on the benefits that have brought to sustainable development. A discussion is presented between different intermediaries and highlights the benefits of cooperative banks especially the close relationship of customers and bank and the resilience it gives to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in difficult times. Different investments strategies are discussed walking through the evolution of Sustainable and Responsible Investing (SRI) funds and diving into the ESG analysis to use as criteria to allocate investments based on environmental, social and governance principles. Microfinance is introduced as a different market that has reached the people at the bottom of the pyramid and highlights the key role it will play to bring financial inclusion. Islamic finance and Fintech are also discussed. Different instruments are presented to understand the current landscape of how different investors are using innovative products to attack social and environmental problems. Finally, five different ways are presented on how policies can strengthen and support sustainable development arguing that the most important is by promoting sustainable footprint certification.
O35|Les externalités de la R&D et la capacité d’innovation : implications sur données camerounaises pour une politique de promotion d’innovation<BR>[The externalities of R&D and innovation effort: implications for Cameroonian data for innovation promotion]|This article seeks to analyze the R&D externalities effect on innovation effort. The data analyzed based on a sample of 640 enterprises located in Douala, Yaoundé and Bafoussam. The method of estimation is a probit with selection based on the framework proposed by Heckman (1979). The first equation explains the cooperation in R&D and the second shows the innovation effort of enterprises. The empirical analysis focused on the unobserved heterogeneity of externalities. Our results reveals the existence of unobserved elements, due to cooperation between the firms, which reinforce their innovation effort. Our results reveals that cooperation can be a vector of positive externalities that reinforce their innovation effort. Moreover, our results tend to show the importance of the social returns of R&D in the innovation process. These results question the relevance of current innovation policies, mainly focused on the promotion of private R&D. Thus, innovation promotion policies should be oriented towards open innovation and intensified innovation cooperation.
O35|From public information to democratic governance: a theoretical atlas from an axiomatic approach to the evaluation of public management|The general theme is the diagnosis of the quality of public information and the evaluation of democratic governance. The specific thematic axis is the nature and purpose of public information in the context of the democratic rule of law in Mexico, in the federal states and, in particular, in the state of Veracruz . The problem is to answer the question: What is required for an effective evaluation of public management? Based on this approach, it is argued that the way to effectively evaluate public management presupposes a theory and indicators of democratic governance. In order to understand the elements that constitute democratic governance it is necessary to use the axiomatic method; this requires establishing: 1) Basic, stipular and common definitions; 2) Axioms, as propositions articulated with the basic and consensual definitions; 3) Postulates, which are propositions admitted as true, which are derived from the basic definitions and from the axioms; 4) Theorems, propositions derived from the postulates. From the theorems are derived the indicators of the present theoretical atlas of democratic governance, which will be shown in a later phase of the essay. This research recovers philosophical, juridical, political, economic and accounting aspects. Its articulating axis is the concept of public information, which is linked to those of transparency, corruption, social participation, accountability and citizen oversight, being minimum elements necessary for the understanding and evaluation of democratic governance.

O35|Senegal: Presidential elections 2019 - The shining example of democratic transition immersed in muddy power-politics|Whereas Senegal has long been sold as a showcase of democracy in Africa, including peaceful political alternance, things apparently changed fundamentally with the Senegalese presidentials of 2019 that brought new configurations. One of the major issues was political transhumance that has been elevated to the rank of religion in defiance of morality. It threatened political stability and peace. In response, social networks of predominantly young activists, created in 2011 in the aftermath of the Arab Spring focused on grass-roots advocacy with the electorate on good governance and democracy. They proposed a break with a political system that they consider as neo-colonialist. Moreover, Senegal’s justice is frequently accused to be biased, and the servility of the Constitutional Council which is in the first place an electoral court has often been denounced.
O35|Technology Advancement & Its Adoption: A Booster for Sericulture Development and Expansion in Madhya Pradesh, India|Sericulture, as an agro based artisanal industry, has proved its potential in raising sustainable income and employment in the rural sector of both traditional and non-traditional states of India. The entire gamut of production in sericulture generates huge economic growth for small villages and its inhabitants and restrict rural to urban migration. This study is based on primary data of sample size 50 which belong to the sericulture farmers and artisans in Burhanpur district of Madhya Pradesh, India. The paper analyzes their knowledge level on improved technology and the adoption level of this advanced technology in sericulture business. The knowledge of technology has found to have greater impact on improving the productivity and production in terms of agriculture as well as its allied activities. This study finds out significant positive impact of variables like, full and partial knowledge about advanced technology and its adoption on the development of the sector. Farmers’ perception about ‘high cost of technology adoption’ and ‘lack of awareness’ are two chief reasons for their non-adoption of the technical advancement. So knowledge and adoption level of advance technology need to be synchronized and extended to base level, making it more cost efficient and easily available to poor farmers and artisans.
O35|An Analysis of Search Results from Institutional Repository: Econpapers|The goal of this research is to examine and explore information retrieval process of patrons who access institutional repositories. Repositories are generally hosted by public universities and run by volunteers which allow researchers to submit their draft versions of their manuscripts in pre-print forms. In this study, we analyze using search methods to sort out research papers classified according to their levels of relevance that are available from a repository, and report the pattern of search results as our findings. Our model employs search methods for searching Econpapers which utilize RePEc bibliographic data. Our analysis attempts to highlight how information seekers, scholars and researchers search relevant topics of their interest and how relevant such information is which is retrieved from an institutional repository. This could aid researchers to modify their search processes to obtain better search results from their queries. The goal is to obtain the most relevant documents from online search. We discuss about the methods employed to retrieve information which is most pertinent to the requirements of researchers. A broad implication could be better utilization of time and resources for efficient retrieval of the most relevant documents of interest that could be expected from searching institutional repositories.
O35|Social Innovation and Social Policy: Empowerment of indigenous women the management of sustainable productive organizations in Vietnam and Mexico|The present proposal, as an area of opportunity, addresses the empowerment of indigenous women, as a mechanism that seeks to achieve the development of management skills of sustainable productive organizations in the short, medium and / or long term, create individual commitment to develop their own potentialities and to generate an answer for their social change and human development. This in support of the strategy to combat poverty and social exclusion, through the development of productive projects, through the management of sustainable productive organizations that seek to improve the living conditions and social position of indigenous women. The importance of the research is that it seeks to deepen the social exclusion processes present in indigenous women, in order to propose alternative solutions in order to overcome their condition of multidimensional poverty and that seek to strengthen the actions for empowerment in the development of their management capacities themselves that are elements that promote the development of sustainable productive organizations.
O35|Social inclusion in an alternative food network: values, practices and tensions|This paper explores challenges a consumer food cooperative must address to combine social inclusion and embeddedness in its urban environment with the food quality standards it targets. While the difficulty in making alternative food networks (AFNs) socially accessible is well documented, little is known about organizational practices that foster inclusion in AFNs. Our research—based on over 100 participant observations of meetings held at the cooperative and on food activities with members of community organizations—has generated insight on how a participative process—through collective decisions, knowledge exchanges and workslot commitments—could facilitate or restrain social inclusion. Our results suggest that promotion of the value of equality for the largest number is hindered by differences in food, material and consumer cultures between cooperative members and non-members. The value of equality for the largest number is pragmatically applied through social inclusion regarding food supply and voluntary work participation.
O35|Local Best Practices for Business Growth|Can best practices of successful business peers influence the efficiency and growth of small-scale enterprises? Does it matter how this information is disseminated? This paper conducts a field experiment among urban retail shop owners in Indonesia to address these research questions. Through extensive baseline quantitative and qualitative assessments, we develop a handbook of local best practices that associates specific business practices with performance and provides detailed implementation guidance informed by exemplary local shop owners. The handbook is distributed to a randomly selected sample of shop owners and is complemented with three experiential learning modules: one group is invited to watch a documentary video on experiences of highly successful peers, another is offered light in-shop assistance on the implementation of the handbook, and a third group is offered both. Eighteen months after the intervention, we find no effect of offering the handbook alone, but significant impact on practice adoption when the handbook is coupled with experiential learning. On business performance we find sizable and significant improvements as well, up to a 35% increase in profits and 16.7% in revenues. The types of practices adopted map these performance improvements to efficiency gains rather than other channels. The analysis suggests these interventions are simple, scalable, and highly cost-effective.
O35|Can Women's Self-Help Groups Contribute to Sustainable Development ? Evidence of Capability Changes from Northern India|This paper investigates a women's self-help group program with more than 1.5 million participants in one of the poorest rural areas of Northern India. The program has four streams of activity in micro-savings, agricultural enterprise training, health and nutrition education, and political participation. The paper considers whether there is any evidence that program membership is associated with quality of life improvement. Using new data on a variety of self-reported capability indicators from members and non-members, the paper estimates propensity score matching models and reports evidence of differences in some dimensions as well as significant benefits to those from the most disadvantaged groups?scheduled castes and tribes. The paper considers robustness and concludes that for some dimensions, there is evidence that the program has contributed to sustainable development through improvements in the quality of life.
O35|Do small bank deposits run more than large ones? Three event studies of contagion and financial inclusion|How susceptible to contagion are bank deposits associated with financial inclusion? To shed light on this question, we analyze the behavior of deposits of different account sizes around three significant bank closures in the Philippines. When we look at the three events by applying difference-in-difference regressions to a dataset that distinguishes between small and large deposits at the town level, we find no evidence that the closure of a large bank leads to withdrawals by depositors at other banks nearby, whether the depositors are large or small. For two of the events, we do find some evidence that depositors, both large and small, anticipate that their bank is about to fail, and they start to withdraw before the bank is closed. With more comprehensive branch-level data for one of the events, we find that a bank closure does lead to reduced deposits at bank branches nearby. All this suggests that, while a bank failure can lead to contagion, the behavior of small depositors is no different from that of large depositors, and thus financial inclusion is unlikely to add to financial instability.
O35|Fanning the Flames of Hate: Social Media and Hate Crime|This paper investigates the link between social media and hate crime using Facebook data. We study the case of Germany, where the recently emerged right-wing party Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) has developed a major social media presence. We show that right-wing anti-refugee sentiment on Facebook predicts violent crimes against refugees in otherwise similar municipalities with higher social media usage. To further establish causality, we exploit exogenous variation in major internet and Facebook outages, which fully undo the correlation between social media and hate crime. We further find that the effect decreases with distracting news events; increases with user network interactions; and does not hold for posts unrelated to refugees. Our results suggest that social media can act as a propagation mechanism between online hate speech and real-life violent crime.Keywords: social media, hate crime, minorities, Germany, AfD JEL Classification: D74, J15, Z10, D72, O35, N32, N34.

O35|La economía social ante los paradigmas económicos emergentes: innovación social, economía colaborativa, economía circular, responsabilidad social empresarial, economía del bien común, empresa social y economía solidaria|The social economy facing emerging economic concepts: social innovation, social responsibility, collaborative economy, social enterprises and solidarity economy. In the last two decades and prominently since the economic crisis and the crisis of legitimacy of the prevailing economic model based on for profit private businesses, a plurality of terms and notions have emerged in the academic field and in the economic and political world. They are concepts such as the social enterprises, the solidarity economy, the collaborative economy, the circular economy, the economy of the common good, the fourth sector, the social innovation and the corporate social responsibility. The objective of this paper is to explain this new wave of notions, to study their meanings and to identify their differences and commonalities in relation to the consolidated concept of social economy. This work is based on the 5 study carried recently for the European Economic and Social Committee (Monzón & Chaves, 2017). Within the framework of the Kuhn's theory of the scientific revolutions, in this paper we have proposed that in the social sciences, major changes in paradigms or scientific revolutions, and with them, changes in the language and concepts that generate a new worldview, are produced simultaneously to the great crisis and socio-economic transformations. In this framework, for the recent history, we have identified two periods of scientific revolutions in the field of the social economy / third sector, which we have called 'conceptual waves' and, between them, a period of normal science. The first wave of concepts appeared in the late seventies and eighties, with the oil crisis. During this first wave, the concepts of the social economy and of the nonprofit emerged. As rival approaches they coexisted as mainstream normal science until the second wave. The second wave of notions came out during the current economic crisis and the legitimization of the prevailing economic model. Other explanatory factors, linked to the sociology of the social scientist and of sociopolitical type, may also have influenced this proliferation of notions, such as the scientist pressure for differentiation and originality, and the positioning of some institutions in favor of some terms and against others. The social economy concept continues to be, with that of nonprofit organizations, the mainstream paradigm to refer to the 'space between the public economy and the private for profit economy'. It has a broad scientific and political consensus regarding its definition, it is well institutionalized and quantified and it has a strong scientific and social notoriety. It is a concept based on structural criteria, such as its social aims, its participatory and democratic decisional criterion and its profit distributive criterion based on the prevalence of people and labor factor over capital. Finally, it is not reduced to a few classical legal forms. Between these two main concepts of the “first wave” there are significant differences in terms of their scope and their structural criteria, as well as in terms of their systemic functions. Their main differences focus on the importance given to the social mission and the democratic criterion in the social economy approach and on the relevance of the distributive criterion, based on the non-distribution constraint, in the second approach. The following conclusions have been obtained from a detailed analysis of the different emerging concepts. First, given its novelty, there is still no broad consensus regarding their definitions. Terminological inflation is then joined by a semantic inflation. Secondly, these notions present are still in an incipient institutionalization process, if we attend their inclusion in official documents or position papers of the European institutions. Thirdly, they still present a low level of academic and social 6 notoriety, measured by their presence in specialized academic search engines, such as Dialnet and Google Scholar. From its semantic comparative analysis with that of the social economy, it can be seen that they are not rival concepts with the latter, but rather complementary and even revitalizing concepts of the social economy concept itself. This conclusion has been reached using the following typology of these concepts: Group 1, notions linked to the main challenges/fields of the system crisis and transformation; Group 2, notions linked to the reorientation of the objectives and governance of organizations and economies, both at the micro and macro level, with new assess and incentive mechanisms; and finally, Group 3, notions linked to new ways of understanding entrepreneurship. In the first group are included the concepts of social innovation, collaborative economy and circular economy, which refer to areas of system transformation such as, respectively, innovation, the digital revolution and the environment. They are transversal areas to the public, business private for-profit sector and third sector, and these paradigms constitute new approaches, both micro and macro, to face the challenges. In the second group are the notions of corporate social responsibility and the common good economy, which refer to the need to establish new mechanisms for evaluating economic performance and new incentive mechanisms that prioritize the social dimension. They are also transversal to the public, for-profit sector and third sector. Finally, the notions of social enterprise, social entrepreneurship, fourth sector and solidary economy are integrated in the third group. These last notions refer to specific entities and enterprises. In the case of social enterprises and the solidarity economy, their proximity to the social economy is maximum, to the point of being considered part of the latter. The importance of the participatory and deliberative dimension of the solidary economy concept has undoubtedly contributed to the emergence in Europe of another new term, integrating both: the 'social and solidarity economy'. In summary, the new notions that have emerged in the context of the crisis of legitimacy of the hegemonic economic model must be considered complementary and even revitalizing with respect to the concept of the social economy.
O35|How Do Nascent Social Entrepreneurs Respond to Rewards? A Field Experiment on Motivations in a Grant Competition|We conducted a field experiment to identify the causal effects of extrinsic incentive cues on the sorting and performance of nascent social entrepreneurs. The experiment, carried out with one of the United Kingdom’s largest support agencies for social entrepreneurs, encouraged 431 nascent social entrepreneurs to submit a full application for a grant competition that provides cash and in-kind mentorship support through a one-time mailing sent by the agency. The applicants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: one group received a standard mailing that emphasized the intrinsic incentives of the program, or the opportunity to do good (Social treatment), and the other two groups received a mailing that instead emphasized the extrinsic incentives - either the financial rewards (Cash treatment) or the in-kind rewards (Support treatment). Our results show that an emphasis on extrinsic incentives strongly affects who applies for the grant and consequently the type of submissions received. The extrinsic reward cues “crowded out” the more prosocial candidates, leading fewer candidates to apply and fewer applicants targeting disadvantaged groups. Importantly, while the full applications submitted by candidates in the extrinsic incentives groups were more successful in receiving the grant, their social enterprises were less likely to be successful at the end of the one-year grant period. Our results highlight the critical role of intrinsic motives to the selection and performance of social enterprises and suggest that using extrinsic incentives to promote the development of successful social enterprises may backfire in the longer run.
O35|Is Equity Crowdfunding a Good Tool for Social Enterprises?|Equity crowdfunding is an emerging financing tool that can help social start-ups and firms to bring people and resources together around a project. This paper focuses on equity crowdfunding. We look at this as a complementary financing channel useful for promoting innovation and social change by paring down the traditional features of financial investment. Our unique dataset regards all the Italian Equity Crowdfunding campaigns launched by different platforms on the Italian equity crowdfunding market from 2013 to 2018. Our aim is twofold: a) to describe some characteristics of the Italian Equity crowdfunding market; b) to describe the characteristics of the social firms which have had recourse to equity crowdfunding, in order to investigate which factors influence the campaign’s success. The results suggest that social firms’ investment offerings are not different from those of non-social ones, but so far, the Italian equity crowdfunding market does not seem suitable for supporting the financial needs of this type of firm, on the side of either investors or firms.
O35|Measuring the Impact of Household Innovation using Administrative Data|We link USPTO patent data to U.S. Census Bureau administrative records on individuals and firms. The combined dataset provides us with a directory of patenting household inventors as well as a time-series directory of self-employed businesses tied to household innovations. We describe the characteristics of household inventors by race, age, gender and U.S. origin, as well as the types of patented innovations pursued by these inventors. Business data allows us to highlight how patents shape the early life-cycle dynamics of nonemployer businesses. We find household innovators are disproportionately U.S. born, white and their age distribution has thicker tails relative to business innovators. Data shows there is a deficit of female and black inventors. Household inventors tend to work in consumer product areas compared to traditional business patents. While patented household innovations do not have the same impact of business innovations their uniqueness and impact remains surprisingly high. Back of the envelope calculations suggest patented household innovations granted between 2000 and 2011 might generate $5.0B in revenue (2000 dollars).
O35|Integration of Migrants, Refugees and Asylum Seekers in Remote Areas with Declining Populations|This paper examines whether immigration can operate as a counter-process of depopulation and economic recession. Based on the comparative analysis of four case studies in Belluno (Italy), Klagenfurt-Villach (Austria), Dalarna (Sweden), and Haßberge (Germany), it analyses the key socio-economic factors explaining the successful integration of migrants, refugees, status holders and asylum seekers and examines under which conditions the arrival of newcomers can turn into a local development opportunity for these territories. The case studies feature four remote territories with the following common characteristics: they have undergone significant socio-economic transformations over the past decade, they face a population decline with an alarming outmigration of youth combined with an increasing ageing population, and central governments have channelled recent immigration and asylum seekers to peripheral areas to counterbalance negative demographic trends. Results show that integration paths undertaken by recipients differ significantly across the four territories. However, all case studies suggest that stable jobs and accommodations render remote and mountain localities attractive for refugees and status holders, who are usually more inclined to move to urban centres. Lastly, results from the case studies highlight the importance of designing individualised integration paths backed by social inclusion initiatives that can incite spontaneous collaborations and work relations with local inhabitants.
O35|OECD 2017 OURdata Index: Methodology and results|This paper presents the methodological process and results of the OECD 2017 Open-Useful-Reusable Government data Index (OURdata Index). It is meant to present the methodology and outline the data collection and verification process; discuss key findings of the composite indicators including overall country scores and scores by pillars and sub-pillars; and show the outcomes of different statistical tests to assess the robustness of the results, including tests to evaluate the sensitivity of the indicators to various weighting schemes. The paper highlights the relevance of the Index to support the design and monitoring of open government data policies and practices leading to socio-economic outcomes and to the improved performance and efficiency of public sector organisations.
O35|The diffusion of a policy innovation in the energy sector: evidence from the collective switching case in Europe|This paper investigates the factors that influence the dissemination of an energy policy innovation, the collective switching, adopting the business ecosystem as unit of analysis. Collective switching is a new phenomenon that recent literature has not yet investigated. It is characterised by a group of people with common characteristics that, through an intermediary, negotiates with the energy suppliers and, thanks to its bargaining power, is able to obtain advantageous contracts. The 6C framework is adopted in order to perform a cross-country analysis oriented to single out differences in the collective switching ecosystems. Through a comparative case study analysis, which examines in rich detail 11 European countriesâ€™ collective switching campaigns, this work provides an accurate description of the collective switching business ecosystem and the ways it reacts to a policy innovation. Semi-structured interviews, conducted with consumer associations that organised collective switching campaigns, provide insights for the definition of some policy interventions.
O35|Sukuk-waqf: The Islamic Solution for Public Finance Deficits|The majority of Muslim countries face increasing pressure on their budget, which pushes to more public spending. Eventually, the main victim of this situation will be the welfare of Muslim communities. Despite Islam does not tolerate negligence regarding the importance of State as major player in preserving the welfare of Muslim communities, it offers a third option to support public effort through the institution of Waqf. Indeed, this institution has played a crucial role all along Muslim civilization and it is invited to more innovation to answer to today’s challenges. Sukuk-Waqf can be seen as the perfect sustainable financing instrument offered by Islam to help sustain public spending by the people and for the people. This paper will try to examine the concept of Waqf, cash Waqf and Sukuk Waqf is Islam and their evolution during Muslim civilization. Finally, it will go through modern attempts to implement this model that can answer the need for financing to support public effort to preserve the welfare of Muslim citizens.
O35|End of Middle-Classes? Social Inequalities in Digital Age|The paper is about a socioeconomics and sociology of middle classes in a theoretical discussion and empirically focussing at “middle class” segments of different European societies for the time period between 2003 and 2014. The argumentation is strongly embedded to Schumpeterian thought of evolutionary economics but it is tried to link discussion about “creative destruction” to digitalization and the evolution of stratified societies in Europe on international comparison. The paper attempts to question assumptions of growing inequality theoretically and empirically by referring to Collins’ thesis of an increased de-middledization. We argue that the ability of ICT innovations (i.e. digitalization) to perform specialized, routine, and predicted tasks better than human allows them to supress middle skilled labor, affect to the polarization of jobs, and finally lead to de-middledization.

O35|New Tendencies in Tourism: The Sharing Economy|Abstract: The sharing economy is a phenomenon that has emerged in the recent years as a response to the technology development, the changing of the peoples' consumption habits, and environmental changes in terms of sustainability. This new economy model has had a rapid rise and has all the chances of becoming the economy that prevails on the market in the coming years. The new economic model has a market orientation and generates new business, new jobs, and growth in economy and income sources. The collaborative economy has also made its mark on the tourism. If the tourist services have been only traditionally provided a few years ago, there has recently been a new tendency in this area, namely to share goods/services. It is important to remember that this type of economy creates values such as trust, transparency, authenticity, and mutual help. This article attempts to highlight how the collaborative economy has put its footprint on the tourism, what are the challenges, benefits and impediments to such an economy.
O35|Future developments in cyber risk assessment for the internet of things|This article is focused on the economic impact assessment of Internet of Things (IoT) and its associated cyber risks vectors and vertices – a reinterpretation of IoT verticals. We adapt to IoT both the Cyber Value at Risk model, a well-established model for measuring the maximum possible loss over a given time period, and the MicroMort model, a widely used model for predicting uncertainty through units of mortality risk. The resulting new IoT MicroMort for calculating IoT risk is tested and validated with real data from the BullGuard's IoT Scanner (over 310,000 scans) and the Garner report on IoT connected devices. Two calculations are developed, the current state of IoT cyber risk and the future forecasts of IoT cyber risk. Our work therefore advances the efforts of integrating cyber risk impact assessments and offer a better understanding of economic impact assessment for IoT cyber risk.

O35|An AB-SFC Model of Induced Technical Change along Classical and Keynesian Lines|This paper introduces the classical idea about the so-called directed and induced technical change (ITC) within a Keynesian demand-side and evolutionary endogenous growth model in order to analyze the interplay among technical change, long-run economic growth and functional income distribution. An ITC process is analyzed within an Agent-Based Stock-Flow Consistent (AB-SFC) model, wherein credit-constrained heterogeneous firms choose both the intensity and the direction of the innovation towards a labor- or capital-saving choice of technique. In the long-run, the model reproduces the so-called Kaldor stylized facts (i.e. with a purely labor-saving technical change), however during the transitional phase the model shows a labor-saving/capital-using innovation pattern, as the aggregate output-capital ratio decreases until it stabilizes in the long-run, as well as declining labor share for long time periods and we can ascribe these evidences mainly to the directed technical change process. In order to stress the effective role of the innovation bias on the model dynamics, we compare the baseline scenario with a counterfactual scenario wherein a neutral technical progress is at work.
O35|L'innovation responsable|The aim of this paper is to present an overview of the « responsible innovation » concept. This concept was first defined at the beginning of the 21st century. It then spread around the world, driven by the European Commission. Firstly, we present the roots of this concept which are based on, on the one hand, the philosophical approach of “researchers and engineers responsibility”, and on the other hand, technological assessment. Then, we describe how the concept of “responsible research and innovation” has grown progressively in European research and innovation politics, in order to bring science and innovation closer to society. Lastly, we describe how this concept is used in companies in connection with their social responsibility. ....French Abstract: L’objectif de ce papier est de réaliser un « état de l’art » portant sur le concept d’ « innovation responsable » apparu au début des années 2000 et diffusé notamment sous l’impulsion de la Commission Européenne. Nous présentons tout d’abord les fondements, de ce concept, en lien avec l’approche philosophique de la responsabilité des chercheurs et ingénieurs, d’une part, les questions relatives à l’évaluation des techniques d’autre part. Puis nous exposons comment le concept de « recherche et innovation responsables » s’est développé progressivement dans les politiques européennes de recherche et d’innovation, afin de rapprocher la science et l’innovation de la société. Enfin, nous relatons comment ce concept est décliné dans les entreprises, en lien avec leur responsabilité sociétale.
O35|Public education expenditure, institution development, and regional innovations: An empirical evidence from China|This paper investigates the relationship between government education expenditure and regional innovation, a key engine of China's long-term economic growth as the nation undergoes massive economic restructuring and deep transformations. In an attempt to inform a whole-of-government approach in promoting indigenous knowledge generation, the authors examined the effect of two additional institutional factors, financial market development and Intellectual Property protection, as well as their interaction with education expenditure on regional innovation levels. By employing a sample of provincial panel data from 1998 to 2014, the authors find a significant positive correlation between education expenditure and regional innovation levels, an effect most pronounced in the Western provinces of China. Their analysis also revealed that financial market development augments the pro-innovation effect of education spending whereas a stronger IP protection regime could potentially mitigate such effect. The findings indicate that government investments in education as well as the creation of a more developed financial landscape will be effective ways to enhance regional innovation levels. However, attention should be paid to the nuances of the current IP protection system as well as the conduct of market players to pre-empt exploitations and enable greater incentives for sustained innovations.

O35|"""Brain gain"" on Wikipedia: Immigrants return knowledge home"|Economic literature acknowledges the impact of immigration on cross-border patenting and scientific publications. However, the role of immigration ows in the dissemination of knowledge in a broader sense is yet to be assessed. In this paper, I estimate the effect of immigration on the facilitation of online knowledge reagrding destination countries in the native languages of immigrants. To quantify online knowledge, I focus on one of the world's most viewed online knowledge platforms, Wikipedia. I combine data on immigration ows between the pairs of immigrants' origin and destination countries with contributions to Wikipedia describing the countries of immigrants' destinations in the languages spoken in immigrants' origin countries. I specifically focus on knowledge domains describing science and culture. In order to draw a causal inference, I use shocks to immigration due to economic and political crises as exogenous shocks to Wikipedia content and analyze subsequent changes in the contributions to Wikipedia. An increase in immigration yields more knowledge contributed to Wikipedia about science and culture in destination countries in the native languages of the origin countries. Interestingly, the increase in contributions is driven by anonymous contributors. In the Wikipedia community, these are considered occasional contributors who care personally about the topics they contribute to. The increase in content generated anonymously is driven by longer contributions.
O35|Community Energy in Italy: Heterogeneous institutional characteristics and citizens engagement|Community energy (CE) initiatives for investments in the energy sector have been progressively spreading across Europe and are increasingly proposed as innovative and alternative approaches to guarantee higher citizens participation in the transition toward cleaner energy systems. This paper focuses the attention on Italy, a Southern European country characterized by relatively low CE sector development. It fills a gap in the literature by eliciting and presenting novel and comprehensive evidence on the recent Italian CE sector development. Through a step-wise approach it systematically map and review Italian CE initiatives, exploring heterogeneity in their institutional characteristics and analysing implications in terms of outcomes delivered and citizens' engagement. It finds a very novel CE sector, still at its niche level and characterized by a wide diversity of implementation approaches. The analysis allows to identify two alternative patterns in institutional characteristics which differently shape citizens engagement and outcomes delivered. The role of policy and its relevance for a renewed CE sector growth is also highlighted and discussed.
O35|Crowdfunding et diasporas?: le financement participatif vient-il remettre en cause les acteurs du financement diasporique'|Crowdfunding is an emerging form of entrepreneurial finance. Financial flows from migrants and their descendants to their homeland are important. Do crowdfunding platforms disrupt this diaspora financial flow ? Our aim is to contrast and compare the literature in sociology of immigration, diaspora and entrepreneurial finance. The study of this new literature and the interviews with key French “Fintechs” entrepreneurs lead us to propose a first description of this market including typologies of diasporas. We also highlight diaspora members’ motivations to invest as well as the trend of evolution of these motivations with the development of crowdfunding. The main results deal with the balance between emotional and rational motivations in the decision to invest for the new generations of immigrants, the competencies that diaspora members give back to their country of origin and the modification of the hierarchy of financing sources due to the possibility to raise money online.

O35|From Proof of Concept to Scalable Policies: Challenges and Solutions, with an Application|"The promise of randomized controlled trials is that evidence gathered through the evaluation of a specific program helps us—possibly after several rounds of fine-tuning and multiple replications in different contexts—to inform policy. However, critics have pointed out that a potential constraint in this agenda is that results from small ""proof-of-concept"" studies run by nongovernment organizations may not apply to policies that can be implemented by governments on a large scale. After discussing the potential issues, this paper describes the journey from the original concept to the design and evaluation of scalable policy. We do so by evaluating a series of strategies that aim to integrate the nongovernment organization Pratham's ""Teaching at the Right Level"" methodology into elementary schools in India. The methodology consists of reorganizing instruction based on children's actual learning levels, rather than on a prescribed syllabus, and has previously been shown to be very effective when properly implemented. We present evidence from randomized controlled trials involving some designs that failed to produce impacts within the regular schooling system but still helped shape subsequent versions of the program. As a result of this process, two versions of the programs were developed that successfully raised children's learning levels using scalable models in government schools. We use this example to draw general lessons about using randomized control trials to design scalable policies."
O35|Les assureurs mutualistes actifs sur le marché de l’assurance municipale en Europe|This presented analysis sought to assess the potential of the European municipal insurance market by looking into its main features and market size. It also weighed the potential impact of new regulatory requirements, in particular the European Commission Directive on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of insurance and reinsurance (Solvency II). An overview of the insurance industry’s performance highlights a strong resilience of the mutual business model relatively to the competing capitalistic model. Mutual insurers in some European markets remain leaders in the market; a result attributable to innovative financial and legal arrangements that were decisive in overcoming challenges pertaining to capital requirements and market access while keeping their mutual DNA. Looking ahead, current macroeconomic imbalances ensure the mutual insurance model a positive outlook, despite headwinds stemming from regulation and other comparative legal disadvantages. As for the specific municipal insurance market, the research identified two major systems of policy issuance: the classical property & casualty (P&C) and life insurance contracts and the fully in-house managed contracts. In terms of outlook, the municipal insurance’s specific features and opportunities make it an area for business expansion where mutual insurers might play a key role
O35|The Design of IEP Sites: Aiming for an Inclusive Economic Participation of Urban Citizens in Flanders|In order to remedy the economic position of socially vulnerable citizens in Flemish cities, the University of Antwerp has launched the concept of an “Inclusive Participation (IEP) site”. According to the CIRIEC workgroup “SSE and territories”, an IEP site can be defined as a particular territorial network that accommodates partners who jointly try to resolve, under the environmental constraints of an urban setting, the challenge of an inclusive economic participation. On the basis of two explorative research projects, the working paper illustrates the fine-tuning of the concept and the development of strategic-spatial blueprints to successfully design and manage these IEP sites.
O35|Cash-Plus: Variants and Components of Transfer-Based Anti-Poverty Programming|Can extensions such as coaching and training augment the poverty relief effects of cash transfers, or do they unnecessarily constrain the agency of recipients in the allocation of program resources? We use a randomized trial to estimate the impacts of philosophically distinct variants of transfer-based poverty reduction approaches in rural Uganda. One is a microenterprise intervention in the spirit of so-called graduation programming that provides beneficiaries with an integrated package of cash transfers, coaching, and training on sustainable livelihoods; the other variant monetizes the cost of coaching and training so as to more than double the size of cash transfers. We also we evaluate the merits of more marginal individual extension components, involving savings group formation in the microenterprise variant and light-touch behavioral intervention (involving goal-setting and plan-making) in the cash variant. Overall, we build confidence that investing program resources in productive extensions can expand poverty reduction. We gain elevated confidence in the impacts and cost-effectiveness of the fully integrated microenterprise intervention.
O35|Cash-Plus: Poverty Impacts of Transfer-Based Intervention Alternatives|Can programmatic extensions such as training and mentorship enhance the economic impact of cash transfers, or do they needlessly absorb resources that program recipients could allocate more meaningfully by themselves? Using a randomized trial, we evaluate a program that targets poor Ugandans and offers them an integrated package comprised of lump sum transfers, coaching, and training on microenterprise development as well as savings group formation. We assess its impact and that of its savings component, as well as the impacts of much simplified program variants: one intervention variant that is limited to lump sum cash transfers and another that expands upon transfers using a light-touch behavioral intervention component. The results support the notion that integrated development interventions are sensible poverty reduction tools.
O35|Creating change through pilot and demonstration projects: Towards a valuation policy approach|Beyond R&D and competitiveness theories of innovation, various conceptual broadenings have recently been proposed to tackle the complex, multidimensional and multi-level dynamics of innovation at stake in the transformation of the economy and society towards new sustainable development regimes. This paper proposes a reading of these conceptual broadenings as a matter of ‘valuation’. In line with pragmatic theories of socio-economic value and market construction, it is argued that value creation is not the result or byproduct of innovation. In contrast to traditional regulation and R&D policies, which confine themselves to framing innovation, valuation policies are endogenous triggers of the transformation of a value regime. Value creation is about inquiring into new values in society, translating them into social and technological solutions and making them valuable in markets. In this perspective, pilot and demonstration (P&D) projects in current transition policies can be interpreted as fundamental inceptions of new values that are not predetermined by innovation but actuated through complex processes of value co-creation in society and markets, and which engage policies as agents of change. By focusing on the purpose behind the sustainability transition rather than the factors that contribute to it, a valuation policy approach offers new insights for future research and policy.
O35|Features of Social and Economic Transformations in the Globalization Era|The article looks into some of the features of social and economic transformations in the globalization era. Due to a number of economic and political processes encompassing all countries, it becomes obvious that the humankind faces the beginning of the drastic historical changes and the world new integrity. The main idea of the article is the idea of principal impossibility of social and economic processes of absolute unification, averaging and simplification of the social systems in the globalization era. The authors’ conviction is based on understanding the fact that in the globalization era the social relations system is being formed, where due to essential processes the different forms of social times and socio-spatial formations interact. Even a cursory glance reveals the whole specter of social organisms represented by both present and past history: ranging from the primitive forms to the semi-feudal one, from the quite traditional relations to the industrial and post-industrial ones. Despite great difference all existing countries while interacting with each other create social context of globalization. In the frame of this process the new integrity of the modern state of the society as the universum is happening. In terms of the social philosophy this universum is understood as active non-line environment where various social spheres emerge and evolve: modern integrative production, information flows including high technology industry, business and other components where the culture is to play the leading role as the way of life of a human being and society. The authors insist, the genesis of modern social systems is extremely interesting scientific issue, its consideration may be not only significant for the science itself, but can be applied in particular for the social relations management.
O35|The Role of Human Factors in the Bank Capital Evaluation Framework|The article assesses various versions of «Bank capital» definitions, and the own bank capital definition is suggested by authors. It assumes that bank capital is a monetary value of the bank’s debts and equities. Milestones of managing the bank capital such as formation and application are provided in the paper. Two groups of bank capital users such as external and internal stakeholders are highlighted. The key-note of the paper is defining the role of human capital in evaluating the bank capital. Human capital is suggested to play positive and negative role through the whole bank capital evaluation. Both subjective pros and cons of the human factor are revealed in the paper. Typical errors such as low-skilled staff, non-flexible mind, inconsistent risk policy in decision-making, deficient analytical framework, lack of useful forecasting are defined. Authors also defined a set of advantages of the human factors such as: quality education, professional skills, professional development, and diplomatic, highly analytical and independent mind, stress tolerance, and so on. The paper highlights the concept that entities’ benefits which are in evaluating the bank capital could be structured in importance and effect of the parties concerned. The hierarchical framework of interests completely depends on the person arranging the framework. The paper stresses that interests of the parties concerned should be listed in the bank capital’s evaluation policy. A set of key indicators such as capital profitability rate, adequacy ratio to highlight stakeholders’ interests are defined. Key features of bank capital management are described. Objectives of internal and external stakeholders’ activity are defined. The set of factors indicating the impact of human factors on evaluating the bank capital are discussed.

O35|Is Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program Enhancing Dependency?|Although development intervention programs can have far-reaching impacts beyond their stated objective, there have been few careful studies of unintended outcomes of such programs. This study assesses the impact of Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) on household size and dependency ratio using the difference in differences method based on a panel data of four rounds over 12 years. Results show that member households in the PSNP have built a larger household size and dependency ratio than non-member households. These results are not only unintended by program designers but also worrisome as they potentially jeopardize the viability of the program in achieving its stated objective of enabling member households come out of poverty.
O35|Mapping and Analysis of ICT-enabled Social Innovation initiatives promoting social investment across the EU: IESI Knowledge Map 2016|This report presents the results of the analysis of the consolidated mapping of ICT-enabled social innovation initiatives promoting social investment gathered as part of the research project entitled 'ICT-Enabled Social Innovation to support the Implementation of the Social Investment Package' (IESI). The dataset includes 613 initiatives inventoried over the course of the research, out of which 300 have been mapped and are part of the IESI Knowledge Map 2016. The results of the analysis of the IESI mapping is meant to help policymakers and practitioners to use ICT-enabled social innovation to modernise EU welfare states, providing better and more efficient social services and increasing the skills, wellbeing and resilience of EU citizens. In this perspective, the documented research design, its proposed terminology, theoretical framework and findings contribute to the growing scientific interest and debate about ICT-enabled social innovations in the field of social services innovation and social policy redesign within the scope of the emerging discussion on the European Pillar of Social Rights and the future of welfare systems.
O35|Exploring the role of ICT-Enabled Social Innovation to support the modernisation of EU Social Protection Systems: findings and insights from analysis of case studies in fourteen Member States|This report presents the results of the analysis of selected case studies on how ICT-enabled social innovations promoting social investment can contribute to the modernisation of social protection systems in the EU. The case studies are drawn from 14 different Member States and address diverse social services and policy domains. Evidence from the analysis points to the strong potential of using new approaches based on ICT-enabled social innovation to support public authorities, at various governance levels, in their efforts to improve the effectiveness and impact of social services delivery mechanisms and outreach. The analysis makes a first attempt to assess the relationship between different typologies of ICT-enabled social innovation and the broader social protection system in which they are embedded. However, more research is needed to better understand the potential impact these initiatives could have on enhancing the adequacy and sustainability of welfare systems in the EU.
O35|JRC Insights - Social Policy Innovation Series - Innovating EU Social Protection Systems through ICTs. Findings from analysis of case studies in fourteen Member States|This issue presents results from the analysis of selected case studies on how ICT-enabled social innovations promoting social investment can contribute to the modernisation of social protection systems in the EU. The selected case studies are drawn from fourteen Member States and address diverse social services and policy domains. Findings from the research show that they have made a positive contribution to transforming existing social services models, with ICT-enabled social innovation playing a crucial role, either as an enabler or game changer. The analysis illustrates examples of how ICTs can provide solutions to those global societal challenges that are adding new complexities to the delivery of social services; in particular, ICTs can help building a â€˜client pathwayâ€™ approach, with services centred on the needs of the beneficiaries. At a more operational level, the simplification and automation of procedures increases access to services and fosters a direct relationship between service providers and users. Innovative policies encouraging the development of ICT solutions for the management of social protection systems and the delivery of social services should thus be promoted; to this end, specific incentive schemes to guarantee development, sustainability and transferability of those initiatives that generate social value by leveraging on ICTs shall be identified and fostered across the EU. At the same time, high levels of digitalization in the services delivery system must be balanced with alternative channels, to ensure that the less technologically savvy are not excluded. For this purpose, it is crucial to involve citizens and relevant stakeholders right from the early stages of social policy programming, and the creation of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and partnerships with third sector organisations should be encouraged.
O35|ICT-Enabled Social Innovation for Active and Healthy Ageing: Redesigning long-term care and independent living in Europe|This issue of JRC Insights presents results from the analysis of initiatives and case studies on ICT-enabled social innovations promoting social investment in the field of Active and Healthy Ageing (AHA) conducted as part of the JRC-led IESI research, in collaboration with DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion. It highlights how over 70% of the initiatives in the field of AHA promote social investment by supporting the modernisation of social protection systems as well as by supporting investment in people throughout their lives. It also reveals that AHA initiatives are frequently characterised by radical innovation potential and higher integration at the service level, often combining funding, administrative and service delivery systems. Finally, the article illustrates how ICTs drive the organizational transformation of service delivery, by reducing overlaps and strengthening integration among service providers. In addition, they increase efficiency and reduce costs by improve targeting and personalisation of services.
O35|i-FRAME â€“ Assessing impacts of social policy innovation in the EU: Proposed methodological framework to evaluate socio-economic returns on investment of social policy innovations|This report presents the final proposal for developing a methodological framework to assess the impacts generated by social policy innovations which promote social investment in the EU, in short i-FRAME. This framework has the objective to provide a structured approach that shall serve as a comprehensive framework for conducting analysis of the economic and social returns on investments of social policy innovations. It also aims to act as a guide to gather insights into replicability and transferability of initiatives which promote social investment across the EU. The report outlines the reviewed and improved theoretical and methodological approach developed by the JRC with help from external experts, and validated by testing the operational components proposed on a number of case studies and scenarios of use. After outlining the conceptual and methodological approach underpinning the i-FRAME (V1.0), the report discusses the proposal for building its operational components according to a structured theoretical framework of a dynamic simulation model for social impact assessment (V1.5). The final proposal for i-FRAME (V2.0) and an overview of the operational components for its implementation are then presented discussing the key elements that should be developed to build a comprehensive i-FRAME Web-Platform and simulator for social impact assessment. Conclusions are then offered in terms of implications for policy and directions for future research. These were drawn after consulting experts from different research disciplines, practitioners and representatives of relevant stakeholders and policymakers, and they include .recommendations for further developing the operational components proposed, paving the way towards building the i-FRAME (V3.0) and beyond.
O35|The potential and impact of ICT-enabled Social Innovation to promote social investment in the EU|This report presents the results of the JRC-led research on â€˜ICT-enabled Social Innovation to support the implementation of the Social Investment Packageâ€™ (IESI) conducted in partnership with the Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion. The IESI research is set out to help policymakers and practitioners use ICT-enabled social innovation to modernise welfare systems, provide better and more efficient social services, and ultimately increase the wellbeing and quality of life of citizens. The original research design, its theoretical framework and empirical findings contribute to the growing scientific interest on ICT-enabled social innovation in the field of social policy reforms, within the scope of the implementation of the social investment approach. Based on the analysis of evidence gathered through a documented collection of initiatives across the EU, the research also advances a proposal for developing a methodological framework to assess the social and economic impact of ICT enabled social innovation. The approach proposed is expected to support policymakers and relevant stakeholders in designing, monitoring and evaluating ICT-enabled social innovation initiatives, which could be transferred, scaled-up and replicated across Europe. Insights from the research contribute to the policy debate on the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights and the future of the Welfare State in the EU.
O35|On-ramping: following women scientists and engineers through their transition from nonacademic to faculty careers|Abstract A popular strategy for increasing women faculty in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) departments is to hire from other universities, but this strategy fails to increase the number of women faculty nationally. This research investigates a new approach to faculty recruitment called “on-ramping,” the process by which women with PhDs leverage their nonacademic careers and enter academia as faculty members. This study follows women scientists and engineers from their non-academic to faculty career and analyzes their experiences transgressing the boundaries of STEM knowledge production sites. We used qualitative methods to collect and analyze semi-structured interviews about the experiences of ten female PhDs who successfully on-ramped into faculty positions with the support of a feminist professional community. Our data revealed four phases of on-ramping that characterized the transition to academia for our participants. Attention to gender in on-ramping also highlights concerns that span the personal and the professional in women scientists and engineers’ lives. By illuminating cultural and political practices in STEM sites of knowledge production and the effects of feminist interventions on women’s experiences of producing knowledge in STEM fields, this study offers a unique perspective that can elucidate the strengths and weaknesses of these sites, especially in regards to gender politics and knowledge production.
O35|Earthquake hazard in Italy Cluster analysis of socio-economic data to inform place-based policy measures|The Italian Government launched the Piano Casa Italia immediately after the series of massive earthquakes that struck Central Italy in 2016, following the 2009 earthquake in L'Aquila and the one in 2012 in Emilia-Romagna. The cumulative impact of human loss-es and economic and social uncertainty produced by the last disaster in 2016 has spurred political decision-makers to advocate an ambitious long-term intervention, aimed at re-structuring Italian public buildings and houses over the next decades. Italy has experi-enced only one other era of similar schemes with the controversial interventions lasting for more than thirty years of the Cassa del Mezzogiorno, which started in the 1950s to cope with the country's dual economic condition. Since then, no other long-term ambi-tious plan has been attempted in Italy and a similar planning perspective is nowadays far from the experience of most public managers, policy makers and even scholars of eco-nomics and development. The ongoing challenges that the Piano Casa Italia has to face are multifaceted: political, economic and social. Challenges pertaining to the agents asked to design the scheme, to implement it and to accept it. The overall perspective of structur-al change will mark its implementation. This paper is a first contribution within a broader framework to outline the conditions characterizing those challenges and the paths of change that will be initiated by realizing the Plan. The paper suggests taking an analytical perspective to support informed policy measures, in four complementary domains: emergency (National Civil Protection), recov-ery (Struttura Commissariale), risk reduction (Piano Casa Italia), socio-economic devel-opment (National Strategy for Inner Areas). The present contribution starts with a prelim-inary step, in line with the Sendai Framework for disaster risk reduction (UNISDR 2015): a detailed analysis of the socio-economic, demographic and geographic conditions across Italian territorial areas, at a municipality level. This work explicitly aims to single out these features, by focusing both on seismic zones and on regions. The paper also returns the results of a cluster analysis performed at municipality level across Italy and concludes discussing some implications for place-based policy interventions.
O35|Earthquake hazard in Italy Cluster analysis of socio-economic data to inform place-based policy measures|The Italian Government launched the Piano Casa Italia immediately after the series of massive earthquakes that struck Central Italy in 2016, following the 2009 earthquake in L'Aquila and the one in 2012 in Emilia-Romagna. The cumulative impact of human loss-es and economic and social uncertainty produced by the last disaster in 2016 has spurred political decision-makers to advocate an ambitious long-term intervention, aimed at re-structuring Italian public buildings and houses over the next decades. Italy has experi-enced only one other era of similar schemes with the controversial interventions lasting for more than thirty years of the Cassa del Mezzogiorno, which started in the 1950s to cope with the country's dual economic condition. Since then, no other long-term ambi-tious plan has been attempted in Italy and a similar planning perspective is nowadays far from the experience of most public managers, policy makers and even scholars of eco-nomics and development. The ongoing challenges that the Piano Casa Italia has to face are multifaceted: political, economic and social. Challenges pertaining to the agents asked to design the scheme, to implement it and to accept it. The overall perspective of structur-al change will mark its implementation. This paper is a first contribution within a broader framework to outline the conditions characterizing those challenges and the paths of change that will be initiated by realizing the Plan. The paper suggests taking an analytical perspective to support informed policy measures, in four complementary domains: emergency (National Civil Protection), recov-ery (Struttura Commissariale), risk reduction (Piano Casa Italia), socio-economic devel-opment (National Strategy for Inner Areas).

O35|Il contributo di Marx a una critica del determinismo tecnologico. Premesse per una ontologia critica dell’innovazione|Despite the criticism of being a technological determinist, Marx provides deep ontological foundations for a critique of technological determinism. The essay elaborates on this thesis with three interrelated arguments. The first one refers to the three elements of Marx's analysis that can contribute to a critical ontology, which allows us to think of social reality as constructed by human activity as such: the notion of work as social praxis; the meaning of fetishism of commodities and its implications; the relationship between quantity, quality and transformation processes. The second argument aims at showing how changes in the characteristics and functions of the division of labour, and the transition itself to the capitalist mode of production, are not reducible, in Marx, to an adaptation to new technological conditions. The third argument draws attention to the need for a critical ontology of innovation as emerging from human activity as such. Grounded on Marx's analysis, the paper concludes on how the notion of work as social praxis, the relationship between quantity and quality and the critical perspective of the fetishism of commodities refer to a complex, and ontologically endogenous, theory of the processes of change.
O35|Inclusive labour Markets in the digital era: The case of Austria|Digitalisation is one of the megatrends affecting societies and labour markets, alongside demographic change and globalisation. The fourth industrial revolution will redesign production processes and alter the relationships between work and leisure, capital and labour, the rich and the poor, the skilled and the unskilled. The degree of disruption induced by the technological transformation ahead largely depends on the policy framework. Digitalisation can lead to anything between soaring inequalities and widespread improvements of living and working conditions. Two main questions arise for policy makers: how to ensure equality of opportunities in the race with technology and how to find the appropriate level of redistribution of the gains associated with digitalisation to preserve social cohesion. Against this backdrop, this working paper will analyse the technology-induced transformation of labour markets, argue for a new social contract and discuss how the provision and use of skills need to adapt to the digital work environment. This working paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of Austria (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-austria.htm).
O35|Culture in local and regional development: A Mediterranean perspective on the culture/economy nexus|This policy paper discusses the direct and indirect role of culture as a driver of local and regional development. It identifies the interactions between local framework conditions, culture, creative industries, culturally relevant products and local development, and discusses the systemic role of culture in translating local framework conditions such as diversity, creativity and experimentation into local or regional development impacts such as economic growth and employment. Case studies from two Mediterranean countries, Cyprus and Israel, illustrate the link between culture and local development. In the final part of the paper, conclusions for local and regional policy are drawn and key recommendations are presented with a particular focus on Mediterranean countries.
O35|Living labs – instruments of social innovation in rural areas|In a country where nearly half the population lives in rural areas, it is difficult to link concepts such as smart cities, Internet of Things to the local government’s priority list. However, lately there have been numerous initiatives to improve access to information using ICT in the rural communities as well. The purpose of this article is not to exhaustively measure the already adopted means, but merely to provide a series of items retrieved as barriers to ICT projects meant to develop these communities. Following the studies conducted so far (in Romania there are about 2,700 communes – the lowest administrative entities of our country), it was observed that the digital divide is found in 100% of these areas. At the urban level – especially in the big cities, pilot projects for developing digital literacy among the elder population had a relatively high success. Such programs have been initiated at the level of the communes whose living standard is higher (the ones that are located near large cities). Their successes, though certainly less visible than in the urban communities, are noteworthy. Most such programs have targeted educational and health fields. The article we propose aims to show these programs’ implementation degree in Romania, providing as examples the most successful cases that help the social innovation process. The intention with which we start this study is to create a list of objectives that the initiators of these programs have to take into account during the preparation of those programs.
O35|Promoting social innovation in rural areas through living labs|In Romania, nearly half the population lives in rural areas, therefore it is difficult to associate concepts like smart cities and Internet of Things to the local government’s priority list. Nonetheless, recently there have been various initiatives to increase access to information using ICT methods in the rural communities as well. The purpose of this paper is not to exhaustively measure the already adopted means, but simply to provide a series of items considered barriers to ICT projects meant to contribute to these communities’ development. By researching the studies conducted so far (in Romania, there are about 2700 communes, these being the lowest administrative units), it was observed that the digital divide is found in 100% of these areas. At the urban level, mainly in the big cities, pilot projects for developing digital literacy among the senior population had a relatively high success. This type of programs has been initiated at the level of the communes with higher living standards, generally the ones located near large cities. Their success, though surely less visible than in the cities, is notable. The majority of these programs have the educational and health fields as targets. This article aims to show these programs’ implementation degree in Romania, providing as examples the most successful cases that help the social innovation process. The intention is to generate a list of objectives that the initiators of these programs have to take into consideration during the programs’ preparatory process.
O35|Collaborative learning as a tool for social innovation|The innovative pedagogy is enhanced by learning and teaching or training programmes focused on social innovation and social entrepreneurship. In this context, the academic capacity building represents a fundamental element. This paper aims to present a framework of developmental traditions that have a great influence on collective learning in order to be used as a way to boost social innovation. It shows the literature that focuses on collaborative learning and how it can be used as an instrument to boost social innovation. The methodology used to carry out the research is both bibliographic – opting here to study the work of specialists in the field, authors from Romania and abroad, and empirical – thus the theoretical approach is supported through relevant case studies from the European context and conclusions. The present and future generations will make a difference in the society they live in, with the help of the academic learning and teaching courses, when more institutions oriented on education take into consideration this type of development process. The results of this paper will show that social media tools have an important role in this context, therefore educational institutions should build spaces adapted for community learning, by using platforms and fields to which students, local communities, different stakeholders, public and private organizations have access and through which they can have the possibility to organize meetings of common interest regarding the education issue. We have identified that although technology is a main element in all life’s activities, there should also be taken into consideration the capability and willingness of individuals and institutions to cooperate and innovate, not only by electronic means, but also through traditional ways of participating in the development process of a society.
O35|Entwicklung und Stand von Bürgerenergiegesellschaften und Energiegenossenschaften in Deutschland<BR>[Development and State of Community Energy Companies and Energy Cooperatives in Germany]|In the paper, the authors describe an estimation of the number and development of community energy companies and energy cooperatives in Germany. The analysis is based on two databases that are maintained by the authors. An increase in the number of new community energy companies in Germany can be observed until 2014. In 2014 at the latest, the number of newly founded energy cooperatives decreased. The decline could only partly be compensated by an increase in the number of limited partnerships with a limited liability company as general partner (GmbH & Co. KG). This shift from the cooperative model to the limited partnership model is linked to a shift in the predominant electricity generation technology. An increase in onshore wind energy can be observed while photovoltaics had to struggle with a shrinking market. Moreover, more bankruptcies and liquidations have been observed since 2009 for community energy companies and energy cooperatives. The existing community energy companies are mostly producing electricity while only a smaller group runs energy grids, especially for heat distribution (small district heating networks). The main focus of community energy companies and energy cooperatives lays on the production of energy through onshore wind and photovoltaics. Bavaria, Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia are the regional core areas of these companies.
O35|Principle-agent analysis of technology project (LINCOS) in Costa Rica|In this paper we analyze the institutional arrangement between various actors to understand how ICT project objectives flow among actors in a standard LINCOS project and how they would affect the sustainability and effectiveness of LINCOS in particular and an ICT project in general. Since there are many actors involved in different stages and processes of a single LINCOS project, the paper analyses the bilateral and multilateral relationships among these actors to understand the factors that might affect the efficiency of the ICT project. In other words the paper looks at the actors involved in a LINCOS project in an effort to capture those circumstances under which a LINCOS project is exposed to principal- agent problems.
O35|Technology case study: Virtual lifestyles and sustainable economic development|The paper analyses the opportunity cyber space and virtual technologies provide for improvement of lifestyles of rural and urban poor in developing countries. The paper floats the term ‘virtual tourism’ that suggests that developing countries can connect with each other and the developed world through world wide web and provide opportunities of cultural, economic and social exchange between populations through development and facilitation of locally developed virtual applications and technologies that has partly created the social media outlets like face book and Twitter and commerce spaces like Amazon and Ali Baba.
O35|Stimularea creativității, inovării și transferului tehnologic în universități<BR>[Stimulating creativity, innovation and technology transfer in universities]|In the digital age in which we live today, the way and the channels through which information is transmitted determines the need to develop all areas of activity, adapting them to the needs and demands of the individuals that today form the so-called knowledge-based societies or, and more specifically, informational. Obviously, universities are part of the category of institutions that need to offer their services in a cheaper, simpler and faster way. Objectives: This paper aims to provide a specific framework through which universities can contribute to the stimulation of creativity, which will lead to the creation or improvement of innovations, all enjoying the transmission of data through technology. Approach: The article was based on a bibliographic research of the specialized papers addressing the complex subject of creativity, innovation and technological transfer, the final part of which constituted a case study that gathers information provided by students from different study cycles through a questionnaire on the subject. Results: The use of current technologies highlights their importance in stimulating creativity, leading to beneficial innovations both for the academic environment and for society as a whole, and in this way can be developed and improved the relationship between the public administration, the citizens and the private sector, to which their needs will be taken into account and their requirements will be met in a much more efficient way than would be the case of traditional means.
O35|Social innovation labs – instrumente de schimbare socială<BR>[Social innovation labs – instruments of social change]|In an era in which society is increasingly based on knowledge and digital technologies have become indispensable to day-to-day activities, social change becomes a problem whose solving can no longer wait for postponement. Objectives: This paper aims to provide a framework for the development of social innovation labs as tools of social change, social innovation bringing innumerable benefits to individuals' lives. Preliminary studies: The paper presents a part of the specialized literature focusing on the concept of social innovation, focusing on social innovation laboratories. Approach: The methodology used for carrying out the research is bibliographic - opting for studying the works of the specialists in the field, both from Romania and abroad, as well as empirical - by building a case study on examples of good practices regarding these living labs. Results: Through social innovation labs, individuals form connections with each other, mobilizing themselves to achieve a common goal - to create a better future. Value: Research shows that social innovation laboratories behave like normal laboratories, so they invent and experiment in finding solutions to the challenges of today's world. Often they generate promising solutions. However, for these solutions to be successful, it must not be forgotten that the essential element is the human component. Therefore, there must be taken into account the capacity and willingness of individuals to collaborate, not only by electronic means, but also by the traditional methods of participation in the process of social change through innovation.
O35|Inovação e desenvolvimento territorial: temas emergentes para a geografia econômica brasileira e latino-americana<BR>[Innovation and territorial development: emerging themes for Brazilian and Latin-American economic geography]|The aim of this paper is to debate some proposals to territorial development in Brazil and other Latin American countries based in the current world framework of technical changes. In this framework an essential aspect for any attempt of development is to promote technological innovation processes which must be appropriated for these nations. For this to happen, we presented and discussed the following elements: the role of urban agglomerations (metropolis and cities) and universities, the understanding of society’s perception about science and innovation, and the necessity of a fully social and economic inclusion of population.
O35|Importance of Creativity of Employees in Adaptation of Food Companies to Innovative Trends in the World|The purpose of this paper is to identify a gap in knowledge and understanding of the need to motivate employees for creative and pro-innovation activities in the organization. Another aim is to provide an overview of innovation in one of the low-tech industries - in the food industry. The concept of innovation and creativity is presented. The characteristics of the concept of creativity have been briefly described. Then examples of ways how food companies are dealing with current trends in the area of innovation in the world are briefly described. Among these trends, the focus on radical innovations has been highlighted, more tightly aligned firm innovation and business strategies, better insight into customers' needs and increased collaboration with other entities. Analyses based on the desk research technique were performed with the inclusion of literature regarding the examples of implementation of innovations in the food sector companies. The conducted analyses allowed us to confirm that exemplary food companies are actively engaged in improving their competitive position, by introducing creative solutions in their products or by new ways of organizing different processes. It has been shown that creativity should be used as the primary source of innovation in the food industry.
O35|Социальный Капитал И Организационная Культура – Потенциал Для Модернизации Сельского Хозяйства: Практика Изучения, Предложения<BR>[Social capital and organizational culture-potential for modernization of agriculture: study practice, proposals]|Abstract. Social capital and organizational behavior of the population are considered as important factors determining the socio-economic dynamics of agriculture. Assessment of the relationship of organizational behavior and culture, the situation in a particular society, country, region by typology G. Hofstede is the basis to judge the state of social capital, as it is crucial for economic and political transformation, which is implemented in the process of reforming society, purposeful changes in the institutional and, as a rule, the modernization of the technological environment or technological environment. These two types of reforms are interrelated: - if the institutional environment is well developed and successfully maintains market relations (property rights, competition, protection of contracts), then technological modernization goes smoothly, an intensive flow of innovations is formed, the economy is growing. There is a link between the dynamics of fundamental values and quantitative indicators of socio-economic development of society. In the proposed work, specific studies of the agricultural economy of the region, the influence of social capital, cultural parameters on the modernization processes in the industry. Proposals are made for the creation of social capital, modernization, institutional development.
O35|Numerical Computation of Flow Reattachment Lengthovera Backward-Facing Step at High Reynolds Number|Investigation of flow separation and reattachment length over a backward facing step are such as the subjects of fundamental fluid dynamics research. The purpose this study is measurement of reattachment length on backward facing step. For this purpose, unsteady flow over a step was simulated in a 2-D by using Computational Fluid Dynamic. Then, secondary flow was added to the 1/3 height of step. In order to, the effect of angles of 15°, 30°, 45° and 90°, expansion ratios of 1.5, 2, 3 and 4, pressure coefficient and Reynolds number with 75000 over backward facing stepwere investigated. To verify the numerical model, the velocity profile using different turbulence models was compared with experimental values in a sudden expansion. The results showed that RNG k-ε turbulent model was selected as the most suitable model to predict recirculation flow over backward facing step. The results of numerical analysis indicated that the reattachment length increase with increasing step angle, expansion ratio and Reynolds number. Also with increasing Reynolds number, when secondary flow is added to 1/3 height of step, the eddy diameters and the length of recirculation flow zone decrease. Moreover, increasing pressure coefficient led to increasing the reattachment length.
O35|Review of information systems research for media industry–recent advances, challenges, and introduction of information systems research in the media industry|Abstract Global media reports clearly show a tremendous increase in spending on Information Technology (IT) and Information Systems (IS) in the media sector. Two main trends are currently visible. First, as stated in McKinsey & Company’s Global Media Report, consumers continuously shift from spending on traditional media products towards rapidly-increasing spending on digital services and media products – consumer patterns have rapidly changed. Second, as stated in Gartner’s reports about the media industry, spending on IT services in the media industry increases gradually, and as a whole, the media industry is the third-largest spender on IT, after banking/finance and manufacturing. Third, as reported by both authors in their works, several facets of the media industry have undergone extreme changes, including business models, declining revenue, content models, management, economics and public funding. The aim of this study is to investigate research work related to IS in the media industry, in particular in the management and economic areas. To conduct this study, we investigated a large corpus of studies that have been contributed to IS research within the Association for Information Systems (AIS) within the past decades. We utilised advanced text mining methods to identify contributions and thematic areas. Our results clearly indicate that there is a significant downward trend of research works dealing with media industry aspects. This trend was a surprise to us, as it contradicts the emergence of new digital technologies which became key drivers in the media industry after 2009. We conclude this article by giving research directions, illustrating the opportunities and importance of investigating media industries within the context of IS, and introducing the research field of Information Systems in the eMedia Industry.
O35|Green-oriented Knowledge Transfers in global markets: technologies, capabilities, institutions|The development of green technologies represents a key driver in the transition towards environmentally sustainable societies. Among environmental challenges, the implementation of national climate policies and international efforts to face the threat of climate change has been particularly effective at triggering the production of climate-friendly innovation in developed countries. This effectiveness has been acknowledged by several studies which observed that, for example, the production of patents related to renewable energy technologies has sharply increased over the last decades. However, the battle against climate change is far from being over. As the share of greenhouse gases emissions in developing countries is sharply growing, how to promote the transfer of available green technologies to these countries is one of the main challenges that policymakers are facing in recent years. Understanding the mechanisms behind technology transfer of “environmental” knowledge and how such transfer happens among countries with heterogeneous economic conditions and different capabilities is a complex exercise. In this report we provide an overview of the literature on green knowledge transfer and, more importantly, on how such literature can be strengthened to deepen the understanding of the interactions that are at stake. The conceptual analysis is aimed at offering a platform to set in-field projects with stakeholders (research/business oriented), to concretely implement the elaboration and general best practice identification for knowledge and technology transfers in the green economy transition.
O35|The Modern Agricultural Cooperative: A Cognitive-Knowledge-Based Approach|The new agri-food market scenario is considered a detrimental factor for the competitiveness and financial equilibria of the agricultural cooperatives. According to this vision, as a result of the saturation and globalization process, the shift of the specific investment at the forward level of the supply chain (i.e., for the brand development, or for R&D activities) would be a serious threat for the cooperative model. These assumptions come from a transaction cost and property rights-based framework. The results of these studies are surely insightful and valuable, but they should be integrated with the strengths in terms of knowledge integration (and coordination) assured by the agricultural cooperative model. This work is aimed at updating the function/justification of modern agricultural cooperatives. Firstly, a theoretical contribution mingling the knowledge-based theory of the firm with the social innovation approach in agriculture will be defined. Secondly, two case studies will be discussed.
O35|Una Visione Knowledge-based della Cooperativa Agricola: Il Caso Sant�Orsola|Sant�Orsola � una cooperativa agricola situata nella provincia di Trento, un�area del Nord-Est Italia che rappresenta l�1 per cento dell�intero territorio nazionale. In Italia Sant�Orsola � l�azienda leader nel commercio dei piccoli frutti, con una quota di mercato che si aggira attorno al 45 per cento. Questo caso di studio mette in evidenza le potenzialit� che la cooperativa agricola pu� avere nello sviluppare e favorire un�organizzazione sociale della produzione e diffusione di conoscenza e innovazione in agricoltura. Sant�Orsola � stata infatti in grado di sviluppare una serie di principi organizzativi (un linguaggio e un codice standard) funzionali all�integrazione di conoscenze strategiche per la produzione dei piccoli frutti. Questo lavoro fa emergere quindi un possibile vantaggio inesplorato della forma cooperativa nel settore agroalimentare.
O35|Role of WASH and Agency in Health: A study of isolated rural communities in Nilgiris and Jalpaiguri|The objective of the Swachh Bharath Mission (SBM) or Clean India Mission of the Indian Government is to eliminate open defecation in India through installation of toilets and triggering of behavioural change by 2019. The problem is most daunting in isolated communities with poor WASH infrastructure and local agencies with scarce resources. In India, tribal communities, living near forests and along mountain ranges are among the most isolated, which means that the study of the impact of WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene behaviour) and the effectiveness of local agencies responsible for public hygiene in such communities is pertinent for our research query. Thus, this working paper presents the results of a study of 20 villages located in two districts, Nilgiris and Jalpaiguri, in two distinct Indian states - Tamil Nadu and West Bengal respectively. The central research question is: What is the role of WASH infrastructure and capabilities and local agencies in containing the incidence of excreta related diseases in isolated rural Indian communities? A novel multi-level model is developed and estimated and further validated through focus research groups. It confirms that disease incidence is jointly determined by the quantity as well as the quality of WASH. The role of agency seems to matter more at village level rather than at the household level.
O35|Developing touristic destination: innovation performance issues|Tourism is one of the most developing branches of service sectors. The paper deals with a key area of a Central-Eastern-European country (Hungary) from the European perspective, i.e. tourism. Tourism provides a remarkable ratio of GDP, thus its importance is inevitable. Tourism destination management (TDM in further text) organisations are local building stones of this important branch. These organisations received remarkable development funds in the previous budget period. The aim was to turn tourism into a competitive and innovative branch. Quadruple helix model - approach to innovation systems provides the opportunity to include the fourth helix - the media-based civic society - into the innovation performance, thus its performance influences the efficacy of the given innovation system. The paper assumes that these TDM organisations, as media-based civil organisations, appear as enterprises that are responsible for touristic innovation performance. The research objective is to prove, or deny that these institutions are important workshops of innovation. A survey research was conducted. In the meantime, feedback was collected about the structure, comprehensiveness and the logical structure of the questionnaire. Cooperation characteristics, the correlations between the innovation performances, the factors generating innovation and the reason for innovation are presented. The results of the study can be used by the state-governed tourism management, the vocational organisations and the Hungarian Tourism Ltd. in the process of establishing the framework of calls, and operational models in order to make international comparisons (with other countries).
O35|Knowledge Creation between Integrated Assessment Models and Initiative-Based Learning - An Interdisciplinary Approach| This paper explores the opportunities for integrating Initiative Based Learning (IBL) and Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) in order to improve our understanding of learning in the context of societal transition pathways, and more specifically by focusing on solar PV as an energy transition technology. Our analysis shows that IAMs and IBL conceptualize learning in a very different way, and the two approaches have major structural differences with respect to the geographical as well as the temporal scale of analysis. This is also due to the different goals of the two methodologies. The aim of IAM is to develop long-term energy and technology scenarios for the next thirty to eighty years, and to describe learning processes mostly to account for future potential improvements in technologies, while IBL focuses on understanding the configuration of actors in specific institutional settings that legitimize and support specific technologies and ultimately lead to dynamics of social learning. Although ambitious forms of integration between IAMs and IBL are not feasible today, the two approaches can be used in parallel and lead to mutual enrichment via a process that we label a two-way recursive collaboration.
O35|Importance Of Crowdsourcing In Social Innovations: Evidence From Poland| This article covers the problems connected with creating open social innovations using crowdsourcing. In this work the importance of crowdsourcing in the context of creating open social innovations, which serve the realisation and solving of social needs, was presented. This elaboration is divided into three parts. Following a short introduction, the essence of open social innovations, including the notion of innovation and social innovations, was presented. In the second part, the essence of crowdsourcing and its potential, were presented. The subject of the final, third part is showing the possibilities of using crowdsourcing to create open social innovations. Theoretical considerations were supported by three examples. Three examples from Poland were purposefully chosen. It is worth underlining that the obtained results confirm the demands made in the subject literature connected with the importance of crowdsourcing in creating open social innovations since this phenomenon contributes to obtain and generate new ideas and ways of solving problems including social ones. --------------------------- A cikk a nyitott társadalmi innovációk létrehozásának kérdését veti fel a crowdsourcing alkalmazása által.

A második részben a crowdsourcing lényege valamint annak potenciálja kerül bemutatásra. Az utolsó, harmadik rész tárgya a crowdsourcing alkalmazásának lehetőségének bemutatása, új nyitott társadalmi innovációk létrehozásában. Az elméleti feltevések három példával lettek alátámasztva. Szándékosan három lengyelországi példa lett kiválasztva. Érdemes kiemelni, hogy az elért eredmények alátámasztják a szakirodalomban a crowdsourcing jelentőségéről felállított feltevéseket a nyitott társadalmi innovációk kialakításában. Ez a jelenség hozzájárul az új ötletek kialakításához és generálásához, valamint problémák - köztük társadalmi problémák megoldásához is.
O35|Modélisation dynamique des systèmes de coûts (MDSC) : un système de représentation des valeurs adapté à l’essor de l’économie de la fonctionnalité pour la transition écologique|While the relations between socio-organizational, biophysical dimensions and value creation can be approached separately in a performance valuation assessment, they need to be dealt with together if the ecological transition is to be achieved. Not to do so would involve neglecting the influence of the socio-organizational framework on value creation, and the role of natural systems as added value production supports. With a view to putting sustainability into practice, models based on a functional economy can contribute to maintaining the structures and functionalities proper to each of these issues. This functional approach allows taking into account intangible and indirect links between value productions, pressures on the environment, and society. It brings the need of other valuation spaces, frameworks and time scales. The DMCS method represents the circulation of information and capital flows between a micro economic process and joint productions of social, economic and ecological values at the local level.

O35|Les circuits courts alimentaires « pour tous », outils d’analyse de l’innovation sociale|The renewal of short food supply chains in France comes up against the question of social innovation through the development of initiatives aimed at facilitating access to quality food to precarious consumers. This article shows the value of analyzing these initiatives to understand the social mechanisms of social innovation building and to explore the conditions of its scaling-up. The approach rests on a combination of economic sociology, and the care approach, allowing the integration of persons and their socio-political context in the analysis of the relational dynamics which build innovation. Based on two case studies, results show how social innovation develops through new kinds of links and resources valuing daily life experience. They invite us to consider that its transformative capacity both relies on products decoupled from these links and on the evolution of persons’ status. The article urges a deepening of the analysis of social innovation through short supply chains, and conversely. JEL Codes: O35, Q13, Q18, A13
O35|Frugal innovations and 3D printing: insights from the field|In this paper, we present a growing technological sector – additive manufacturing – and discuss its hidden potential as frugal innovation. Additive manufacturing, which is also known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, constitutes a recent manufacturing process that builds layers to create a three-dimensional solid object from a digital model. 3D printing technology has been identified as one aspect of the digital revolution that has the potential to revolutionize the industrial world. This topic has been surrounded with a lot of hype when predicting future application scope. In this paper, we focus on 3D printing as a technology that, under certain circumstances of technological transfer via community-operated organizations like fab labs, enables the development of frugal solutions targeting Base-of-the-Pyramid (BoP) population. At the same time, this paper aims to contribute to the discussion on Frugal Innovations in existing scholar literature. JEL Codes: O32, O35
O35|Au bord du précipice, opterons-nous pour les monnaies complémentaires locales ?|"Noting the risk of collapse of our civilization by 2030 if major trends are not curbed rapidly, this article argues that local complementary currencies could be vectors of real change in the near future. Their potential transforming power appears in the questioning of the monetary and financial system. Indeed, how the money is created and used, by whom and for what is fundamental in formation and propagation of values, beliefs and the evolution of our societies. However, environmental policies currently envisaged take very little account of it. The proposals from the ""weak"" interpretation of sustainable development, that is to say the one seeking to maintain the current organizational structure, are not up to the challenges. In contrast, the radical reversal of values and lifestyles that would induce the adoption of a ""strong"" vision of sustainable development does not seem attainable on a short time horizon. Therefore, touching the heart of our organizations, local complementary currencies could make the current monetary system of monoculture to evolve to a world full of diversity, opening channels for the financing of low-carbon activities, and enhancement of behaviors consistent with sustainable development."
O35|Regional Competitiveness And Regional Convergence – Together Towards The Success Of Development|This paper comes to describe the relation between two representative concepts within the wide literature in the field of regional development and cooperation. As many of concepts that are used in our times, the regional competitiveness and the regional convergence are two notions that have a transdisciplinary feature, a phenomenon that emphasizes the fact that the approaches in the literature are different and are the results of the researches in different field, though approaching the same two aspects. Regional competitiveness regards the ability of one region to compete and develop itself through the products and services it produces and provides, which are the ultimate result of the cooperation between the companies, institutions, socio-political policies within that region, while maintaining or developing the living standards of its population. On the other hand, regional convergence is the result of a series of policies and decisions made by a superior institution, that are designed to reduce the differences between the development level between the economic regions within a certain area.
O35|Why Should The Whole Business Environment And Business Related Organizations Choose And Support The Developing Clustering Process?|This paper represents a brief though concentrated review on the common aspects that are pursued when dealing and talking about the concept of cluster, also displaying some motivating reasons for the companies, institutions and all related entities to choose and support the clustering process. The clusters represent geographical concentrations of companies that are interrelated, which have developed connections with other organizations, such as professional agencies, governmental agencies, research and development institutions and educational institutions. Possessing their feature of competences concentration poles, they nowadays represent key players on the international economic and competitiveness stage, promoting a series of objectives such as the development of industries, environmental technologies, the reduction of production costs and the most important, the enhancement of the cooperation between the business environment, universities, research and development institutions and governmental institutions.
O35|El capital social y la planificación adaptativa en una comunidad industrial innovadora del Perú|El presente estudio vincula el capital social y la planificación adaptativa con la innovación y el desarrollo empresarial de una comunidad de productores vitivinícolas en el Perú. Dado lo anterior, se considera que tanto el capital social como la planificación adaptativa impactan en el aprendizaje productivo y el desarrollo de valores empresariales en ciertos escenarios donde predomina un extendido conocimiento tácito tradicional y colectivo –perdurable a través de siglos– y que se transforma en innovación. La metodología utilizada para la validación empírica fue el análisis factorial exploratorio, a través del cual se confirmó la propuesta teórica.
O35|El tiempo social del proyecto “experiencias en innovación social en América Latina y el Caribe” (2004-2011)|El presente artículo analiza la estructura interna del Proyecto “Experiencias en Innovación Social” que realizó la Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe, CEPAL, entre los años 2005 y 2011, en conjunto con la Fundación Kellogg. El proyecto tuvo como actividad central la realización de un concurso para elegir y premiar las experiencias que demostraran ser las más innovadoras socialmente en América Latina y el Caribe. El documento analiza la variable tiempo social, categoría que nos permite develar el tipo de relaciones establecidas entre los sujetos que interactúan en el Proyecto de Innovación Social y caracterizar las relaciones de dominación que se tejieron entre ellos. Este tipo de análisis resulta relevante para dar cuenta de cómo en la historia presente de América Latina los organismos internacionales han incorporado nuevos mecanismos para ejercer dominio sobre la vida económica y social. ****** This article analyzes the internal structure of project “Experiences in Social Innovation” carried out by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, ECLAC, between 2005 and 2011, in conjunction with the Kellogg Foundation. The main activity of this Project was to identify innovative initiatives in the field of social development in Latin America and the Caribbean, so as generate public policy recommendations. This paper analyze the variable social time, a category that will allow us to unveil the type of relations established between the actors that interact in the Project. Social time contribute to characterize the relations of domination that were woven between them and to understand how recent international organizations have incorporated new mechanisms to exercise dominion over economic life of local organizations in Latin America and the Caribbean.
O35|"Mainstreaming an Effective Intervention: Evidence from Randomized Evaluations of ""Teaching at the Right Level"" in India"|"Previous randomized studies have shown that addressing children's current learning gaps, rather than following an over-ambitious uniform curriculum, can lead to significant learning gains. In this study, we evaluate a series of efforts to scale up the NGO Pratham's approach to teaching children according to their actual learning level, in four Indian States. While this approach was previously shown to be extremely effective when implemented with community volunteers outside of school, the objective of these new scale-up evaluations was to develop a model that could be implemented within the government school system. In the first two instances (Bihar and Uttarakhand), the methodology was not adopted by government schoolteachers, despite well-received training sessions and Pratham support. Motivated by the quantitative and qualitative analysis of these early attempts, we adapted the approach and designed large-scale experiments in the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to test two new scale-up models. In Haryana, teachers received support from government resource persons trained by Pratham, and implemented the approach during a dedicated hour. In Uttar Pradesh, Pratham volunteers implemented high-intensity, short-burst ""learning camps"" for 40 days, in school and during school hours, with additional 10-day summer camps. Both models proved effective, with gains in language of 0.15 standard deviation in Haryana, and 0.70 standard deviations in Uttar Pradesh, on all students enrolled in these schools at baseline. These two models provide blueprints that can be replicated inside other government systems."
O35|"Interregionale Zusammenarbeit: Notwendigkeit und Herausforderung für informelle ""Erneuerbare-Energie-Regionen"""|Renewable energy regions are valued as important drivers of the German energy transition. Nevertheless they are hardly engaged in interregional coordination processes of goals and activities, and they are a missing voice in vertical coordination processes of energy related multi-level governance. This fact has been neglected by research for a long time. The article shows needs and possibilities for action of a strategic cooperation of renewable energy regions and also examines its obstacles. Finally, consequences for future research on renewable energy regions are derived. Erneuerbare Energie-Regionen werden als Treiber der Energiewende von unten wertgeschätzt. Sie sind aber bisher weder in der horizontalen, interregionalen Abstimmung regionaler Ziele in nennenswertem Umfang aktiv, noch haben sie eine Stimme in vertikalen, handlungsebenenübergreifenden energiepolitischen Abstimmungsprozessen (Mehrebenen-Governance). Dieser Tatbestand wird in der Forschung zu Erneuerbare-Energie-Regionen bisher nicht angemessen problematisiert und bearbeitet. Der Beitrag zeigt, welche Handlungsbedarfe und -möglichkeiten für eine strategisch-politische interregionale Zusammenarbeit bestehen und beleuchtet die möglichen Hemmnisse einer solchen Zusammenarbeit. Abschließend werden Konsequenzen für die zukünftige Forschung formuliert.

O35|How did trade norms evolve in Scandinavia? Long-distance trade and social trust in the Viking age|As the saying goes, “it takes years to build up trust and only seconds to destroy it.” In this paper, we argue that this is indeed the case when explaining trust formation in Scandinavia. Hence, in an attempt to explain why the Scandinavian welfare states hold the highest social trust scores in the world today, we argue that one possible historical root of social trust may be the long-distance trade practices of the Viking age. To manage the risk of being cheated, trade between strangers in an oral world required a strong informal institution of trust-based trade norms out of necessity to deal with the risk of being cheated. In contrast to similar cases like the famous medieval Maghribi traders, who counted on writing (Greif, 1989), the punishment of cheaters could not be supported by written documents such as legal documents and letters, as the large majority of Vikings were non-literate. If a trader did not keep his word, social sanctioning by word of mouth was most likely the only method to discipline the cheater and prevent future free-rider behavior. The early rise of trust-based trade norms in Scandinavia is an overlooked factor in the region’s long-term socio-economic development and social trust accumulation. This result points to the importance of free trade today, especially in poor countries with low levels of economic development and high rates of non-literacy.
O35|The cultural foundations of economic failure: A conceptual toolkit|This paper proposes a framework for integrating mental constructs into economic analysis. It considers three types of belief: identities, narratives and norms. Identities influence preferences; narratives influence how causal relationships are (mis)understood; norms determine self-imposed constraints. The beliefs are acquired pre-rationally, through participation in social networks which are initial endowments; subsequent choice of network participation is path dependent. Actors rationally maximize their utility subject to these beliefs, but the beliefs themselves are contaminated by these endowments of irrationality. In equilibrium, beliefs and networks are locally stable and constitute a ‘culture’: the culture can be that of an organization, an entire society, or a family. Local stability is achieved partly through interactions between the three types of belief, and partly through the interaction of beliefs and networks. A dysfunctional culture generates behaviour that yields bad outcomes. If these forces are strong, Bayesian updating from mistakes can be frustrated: dysfunctional cultures can be traps. Principals can use various control variables to improve (or preserve) outcomes by targeting beliefs. The framework enables a systematic approach to dysfunctional cultures.
O35|Knowledge Creation between Integrated Assessment Models and Initiative-Based Learning - An Interdisciplinary Approach|This paper explores the opportunities for integrating Initiative Based Learning (IBL) and Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) in order to improve our understanding of learning in the context of societal transition pathways, and more specifically by focusing on solar PV as an energy transition technology. Our analysis shows that IAMs and IBL conceptualize learning in a very different way, and the two approaches have major structural differences with respect to the geographical as well as the temporal scale of analysis. This is also due to the different goals of the two methodologies. The aim of IAM is to develop long-term energy and technology scenarios for the next thirty to eighty years, and to describe learning processes mostly to account for future potential improvements in technologies, while IBL focuses on understanding the configuration of actors in specific institutional settings that legitimize and support specific technologies and ultimately lead to dynamics of social learning. Although ambitious forms of integration between IAMs and IBL are not feasible today, the two approaches can be used in parallel and lead to mutual enrichment via a process that we label a two-way recursive collaboration.
O35|Sharing and Tourism: The Rise of New Markets in Transport|This paper analyses the implications of sharing on tourists and tourism focusing on the transportation sector. The shifts from ownership to access, from products to services have induced dramatic changes triggered by the emergence of innovative marketplaces. The services offered by Knowledge Innovative Service Suppliers, start-ups at the origin of innovative marketplaces run through platforms allow the tourists to find solutions to run themselves their activities, bypassing the traditional tourism industry. The paper builds a taxonomy to apprehend the diversity attached to this growing platform economy, and uses this analytical framework to depict significant cases drawn from ridesharing or carsharing.
O35|Au bord du précipice, opterons-nous pour les monnaies complémentaires locales ?|"Noting the risk of collapse of our civilization by 2030 if major trends are not curbed rapidly, this article argues that local complementary currencies could be vectors of real change in the near future. Their potential transforming power appears in the questioning of the monetary and financial system. Indeed, how the money is created and used, by whom and for what is fundamental in formation and propagation of values, beliefs and the evolution of our societies. However, environmental policies currently envisaged take very little account of it. The proposals from the ""weak"" interpretation of sustainable development, that is to say the one seeking to maintain the current organizational structure, are not up to the challenges. In contrast, the radical reversal of values and lifestyles that would induce the adoption of a ""strong"" vision of sustainable development does not seem attainable on a short time horizon. Therefore, touching the heart of our organizations, local complementary currencies could make the current monetary system of monoculture to evolve to a world full of diversity, opening channels for the financing of low-carbon activities, and enhancement of behaviors consistent with sustainable development."

O35|The Impact of Employee Training and Innovation on Turnover Intention: An Empirical Research|Companies pay special attention to employee turnover rates because losing qualified employees causes many financial and nonfinancial problems. Thus managers should find permanent solutions for disruptive turnovers. Literature gives strong cues for preventing high turnover rates. This study makes significant contributions to turnover literature by using empirical research results. The research has been carried out with 239 employees working in 36 different service firms operating in Turkey and it focuses on whether employee training and innovation can be used as instruments to decrease turnovers. While innovation and turnover scales were measured in one dimension, employee training scale was measured in two dimensions as extensive training and training in multiple functions. Results indicate that all variables are significantly correlated with each other. It is observed that innovation and training in multiple functions variables are having a significant power for decreasing turnover. Besides it is seen that the variable of innovation does not mediate the relationship between employee training and turnover.
O35|Reconstruction of affected SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) after the Great East Japan Earthquake: A Case study of a Marine Products Supplier|I made attention to â€œcrowd funding and micro investmentâ€ to support affected SMEs, after the Great East Japan Earthquake, and analyzed its system and the situation of the enterprise. It is useful to give encouragement (mentally) as well as to alleviate economic burden (economically). Participation by citizens and social contribution by the private company are also emphasized.
O35|Considerations regarding the expenses in the research and development sector of the European Union|This article aims to analyze the situation of the expenses (material resources) in the research - development and innovation (RDI) sector in the European Union, over the period 2000-2014. It examines their evolution in the considered period, as measured by expenditure intensity in the field, being revealed the gap between the EU and other states competing on the international market, i.e. the US, Japan and South Korea, showing that EU lags behind these countries. Outlook for material resources of the EU are determined by trends of new scientific and technical revolution and the transformations that the new technologies (mainly digital) will produce in the human society as a whole. Article reveals the conclusions that can be drawn from the undertaken analysis, mainly that the European Union RDI sector requires an increased allocation of funds in the next period to achieve social objectives assumed by policy makers at EU and national level.
O35|The support paradox in community enterprise experiments in the Netherlands| In many European countries, community-based entrepreneurship is increasingly considered as a means to initiate small-scale urban regeneration. However, residents in deprived neighbourhoods are often viewed to lack key entrepreneurial skills. Most research on community entrepreneurship support is based on cross-sectional studies and overly focussed on government support. This paper extends current knowledge by reporting a unique national experiment in the Netherlands with community enterprises receiving support from a private foundation. The paper aims to investigate how active citizens perceive the benefits and drawbacks of this support. Using a unique longitudinal approach, the paper analyses transcriptions of repeated semi-structured interviews (panel design) from community enterprises in several neighbourhoods. While positive feedback is found, the study provides strong evidence for a 'support paradox': the support that was intended to overcome a number of entry barriers and difficulties on the road to community entrepreneurship has significantly hampered progress among several community enterprises.
O35|Deciphering innovation across cultures|Schumpeter in 1942 clearly established the necessity of innovation for all forms of global competition. The more we enter in globalized markets Innovation is becoming a critical tool for business value creation. Innovation, understood as something new that can create value, the integration or generation of new ideas to generate products or services is widely view as a key driver for a country’s economic growth. Further, policies for economic development are often drafted around a country’s innovative capacity and usually then transferred across Nations as a form of templates for key economic development initiatives. However, there are many definitions of innovation across country/culture levels and therefore the concept of innovation can raise definitional issues. This research argues that a country’s culture may have an impact in defining innovation and as a consequence in the final outputs and aims to seek more precise ways of understanding innovation. Furthermore, the intention of this research is to explore and understand how innovation is perceived across different cultural groups and demonstrate that a unique or singular perception may not be as effective in deciphering this important term. This research presents findings across three different countries with very distinctive and entrepreneurial cultures, although all of three countries are in the Asia Pacific area. The research makes a contribution at two levels. First, at the scholarly level, it contributes toward theory development by improving our understanding of the roles of cultural factors in the innovation concept. This leads to a better perception of the different definitions underlying innovation and how these impact on firms implementing innovation strategies across countries. Second, at an applied level, the study provides insights for management and policy makers. In the case of management, this study provides information that allows them to make decisions that could help them develop or assess the effectiveness of existing innovation activities and strategies. This study finds that the perception and interpretation of innovation across the responders is influenced by their regional location. Few triggers for these interpretations are highlighted however it is discussed that further study is required to understand in depth the reasons for these differences.
O35|Multiple Criteria Decision Model Suggestion for Determination of Technological Innovation of Logistic Firms|The purpose of this study is to develop a model for determination of technological innovation level of logistic firms. The suggested model is used on the ranking of logistic firms listed in 2015 Fortune 500 Turkey according to their technological innovation levels. With this purpose, the study is conducted in two phases. In this first phase, a multiple criteria decision model is developed using Delphi Method to be used in determination of technological innovation levels of logistic firms. In the second phase, the suggested model is tested using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), TOPSIS, VIKOR and Bord a method in order. Study findings show that the suggested model is applicable and can be used for determination of technological innovation level of logistic firms. Additionally, according to analysis results; it is concluded that “radical innovation” is the main criterion and “big data” is the most important sub-criterion. C firm is determined as having the highest level of technological innovation level.
O35|Understanding ‘Shared Valued’ and Social Capital Link to Pave the Path of next Generation of Innovation|The idea “Creating shared value” (CSV) offers a resolute direction to the debate on the link between business and society which can be restored through three distinct actions such as a) reconceiving products and markets; b) rede?ning productivity in the value chain; and c) building supportive industry clusters. The critical analysis predicts that the path of these actions is progressive in nature and their scope apparently ranges from narrow to wider deliberations. Keeping variant scope of proposed actions, this paper focuses only first course of action as it paves the path of new wave of innovation. For this new wave of innovation, the role of social capital is explored to determine the extent this capital can derive next wave of innovation. In this regard, a model is proposed to predict the link between various dimensions of social capital and innovation that can produce both social and business revenues. The proposed model assumes that narrow conceptualization of social capital to network theory only and ignoring its origins and deep rooted relations with community will lead towards routine innovations that lacking potential benefits of shared value. If organizations emphasize more and invest in developing relationships restricted to network actors, then potential benefits might be unnoticed. Therefore, like defining ‘value’ too narrowly due to strategic myopia, keeping the social circle of small radius also limit the organization’s ability to exploit the embedded potential of social capital necessary to pave the path of new generation of innovation benefiting both business and society.
O35|Towards a Democratization of Knowledge with Topological Emphasis in Economics|We formulate and prove a theorem which consists in how the natural endogenous antagonist interaction of agents who look for understanding a generalizable phenomenon, results in a tendency towards chaos. This takes us to the final absolution of implementing the majority rule as the only instrument that generates socially acceptable knowledge, escaping from the chaos tendency. Finally, we extend our analysis to consider the arise of multiple simultaneous antagonist postures on the explanation of a phenomenon, and through an application of the Pythagoras theorem, we prove that it takes less effort or sacrifice for an agent to learn strategically to get an explanation, than if she was the creator of the concerning knowledge, which implies different consequences of possible topological private and public tendencies.
O35|Generating and Measuring Regional Social Innovation|Innovation is one of the determining factors of economic output. The actors of economics have long recognized that in regions where there is a lack of economic and natural science innovation, social innovation can be a compensating factor. This recent research presents a methodology for measuring social innovation potential (index) and defines a knowledge engineering system that helps to generate such innovations. This can be applicable to defining the intervention axis along which social innovation potential can be increased.

O35|Individual heterogeneity and pension choices: How to communicate an effective message?|We use the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) to explain how communication influences the heterogeneity in pension choices. To this end we exploit the 2007 Italian reform that allowed transferring future severance pay contributions into a pension fund and was accompanied by an information campaign with a clear message. According to ELM, individuals follow either a “central route” or a “peripheral route” depending on their motivation and ability to think, and eventually change or retain their initial attitude. Based on Logit models and data from the Bank of Italy Survey on Household Income and Wealth, we find that the decision to transfer the severance pay into a pension fund was taken by more educated and older individuals, with high household income. Since the reform was mainly directed at low income and younger individuals, this result suggest that the information campaign was not very effective. Moreover, our findings show that generic financial literacy does not significantly affect decision consciousness, pointing at a more relevant role in the elaboration process for: the individual’s comprehension of the specific choice object (pension funds), cognitive skills, and influential contextual factors (i.e., unions and employer’s pressure).
O35|Innovation and development after the earthquake in Emilia|The 2012 earthquake in Emilia-Romagna (Italy) has shaken up the collective understanding on the socioeconomic importance of a vast territory that generates almost 2% of Italian GDP. The area affected by the earthquake is characterized by the presence of important industrial and agricultural districts, and by good practices of local governance that are internationally renowned. Private and public buildings, factories, offices and retail shops, historical and cultural heritage sites have been severely damaged. Not only, but it set in motion transformations in the socio-economic system that might have unexpected consequences and that undermine the quick recovery of the local system: different agents, at different levels, taking individual and collective decisions, generate a cascade of changes that interact with its evolution path. Indeed, earthquakes pose challenges, but provide unprecedented opportunities: strategic decisions by economic and political agents, newly available financial resources, coordination or lack of coordination among main stakeholders, and so on. The following paper provides an overview of the first results of Energie Sisma Emilia research project: it aims at collecting and disseminating relevant knowledge and evidence in order to design policies. In particular, it identifies the agents propelling innovation processes, and analyses their strategies in ever-changing environment. The paper starts with a socio-economic analysis of the area struck by the earthquake, followed by the results of three of the focus groups conducted. Eventually, it illustrates a specific innovation: the introduction and implementation of the digital infrastructure “Mude”.
O35|Enhancing the resilience of social infrastructures: issues on agents, artefacts and processes. Proceedings of the 2016 Modena Workshop|In the social sciences domain, the term 'resilience' is usually associated to a wide set of changes that affect people and their communities. In particular, both the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005–2015 and the Sendai Framework explicitly focus on the way in which communities face both natural and man-made hazards. To this respect, both material and non-material infra-structures play a critical role, hence deserving a specific focus when assessing local communities' level of resilience. Among them, this paper focuses on: health services, social services, govern-ment (according to a multi-level perspective, from the national to the local level), communication infrastructure (i.e. specific tools to interconnect all aforementioned networks). Firstly, this paper discusses some of the most important issues and theoretical frameworks that should be addressed in the analysis of the processes of enhancing the resilience of social infrastructures. Secondly, the discussion that took place in a workshop promoted in May 2016 as the outcome of a one-year dialogue across a group of EU researchers is returned. The debate moves from some theoretical perspectives on resilience and it eventually returns some case studies and real experiences, such as the actions of local governments and the role of risk communication.

O35|Harnessing the digital economy for developing countries|This report makes a call for why the digital economy matters for developing countries and what they need to consider when developing a national digital strategy. The world is undergoing a digital revolution with significant implications for global economies and livelihoods. This revolution is predicated on the ever-increasing pace of technological innovation and diffusion. Digital technologies and their attendant applications are reshaping whole domains of human activity, and are spreading across the world faster than previous waves of technological innovation. The digital revolution is thus too important for any country to overlook. As outlined in Section II, the digital economy can be harnessed for inclusive and sustainable growth: digital technologies make life easier for citizens and consumers, raise the productivity of workers and firms, and help governments extend key services to those who need them most. However, this does not just happen randomly: governments must engage in strategic planning to maximise the development impact of digitalisation and ensure that its benefits are evenly distributed. Using the experience of leading economies in the digital space, Section III looks at some of the broad and generic enabling factors that developing countries can develop and use as foundations for their digital economies. The concluding section, Section IV, examines three key lessons developing countries can learn from other countries’ digital experiences. It provides some guiding principles around thinking about how to craft a national digital strategy that builds on top of the enablers of the digital economy.
O35|The Diffusion of a Social Innovation: Executive Stock Options from 1936–2005|Abstract: We study the increasing use of stock options to compensate executives in US corporations. As with many technological innovations, the adoption curve exhibits a classic S-shaped pattern: the rate rises slowly at first, then there is a period of rapid acceleration, and finally it tails off as the saturation level is approached. Using a longitudinal data set of Frydman and Saks (2010) supplemented with financial reports compiled by the authors, we argue that the diffusion of options was initially given a jump-start by a change in the tax law, but thereafter it was propelled by a process in which firms learned from the experience of earlier adopters. The notion that options spread primarily through social conformity or ‘jumping on the bandwagon’ is not borne out by the data.
O35|Vinotherapy As An Innovation – Impact On Health Attitudes|Evidence from research has not only excluded negative consequence of moderate wine consumption, but associated consumption of grapes and their components with a protective impact on health. Wine demonstrates anti-cancer, antioxidant and defensive results for the cardiovascular system. Not surprisingly, there is an interest in exploring a growing consumption of wine and turning it into innovative solutions with different approaches, making use of areas that have undergone significant transformations over last decades as a results of a global dynamical change which offer new consumption patterns seen now as driving forces for stagnating economies of the XXI century. This article builds on this perspective aiming to shed some light on wine consumption patterns, health attitudes and the perception and awareness of positive effect of a moderate consumption of wine on human health. The study was carried out between March and May 2013 as a self-administered questionnaire to visitors of liquor stores, wineries, wineries of the Lower Silesia region, Poland. Results demonstrate an interest in consumption of wine with opposite tendencies in opinions about the recommended about the recommended wine quantity of consumption.

The topic of what is ""correct"" or ""ethically right"" or ""morally right"" or ""ethically attractive"" in any circumstance is differently stated, yet the greater part of the words and expressions are after the same thing: what act is ""better"" in a good or moral sense than some other demonstration? Individuals once in a while discuss profound quality as something individual however see morals as having more extensive social ramifications. Others consider profound quality to be the subject of a field of study, that field being morals. Morals would be profound quality as connected to any number of subjects, including journalistic morals, business morals, or the morals of experts, for example, specialists, lawyers, and bookkeepers. We will wander a meaning of morals, however for our motivations, morals and ethical quality will be utilized as comparable terms."
O35|Creating Innovators through setting up organizational Vision, Mission, and Core Values : a Strategic Model in Higher Education|Vision, mission, objectives and core values play major role in setting up sustainable organizations. Vision and mission statements describe the organization’s goals. Core values and core principles represent the organization’s culture. In this paper, we have discussed a model on how a higher education institution can prosper to reach its goal of ‘creating innovators’ through its vision, mission, objectives and core values. A model for the core values required for a prospective graduate from higher educational institutions is developed, discussed and analysed. The model identifies some of the core values which are essential for a student/graduate to become successful and stand-out in his/her life. Based on the core values, a set of core principles for higher educational institutions is developed. Finally, the benefits of core values and core principles are discussed.
O35|Chinese And African Migrant Entrepreneur’s Articulation Shaped By African Agency|Much has been written on the relationship of China and Africa in the past decade. However, the subject of Chinese migrant entrepreneurs in Africa and their articulation with African counterparts was little explored up to the early 2010s. Apparently, this research gap has been closed, as shown by four publications in recent years: three edited volumes and one monography, focusing on this subject. In view of early prejudices on the passive or even disapproving reception of Chinese migrants by Africans, the state of the art underlines the importance and scope of African agency vis à vis Chinese migrant entrepreneurs in Africa.

O35|Towards a Democratization of Knowledge with Topological Emphasis in Economics|We formulate and prove a theorem which consists in how the natural endogenous antagonist interaction of agents who look for understanding a generalizable phenomenon, results in a tendency towards chaos. This takes us to the final absolution of implementing the majority rule as the only instrument that generates socially acceptable knowledge, escaping from the chaos tendency. Finally, we extend our analysis to consider the arise of multiple simultaneous antagonist postures on the explanation of a phenomenon, and through an application of the Pythagoras theorem, we prove that it takes less effort or sacrifice for an agent to learn strategically to get an explanation, than if she was the creator of the concerning knowledge, which implies different consequences of possible topological private and public tendencies.
O35|Economic Effects of Open Access to Scientific Publications|With the development of digital technology and especially the possibilities for electronic publishing Open access publishing is becoming more and more a global phenomenon. Open access means unrestricted online access to scholarly research and research data. The paper presents the common definitions, the types and vehicles for delivering Open access to scientific publications. Because of its economic efficiency, the potential economic benefits of Open access might have an impact on many other groups besides the users and the authors themselves – publishers, scientific institutions, specific industries, etc. Economic effects of OA are analysed through the concept of its benefits which could generally be divided into two groups – individual and collective. Besides the economic benefits, one must also consider the “price” of OA, as well as its limitations. Together with the effects of Open access that support the development of science, its use could be regarded as a means to increase social welfare as well.
O35|Innovaciones sociales e inclusivas: límites y posibilidades para el desarrollo territorial en el contexto de la globalización<BR>[Social and inclusive innovations: limits and possibilities for territorial development in the context of globalization]|The technological innovation processes play an important role as a constitutive element of territorial development, a concept that intends to bring together the economic dimension (economic development), the social dimension (social development), the environmental dimension (sustainable development) and the territorial imbalances (territorial cohesion). Moreover, these processes are decisive in the context of economic and social changes faced by the world and Latin America, as the capacity of scientific and technological appropriation of regions and countries is crucial. In this context, this article has as its main objective to propose and to evaluate some strategies of territorial development based on the integration between economic and technological development and social inclusion for Latin America, showing the possibilities for their success and their limits and obstacles. The text suggests discussing also the merits and utility of two other concepts: social innovation and inclusive innovation.
O35|Recent economic theorising on innovation: Lessons for analysing social innovation|This paper reviews recent economic theorising on innovation from the angle of analysing social innovations (SI). It is structured as follows: Some of the basic notions used in innovation analyses are considered in section 2, focusing on the subject, objectives and levels of change. Section 3 reviews how innovation is understood in particular models of innovation and analysed by various schools of economics highlighting the types of actors and knowledge perceived as relevant in these various approaches. The notion of innovation systems (national, regional, sectoral, and technological ones) and its analytical and policy relevance is explored in section 4. Lessons relevant for analysing social innovation are drawn at the end of each sub-section, and the most important of those are reiterated in the concluding section.
O35|Assessing the potential of social enterprises through social network analysis: Evidence from Albania|Organizations falling within the category of ‘social enterprises’ are rapidly expanding in developing and transition countries, representing an innovative instrument for poverty reduction and endogenous development. However, economic long-term sustainability remains a major problem. Acquisition of knowledge is then claimed as a key issue for their competiveness and survival in the market. A critical factor for implementing successful knowledge transfer relates to the creation of well-connected networks of relationships. Stable and collaborative contacts among social entrepreneurs also allow more effective coordination, reducing the risk of dispersed and fragmented initiatives. This paper investigates the Albanian social enterprise sector, focusing on their network of relationships (i.e. social enterprises’ networks and supporting actors’ networks) by means of a social network analysis. Results are based on empirical evidence collected at the firm level from organizations operating in the Tirana and Scutari regions, the heart of the country’s economic growth engine. Visual social network investigation along with networks’ correlation analysis have showed that Albanian social enterprises are poorly aware of advantages arising from their network of relationships, still showing low entrepreneurial attitudes.
O35|Применение Почвозащитных Технологий В Регионах, Подверженных Ветровой Эрозии: Механизмы Мотивации Собственников Земли<BR>[Application of soil protection technologies in regions prone to wind erosion: mechanisms for motivating landowners]|The purpose is to reveal the factors of motivations of the agricultural enterprises and certain farmers in the course of application of the nature preservation technologies; the priority of protection the natural resources in motivation of farmers; to develop a technique of studying the social and economic mechanisms of use of the soil-protective systems. The novelty consists in complex studying of motivation of rural producers by means of the technique considering macro-social and micro-social factors of application of the nature preservation technologies for the regions subject to wind erosion of soils (Kazakhstan, the Volga region, Siberia, etc.). The results are as follows: the policy in the sphere of the nature preservation technologies has to consider the factors influencing the choice of decisions regarding the use of technologies. Among the factors are demographic situation, poverty level, the state policy, measure of sensibleness of the carried-out actions, access to information, and economic efficiency for the economic entity. The action program directed on formation of the social and economic mechanism, pricing, subsidies and trade policy in agriculture has been proposed, as well as creations of the monitoring system of soils condition, consumption of fertilizers, pesticides, soil cover and the ground waters. The scope of results is the following: professional communities, state authorities, municipalities, scientific and research and educational institutions.
O35|L'agence sociale compte! - Des entrepreneurs migrants africains et chinois comme acteurs de changement<BR>[Social Agency matters! - African and Chinese migrant entrepreneurs as agents of change]|"English Abstract: [Social Agency matters! - African and Chinese entrepreneurs as agents of change] - The book reviewed, edited by Laurence Marfaing and Karsten Giese, documents a research project, on-going since six years, at the German Institute of Global and Area Studies (GIGA-Hamburg) which combines African and Sinologist perspectives. The publication in French, can be seen as advantage and disadvantage at the same time. Considering the lack of French edited publications on this subject and the deplorable language-divide between Anglophone and Francophone Africa, the chapters (some of them translated from English) are certainly most welcomed by French speaking African readers and scholars alike. Thus, they gain the unique possibility to become familiar with the results of painstaking studies by spearheading researchers in this field of study. Some of the contributions are revised papers, originally presented at a workshop at Dakar organised by the editors in January 2013 within the framework of the program Point Sud, an International Centre for Research on Local Knowledge in Bamako (Mali). The introduction by the editors, written jointly with their research collaborator, Alena Thiel, develops the Leitmotiv of the book. It aptly captures the essence of the research findings presented in its title: ""From rejecting the other to mutual involvement of both parties in the dynamics of social change"". In fact, the relations of Chinese and African petty traders and their mutual perception have changed fundamentally since the xenophobe manifestations against 'the Chinese' in several African towns as well as mutual incomprehension of both in Chinese towns (mostly in the urban districts Xiaobei and Sanyuanli of Guangzhou) where migrant African entrepreneurs arrived in the early 2000s. Many, if not most of them did not come to stay in the host country permanently, but they acted rather as sojourner, exploring the terrain in search of profitable trade, that is, Chinese imports of cheap consumer goods to Africa. Their mutual economic interest was based not so much on the general impact of political and economic globalisation but more specifically on the development of Chinese industrial production that facilitated Africans access to the desired Western products at an affordable price. Thus, these entrepreneurial migrants, who incorporated globalisation from below in their very transnational economic practices, became themselves carriers of social and economic transformations in their respective host countries. The realm of these transformations covered a remarkable range, from specific access strategies to resources and social mobility, changing consumer behaviour, new norms and practices up to modifications of taste and ways of life. French Abstract: [L'agence sociale compte! - Les entrepreneurs africains et chinois en tant qu'agents du changement] - Le livre revu, édité par Laurence Marfaing et Karsten Giese, documente un projet de recherche en cours depuis six ans à l'Institut allemand des études mondiales et régionales (GIGA-Hambourg). Les cultures africaines et chinoises sont analysé simultanément d'un point de vue africain et sinologique. La publication en français peut être considéré comme un avantage et un inconvénient en même temps. Considérant le manque de publications éditées en français sur ce sujet et le fossé linguistique déplorable entre l'Afrique anglophone et l'Afrique francophone, les chapitres (certains d'entre eux traduits de l'anglais) sont certainement les bienvenus parmi les lecteurs et chercheurs africains francophones. Ainsi, ils ont la possibilité unique de se familiariser avec les résultats d'études minutieuses des chercheurs specialisés dans ce domaine d'étude. Certaines des contributions sont des documents révisés, initialement présentés lors d'un atelier organisé à Dakar par les éditeurs en janvier 2013 dans le cadre du programme Point Sud, un Centre international de recherche sur les savoirs locaux à Bamako (Mali). L'introduction par les rédacteurs, écrite conjointement avec leur collaborateur de recherche, Alena Thiel, développe le Leitmotiv du livre. Il capture judicieusement l'essence des résultats de recherche présentés dans son titre: «De reject de l'autre à l'implication mutuelle des deux parties dans la dynamique du changement social». En fait, les relations des petits commerçants chinois et africains et leur perception mutuelle ont changé fondamentalement depuis les manifestations xénophobes contre les «Chinois» dans plusieurs villes africaines ainsi que l'incompréhension mutuelle des deux groupes dans les villes chinoises (principalement dans les districts urbains Xiaobei et Sanyuanli de Guangzhou) où les entrepreneurs africains migrants sont arrivés au début des années 2000. Beaucoup, sinon la plupart d'entre eux ne sont pas restés dans le pays d'accueil en permanence, mais ils ont plutôt agi en tant que agents, explorant le terrain à la recherche de commerce rentable, c'est-à-dire des importations chinoises de biens de consommation bon marché. Leur intérêt économique mutuel ne reposait pas tant sur l'impact général de la mondialisation politique et économique que sur le développement de la production industrielle chinoise qui facilitait l'accès des Africains aux produits occidentaux désirés à un prix abordable. Ainsi, ces migrants entrepreneurs, qui ont intégré la mondialisation d'en bas dans leurs pratiques économiques très transnationales, sont devenus eux-mêmes porteurs de transformations sociales et économiques dans leurs pays d'accueil respectifs. Le domaine de ces transformations couvrait une gamme remarquable allant des stratégies d'accès spécifiques aux ressources et à la mobilité sociale, en passant par le changement du comportement des consommateurs, de nouvelles normes et pratiques jusqu'aux modifications du goût et des modes de vie. German Abstract: [Gesellschaftliches Handeln zählt! - Afrikanische und chinesische Unternehmer als Motor des Wandels] - Das rezensierte Buch, herausgegeben von Laurence Marfaing und Karsten Giese, dokumentiert ein seit sechs Jahren laufendes Forschungsprojekt am German Institute of Global and Area Studies (GIGA-Hamburg), das afrikanische und afrikanische Kulturen simultan analysiert, sowohl aus afrikanischer als auch sinologischer Perspektive. Die Publikation in Französisch, kann sowohl als Vorteil, als auch als Nachteil zugleich gesehen werden. In Anbetracht des Mangels an französischen Publikationen zu diesem Thema und der beklagenswerten Kluft zwischen dem anglophonen und dem frankophonen Afrika, sind die Kapitel (von denen einige aus dem Englischen übersetzt wurden) sicherlich bei französischsprachigen afrikanischen Lesern und Wissenschaftlern sehr willkommen. Dadurch erhalten sie die einzigartige Möglichkeit, sich mit den Ergebnissen der fundierten Studien von führenden Forschern auf diesem Gebiet vertraut zu machen. Einige der Beiträge sind überarbeitete und aktualisierte Studien, die ursprünglich im Rahmen eines im Januar 2013 organisierten Workshops in Dakar im Rahmen des Programms Point Sud, einem internationalen Zentrum für lokale Wissensforschung in Bamako (Mali), vorgestellt wurden. Die Einführung des Buches, von den Herausgebern gemeinsam mit ihrer Forschungskollegin Alena Thiel geschrieben, entwickelt das Leitmotiv des Buches. Es fasst treffend die Essenz der Forschungsergebnisse zusammen, die in seinem Titel dargestellt sind: ""Von der Ablehnung des Anderen zur gegenseitigen Beteiligung beider Parteien an der Dynamik des sozialen Wandels"". In der Tat haben sich die Beziehungen zwischen chinesischen und afrikanischen Kleinhändlern und ihre gegenseitige Wahrnehmung seit den fremdenfeindlichen Kundgebungen gegen ""die Chinesen"" in mehreren afrikanischen sowie chinesischen Städten (hauptsächlich in den Stadtbezirken Xiaobei und Sanyuanli von Guangzhou), wo afrikanische Unternehmer zu Beginn der 2000er Jahre eintrafen, grundlegend verändert. Viele, wenn nicht die meisten von ihnen, blieben nicht dauerhaft im Gastland, sondern sie agierten eher als Reisende, die das Terrain auf der Suche nach profitablem Handel erkundeten, d.h. nach chinesischen Importen billiger Konsumgüter nach Afrika. Ihr beiderseitiges wirtschaftliches Interesse basierte nicht so sehr auf den allgemeinen Auswirkungen der politischen und wirtschaftlichen Globalisierung, sondern insbesondere auf der Entwicklung der chinesischen Industrieproduktion, die den Afrikanern den Zugang zu den (nachgebauten) gewünschten westlichen Produkten zu einem erschwinglichen Preis erleichterte. So wurden diese unternehmerischen Migranten, die die Globalisierung von unten in ihre transnationalen Wirtschaftspraktiken einbrachten, selbst Träger von sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Transformationen in ihren jeweiligen Gastländern. Die Bandbreite dieser Transformationen reichte von spezifischen Zugangsstrategien über Ressourcen und soziale Mobilität, wechselndes Konsumverhalten, neue Normen und Praktiken bis hin zu Geschmacks- und Lebensmodifikationen."

This paper highlights the opportunity for academic development of the issue concerning the impact investing, with the aim of preparing the process of construction of a theoretical framework based on the development of a conceptual framework and the description of three case studies, where comes up on how funds established impact on developed nations have begun to deploy their actions in production systems of Latin American countries and generate long-term value through the support of projects and enterprises based on different criteria from those traditionally applied by conventional investors. The contributions obtained in the study of the conditions required by these funds to place confidence in ideas that are intended to be sustainable and the types of business that have the capacity of investing investors, such as social entrepreneurship, Eco-innovations and business oriented to the base of the social pyramid of regions and countries.
O35|https://cebr.vse.cz/index.php/cebr/article/download/285/175|Negative feedback has been repeatedly identified as beneficial for organizational learning, adaptability, and performance. Despite having these advantages, most organizations still do not use negative feedback to its full potential, as they fail to spread it correctly among their members. The application of negative feedback, therefore, faces several issues like misuse or process avoidance that are mostly driven by psychological factors. The purpose of this paper is to discuss potential benefits of a newly emerged organizational approach called radical candor for contemporary state of the art in feedback-related behavior and to propose how it might be successfully applied in organizational settings. We define radical candor as a proactive and compassionate engagement in an unpleasant and direct feedback process. Radical candor may help reduce the influence of psychological factors like extreme levels of attachment, harsh emotions or low self-esteem in order to make organizational members more engaged and satis-fied with the negative feedback process. Organizations willing to apply radical candor might consider either official implementation from top to bottom (through managers and leadership) or unofficial intervention through the agents (employees of all levels) depending on company characteristics.
O35|Capital social, cultura organizacional, cultura innovadora y su incidencia en las Organizaciones Productivas Rurales Colaborativas|En la presente investigación se analiza información sobre factores como capital social, cultura organizacional y cultura innovadora que inciden en el desarrollo de organizaciones productivas rurales colaborativas (O.P.R.C. de aquí en adelante), y da a conocer los resultados que se obtuvieron en la investigación de campo, realizada en el Municipio de Ameca, Jalisco, en una muestra de 35 O.P.R.C., el estudio fue de tipo descriptivo-correlacional, no experimental y transversal, con un enfoque cuantitativo de carácter correlacional. Se identificó de manera general que el factor capital social el que guarda una relación de incidencia significativamente más alta, y la cultura innovadora el factor que reflejó una relación de incidencia más bajo. De lo anterior se concluye que es muy importante el identificar algunos factores que pueden incidir para crear o impulsar un proyecto empresarial en un entorno rural, permitiendo una mejor participación e inserción dentro del desarrollo local.
O35|Action Research as a leadership strategy for innovation: The case of a global high-technology organisation|The paper describes two sets of action research within an iconic global high-tech company. Two teams within the organisation (one in New York and one in Sydney) were selected to participate, on the basis of their failure to have achieved any technical innovation over the previous three years. The action research had the practical goal of generating valuable technical innovations, and the research goal of gaining insight into any social (leadership) practices that may have facilitated the technical innovation. The research delivered novel insights into the nature of the leadership practices that enabled these two teams to deliver four company-lauded technical innovations. The principal finding of the research: that social innovation precedes technical innovation, highlights the role action research can play in the creation of a social environment conducive to technical innovation within enterprises.
O35|'Today we are treated like human beings!' Methodological strategies of Action Research with family farmers’ practitioners of the slash-and-burn system in Southern Brazil|"We present and discuss the action-research methodological strategies used with farmers of Biguaçu, on the coast of Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil, over eight years. These strategies have enabled access to the formal market of farmers who produce in the slash-and-burn system the added value to products from this system and, above all, the collective organisation and raising their self-esteem. Cutting and burning agriculture, locally known as ""roça de toco"", consists of the felling and burning of a small piece of vegetation (glebe) for the implementation of annual crops for a few years. After that, the glebe is left fallow so that the forest and soil fertility regenerate, and another glebe is felled and cultivated. In Biguaçu, three main products are obtained in this system: charcoal, cassava and cassava flour. Although having recognised quality and being produced in an ecologically intelligent system, these products were marketed irregularly, with little financial return for farmers who were surrounded by large legal and environmental insecurity. Within the framework of different projects, different strategies were used to overcome this situation. We highlight the unprecedented combination, in working with farmers, of the thematic research of Paulo Freire with the Teaching Moments, used for the transposition of Freire's premises for the teaching of science. On that basis, the group took conscience of their problems and of the need to acquire new knowledge and new attitudes that would overcome them. To plan for overcoming the problems, the method ZOPP of participatory planning (Objectives-Oriented Project Planning) was used. The set of strategies used resulted in the development of packaging and collective marks and the constitution, in July 2013, of the Association ""Valor da Roça"" (“The Farm's Value""). Collectively, we created the Association's statutes and the Regulations laying down detailed rules for the use of packaging and the umbrella brand ""Farm's Value"" as well as that of the collective marks of the products Our Coal, Our Flour, and Our Cassava. Thus, another important result is the fact that, currently, farmers are independent, managing their brands and packaging autonomously and reaching new markets."
O35|Commitment and regulation. Ethics in research and the human sciences|Although ethical issues have been present since remote times in the academia and in professional organisations, in recent years ethics in research has been doubly highlighted: as a topic and specific field for reflection within the academic community and as an object of evaluation and regulation from outside academia. While reflection has a well-established context in the human sciences, evaluation and regulation developed focusing especially on dilemmas in the biomedical fields. They have expanded from there to the other scientific areas. For research with methodologies that establish more horizontal relations and are open to permanent negotiations, such as participatory research, the regulations that involve vertical knowledge-power relations may present dilemmas that affect both the practice of research and its potential results. However, recognising the specificity of the human sciences regarding this aspect meets with strong resistance. The text discusses these problems based on the experience of participating in a research ethics committee and in a Work Group of the Ministry of Health in Brazil charged with elaborating specific regulations for ethics in research in the human and social sciences.
O35|Industrieangestellte – Neue Initiativen der Interessenvertretung in der internen Tertiarisierung (White collar workers: New initiatives of interest representation)|Industrieangestellte nehmen an Zahl und Bedeutung zu. Nicht nur stellen sie inzwischen die Haelfte der Beschaeftigten in den Kernbranchen der Industrie, sie besetzen auch wichtige Positionen in den betrieblichen Hierarchien mit hohem Primaermachtpotenzial. Die Mobilisierung und Organisierung von Industrieangestellten als Waehler, Kompetenztraeger und Mitglieder entscheidet deshalb ueber die Zukunftsfaehigkeit der Interessenvertretungen in den Industriebranchen. Waehrend frueheren angestelltenpolitischen Ansaetzen der Gewerkschaften wenig Erfolg beschieden war, sind in juengerer Zeit von Gewerkschaften und Betriebsraeten neue Initiativen der Angestelltenpolitik entwickelt worden. Diese werden im vorliegenden Beitrag anhand betrieblicher Fallbeispiele untersucht. Die Initiativen haben unterschiedliche thematische Schwerpunkte; gemeinsam ist ihnen jedoch, dass darin die Betriebsraete neue Formen der Rekrutierung und der Arbeitsteilung in den Gremien entwickeln und dass sie Laboratorien neuer Formen der Beteiligung von Beschaeftigten einrichten. Interessenvertretungen gewinnen an Bedeutung als Berater und Helfer zur Selbsthilfe. Gewerkschaftliche Organisationswirkungen stehen und fallen mit der Rolle der Gewerkschaft in lokalen Konflikten und ihrer Organisierungsstrategie. (White collar workers in the German manufacturing sector have outpaced blue collar workers in number and they usually have positions with higher power resources in occupational hierarchies. Therefore it is of crucial importance for the future organisational power of unions and works councils to attract, mobilise and organise them as voters, as a resource with competencies and experience and as members. While former attempts to develop white collar policies have had little success, unions and works councils today have created new initiatives which will be analysed in this paper by focusing on the plant level. The initiatives are characterised by different topics like safeguarding of jobs, wages, health or working time flexibility. However, common denominators of the initiatives are new forms of recruitment, new divisions of work in works council committees and new forms of employee participation created in the course of the initiatives. Works councils are gaining importance by playing roles as consultants of employees and as supporters of the individual capability of the workers to defend their interests. Union organising can be successful if the union plays a central role in local conflicts and if it focuses on a strategy of organising.)
O35|Resurrected, recovered, but still didn’t survive? A case study on the viability of employee-owned companies|While there have been high hopes about democratic governance structures in organizations recently, the empirical record of employee-owned companies (EOC) is rather bleak. Correspondingly, in the long-standing literature about EOCs, there seems to be a consensus regarding the rather limited viability of democratic organizational forms. Although the explanations, mainly based on microeconomic models, differ in the causal mechanisms explaining EOCs’ short average lifespan. In this paper, we challenge the conventional wisdom about the reasons for the limited viability of democratic organizational forms. We develop an alternative explanation for their normal failure by means of an in-depth case study that corresponds with the transformation expectation about EOCs into conventional firms. We analyze a German case which we were able to study over a long period of time including the end of the EOC (while the company survived the changes in ownership and corporate governance structures). Firstly, we show that classical explanations do not seem to be valid for this particular failure of democratic governance structures. Secondly, we try to explore alternative explanations for the institutionalized transformation expectation regarding EOCs. In order to overcome the shortcomings of microeconomic models of EOCs, we deploy a social-constructivist heuristic framework that is derived from the organizational theories of Niklas Luhmann und Karl E. Weick. Thus we focus on dynamic social sensemaking processes and decision-making processes at the organizational level at the same time. We stress the role organizational cognitive routines in EOCs play especially in their organizational environment, pointing to the social embedding of EOCs and to the historical trajectories of individual organizations as potential sources to explain the normal failure of EOCs. Our study also confirms the significance of both the ambivalence and ambiguity of sensemaking and the contingency in the decision-making process for the explanation of a phenomenon that looks, at first glance, rather causally determined.
O35|Empirical Study Regarding the Trust Relationships Established in a Community|The paper that we present aims to address the issue of relationships naturally established in a community through some items that we consider relevant to the proposed topic. In this purpose, we have initiated a quantitative research, developed through a survey, based on questionnaire, self-managed and on line. The recorded answers are statistically interpreted, using IBM SPSS application. The results suggests that the perception of the subjects participating in the study on the relationships established with their communities, on the date of the study, is not clearly contoured.
O35|Online Communication and E-Commerce Dynamics in the European Union. A Consumer-Based Approach|The European Union has settled facilitating transactions within a single market as a primary aim. Consumers’ rights and protecting their safety are priorities for the European Union, alleging a partnership between member states and citizens. National legal systems represent the first problem in applying European rules because contract laws are different in many aspects, as many authors posit. The interest of this paper is finding out if consumers consider themselves well-informed, and which are the main channels used with a view to feeling comfortable and to trusting European market dynamics. Consumers’ opinions about the efficiency of online communication have a double impact on the social spectrum: being adaptive or being repellent. Hereby, the research questions mark the importance of online communication in delineating economic transactions. Our approach is from a social-cognitive perspective, acknowledging the importance of behavioral communication in economic boundaries. The environment in which consumers work or spend spare time determines and influences their acts, attitudes and social behavior. In order to understand how consumers’ look at the European Union’s interest in being more open to citizens and to how their social behavior in online area can mark the way consumers react to European goods, we resorted to a qualitative research, with in-depth interviews. Investigating the bond between consumers’ trust and consumers’ acts in acquiring European services brings into light the fact that communication remains unavoidable and compulsory for gaining citizens’ credential regardless of the frame of reference.
O35|The concept of innovation in social economy. A review and a research agenda|"Current research provides evidence that traditional business and public sector organizations are not the only structures that encourage development through innovation. A more recent form of organization known under the name of ""social enterprise"" has a great potential to innovate services, products and processes which can create social value. We have reviewed an array of social economy literature incorporating into it the concept of innovation. Following the grounded theory procedure we have analysed 59 papers in the field of social economy published between 1990 and 2014 so as to see the current state of knowledge regarding the innovative dimension of social enterprises. The innovative dimension of the social enterprise has been found to have been rather neglected by the research field, which tend to adhere to a more theoretical rather than empirical direction. A future research agenda is proposed here, so as to address this issue."
O35|Sustainable Innovation of Technology and Business Models: Rethinking Business Strategy|The article deals with the overall strategic perspectives of business, technology and innovation management models for sustainable development (SD). Radical changes introduced by new technological breakthroughs and innovation in the light of social, economic and ecological impacts and goals urgently call for new business and technology models and solutions. The new goals and principles of SD highly influence the establishment of a fresh business philosophy with new dimensions. In this article we present a framework that describes the essential relations and new business and technology models. The research results presented contribute to the theoretical background for creating more sustainable business and technology solutions in practice.
O35|Rozważania nad istotą klastrów|Popularność pojęcia klaster znacznie przerosła wiedzę o tym zjawisku. Celem artykułu jest przedstawienie tego fenomenu gospodarczego, zgodnie z definicją zaproponowaną przez twórcę koncepcji klastra – Michaela Portera. W artykule przywołano przykłady definicji klastra pochodzące z różnych prac badaczy tego zjawiska i skomentowano zgodność tych definicji ze źródłami. Rozważania o relacjach w środowisku klastrowym, przyczynach powstawania i dynamice rozwoju klastra, służą lepszemu zrozumieniu istoty tego zjawiska. Opierając się na metodzie pogłębionych krytycznych studiów literaturowych, autor przedstawia podstawowe elementy koncepcji klastra Michaela E. Portera, a także jej zalety, polegające na elastyczności jej stosowania i wykorzystania przy tworzeniu strategii rozwoju gospodarczego. Ta elastyczność stwarza jednak problemy związane z wychodzeniem poza ramy wyznaczone przez jej twórcę. Mnogość definicji i metod identyfikacji klastrów daje duże możliwości ich stosowania, lecz także duże problemy standaryzacyjne. Wzrost popularności klastrów wynika z tego, że są one coraz ważniejszym instrumentem stymulacji rozwoju gospodarczego, konieczne jest więc uporządkowanie chaosu, który wkradł się do stosowania koncepcji klastrów przez nadużycie jej elastyczności. Artykuł jest próbą uporządkowania dyskusji o klastrze, przez wskazanie w jego definicji najistotniejszych cech, z których wynika, że jest to samoistnie powstające w gospodarce zjawisko.
O35|Social Entrepreneurship Research – Challenges, Explanations and Suggestions for the Field Development (Przedsiebiorczosc spoleczna – wyzwania, przyczyny i sugestie dla obszaru badawczego)|Employing critical review of the key literature in the area of entrepreneurship and management studies on social entrepreneurship, this paper aims to outline the current challenges this field is facing, also introducing related explanations and suggesting required changes. The field of social entrepreneurship research is at its nascent stage, determined by ongoing definitional debates and low legitimacy in the scholarship, leading to limited theory development. The key challenge lies in the lack of consistent theory and weak research infrastructure. What lies behind these challenges is the complexity and diversity of the social entrepreneurship phenomenon and academic discourses. There are significant institutional and economic differences between individual countries and regions, which in the end constitute the complexity of the phenomenon. The related definitional debate generates challenges in developing the research infrastructure, which is strengthened by functionalist approach. At the same time, there is a strong need to employ the contribution of other, affiliated disciplines, not limited to entrepreneurship and management, feeding on sociology, anthropology, political science, economics. Their conceptual framework, research methods, particularly derived from sociology, may serve as a useful framework for the field development. This may generate scholarly interest in moving towards other research paradigms, employing subjectivist approaches, or assuming radical change in the society. Moving beyond dominant functionalist paradigm may give voice to initiatives and ventures in social entrepreneurship that have so far been marginalized in research. This, in result, could develop social entrepreneurship research field.
O35|The Recovery of Companies|The transmission of an enterprise faces different forms which are the recovery, indeed whether it's about a sale or a succession the transmission often puts in danger the existence of an enterprise. An enterprise can be taken over by another enterprise as part of its external growth strategy or by an individual who can be an heir, a former employee of the enterprise, a commercial or financial partner or a foreign buyer for the firm, but whatever his prior knowledge of the target enterprise the individual buyer holds the position of a new manager and fits into a functioning structure and leads a staff that he did not recruit. As part of our article, we have been interested in the study of the recovery of enterprises and its various aspects, in the first part the general case we discussed the resumption namely the transfer of businesses and through the brakes related to the transmission and the process of transmission. The second part is dedicated to the recovery and its integration in the fields of entrepreneurship, as well as the different forms that can take the recovery of a company namely: the external growth and the recovery of enterprises by individuals.
O35|The Management of Crisis|Many business leaders defines a time of crisis as a moment which completely hinders society activity which ultimately leads to bankruptcy they prefer the choice of resentment downturn and do not consider it a key moment for the renewal ideas, ways of thinking, of policies and strategies adopted that mobilize around new ambitions, new development projects, new sales models, new businesses, new markets and do a crisis a moment of creation and innovation and collective revitalization. The purpose of this article is to study the various steps of the management of crisis and best management practices in times of crisis to be applied properly by the manager. Therefore, we would have to ask the following question: How can we ride a situation of crisis and provide benchmarks based on best management practices?
O35|A Comment on “What Is Wrong with the West’s Economies?” by Edmund Phelps|Abstract Professor Phelps has written a plea for social, technological, and economic innovation as the key to human flourishing. I cannot see how the middle class drab life could be alleviated by innovation. This paper criticises his views and argues that people need what I call openings (opportunities) that channel their natural activities in the right way.
O35|Getting Innovation Right: The Key to Happiness and Flourishing?|Abstract Correlations between happiness and other variables, including innovation, are possibly dubious and may be ultimately misleading. Quality-of-life enhancing innovation is a social phenomenon, and much more than just a technological breakthrough. It typically involves institutional, cultural, organizational, managerial and other changes. It is the social phenomenon, rather than the technological breakthrough, or in addition to it, which makes the economy more dynamic and lives richer. Interesting examples include the distinction between the invention of the airplane and the development of mass tourism between northern and southern Europe. But there are many other examples, from access to pharmaceuticals in poor countries to wine making, miners' rescue and earthquake damage prevention. Failure to see the difference between the technological breakthrough and the social phenomenon may lead to the wrong conclusions.
O35|Change in access after digitization: Ethnographic collections in Wikipedia|The raison dâ€™Ãªtre of memory institutions revolves around collecting, preserving and giving access to heritage collections. Increasingly, access takes place in social networked markets characterized by communities of users that serve to select and rank content to facilitate reuse. Publication of heritage in such digital medium transforms patterns of consumption. We performed a quantitative analysis on the access to a museum collection and compared results before and after publication on Wikimedia. Analysis of the difference in access showed two main results: first, access to collections increased substantially online. From a selection of the most viewed objects, access grew from an average of 156,000 onsite visitors per year (or 15.5 million in a century) to over 1.5 million views online per year (or 7.9 million in five years). Second, we find a long tail in both mediums, where 8% of objects were exhibited onsite and 11% of available objects online were used in Wikipedia articles (representing 1% of the total collection). We further document differences in consumer preference for type of object, favouring 3D onsite and 2D online, as well as topic and language preference, favouring Wikipedia articles about geography and in English. Online publication is hence an important complement to onsite exhibitions to increase access to collections. Results shed light on online consumption of heritage content by consumers who may not necessarily visit heritage sites.
O35|How communities can regenerate urban contexts: The case study of Hackney Co-operative Development|During the last years, the regeneration of spaces and buildings inside cities has become an important issue, which involves public governments, private actors and the third sector. The failure of neoliberal market-oriented models, as a tool against social exclusion, has led to the re-thinking of local strategies for urban regeneration. A new idea of development has emerged, based on the empowerment of local communities and their potential. It points out the creation of community enterprises for the management of local assets. This paper presents the British context and the evolution of its legislation for the community enterprises. The case study of Hackney Co-operative Developments is presented to show how a community enterprise, set up to respond to local issues can structure its business and can be a generator of social innovation.
O35|Governance for a �socialised economy�. A case study in preventive health and work integration|This work is motivated by the question of how organisational governance can address the needs of vulnerable groups. This paper offers a conceptual reflection on how the production of complex health-related services, such as aspects of preventive psychiatric illnesses, can be governed to the benefit of users and communities society more broadly. The analysis is applied to a consortium of twenty-two social enterprises (SEs), with worker membership, located in Italy. The governance model adopted by the consortium is of particular interest since it pioneered solutions based on the combination of preventive health and work integration services. The case, specifically, allows to illustrate and analyse interdependencies amongst multiple publics, and how these are reflected by the governance model. Specifically, the findings suggest that central to the success of the model in meeting such challenges are: a) the integration of different but complementary organisations and competencies, including health, social, and production competences; b) a mix of interdependent governance solutions, each activating different types of publics and social capital; c) membership, through which workers partake in decision-making; d) formal fiduciary duties between vulnerable publics and members complemented by bonding and bridging social relations; e) the integration of community assets as inputs into the process, and the creation of societal outputs in terms of employment, social integration and cohesion.
O35|The invisible hand of informal (educational) communication!?: Social capital considerations on Twitter conversations among teachers|Twitter can contribute to the continuous professional development of teachers by initiating and fostering informal learning. Social capital theory can aid to analyse the underlying communication processes and outcomes. Yet, previous research has largely neglected teachers and the role of social capital on Twitter. The present study addresses this shortcoming by analysing a hashtag conversation among German speaking teachers. Using social network analysis, we are able to show the relevance of the structural dimension of social capital in Twitter conversations among teachers.
O35|Payment Cards|The aim of this paper is to analyze the use of payment cards in retail in the Czech Republic from the side of clients (buyers) and the side of sellers. Questionnaires for clients examine satisfaction with cards and the service connected with them. Sellers’ satisfaction with the profit and function of cards is analyzed. The data indicated that 92% of the 352 respondents in South Bohemia had a payment card and more than 35% had more than one card. In retail, 70% of sellers had a payment terminal.
O35|Koordination, Lernen und Innovation zur Entwicklung peripherer ländlicher Regionen: Phase II der Begleitforschung zum Modellvorhaben LandZukunft|Das Bundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft suchte mit seinem Modellvorhaben LandZukunft von 2012 bis 2014 nach neuen Wegen, um anhaltende sozioökonomische Probleme in peripheren ländlichen Regionen zu lösen. Dazu sollten das aus der Managementlehre bekannte Instrument des Steuerns über Ziele, neue Finanzierungsinstrumente wie Mikrokredite und die Beteiligung neuer 'unternehmerischer Menschen' in vier Modellregionen erprobt werden. Die Begleitforschung untersuchte in ihrer zweiten Phase von 2014 bis 2015, inwiefern das Modellvorhaben zum Lernen und Kapazitätsaufbau in den teilnehmenden Regionen beigetragen hat sowie neue und dauerhafte Lösungen für die Herausforderungen peripherer Regionen anstoßen konnte. Darüber hinaus wurde das Steuern über Ziele hinsichtlich seines Potentials zur Koordination der ländlichen Entwicklung im politischen Mehrebenensystem untersucht. Der thematische Fokus der Begleitforschung jenseits dieser Querschnittsthemen ergab sich aus den unterschiedlichen Aktivitäten der Modellregionen: die Stärkung lokaler Bildungslandschaften, die touristische Destinationsentwicklung, die Entwicklung neuer Finanzierungsangebote, Finanzierung und Strategien sozialen Unternehmen sowie die mögliche Rolle großer Bildungseinrichtungen für die ländliche Entwicklung. Neben der Auswertung des Forschungsstandes und von Dokumenten basieren die Ergebnisse insbesondere auf Befragungen von beteiligten Akteuren und teilnehmender Beobachtung in den vier Modellregionen. Die Forschungsergebnisse zeigen, dass das Modellvorhaben in den Regionen auf großes Engagement gestoßen ist. Die schnelle Umsetzung des Vorhabens war aber mit großem Aufwand und hohen Kompetenzanforderungen verbunden, die nicht überall vorausgesetzt werden können. Das Steuern über Ziele birgt die Gefahr von Interessenkoalitionen zwischen Kontrolleuren und Kontrollierten, um die Fördermittel auszugeben und Ergebnisse positiv nach außen darzustellen. Lernprozesse konzentrierten sich auf die Fähigkeiten, die nötig waren, um das Modellvorhaben finanziell abzuwickeln, während strategische Veränderungen und institutionelle Anpassungsprozesse wesentlich seltener zu beobachten waren. Nachhaltige Entwicklungen konnten vor allem dort angestoßen werden, wo an vorhandene Kompetenzen und Kapazitäten angeknüpft wurde. Aufbauend auf diesen Erkenntnissen leitet die Begleitforschung Handlungsempfehlungen ab. So sollte beispielsweise das Steuern über Ziele nur dann für die ländliche Entwicklung in Betracht gezogen werden, wenn Innovationen nicht im Vordergrund stehen, sodass bereits Erfahrungswerte für mögliche Zielwerte und deren Verhandlung zwischen den Vertragspartnern vorliegen. Zudem sollte der thematische Fokus der Strategie möglichst eng gewählt werden, um die Definition und Kontrolle der Ziele sowie die Aneignung des nötigen Wissens zu erleichtern.
O35|Simple numerical method for kinetical investigation of planar mechanical systems with two degrees of freedom|The aim of this article is to demonstrate the application of a simple numerical method which is suitable for motion analysis of different mechanical systems. For mechanical engineer students it is important task. Mechanical systems consisting of rigid bodies are linked to each other by different constraints. Kinematical and kinetical analysis of them leads to integration of second order differential equations. In this way the kinematical functions of parts of mechanical systems can be determined. Degrees of freedom of the mechanical system increase as a result of built-in elastic parts. Numerical methods can be applied to solve such problems. The simple numerical method will be demonstrated in MS Excel by author by the aid of two examples. MS Excel is a quite useful tool for mechanical engineers because easy to use it and details can be seen moreover failures can be noticed. Some parts of results obtained by using the numerical method were checked by analytical way. The published method can be used in higher education for mechanical engineer students.
O35|A roadmap for a computational theory of the value of information in origin of life questions|"Information plays a critical role in complex biological systems. Complex systems like immune systems and ant colonies co-ordinate heterogeneous components in a decentralized fashion. How do these distributed decentralized systems function? One key component is how these complex systems efficiently process information. These complex systems have an architecture for integrating and processing information coming in from various sources and points to the value of information in the functioning of different complex biological systems. This article proposes a role for information processing in questions around the origin of life and suggests how computational simulations may yield insights into questions related to the origin of life. Such a computational model of the origin of life would unify thermodynamics with information processing and we would gain an appreciation of why proteins and nucleotides evolved as the substrate of computation and information processing in living systems that we see on Earth. Answers to questions like these may give us insights into non-carbon based forms of life that we could search for outside Earth. We hypothesize that carbon-based life forms are only one amongst a continuum of life-like systems in the universe. Investigations into the role of computational substrates that allow information processing is important and could yield insights into: 1) novel non-carbon based computational substrates that may have ""life-like"" properties, and 2) how life may have actually originated from non-life on Earth. Life may exist as a continuum between non-life and life and we may have to revise our notion of life and how common it is in the universe. Looking at life or life-like phenomenon through the lens of information theory may yield a broader view of life."
O35|Business Environment and Creative Industries in Romania|This article explores the curent situation of creative industries in Romania, a field still insufficiently investigated where entrepreneurship is increasingly present. In this sense, it addresses addresses two research objectives. Taking as reference the relevant academic literature, and based on the analysis of an original data-set regarding the composition and structure of creative industries in Bucharest, the article propose a conceptual framework addapted to the context of Romania for the study of the structural mechanisms that ties the economic model and the development of those economic activities labeled as creative. Our findings suggest that the development tendencies of variou creative specialisations have a massive growth potential in the future, impacting deeply the Romanian business environment and entrepreneurial perspectives. The paper furthers the understanding of the role and characteristics of creative activities in the economy and creates the premises for comparative research projects in the future.
O35|Social networks a real solution for students' future jobs|This study examines if social networks represent a real solution for students' future jobs. The authors use for their analysis data provided by the students from Faculty of Economic Cybernetics, Statistics and Informatics (ECSI) ? The Bucharest University of Economic Studies and by professional networking websites like Facebook and LinkedIn. In this paper there are highlighted the level of using social networks and students’ perception on the use of social networks in their activities. The paper focuses on students’ interest in using social networks for securing future jobs. The results of research underlined the idea that for higher education there is an opportunity to facilitate the access of students to social networks in two ways: by developing or enhancing students’ knowledge on how to use social networks and as part of that effort, by educating students about how they can promote their skills. The main idea is that the use of large amounts of data generated by social networks accelerates students' integration within working environment and their employment.
O35|Social Innovation in the Local Public Sector: A Cross-Regional Approach for Romania|Social innovation could be understood as “new ideas (products, service and models) that, simultaneously meet needs and create new social relationships or collaboration” (Murray et al., 2010). For the local public sector, the social innovation gains endemic characteristics, connected to better use of local resources and human resources, as well as those concerning interregional or even cross-regional cooperation. For the time being, Romania undergoes a complex process of shifting to regional organization, which essentially involves important changes with genuine characteristics of social innovation. The most obvious aspects of social innovation are expressed by administrative innovation or systemic innovation. Of course, the innovation in the public services or processes for public service delivery becomes visible through citizen orientation, involvement of new material and financial resources. In this context, the current paper aims to emphasise the main characteristics of social innovation, determined by regionalization and administrative re-organizations. The cross-regional approach comprises interregional comparative studies and it highlights the instruments for evaluation of social innovation and their application in view to substantiate the comparative studies concerning the impact of social innovation. The research methodology comprises bibliographic syntheses, comparative studies as well as socio-innovative empirical researches.
O35|Conceptualizing risk and social innovation: An integrated framework for risk governance|Public policy seeks innovation as a solution to society’s big problems, yet it almost always fails to address one key component of innovation: risk. Furthermore, risk management in public policy predominately focuses on the minimization or even avoidance of risk, no matter its nature. This article focuses on the nexus between risk and social innovation specifically in public policy. It acknowledges the special context of decision-making in public policy and proposes two differentiations that are necessary for a holistic model of risk management in public policy innovation: Firstly, the differentiation between cases of risk and uncertainty; and, secondly, between hard and soft risk management approaches. Concluding, the paper presents a framework that can inform public policy makers and practitioners alike regarding risk management and its effect on social innovation.
O35|Need Of A New Social And Economic Pact – Horizon Europe 2020|The current period is characterized by three concurring phenomena and which influence mutually one another: globalization, digitalization and computerization at of all sectors of economic and social life. The balance between economy and society, mediated by institutions and institutional settings needs to be reconfigured based on the new realities. The paradigm change on the labour market is, in fact, one of the expressions of the structural changes of the economy. A new social and economic pact is necessary in view of achieving the employment objectives of the Europe 2020 Agenda
O35|Towards Successful Cloud Ordering Service|Background: The rise of cloud services has led to a drastic growth of e-commerce and a greater investment in development of new cloud services systems by related industries. For SaaS developers, it is important to understand customer needs and make use of available resources at as early as the system design and development stage. Objectives: This study integrates E-commerce Systems (ECS) Success model and Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) into empirical research of the critical factors for cloud ordering system success. Methods/Approach: A survey research is conducted to collect data on customer perceptions of the importance and performance of each attribute of the particular cloud ordering service. The sample is further divided according to the degree of use of online shopping into high-usage users and low-usage users in order to explore their views regarding the system and generate adequate coping strategies. Results: Developers of online ordering systems can refer to the important factors obtained in this study when planning strategies of product/service improvement. Conclusions: The approach proposed in this study can also be applied to evaluation of other kinds of cloud services systems.
O35|Innover de façon plus juste ? De la place des connaissances dans un dispositif de coopération sciences sociales – industrie|This article analyzes a cooperation program between social sciences and industry, which aims to develop alternative approaches to design innovation within a food company. We question the ways in which socio-anthropological knowledge about food consumers are produced as part of this partnership, and are mobilized within the company to design more accurate innovations, in terms of responsibility and fitness to market. From a field survey at the interface between action and critical research, we first analyze the origin and the issue of the partnership between the company, social sciences and the kind of knowledge they generate. We then show the inherent difficulties of this cooperation, in terms of contrasted temporality between knowledge production and product design, boundaries of the methodology, and in the latter, emphasis put by the company on the socio-anthropological knowledge.

O35|Reconnaissance et institutionnalisation des innovations sociales dans le champ des politiques sociales|Based on several studies on experimentation and social innovation, this article presents an analysis of the processes of trivialization of social innovations through appropriation and institutionalization. Focusing primarily on the field of social policy, two main ideas are put forward. The first is based on the hypothesis of the diversification of forms of protection and social intervention through experimentation and social innovation. The second presents the inevitable trivialization of innovation as a continuous process of appropriation and institutionalization. This dialogical process connects social innovation and institutional innovation by a double movement of recognition and normative regulation. JEL Codes : O35, I38, P48
O35|Innovation and entrepreneurship in aging societies: theorical reflection and a case study from kamikatsu, Japan|This paper aims at applying the Schumpeterian framework to issues of rural communities with shrinking and aging populations and a lost linkage to economic dynamics and to innovation. Discussion of how to obtain wealth and the well-being of townspeople remain undeveloped in theory and practice. This paper asks how innovative entrepreneurship and enterprise development can contribute to regional and communal competitiveness as well as create positive relationships between work and well-being. By applying Schumpeterian approaches to entrepreneurship and innovation a hypothetical schema is built. Our case study of a typical rural aging town with a stagnant economy provides empirical evidence to support the theoretical conception. The personality of the entrepreneur plays the main role in the creation of an innovative enterprise and for improvement in the well-being of townspeople. With entrepreneurial leadership, older residents in rural communities may indeed create disruptive innovation with low technology and become healthier and happier. JEL Codes: J14, O22, O35
O35|Estimating and explaining the efficiency of township hospitals in Shandong province in the context of the drug policy reform|To cope with the rising price of drugs, in 2009 the Chinese government launched a large pharmaceutical reform. Its key element is the implementation of a National Essential Medicine List, leading to a reorientation of incentives for health services providers. Health facilities are not anymore allowed to make any profit on drug sales (“zero mark-up policy”), while this used to be their main source of financing. Different compensation schemes have been implemented by the authorities. In a context of refunding of the financing structure of health care facilities, it is crucial to understand how the reform has affected –or not- health care facilities activity and efficiency. This study relies on a survey data from a sample of 30 Township Hospitals of the rural prefecture of Weifang (Shandong province). Using a two-stage procedure, it aims at assessing the THs’ technical efficiency scores and then at identifying the determinants of this efficiency. The first stage is realized with a non-parametric frontier approach, the so-called ‘partial frontier’ method, order-m to deal with the problem of dimensionality. The identification of the determinants of efficiency requires panel data models, with random individual effects. Results show that the average efficiency remains constant between 2006-09 and 2010-12, around 0.65. The most significant and robust factors of technical efficiency are the share of subsidies in the TH incomes for the first sub-period (negative effect), and the number of covered inhabitants per bed (positive effect). It suggests that drug reform hasn’t improve primary health facilities efficiency, certainly because the reform did not tackle with success the issues of the financial barriers to universal access to healthcare -out-of-pocket payments from patients-, and of the perception of quality of public healthcare.
O35|Représentations sociales de la monnaie : contraste entre les citoyens et les porteurs de monnaies locales|This article analyzes the social representations of money from survey data. More specifically, it tests how holders of a complementary currency project have a distinct perception of money compared to other citizens. The main results confirm the existence of significant differences between the two groups. The structure of their representations shows that money is less tied to official institutions, the symbol of the sovereign State, to work and wages than for the representative population group. This confirms a number of theoretical works that see these social innovations as protest projects of the standard system, questioning the sovereignty State currency and close to the concepts of unconditional income. Local currencies, by differences in social representations they contain, could well be generators of societal change.
O35|Classifying Non-banking Monetary Systems using Web Data|This paper develops a new classification of non-banking currencies projects based on a lexical analysis from web data. The advantage of this method is to derive an endogenous typology of monetary projects, based on how currencies are depicted on the internet. Therefore, it allows to by-pass issues face for now in the literature to uncover a clear classification of non-banking currencies projects from exogenous elements. Our textual corpus consists in 320 web pages, corresponding to 1210 text pages. We first applied to our data a downward hierarchical clustering, which enables us to endogenously derive five different classes, allowing us to operate distinctions not only between non-banking currencies projects, but also between these latter and the standard monetary system. Then, we resorted to a similarity analysis and according to our results; all non-banking currencies projects define themselves in relation to the standard monetary system, with the exception of Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETs).

Today, companies that look out an everyday economic stability, have determined the relevance of technological design and innovation that enable them to generate national and international competitive advantage, both elements require in first instance an efficient and effective knowledge management that will contribute to their achievement. The aim of this study is to design an instrument that in a further research will be applied to obtain relevant information on the situation of the SMEs that integrate the automotive cluster of Guanajuato, in relation to knowledge management. The process to develop the instrument, was through an analysis of the main theoretical references on the subject. An initial instrument was examined by the experts method, making its adaptation through a collaborative work.
O35|Niche Websites And Online Tools Used In Recruitment|Based on technological evolution and a very large number of users, the Internet plays a key role in attracting talented employees which can generate competitive advantage for the organization. Therefore nowadays niche websites, specialised recruitment sites, become increasingly important. With the creation of such sites also appeared several applications for recruiting. The purpose of this paper is to analyze these sites and applications in order to determine the advantages and disadvantages of specialised recruitment websites (1), career sites of organizations (2) social professional sites (3) . Using these online recruitment tools lead to the development of e-recruitment. Our conclusion is that these websites do not represent yet a universal solution for organizations although the number of users is growing. For being successful in the recruitment process, recruiters have to combine niche websites in recruiting and not use only one type of niche websites.
O35|Religion and Innovation|In earlier work we identified a robust negative association between religiosity and patents per capita, holding across countries as well as US states. In this paper we relate 11 indicators of individual openness to innovation (e.g., attitudes toward science and technology, new versus old ideas, change, risk taking, agency, imagination, and independence in children) to 5 measures of religiosity, including beliefs and attendance. We use five waves of the World Values Survey and control for sociodemographics, country and year fixed effects. Across the 52 regressions, greater religiosity is almost uniformly associated to less favorable views of innovation, with high significance.
O35|Small-scale cooperative banking and the production of capital: Reflecting on the role of institutional agreements in supporting rural livelihood in Kampot, Cambodia|This paper explores the ecological economics of small-scale cooperative banking (SSCB) through reference to the empirical case of a rice-farming village in Kampot, Cambodia. It combines Georgescu-Roegen's discussion of an economy's capacity to produce economic processes with Ostrom's concept of institutional performance, in order to address the implications and functioning of SSCB within a small-farmer economy. The local collective action situation of maintaining and making use of a SSCB system – a specific finance model – provides the studied community with access to a pooled capital fund that may play an important role in ensuring its capacity to produce and reproduce economic processes, according to its own specifications. The coordinated action among the villagers, which matches up well with Ostrom's criteria for effective institutional performance of common pool resource use governance, is found to include social and environmental dimensions, which we understand to be necessary for achieving transformations toward more sustainable economic activity. While we do not wish to suggest that the adoption of SSCB guarantees either improved ecological or social impacts, our results suggest that this finance model could play a supporting role in enhancing the potential of small-farming communities to improve both, should they wish to do so.
O35|Electromobility in Norway: Experiences and Opportunities|Electrification will reduce environmental impacts and greenhouse gas emissions from transport. Electric propulsion is energy efficient, and does not cause local pollution. In 2013 the new vehicle market share of electric vehicles (EVs) was 5.8%. and 80% were owned by private consumers. This paper explores some possible explanations to the Norwegian development by describing the electromobility story, the incentives given and the attitudes among users. A long lasting interaction between private enterprises, public authorities and non-government organizations combined with a taxation system that gives the authorities opportunity to influence vehicle purchase, and to compensate for marketing challenges related to price, have supported the Norwegian diffusion of electromobility. In addition a high share of multi-vehicle households and a publicly supported expansion of charging stations have made range challenges manageable. The Norwegian market is expected to continue to grow as more models are coming into the market and given the governmental decision to extend the economic incentives until the end of 2017. Rapid development of the technology and policies makes firm conclusions for other countries challenging to make. Further research should include several countries and broader cost/benefit and life-cycle analyses.
O35|Social Priorities of Internal Banking Assortment (Products) Policy|Motivations of social responsibility, social orientation and social priorities are described in the context of special quasi social bank status and other credit organizations, Russian historic traditions, and specific peculiarities of bank management. Subjects and objects of social priorities, their concurring and alternative interests, goals and tasks are defined and explained on the basis of the analysis of theoretical and methodological insights, research and ranking of statistic data. Subjective, objective (institutional) and process concentrations of social priorities in bank management are framed. Benchmarks of social priorities, their levels and nominations are marked out. This work emphasizes and describes with relevant explanations such areas of socially oriented activity of banks as provision of banking services to enterprises and organizations of social areas and those that are entirely or partially socially oriented, financial and/or organizational participation in proper socially motivated events, financial and/or organizational participation in social projects of third parties including specialized ones, creation and selling of banking socially oriented products. Certain weak points and inaccuracy in implementing social projects by Russian banks are revealed. The subject matter and structure of internal banking policy, factors and terms and conditions that have an impact on its parameters concretized to the peculiarities of the assortment (products) policy are regarded. The formulated areas of social priorities are regarded as an optimized complex. On its basis, social components of preferences, limitations and prohibitions of the internal banking assortment (products) banking policy are developed and recommended.
O35|The Concept Of Social Capital In Economic Theory|Economic research at the turn of the century has been explicitly dealing with the social capital, as a special form of capital. It is a relatively new concept, which is why it is not surprising that there is no generally accepted term to denote this phenomenon. The social capital means the economic benefit of the society, which can be reached with the help of communication, cooperation, and trust among the entities in the given socio-economic environment. The social capital is most often regarded as the ability of social structures and attitudes that support them to increase the effectiveness of collective action. The social capital is a connective tissue, a glue that helps people to use available resources for creating mutual benefits. Its existence is a prerequisite for economic growth and development. The components of the social capital are social ties and networks that can be transformed into economic capital.
O35|Innovare il rapporto tra musei, visitatori ed utenti attraverso le relazioni digitali|"Le tecnologie della comunicazione stanno progressivamente ridisegnando il nostro modo di essere, le nostre relazioni e le forme e gli strumenti attraverso cui quotidianamente accediamo alle informazioni di cui abbiamo bisogno. Anche i musei sono coinvolti in tali evoluzioni ed il rapporto che può essere instaurato tra visitatore e museo attraverso i nuovi media digitali diventa quindi incredibilmente più ricco e complesso. Tanto il museo quanto l’individuo sono, quindi, portatori di una trama relazionale che diventa progressivamente più estesa, anche traendo beneficio dalla più recente evoluzione della rete internet, caratterizzata dall’avvento e dalla diffusione del cosiddetto ""web 2.0"" e dei social media. Ciò determinerà per i musei la necessità di sviluppare una consapevole strategia di presenza sui social media, cioè una vera e propria ""social media strategy"", la quale rappresenta una porzione della più ampia ""digital strategy"" del museo. Inoltre, la diffusione sempre più ampia e pervasiva delle tecnologie mobili e dei dispositivi indossabili prefigura l’avvento di uno scenario in cui i visitatori dei musei modificheranno profondamente sia il modo con il quale stabilire una relazione con queste organizzazioni, sia le modalità concrete di fruizione dei servizi museali."
O35|Le reti del Terzo Settore e la sfida per l’integrazione degli immigrati|"Il fenomeno dell’immigrazione è oggetto di ampio dibattito teorico e politico di matrice prevalentemente giuridica e sociologica. Nel presente lavoro, la prospettiva si focalizza sui servizi per facilitare l’integrazione dei migranti nella società di accoglienza e sulla natura sociale delle innovazioni intervenute in Italia. Dopo aver chiarito il concetto di integrazione sociale degli immigrati con riferimento al sistema di relazioni nel cui ambito essa si realizza e con riferimento al quadro di policy che sancisce il principio di non discriminazione dei migranti nell’accesso ai servizi essenziali, il lavoro illustra alcune innovazioni introdotte in Italia per favorire l’integrazione degli immigrati, inquadrandole alla luce del dibattito sull’innovazione sociale. In particolare, l’attenzione viene rivolta, oltre che alle innovazioni istituzionali, alla mediazione culturale ed ai servizi per l’inserimento lavorativo. Infine, all’interno di un framework teorico volto ad evidenziare le finalità della collaborazione e, al tempo stesso, le fasi di sviluppo dell’innovazione, viene affrontato il tema della collaborazione per l’innovazione, con riferimento ai principali attori - tra cui spiccano le organizzazioni del Terzo Settore - ed alle traiettorie evolutive delle collaborazioni stesse, che hanno visto nel ""progetto sociale"" una forma organizzativa finora prevalente. Nelle conclusioni, si evidenzia la necessità di ""capitalizzare"" le esperienze innovative sperimentate, in un più generale processo di innovazione dei servizi pubblici."
O35|Civic crowdfunding e valore del territorio: un’analisi empirica attraverso due piattaforme italiane|Nel lavoro si analizza il rapporto tra l’efficacia dei progetti di Civic Crowdfunding e l’attrattività del territorio. L’indagine, condotta attraverso lo studio di due importanti piattaforme di Civic Crowdfunding, è stata effettuata attraverso un’analisi statistica di regressione lineare e multivariata OLS. Si è così verificato, su un campione di 144 progetti di Civic Crowdfunding, la presenza di una correlazione positiva tra l’efficacia dei progetti e l’attrattività del territorio, da un lato, ed il numero dei finanziatori, dall’altro. Sembra emergere, invece, una correlazione negativa con il numero dei progetti presentati. Il lavoro mostra l’importanza e la valenza del territorio attraverso la risposta data dai finanziatori aderendo ai progetti di Civic Crowdfuding, a dimostrazione dell’importanza che va assumendo questa particolare tipologia di investimento per lo sviluppo sostenibile del territorio, in linea con la tendenza, da parte dei cittadini, ad esprimere una maggiore volontà di partecipazione alla costruzione di città e territori migliori.
O35|Bridginig The Gaps In Transnational Technology Transfer Under Hr Development Related Projects|Transnational projects aiming at knowledge transfer and diffusion are essential for both labor force development and social innovation. Formal training programs and certified courses organized under the umbrella of transnational projects aimed at increasing occupational rate were considered to be an effective way for channeling international knowledge to reach specific labor demand. However, the international transfer of technology implies specific actions regarding technology adoption and technology transfer problems, which needs proactively tackled as possible sources of risks for human resources development projects. It is the scope of this paper that, after a synthesis of relevant literature regarding the international technology transfer to enlighten bridges needed to enable efficient transnational knowledge transfer and knowledge creation. Based on empirical analysis upon different factors of knowledge transfer efficiency, interculturality, digital skills and occupational trainings, some conclusions are formulated, in line with the knowledge transfer actual theory. Finally, the article presents a case study based on a Romanian transnational project financed by European Social Fund that has offered an efficient method for training and skill building, witch fully supports the conclusions formulated by the author. Future research directions and perspective are also presented in the end.
O35|Long tails in the tourism industry: towards knowledge intensive service suppliers|This paper analyses the effects of the internet on the organisations and the markets in the tourism industry. It enlightens its deepening impact on incumbent organisations and markets from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 though the analysis of the dynamics of the long tail, i.e., of the distribution of activities in tourism. Innovation is gone from exploitation to exploration of the long tail, towards the emergence of non-profit or for-profit knowledge intensive service suppliers (KISS) allowing 'prosumers' to find solutions to run themselves their activities, through users generated resources. The growing autonomy of the tail from the head of distribution in the tourism industry emerges with the development of a platform economy, i.e., of global innovative market places inside the long tail itself.
O35|Mobile Money Adoption and Financial Inclusion Objectives: A Macroeconomic Approach through a Cluster Analysis|This paper investigates the adoption patterns of Mobile Money in emerging and developing countries. Starting from macroeconomic comparative and case studies realised by practitioners experts, this paper proposes a wider macroeconomic approach based on cluster analysis as an alternative strategy for assessing similarity in adoption levels. By anchoring observations from previous studies in innovation adoption and diffusion theories, this article evaluates dissimilarity between groups of countries sharing the same adoption levels. Since the results matches with hypotheses from the innovation adoption and diffusion literature, this analysis nuances the potential of Mobile Money as an inclusive financial tool fighting banking exclusion.

It enlightens its deepening impact on incumbent organizations and markets from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 though the analysis of the dynamics of the long tail, i.e. of the distribution of activities in tourism. Innovation is gone from exploitation to exploration of the long tail, towards the emergence of non-profit or for-profit Knowledge Intensive Service Suppliers allowing ‘prosumers’ to find solutions to run themselves their activities, through users generated resources. Contrasting results appear, the growing autonomy of the tail from the head of distribution in the tourism industry, i.e. the development of global innovative market places inside the long tail itself, but still the reemergence of power laws, of tails within the tails as the basic shapes of activities in this platform economy. Skewed distributions appear indeed as the ‘normal’ characteristic of the economic activity, the traditional market one as well as the so-called ‘sharing’ one, which stands as a new form of the globalization
O35|Classification des systèmes de monnaies non-bancaires : ce que disent les données du Web|This article proposes a classification of the projects of non-banking currencies based on a lexical analysis on the Web data. The advantage of this method is to offer an endogenous typology of the initiatives, based on the way the various currencies are presented on the internet. She so allows to by-pass the difficulty met in the literature which faces troubles in bringing to the foreground a clear taxonomy from exogeneous elements. The corpus was created from 32 keywords referring to the complementary currencies. The first 10 Urls of results under the search engine Google for each of the keywords was selected, then their text contents extracted. The corpus is so constituted by 320 web pages, corresponding to 1210 pages of text and 342 585 words, that is 17 939 segments of 20 successive occurrences. A classification of the corpus by a downward hierarchical analysis endogenously creates five different classes, allowing us to operate distinctions not only between the projects of non-banking currencies, but also between these and the standard monetary system. An analysis of similarity concludes that all the currencies define themselves with regard to the conventional currency, except the local exchange trading systems (LETs).
O35|Représentations sociales de la monnaie : contraste entre les citoyens et les porteurs de monnaies locales|This article analyzes the social representations of money from survey data. More specifically, it tests how holders of a complementary currency project have a distinct perception of money compared to other citizens. The main results confirm the existence of significant differences between the two groups. The structure of their representations shows that money is less tied to official institutions, the symbol of the sovereign State, to work and wages than for the representative population group. This confirms a number of theoretical works that see these social innovations as protest projects of the standard system, questioning the sovereignty State currency and close to the concepts of unconditional income. Local currencies, by differences in social representations they contain, could well be generators of societal change.
O35|Classifying Non-banking Monetary Systems using Web Data|This paper develops a new classification of non-banking currencies projects based on a lexical analysis from web data. The advantage of this method is to derive an endogenous typology of monetary projects, based on how currencies are depicted on the internet. Therefore, it allows to by-pass issues face for now in the literature to uncover a clear classification of non-banking currencies projects from exogenous elements. Our textual corpus consists in 320 web pages, corresponding to 1210 text pages. We first applied to our data a downward hierarchical clustering, which enables us to endogenously derive five different classes, allowing us to operate distinctions not only between non-banking currencies projects, but also between these latter and the standard monetary system. Then, we resorted to a similarity analysis and according to our results; all non-banking currencies projects define themselves in relation to the standard monetary system, with the exception of Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETs).
O35|Various approaches to measuring business innovation: their relevance for capturing social innovation|This paper reviews various approaches to measuring business innovation from the angle of capturing social innovations and offers several methodological and policy conclusions. First, the Innovation Union Scoreboard (IUS) indicators in principle could be useful in settings where the dominant mode of innovation is based on R&D activities. In practice, however, both R&D and non-R&D-based modes of innovation are fairly important. IUS, therefore, only provides a partial picture. Social innovations can certainly rely on R&D-based technological innovations. Their essence, however, tends to be organisational, managerial and behavioural changes. The IUS indicators do not capture these types of changes. Second, an assessment of the 81 indicators used to compile the Global Innovation Index reveals that it would neither be a fruitful effort to rely on those indicators to capture social innovations. Third, given the diversity among innovation systems, a poor performance signalled by a composite indicator does'nt automatically identify the area(s) necessitating the most urgent policy actions. Only tailored, thorough comparative analyses can do so. Fourth, analysts and policy-makers need to be aware of the differences between measuring (i) social innovation activities (efforts) themselves, (ii) the framework conditions (pre-requisites, available inputs, skills, norms, values, behavioural patterns, etc.) of being socially innovative, and (iii) the economic, societal or environmental impacts of social innovations.
O35|Towards social investment and social innovation in EU member states? First observations of recent developments in Austria|This paper aims to shed light on the relative importance of the discourse on social investment and social innovation in Austrian social policy by examining their role in academic and civil society discussions and presenting some evidence of current empirical developments. It is shown that the idea of social innovation is increasingly being promoted by industry, the media and civil society. In terms of social investment, the perspective has only recently been taken up by some researchers and interest groups. Depending on its very definition, however, empirical data on social investment expenditures suggest – also in comparison with other conservative welfare states – increasing or decreasing trends of this type of social security expenditures in Austria.
O35|Structure of Social Attitudes to Science and Technology: National and Individual Determinants|Attitudes towards science and technology has been drawing the attention of many researchers focusing their search on specific aspects of public understanding of science, measuring risk perception associated with the development and wider dissemination of new technologies, engagement in decision making about controversial research issues. While some authors prefer to focus on the prevalence of particular attitudes towards S&T, trying to explain the differences between countries by variances in their economic development, others search for specific individual factors underpinning their development like values or beliefs. In our paper, we attempt to bring together these perspectives and comprehensively analyze both individual and national factors that define public opinion on S&T by considering the example of the attitude that characterizes optimistic or pessimistic perception. The method of multilevel regression analysis is used for this purpose. It was shown that inclusion into the model both micro and macro-level indicators is helpful to explain the differences between countries and allow us to better understand the “pure effects” of certain social determinants of public attitudes towards science and technology
O35|Homophily and Triadic Closure in Evolving Social Networks|We present a new network model accounting for homophily and triadic closure in the evolution of social networks. In particular, in our model, each node is characterized by a number of features and the probability of a link between two nodes depends on common features. The bipartite network of the actors and features evolves according to a dynamics that depends on three parame-ters that respectively regulate the preferential attachment in the transmission of the features to the nodes, the number of new features per node, and the power-law behavior of the total number of observed features. We provide theoretical results and statistical estimators for the parameters of the model. We validate our approach by means of simulations and an empirical analysis of a network of scientifc collaborations.
O35|‘Shaken, but not stirred’: six decades defining social innovation|This paper examines the evolution in the conceptualization of Social Innovation (SI) under the assumption of SI as a trans-disciplinary construct which comprises a diversity of discourses from different fields and actors. We performed a comprehensive and systematic literature review along six decades (1950-2014), extracting definitions of SI through a search of 2,339 documents in various languages retrieved from Web of Science, SCOPUS and Google scholar. To guide the inductive analysis of pluri-vocal discourses we assume innovation to be a learning-based process, introducing the notion of social practice linked to its intertwined institutional and socio-cultural dimensions. We applied mixed qualitative methodologies, combining content analysis based on a social constructionist/interpretivist ontology with cognitive mapping techniques. Our findings identify some core and secondary elements underpinning two complementary perspectives (transformative and instrumental) of SI as scientific construct. They also point to a number of promising avenues for research towards the advancement of a socio-technical theory of innovation.
O35|Determining Degraded Housing Areas in the Light of Regulations Regarding Revitalization Funding|Guideline of Ministry of Regional Development on housing have created the potential conditions for implementation of regeneration projects in the areas of housing, co-financed from the EU funds. The inadequacy of the detailed provisions of these guidelines in relation to the definitional understanding of revitalization and the limited data aggregation of Polish official statistics caused the deficiencies in determining degraded areas. The result was the implementation of repair or modernization projects mainly. Set criteria for determining degraded areas, by using inappropriate reference (in relation to regional indicators) have resulted in the exclusion of many urban territories from revitalization activities financed from the EU sources. The content of this article is to present and evaluate these criteria, their impact on the way of the delimitation of the areas and the conclusions suggesting necessary changes in these guidelines.
O35|Empirical analysis of customer motives in the shareconomy: a cross-sectoral comparison|We present the results of an empirical study on German customers' motives to participate in the shareconomy. We focus on four different industries with two companies each: accommodation renting (Airbnb vs. Couchsurfing), car sharing (DriveNow vs. tamyca), commodities (Leihdirwas vs. WHY own it) and clothing (Prêt-à-Louer vs. Kleiderkreisel). We can conclude that the lower prices compared to classical consumption offers provide the main motive for customers using sharing offers. Across industries, we find tremendous differences as regards the importance of further motives like environmental awareness or availability of offers. Based on the results of the study, we elaborate recommendations for the different sectors.
O35|New Cooperation Modes: An Opportunity for Polish Biotechnological Clusters|This article reviews new cooperation forms between companies, referring to the latest data from the asap (the Association of Strategic Alliance Professionals). Potential cooperation between companies, universities and research institutes in the field of biotechnology in Poland based on a model of open innovation alliances are presented. Biopharmaceutical companies are looking for new and innovative paths of development. They try to implement new strategies to transfer their research processes to a higher level. To achieve this, biopharmaceutical companies often use open innovation model as an additional tool for developing new products. Thanks to the cooperation with universities in the framework of open innovation alliances, they can significantly reduce the risk, the cost of research, and most of all, through joint work with academic researchers on identifying disease mechanisms and on development of new drugs, they are able to create improved and appropriate medical therapy for patients.
