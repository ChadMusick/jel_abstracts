B25|El equivalente general en la génesis del dinero de Marx: el dinero como criatura del Estado|En la Génesis del dinero Marx expone sin éxito la postulación del equivalente general, una laguna en su teoría del valor que ha motivado considerable literatura. En este documento de trabajo planteamos una alternativa al método dialéctico para explicar el surgimiento y naturaleza del dinero, la cual presenta cierta coherencia con algunas observaciones históricas respecto al mismo realizadas por el propio Marx. La integración con la Teoría del Dinero del Estado nos permite interpretar la teoría laboral del valor como una teoría monetaria del valor-trabajo, acorde con las relaciones y dinámicas capitalistas. A través de las nociones de la forma de valor y el concepto de trabajo abstracto, analizaremos cómo la teoría laboral del valor es esencial para comprender el pleno empleo con estabilidad de precios en un sistema de producción fragmentado, caracterizado por las quiebras empresariales y el papel jugado por los bancos privados en la endogeneidad de la oferta monetaria. Finalmente, sugerimos el mecanismo del Trabajo Garantizado como estabilizador del valor de la moneda, mitigando los efectos de la financiarización de la economía y las apuestas fallidas de los bancos.
B25|The Late Emerging Consensus Among American Economists on Antitrust Laws in the Second New Deal|This paper presents the late convergence process from US economists that led them to support a strong antitrust enforcement in the late thirties despite their long standing distrust toward this legislation. The 1945 Alcoa decision crafted by Judge Hand embodied the results of this convergence. The purpose of antitrust law enforcement does not consist in promoting economic efficiency, as today’s more economic approach advocates, but in searching for a reasonable compromise aiming at preventing improper uses of economic power. This paper presents the path from which institutionalist economists, on one side, and Chicagoan neoliberals, on the other one, have converged on supporting the President F.D. Roosevelt administration towards reinvigorating antitrust law enforcement as of 1938, putting aside their initial preferences for a regulated competition model or for laissez-faire.
B25|La concentration des pouvoirs économiques privés : une perspective d’économie institutionnelle du droit|This paper analyzes how competition law and economics tackle the issue of private economic powers. We highlight a tension between recommendations based on a definition of the competitive order as a guarantee of access to market and of pluralism, and normative prescriptions whose sole objective is the maximization of consumer welfare. We illustrate our aims with an analysis of the stakes for digital markets. JEL codes: B25, D43, K2
B25|Försörjningsstöd, institutioner och strukturcykeln|Ur ett strukturcykliskt perspektiv sker en omvandling av ekonomi, institutioner och politik under omvandlingsperioderna. Då välfärd kan betraktas som en funktion av dessa borde det vara möjligt att analysera välfärd och de institutionella arrangemang som är nödvändiga för en välfärdsproduktion med hjälp av en strukturcyklisk ansats. Lennart Schön har i ett flertal studier diskuterat detta samband, men på en hög teoretiskt abstraktionsnivå. Denna uppsats syftar till att diskutera i vilken utsträckning ett strukturanalytiskt resonemang är tillämpligt vid analyser av tillkomst och förändring av olika välfärdsarrangemang och social reformarbete. Socialtjänst och försörjningsstöd, samt deras föregångare, används som exempel. Resultaten indikerar att 1871 års fattigvårdsförordning, 1918 års fattigvårdslag, 1956 års socialhjälpslag och 1997 års socialtjänstlag styrts eller i stor utsträckning påverkats av sociala utvecklingsblock, medan 1980 års socialtjänstlag snarare tillkommit enligt ett kris-/skördetidsmönster.
B25|Criptovalute, Sovranismo e Sistema Monetario|La storia finanziaria dell’ultimo decennio ci offre diversi spunti di riflessione sullo stato e le prospettive dell’attuale sistema monetario. Le dinamiche sui mercati delle criptovalute e le trasformazioni politiche in atto sembrano sottoporre l’attuale assetto monetario a pressioni di segno opposto: mentre le prime promuovono – da una prospettiva liberale e sovranazionale – la riduzione della contiguità tra emissione monetaria e potere politico, le seconde – da una prospettiva populista e sovranista – premono per un suo deciso rafforzamento. Questo lavoro discute la natura e le implicazioni di queste due tensioni, attraverso le lenti della memoria storica del nostro continente, e del pensiero di A. Smith e F. Von Hayek.
B25|CasP's 'Differential Accumulation' versus Veblen's 'Differential Advantage' (Revised and Expanded)|This paper clarifies a common misrepresentation of our theory of capital as power, or CasP. Many observers tend to box CasP as an ‘institutionalist’ theory, tracing its central process of ‘differential accumulation’ to Thorstein Veblen’s notion of ‘differential advantage’. This view, we argue, betrays a misunderstanding of CasP, Veblen or both. First, we are not Veblenians and certainly not institutionalists: Veblen’s theory was evolutionary, while CasP is deeply dialectical, and institutionalism, particularly its ‘new’ varieties, emphasizes and often promotes what holds capitalism together, whereas CasP critically examines both the underpinnings of capitalized power as well as the forces that threaten and undermine it. Second, CasP’s notion of differential accumulation is not only different from, but also diametrically opposed to Veblen’s differential advantage. Veblen, who wrote at the turn of the twentieth century, before the appearance of business indices and financial benchmarks, emphasized the absolute drive for ‘maximum profit’ and saw strategic sabotage merely as a power means to an economic end. By contrast, CasP, which was developed at the end of the twentieth century, sees power not only as a means of accumulation, but also – and perhaps more importantly – as its ultimate purpose. Accumulators, it argues, are conditioned and driven to augment not their profits and assets as such, but their relative power, and this means that, as symbolic bearers of power, these profits and assets should be measured not absolutely, but relatively to those of others – hence the imperative of differential accumulation.
B25|"Die Wirkmacht der ""Liebe zum Markt"": Zum anhaltenden Einfluss ordoliberaler ÖkonomInnen-Netzwerke in Politik und Gesellschaft"|Der Artikel behandelt die aktuell breit diskutierte Frage der Rolle und des Einflusses ordoliberalen Denkens in (wirtschafts-) politischen Debatten in Deutschland. Wir nehmen dabei erstens eine theoretische Verortung des Ordoliberalismus vor und zeigen zweitens anhand einer Sozialen Netzwerkanalyse die ungebrochene politische und mediale Wirkmächtigkeit ordoliberaler ÖkonomInnen bis heute.
B25|The Urgent Need for an Economics of “Hategoatism”|The word “scapegoat” is defined as “a person made to bear the blame for others,” and similarly, “scapegoatism” refers to “the act or practice of assigning blame or failure to another, as to deflect attention or responsibility away from oneself” (Collins English Dictionary and Dictionary.com, respectively.) While these definitions do not mention economics specifically, in most cases the blame on the scapegoat is economic in nature. Scapegoatism also provides a convenient, though extremely inferior, substitute for valid analyses of economic problems. Scapegoatism, however, has a partner, dehumanization, which is the process of demonizing certain people as less than human and unworthy of humane treatment. Scapegoatism is not only accompanied by dehumanization, but it is often motivated by it. Thus, “scapegoatism” is a euphemism and it is understudied as a result, because there is no single term of art that combines scapegoatism and dehumanization. This paper offers a solution to this semantic dilemma by proposing the new term, “HATEGOATISM,” for the simultaneous existence of scapegoatism and dehumanization. Only one subfield of economics regularly embraces hategoatism, which is Libertarianism (where the “HATEGOAT” is government workers). Economists must lead by example by combating hategoatism, and that requires cleaning their own house first.
B25|Der spezifische Liberalismus von Hayek im Spektrum des Neoliberalismus|Friedrich August von Hayek hat der Nachwelt ein breites theoretisches Werk hinterlassen. Ein durchgängiger Wesenszug darin ist sein spezifischer Liberalismus, der durch einen negativen Begriff von Freiheit bestimmt ist. Damit verbunden ist Hayeks ausgeprägter methodologischer Individualismus. Doch Hayek polarisiert, und zwar nicht nur zwischen Anhängern und Gegnern, sondern auch innerhalb der Vertreter des neoliberalen Spektrums. Der Beitrag geht der Frage nach, in welchem Grade Hayek selbst die Verantwortung dafür trägt, indem Inkonsistenzen in seinem Denken aufgezeigt werden. Eine Konsequenz davon ist, dass Hayek zwar für verschiedene Varianten des Neoliberalismus als Bezugspunkt dient, aber die Heterogenität des modernen Neoliberalismus noch vertieft hat. Ob Hayek ein Ordoliberaler oder ein Marktradikaler ist, bleibt eine Frage, die bestenfalls tendenziell zu beantworten ist Ein einheitliches Denkkollektiv im Anschluss an Hayek existiert jedenfalls nicht, ebenso wenig wie ein homogener Neoliberalismus.
B25|Der vergessene Lippmann: Politik, Propaganda und Markt|"Das Paper gibt einen Überblick über das Leben und die Bedeutung von Walter Lippmann, der in der ersten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts einer der bedeutendsten Journalisten der USA war. Lippmann hat sich auch an Propagandaaktivitäten im Ersten Weltkrieg beteiligt und aufgrund dieser Erfahrung u.a. 1922 das Buch Public Opinion publiziert. Dieses Buch wird hier zusammenfassend beschrieben und in seiner Bedeutung eingeschätzt. Dies wird dann einem weiteren Buch von Lippmann Buch, nämlich The Good Society aus dem Jahre 1937, gegenübergestellt - das letztere Buch gab Anlass zum so genannten Walter Lippmann Colloque 1938 in Paris, das als die erste internationale Veranstaltung des Neoliberalismus gilt. Lippmanns Manipulationsideen werden verglichen mit denen, die Friedrich August von Hayek aus Anlass der Gründung der Mont Pèlerin Society , die als Nachfolgeorganisation des Walter Lippmann Colloque gilt: Lippmann hat vor Manipulation gewarnt, die Demokratie sei damit gefährdet. Demgegenüber wollte sich Hayek der Manipulation ""der Massen"" bedienen, nur so könne ""die Zivilisation"" gerettet werden."
B25|Ökonomische Expertise und politökonomische Machtstrukturen|Aufbauend auf neueren und älteren Forschungsergebnissen zum Einfluss von ÖkonomInnen auf politische Entscheidungsprozesse und mediale wirtschaftspolitische Debatten wird in diesem Beitrag ein eklatantes politökonomisches Machtungleichgewicht unter einflussreichen ökonomischen ExpertInnen aufgezeigt: Es kann vor allem in Deutschland eine starke Dominanz von neo- bzw. ordoliberalen Interessenskoalitionen bzw. -netzwerken gegenüber alternativen, keynesianischen oder gewerkschaftsnahen Netzwerken konstatiert werden, wohingegen in Österreich durch eine noch stärkere Bedeutung korporatistischer Strukturen dieses Ungleichgewicht zumindest schwächer ausgeprägt ist. Auf Basis dieses Beitrags kann argumentiert werden, dass das politökonomische Machtungleichgewicht in der Ökonomik als einer der Grundpfeiler der Persistenz neoliberaler Wirtschaftspolitiken zugunsten ökonomisch Mächtiger zu verstehen ist.
B25|Markfundamentalismus als Kollektivgedanke: Mises und die Ordoliberalen|"In diesem Beitrag diskutieren wir den Begriff des Marktfundamentalismus, der für uns Ludwik Fleck folgend auf dem einigenden Kollektivgedanken ""des Marktes"" im frühen ""neoliberalen Denkkollektivs"" nach Mirowski und Plehwe beruht. Unsere These ist, dass in jenem Denkkollektiv der Kollektivgedanke ""des Marktes"" enthalten ist, wir zeigen dies anhand grundlegender Werke von Ludwig von Mises, dem Begründer des Marktfundamentalismus, sowie führender Denker des Ordoliberalismus. In diesem Beitrag wollen wir (1) auf konzeptioneller Ebene zeigen, auf welche Weise das Konzept ""des Marktes"" als eine ""Tiefenstruktur"" im Denken unterschiedlicher ökonomischer TheoretikerInnen verstanden werden kann, und (2) andeuten, welchen Einfluss diese konzeptionelle Grundlage des ökonomischen Denkens auf konkrete Vorstellungen zur Organisation von politischen und gesellschaftlichen Prozessen hat."
B25|Bilder in der Geschichte der Ökonomie: Das Beispiel der Metapher von der Wirtschaft als Maschine|"In der ökonomischen Theorie haben Metaphern (als Formen eines bildhaften Sprachgebrauchs) immer eine besondere Rolle gespielt. Nach einem historischen Überblick über das Konzept von Metaphern wird die Geschichte des dominanten Stranges in der ökonomischen Theorie als Geschichte einer Metapher von der Maschine skiziiert In der Geschichte der ökonomischen Theorie finden sich immer Metaphern, diese können als Formen eines bildhaften Sprachgebrauchs verstanden werden. Eine besondere Rolle hat im Hauptrang der Theorieentwicklung die Metapher von der Maschine gespielt. Nach einem historischen Überblick über das Konzept von Metaphern (Kap. 1) und der Kulturgeschichte der Metapher von der Maschine (Kap. 3) wird die Geschichte der ökonomischen Theorie als achtstufige Geschichte einer Metapher von der Maschine skizziert: Bei Quesnay als einer machine économique mit Bezug auf die Philosophie von Descartes, bei Smith eine natural order mit Bezug auf die Mechanik bei Newton, bei Malthus und Ricardo als Konzept von ökonomischen Gesetzen in Analogie zu Naturgesetzen in einer Neuinterpretation von Newton - ähnlich auch bei John Stuart Mill, bei Jevons und Walras als explizit ausformulierte ""mechanistische Nationalökonomie"", bei Autoren wie Gérald Debreu als Neuformulierung des Ansatzes von Walras als einer Informationsmechanik, sowie bei Friedrich August von Hayek als Konzept von ""dem Markt"" als einem Informationsnetzwerk in Analogie zu einem Telekommunikationssystem."
B25|"Wissen und Nicht-Wissen angesichts ""des Marktes"": Das Konzept von Hayek"|"Das Paper diskutiert den Einfluss von Karl Friedrich August von Hayek auf die Geschichte der ökonomischen Theorie, vor allem durch sein Konzept ""des Marktes"" als Wissenvermittlungs- und Wissensgenerierungsinstanz. Das ist mit einem Konzept des Nicht-Wissens für den Menschen verbunden, der angesichts des ""Überwissens des Marktes"" die Fähigkeit verliert, über das Wirtschaftssystem angemessen reflektieren zu können. Damit ist eine Aufwertung des Wissen von UnternehmerInnen und eine Abwertung des Wissens von WirtschaftswissenschaftlerInnen verbunden - mit Konsequenzen für das Konzept der Politik und auf die Art, wie z.B. über Klimaprobleme diskutiert werden. Im Paper werden diese Konzepte in Bezug auf die Absicht von Hayek diskutiert, langffristig die gesamte Gesellschaft zu verändern."
B25|70 years after the German currency and economic reform: The monetary, economic and political order in Europe is disturbed|The currency reform on 20 June 1948, together with a comprehensive liberalisation of prices and the implementation of monopoly control, formed the basis for the West German economic miracle. From then on, the market principles formulated by Walter Eucken und implemented by Ludwig Erhard became the economic backbone of the European integration process. 70 years later, little remains of the basic principles of the German social market economy. An increasingly expansive monetary policy of the European Central Bank undermines market principles, growth and social cohesion in Europe, thereby eroding political stability. To ensure Europe's economic, political and social stability, a return to a stable currency and a marketoriented order is needed.
B25|Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, development economist|Accounts of Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen’s career as an economist usually focus either on the brilliance of his pioneer contributions to mathematical economics during the 1930s, or more frequently, on his later conversion to a critical approach to economic theory anchored on the centrality of the entropy law in a dynamic setting. These two disparate moments, however, were connected by Georgescu-Roegen’s strong attraction to the study of the problems afflicting underdeveloped societies. This began with his work on the agricultural economy of his native Romania, produced under the auspices of Harvard’s Russian Research Center in the late 1940s. Thenceforth, he embarked on a journey that spawned his early interest in Leontief-type linear models, an extended tour of Southeast Asia commissioned by Vanderbilt University’s Graduate Program in Economic Development, and several visits to Brazil during the 1960s to assist in the development of academic economics in the country. The paper highlights these lesser-known aspects of Georgescu-Roegen’s intellectual trajectory, while using his case to illustrate some of the paths open for inquiry during the heyday of development economics.
B25|The Brexit as a Forerunner: Monetary Policy, Economic Order and Divergence Forces in the European Union|We analyze the effects of the increasingly expansionary monetary policies on the economic order and on the European integration process. We argue that the market orders shaped in postwar Germany and in Margret Thatcher’s United Kingdom have long served as cornerstones for growth, prosperity and social cohesion in Europe. It is shown that the monetary policies of the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have undermined these orders, thereby eroding productivity gains and growth. Combined with negative distribution effects, ultra-loose monetary policies constitute the breeding ground for divergence forces in the European Union as heralded by the Brexit.
B25|Limitantes sociales y políticos de la industrialización por sustitución de importaciones en Colombia 1950-1980|El presente trabajo tiene como objetivo lograr un acercamiento a las dificultades sociales y políticas por las cuales atravesó el modelo de Industrialización por Sustitución de Importaciones (ISI) en Colombia. A lo largo del texto se realiza un recorrido por diversos problemas afrontados en el país entre 1950 y 1980, periodo durante el cual el problema agrario, el conflicto armado y la falta de una élite económica que propiciara un proceso de industrialización aparecen como razones generadoras de dificultades en el proceso de industrialización colombiano. Finalmente, se concluye que estos motivos generan consecuencias que no permiten consolidar un mercado interno fuerte, factor fundamental para el proceso de industrialización.
B25|Pouvoirs économiques privés et ordre concurrentiel : Une application à l’économie numérique|This paper analyses how competition law and economics tackles the issue of private economic power. Through a historical approach based on the evolutions of the economic thoughts and courts decisional practices, we stress a tension between recommendations based on a definition of the competitive order as a guarantee of access to market or of pluralism, and normative prescriptions based the consumer welfare maximisation, as the competition law enforcement unique criterion. We illustrate this debates with examples provided by digital markets and we open the discussion to the media sector.
B25|Hayek on Expectations: The Interplay between two Complex Systems|In this paper we argue that Hayek’s expectations approach can be better understood by taking account of the interplay between two related complex systems: the complex system of cognition and the complex system of behavioral rules of action. The former is located at the individual level and concerns the way human beings perceive the physical world as and well as their fellow men. The second one concerns how human beings behave (essentially how they follow rules) and form expectations based on the properties of their cognitive systems, such that the system of rules to which they adhere provides higher order regularities which preserve their existence over time, that is, the existence of societies. The article is organized as follows. Section 1 provides a detailed description of these complex systems and emphasizes their differences. Section 2 deals with the interplay between these two systems, and discusses the consequences of forming expectations. Section 3 sums up the paper’s main arguments.
B25|Buchanan and public finance: The tennessee years|Abstract James Buchanan’s views on public finance have already been analyzed and they are quite well known, as are their origins and roots. However, nothing has ever been said about why Buchanan chose public finance in the first place. The first goal of this paper is to show that Buchanan had made this choice before arriving at Chicago. We show how Carlton C. Sims and Charles P. White influenced him. We also show, by analyzing Buchanan’s M.A. thesis, that he was not only interested in public finance but was also primarily concerned by ethical questions and defended a bureaucratic centralized solution to solve the problem he was discussing – how to share the benefits collected from a gasoline tax among Counties. This helps to understand that Buchanan did not choose to study public finance to learn how to fight government intervention. Quite the contrary: it was to legitimate it. Second, we also demonstrate that a lot of the ideas that will matter for Buchanan in his career – the importance of ethics and the principle of an equal treatment for equals, the need to link taxes to benefits, the importance to adapt the scale of provision of a public good to the type of public good – were already present in this first work.
B25|Pouvoirs économiques privés et ordre concurentiel. Une application à l'économie numérique|Il s’agit d’interroger la façon dont l’économie du droit de la concurrence se saisit de la question des pouvoirs économiques privés. Au travers d’une analyse historique, les prescriptions de la science économique et les pratiques décisionnelles américaine et européenne sont interrogées. Nous mettons en évidence une tension entre les recommandations qui découlent d’une défense de l’ordre concurrentiel conçu comme une garantie d’accès au marché et de pluralisme, et celles qui assignent à ce dernier le seul et unique objectif de la maximisation du bien-être du consommateur. Nous illustrons notre propos par une analyse de ces enjeux pour les marchés numériques et par une application au secteur des médias.
B25|Hayekian Welfare States: Explaining the Co-Existence of Economic Freedom and Big Government|The idea that all types of economic freedom – including limited government – promote prosperity is challenged by the fact that some countries successfully combine a large public sector with high taxes and otherwise high levels of economic freedom. To explain the co-existence of economic freedom and big government, this paper distinguishes between big government in the fiscal sense of requiring high taxes, and in the Hayekian sense of requiring knowledge that is difficult to acquire by a central authority. The indicators of government size included in measures of economic freedom capture the fiscal size but ignore the Hayekian knowledge problem. hinking about government size in both the fiscal and Hayekian dimensions suggests the possibility of Hayekian welfare states, where trust and state capacity facilitate experimentation and learning, resulting in a public sector that is big in a fiscal sense but not necessarily more vulnerable to the Hayekian knowledge problem. Pensions in Sweden are used as a case to illustrate the empirical relevance of the argument. The new pension system represents big government in a fiscal sense, but by relying on decentralized choice it requires relatively little central knowledge.
B25|The Stockholm School in a New Age – Erik Lundberg and the Swedish Model|The Stockholm-school member Erik Lundberg is the economist who devoted most attention to the economic theory and policy of the Swedish postwar model. The established view is that Lundberg was a steadfast opponent of the so-called Rehn- Meidner model, an economic and wage policy program developed by two Swedish trade-union economists in the early postwar years. The model recommends fiscal policies in the medium term, extensive labor market programs and wage policies of solidarity to simultaneously obtain price stability, full employment, income equality and high growth. This article maintains that Lundberg shared many of the premises of the Rehn-Meidner model already at the beginning of his debate with Gösta Rehn in the early 1950s. Furthermore, in their debate, Lundberg approached Rehn’s policy program and underlying theory of the working of the Swedish economy. Despite his ideological qualms, Lundberg’s ambiguous attitude to the Rehn-Meidner model turned into a complete adoption of the model in the 1960s. By highlighting the innovative nature of the Rehn-Meidner theory, Lundberg also correctly downplayed the impact of the Stockholm School.
B25|Functional Finance: A Comparison of the Evolution of the Positions of Hyman Minsky and Abba Lerner|"This paper examines the views of Hyman Minsky and Abba Lerner on the functional finance approach to fiscal policy. It argues that the main principles of functional finance were relatively widely held in the immediate postwar period. However, with the rise of the Phillips curve, the return of the Quantity Theory, the development of the notion of a government budget constraint, and accelerating inflation at the end of the 1960s, functional finance fell out of favor. The paper compares and contrasts the evolution of the views of Minsky and Lerner over the postwar period, arguing that Lerner's transition went further, as he embraced a version of Monetarism that emphasized the use of monetary policy over fiscal policy. Minsky's views of functional finance became more nuanced, in line with his Institutionalist approach to the economy. However, Minsky never rejected his early beliefs that countercyclical government budgets must play a significant role in stabilizing the economy. Thus, in spite of some claims that Minsky should not be counted as one of the ""forefathers"" of Modern Money Theory (MMT), this paper argues that it is Minsky, not Lerner, whose work remains essential for the further development of MMT."
B25|External Instability in Transition: Applying Minsky's Theory of Financial Fragility to International Markets|This inquiry argues that the successful completion of the transition process in the post-Soviet economies is constrained by the prevailing social structure and low levels of technological progress, both of which require institutional reforms aimed at increasing growth in national income, productivity, and the degree of export competitiveness. Domestic policy implementation has not shown significant improvements on these fronts, given its short-term orientation, but instead resulted in stagnating growth rates, continuously accumulating levels of external debt, and decreasing living standards. The key to a successful completion of the transition process is therefore a combination of policies targeted at the dynamic transformation of production structures within an environment of financial stability and favorable macroeconomic conditions.
B25|Investment Decisions under Uncertainty|"Divergent trends, as observed, between growth in the financial and real sectors of the global economy entail the need for further research, especially on the motivations behind investment decisions. Investments in market economies are generally guided by call-put option pricing models--which rely on an ergodic notion of probability that conforms to a normal distribution function. This paper considers critiques of the above models, which include Keynes's Treatise on Probability (1921) and the General Theory (1936), as well as follow-ups in the post-Keynesian approaches and others dealing with ""fundamental uncertainty."" The methodological issues, as can be pointed out, are relevant in the context of policy issues and social institutions, including those subscribed to by the ruling state. As it has been held in variants of institutional economics subscribed to by John Commons, Thorstein Veblen, Geoffrey Hodgeson, and John Kenneth Galbraith, social institutions remain important in their capacity as agencies that influence individual behavior with their ""informational-cognitive"" functions in society. By shaping business concerns and strategies, social institutions have a major impact on investment decisions in a capitalist system. The role of such institutions in investment decisions via policy making is generally neglected in strategies based on mainstream economics, which continue to rely on optimization of stock market returns based on imprecise estimations of probability."
B25|Development of Education and Health Services in Asia and the Role of the State|This paper analyses the dramatic spread of education and healthcare in Asia and also the large variations in that spread across and within countries over fifty years. Apart from differences in initial conditions and income levels, the nature of the State has also been an important determinant of these variations. This is because social development has typically been led by the State. But in most countries, public resource constraints and the growing dependence on private provision and private spending have generated a pattern of nested disparities in the access to education and healthcare between rich and poor regions, between rural and urban areas within regions, and between rich and poor households within these areas. However, as the better-off regions, areas, and households approach the upper limits of achievable education and health standards, a process of convergence is also underway as those left behind begin to catch up.
B25|Demand regimes, financialisation and hysteresis. New Keynesian and post-Keynesian macroeconomic underpinnings of the Varieties of Capitalism|The recent integration of post-Keynesian insights into Comparative Political Economy is an exciting development. Post-Keynesian theory differs from neoclassical and Marxist theories in its analysis of the role of income distribution and of finance. It allows for wage-led demand regimes and it regards finance to be endogenously created and a source of instability. The paper contributes to the debate on the integration of demand regimes in the Varieties of Capitalism analyses. It contrasts post-Keynesian theory to the New Keynesian three equation model. It highlights that post-Keynesian theory gives prominence to the role of income distribution and allows for wage-led demand regimes; financial variables play a key role, which gives rise to endogenous instability and financial cycles (Minskyan debt cycles); economic growth is regarded as a path dependent process (with unemployment hysteresis due to wage norms) and is not anchored in a supply side equilibrium. However, PKE has so far mostly provided a normative analysis of government interventions. The ability to generate income and wealth rather than competitiveness is regarded as key criteria for a viable variety of capitalism.
B25|Bringing the helicopter to ground: a historical review of fiscal-monetary coordination to support economic growth in the 20th century|In the face of the perceived high public and private debt levels and sluggish recovery that has followed the financial crisis of 2007-08, there have been calls for greater fiscal-monetary coordination to stimulate nominal demand. Policy debates have been focused upon the inflationary expectations that may be generated by monetary financing or related policies, consistent with New Consensus Macroeconomics theoretical frameworks. Historical examples of fiscal-monetary policy coordination have been largely neglected, along with alternative theoretical views, such as post-Keynesian perspectives that emphasise uncertainty and demand rather than rational expectations. This paper begins to address this omission. First, we provide an overview of the holdings of government debt by both central banks and commercial banks as an imperfect but still informative proxy for fiscal-monetary coordination in advanced economies in the 20th century. Second, we develop a new typology of forms of fiscal-monetary coordination that includes both direct and less direct forms of monetary financing, illustrating this with case-study examples. In particular, we focus on the 1930s-1970s period when central banks and ministries of finance cooperated closely, with less independence accorded to monetary policy and greater weight attached to fiscal policy. We find a number of cases where fiscal-monetary coordination proved useful in stimulating economic growth, supporting industrial policy objectives and managing public debt without excessive inflation.
B25|Contemporary of every age: Gaetano Filangieri between public happiness and institutional economics|In the decades around the turn of the eighteenth century, Naples was capital of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and Europe’s third most populous city. From the early decades of the eighteenth to the end of the nineteenth century, the city spawned a school of intellectuals that, though predominantly juridical in cast, nevertheless displayed a surprisingly substantial openness to a new approach to the social sciences, which had developed above all in France, heavily influenced by the natural sciences and the experimental method. In harmony with Enlightenment thought, Gaetano Filangieri was the precursor, two centuries back, of the principles of indissoluble interaction between formal and informal institutions and economic development, between governance and social feedback, that are pillars of today’s school of institutional economics. His writings anticipated, in a number of respects, conceptual approaches adopted by later scholars. The present paper offers an institutional focus on his work, referring above all to Douglass North and his treatment of the role of the Glorious Revolution.
B25|Mirror image versus Parabolic Reflections of Donor Kebabs: Secret of Economic Success|The paper explains why re advent of neo Keynesian economics may lead to a framework of universal economic development that means prosperity achieved vertically (national) and horizontally (local) only if it can utilize tools of social science available in anthropology and political economy.
B25|A note on re-switching and the neo-Austrian concept of the average period of production|The neo-Austrian average period of production is calculated by taking the shares of costs referable to each period out of the total amount of costs as weights. Once this notion had been introduced, its inverse relationship with the rate of interest prompted some scholars to believe that it could serve as a good measure of capital intensity. As will be shown, however, this new average period poses some problems. On the one hand, the inverse relationship mentioned above does not preclude the re-switching of production methods. On the other, if re-switching occurs, the most roundabout method may paradoxically be the one that gives the smallest net output per worker. This result can affect the revival of the Austrian business-cycle theory.
B25|Política Fiscal, Ingresos y Desigualdad en Colombia (1990-2015)<BR>[Fiscal Policy, Income And Inequality In Colombia (1990-2015)]|Due to the supported economic growth of the first decade of the 21st century, Colombia managed to reduce the levels of poverty and inequality. Nevertheless, the country continued to present one of the most inequitable economies in the world maintaining a high income concentration. In that sense, this paper aims at analyzing the fiscal policy incident in the income distribution. To that effect, the redistributive impact of the fiscal action in Colombia, Latin America and the group of country members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) were examined. Besides, a historical follow-up of the income and public expenditures behavior in Colombia was carried out from 1990 until 2015, highlighting two fundamental facts: 1) from the constitutional reform of 1991, the social public expenditure presented a remarkable growth as a response to the fiscal commitments acquired by the state and 2) the Income Tax and the Value-Added tax (VAT) have been the props on which the national tax structure has been supported. With these elements and the information supplied by the National Survey of Income and Home Expenses, there was approached the study of the distributive incident in Colombia, estimating Gini’s indicators, the income concentration, Kakwani and Reynolds-Smolensky. The results of the present investigation allow to conclude that though the Income Tax to natural people, the Value-Added Tax (VAT) and the public expenditure show a progressive behavior, their redistributive capacity is limited; that is why the Gini’s coefficient don’t present significant variations after the fiscal action.
B25|Aux prémices des humanités numériques? La première analyse automatisée d'un réseau économique ancien (Gardin Garelli, 1961). Réalisation, conceptualisation, réception<BR>[A Precursor of Digital Humanities ? The First Automated Analysis of an Ancient Economic Network (Gardin & Garelli, 1961). Implementation, Theorization, Reception]|From as early as the 1950s, J.C. Gardin's work spanned both archaeology and the emerging automation of numerical computation and documentation. In 1961, with P. Garelli, he published the first automated application of graph theory to historical materials, working from Assyrian cuneiform tablets documenting economic relations. This work was then widely ignored both in archeology and network analysis. However, in the past twenty years, socio-epistemic claims related to the growth of the Internet and computing (digital humanities, computational archaeology, etc.) have brought a surge of interest in Gardin's work, which is now regarded as pioneering. Working from archive materials and publications, this paper shows how a historical sociology of scientific writings can be relevant to the history of automation in historical sciences. The paper examines Gardin's recognition as an influential forerunner of computational archeology, showing that : 1) although Gardin had access to resources (financial, instrumental, etc.) that were rare at the time, and could have provided material for the foundation of a school or a specialty, he did not however pursue this ambition; 2) the demonstrative purposes pursued by Gardin with his study of 1961 economic networks varied between the 1960s (demonstrating the relevance of non-numerical computation) and the 1980s (legitimizing simulation in the social sciences), but were never concerned with network analysis as such.
B25|"The ""Modern Monetary Theory"": An extension of Radical Political Economy"|The rupture of the nexus between monetary and fiscal policies, which derives from the supranational transfer of the monetary sovereignty by the states, is the origin of the great macroeconomic imbalances that shake today some nations inserted in the European integration process. In this paper we try to show the so-called Modern Monetary Theory, from which underlies the urgency of recovering the monetary-fiscal bond, and consequently, the need of conceiving public finances in a functional way. In contrast to the orthodox recommendations, which suggest fiscal balance and austerity as macroeconomic stabilization measures, the MMT contemplates the government and nongovernmental sectors balances as one, being desirable, therefore, fiscal expansion in recession periods to achieve full employment, without neglecting the one related to price stability. Thus, the implementation of job guaranteed programs would act as a powerful corrector of the supply-side imbalance in the labor market, meanwhile stimulating social and/or environmental improvements in the countries concerned, favoring higher levels of well-being in them ultimately.
B25|Can News Draw Blood? The Impact of Media Coverage on the Number and Severity of Terror Attacks|Using a new data set that captures the share of reporting on terrorism, we explore the nexus between terrorist attacks and the news. It turns out that terrorism mainly influences news reports through the number of incidents. Regarding the reverse causality, we provide evidence that the share of the news devoted to terrorism Granger-causes further terrorist activities. However, short-run and medium-run effects differ: media coverage on terror only impact in the severity of terror in the short run (up to two months). From the third to the tenth months, it causes an increase in the number as well as in the severity of the attack. These observations are consistent with the idea of competition between terrorist groups.
B25|Monetary Policy Crisis Management as a Threat to Economic Order|The paper analyses the effects of the monetary policy crisis management of the European Central Bank on the economic order of Germany. It is argued that in post-war Europe the German social market economy as designed by Eucken (1952) and Müller-Armack (1966) has been a core element of growth, welfare, social cohesion and political stability in Germany and Europe as a whole. It is shown that the monetary policy rescue measures of the European Central Bank have undermined the constitutive principles of the German social market economy, which has considerably contributed to the erosion of (productivity) growth and welfare in Germany and Europe. As the outcome is crumbling social cohesion and growing political instability, a timely exit from ultra-expansionary monetary policy is postulated.

B25|John Kenneth Galbraith et l’évolution des structures économiques du capitalisme : d’une théorie de l’entrepreneur à une théorie de la grande entreprise ?|Dans cet article nous revisitons le concept de technostructure forgé par John K. Galbraith dans Le nouvel État industriel, en le resituant dans son analyse de l'évolution des structures du capitalisme, et plus précisément du passage du capitalisme entrepreneurial au capitalisme de la grande entreprise. En distinguant d'une part la figure de l'entrepreneur et d'autre part les fonctions de l'entrepreneur, nous montrons que si la figure de l'entrepreneur disparaît progressivement, elle est supplantée par la technostructure qui est amenée à remplir les fonctions autrefois dévolues à l'entrepreneur. En confrontant le point de vue de Galbraith avec les théories de l'entrepreneur et les théories managériales de l'entreprise, nous mettons en lumière l'originalité et la spécificité de l'analyse de Galbraith qui, en retenant une conception « gestionnaire » de l'entrepreneur, propose une théorie de la grande entreprise qui « dérive » de sa théorie de l'entrepreneur.

B25|The Role of Agents’ Propensity toward Conformity and Independence in the Process of Institutional Change|This paper analyses institutional change and Veblen’s work (1907, 1914, 1919) under the perspective of cognitive economics. Particularly it focuses on two interesting issues of Veblen’s theory of economic change: 1. in Veblen’s view habits are both mental habits and behavioral habits and they play a twofold role in economic change because they are particularly relevant both as elements of propensity, and as forces resisting to change. 2 Veblen gives an exhaustive definition of instincts and habits but he does not completely explain the cognitive processes that bring changes and evolution in social habits. He develops an economic theory at the base of which there is an evolutionary view of reality and a deep awareness of the role of the human mind within the decision-making processes of choice. This paper is aimed at analyzing both issues using the interpretive tools offered by psychology and discussing the role of agents psychological propensity toward conformity and independence in explaining institutional change. The central idea is that if we better encompass the theory of conformity and independence developed in psychology (starting from Asch, 1952) in the analysis of economic institutions, we can better explain institutional change. Conformity is the effect of the pressure of social group on agents’ behavior. That concept contributes to explain resistance to change. On the other hand, psychology shows that agents are also subject to mechanisms of independence. These are key elements in explaining behavioral change. The analysis of Veblen’s instinct-habit concept under conformity-independence perspective shows interesting connections between Veblen and Hayek’s ideas of economic change. Hayek’s concept of evolution based on psychological and neurobiological aspect, in fact, is a contribution of great significance both in explaining the dual role of habits in institutional change and in understanding individual mechanisms that bring changes in social habits.

B25|The unresolved problem of gratuitous credit in Austrian banking theory|Abstract Ludwig von Mises called gratuitous credit, the ability banks have to create new credit, the chief problem in a theory of banking. This paper traces how Mises and succeeding generations of Austrian-school economists have grappled with this problem, but have failed to find resolution. The result is that Austrian economists disagree on a variety of issues in banking and business cycle theory, such as whether there is an endogenous business cycle under free banking, or cycles only occur under central banking. Before a resolution can be attempted, current thinking must be clarified. This paper divides Austrian economists into five schools of thought. It points to a possible resolution in the economic development writings of Joseph Schumpeter.
B25|Private Equity Fund Structures in Czech Republic within the Framework of the New Institutional Economics|Research background: Institutional aspects of a well-functioning private equity and venture capital market are emphasized in the recent academic literature. In particular, a favourable tax and legal environment is essential, since formal institutions enable the industry to attract a larger volume of investors and thus to contribute more efficiently to the growth of GDP. In the Czech Republic, however, legal barriers represent an essential obstacle affecting a rather poor scope of resources available to domestic private equity and venture capital funds. Purpose of the article: This paper examines the current tax and legal environment for private equity and venture capital investments in the Czech/ Republic. Proposals for prospective improvements of legal and tax framework are made in the empirical part of the study. Methodology/methods: As the phenomenon under study is complex and explanatory in nature, qualitative data with content analysis proved to be the best way how to assess institutional framework for PE/VC in the Czech Republic. Data collection methods cover a comparative analysis of scientific literature documents and reports, as well as primary data from interviews with experts in the industry. The results of both secondary and primary data analysis were categorized and core lacks in the institutional framework were identified and discussed. Finally, proposals for prospective improvements of the institutional framework are made. Findings & Value added: The conducted analysis implies that the issue of the legal and organisational structure suitable for PE/VC funds may be deemed resolved in the Czech Republic. A Czech equivalent to a Limited Partnership (SICAR), i.e. a limited partnership with investment certificates, has already with provided with sufficient support in the legislation in terms of the legal form. The legal form is a necessary, yet not sufficient condition. A tax handicap was identified implying that it is necessary to amend the tax law so that the legal regulation extends the tax exemption. Another amendment to the applicable legislation should then be directed towards eliminating or mitigating the barriers imposed on pension funds when investing in PE/VC funds.

B25|The rise and fall of the subsistence fund as a resource constraint in Austrian business cycle theory|Abstract The “subsistence fund” was once an integral part of Austrian business cycle theory to indicate the resource constraint on the ability to complete investments. Early agrarian and industrial economies were constrained by resource availability in a manner consistent with that alluded to by the subsistence fund. This link became more tenuous as the growth of the financial economy in the twentieth century removed the apparent importance of pre-saved goods to complete investments. At this point the subsistence fund came to be used only as a metaphor and was jettisoned from Austrian business cycle theory. The present paper points to the merits of the subsistence fund in explaining the turning point of the business cycle as compared to alternative explanations. It also works out the deficiencies in historical expositions of the Austrian theory based on the subsistence fund, and traces the evolution of the resource constraint at the core of Austrian economists´ treatment of the business cycle.
B25|Структурные Или Институциональные Сдвиги? Попытка Измерения На Примере Банковского Сектора<BR>[Structural change, institutional change and their measurement: The case of banking]|The paper attempts measuring institutional change, taking the case of the Russian banking industry in 1991-2016. I put forward a set of metrics featuring the actors and the relevance of banking for the economy. At the first stage, the communist-era credit system falls apart, and so do coordination mechanisms between monetary and real sectors of the economy. After the 1998 crisis, evolution goes in the direction of greater government involvement in banks and centralized allocation of financial resources. Structural change has not yet led to a fully different modus operandi of the banking industry. The contribution of this paper is that it tackles the interplay between structural and institutional change in a particular economic sector.
B25|The Recurrence of Long Cycles: Theories, Stylized Facts and Figures|Basic innovations and their diffusion, the expansion or contraction of the level of economic activity and the volume of international trade, rising sovereign debts and their defaults, conflicts and the outbreak of wars, are some of the major phenomena appearing during the downswing or upswing phases of long cycles. In this article, we examine the extent to which these phenomena constitute stylized facts of the different phases of long cycles which recur quite regularly in the turbulent economic history of capitalism. The main argument of this paper is that the evolution of long cycles is a result of the long-run movement of profitability. During the downswing of a long cycle, falling profitability induces innovation investment and the associated with it 'creative destruction' of the capital stock that eventually set the stage for the upswing phase of a new long cycle.

B25|Bringing Institutions into Economics when Teaching Economics as a Minor Subject|Developments in economic policy since the 1980s have shown a general trend towards a single type of institutional arrangement, following short-term, immediately applicable efficiency criteria. This was supported through the teaching by putting particular weight on the corresponding analytical instruments. The thesis presented here observes a systematic bias in this. It does so by evaluating institutional trends in the various sectors of the economy, and by discussing institutional arrangements of selected areas in detail. Furthermore, it reviews contributions by representatives of New Institutional Economics for a more comprehensive approach. Based on this, institutions themselves are conceptualised as public or club goods. As such they are applied to the policy areas selected. It can thereby be shown that microeconomic theory can find an appropriate place in this extended economic approach, along with concepts like common-pool resource management. In conclusion, this thesis proposes giving considerably more space to institutions in economics curricula, to their evolution and implications for economic outcomes. Particularly for economics as a minor subject, more emphasis should be placed on institutional arrangements.
B25|Heterogeneity of habits as a foundation for Schumpeterian economic policy|Abstract In this paper, we highlight the heterogeneity of agents in Schumpeter’s theory. Because of its centrality in Schumpeter’s theory, we argue that agent heterogeneity should also be a key element for economic policy informed by Schumpeter’s theory. Schumpeter considered agents’ habits as a particularly important source of heterogeneity. We show how Schumpeter’s notion of habits is closely related to modern work on habits, and draw on recent research to elaborate theory that can provide the foundation for Schumpeterian economic policy. We argue that heterogeneity of habits can be a crucial building block and foundation of Schumpeterian economic policy: it offers a target for policy interventions that is different from incentives or information. This target is potentially as powerful as incentives or information, which only influence intentions rather than influencing behavior directly.
B25|Alternative User Costs, Productivity and Inequality in US Business Sectors|Using the new Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts as well as other BEA data, we construct productivity accounts for two key sectors of the US economy: the Corporate Nonfinancial Sector (Sector 1) and the Noncorporate Nonfinancial Sector (Sector 2). Calculating user costs of capital based on, alternatively, ex post and predicted asset price inflation rates, we provide alternative estimates for capital services and Total Factor Productivity growth for the two sectors. Rates of return on assets employed are also reported for both sectors. In addition, we compare rates of return on assets employed and TFP growth rates when the land and inventory components are withdrawn from the asset base. Finally, implications for labour and capital shares from using alternative income concepts are explored.
B25|The Origins of Private Property|This paper focuses on the legitimacy of private property and analyses the process of first appropriation. In particular, we examine and comment the different views on the origin of private property rights that have emerged through the history of economic and legal thinking, from Democritus to de Jasay. These views have been grouped in two broad categories: consequentialism and fundamental principles. Although consequentialism is now dominant among economists and inchoate in the legal profession, we observe that it is in fact an alibi for discretionary policymaking by the authority. By definition, fundamentalist approaches generate rules that limit discretion. However, we show that some fundamental views rest on questionable a-priori statements. De Jasay’s argument based on the presumption of liberty is perhaps the only perspective that escapes this criticism.
B25|Fission, forking and fine tuning|Perhaps because we live in the age of the Internet and social networks, everyone seems agreed that innovation is all about recombination. Although not fully dissenting from this consensus, and perhaps in the end affirming it in an important way, I want to draw attention to some apparently different mechanisms of innovation, both suggested by Adam Smith: subdivision (or differentiation) and fine-tuning. On the surface at least, these – especially the second – do not appear to be processes of recombination. I will attempt to elucidate what I mean by these concepts and try to think about how they fit together with recombination in a full Smithian account of innovation. Whether innovation proceeds from the top down or the bottom up depends crucially on the structure of complementary stages in the process of production. Especially if it takes place in a non-modular way, recombination may require unified decision rights, implying the vertical integration of complementary stages of production, in order to overcome the dynamic transaction costs of change. But the processes of subdivision and differentiation may also require changes in decision rights in order to overcome dynamic transaction costs. I illustrate these points with a case study of three generations of an American family of inventor-entrepreneurs in electricity and electronics.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B25|Who is John Galt? Un análisis de la crisis financiera de 2008 desde la óptica de la Escuela Austríaca|The 2008 financial crisis, is perhaps the most significative event in the world’s economy during the XXI century. The present paper tries to explain this phenomena in light of the Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT) developed by the Austrian School of Economics. With that in mind, this paper study the relation between the historical facts that happened during the previous years in the American economy and the stylized facts presented by the theory. In concrete we can observe an expansive monetary police held by the Federal Reserve during the previous years led the Federal Funds Rate below the individual’s intertemporal preference rate, i.e. original interest rate. As consequence of this, we can observe a misallocation of original factors in new ventures that led into a new more roundabout structure of production. Specifically, a conjunction of low interest rates in mortgages contracts and institutional factors led to the formation of a bubble in the real state sector. The growth in subprime lends and new ways to expand the credit via securities led into a financial mess that explodes once the Federal Reserve rises the FFR. As the FFR raised, the credit emitted by banks started to be tightened with less refinancing of default credits, specially affecting the subprime borrowers. As subprime borrowers default their mortgages, the different securities that were backed in them, start to have problems in payments. This affect not only individuals, but also banks, which have strong losses that in some cases led some financial organizations to the bankruptcy. As the securities were bought by agents of foreign economies the crisis spill over the world. As the ABCT predict, in this context the production structure in the expansive phase evolved in a more roundabout structure but as soon as the credit was retracted the structure became less roundabout. From the point of view of the stock market and the original factor’s prices, the behavior of this variables are in concordance with what the theory predict. Giving this, the stylized facts presented by the ABCT seem to be a good theoretical framework to explain this crisis.

B25|Zur Zukunft der Europäischen Union aus ordnungspolitischer Perspektive|Der Artikel untersucht die Auswirkungen der sehr lockeren Geldpolitik der Europäischen Zentralbank auf die Wirtschaftsordnung und den europäischen Integrationsprozess aus ordnungspolitischer Perspektive. Es wird argumentiert, dass lange Zeit die von Deutschland geprägte Wirtschaftsordnung nach Eucken (1952) ein Grundpfeiler für Wachstum, Wohlstand und sozialen Zusammenhalt in Europa war. Es wird gezeigt, dass die Geldpolitik der Europäischen Zentralbank mit Euckens (1952) konstituierenden Prinzipien den wirtschaftlichen Grundpfeiler des europäischen Integrationsprozesses untergraben hat. Da die geldpolitischen Rettungsaktionen negative Verteilungseffekte haben und das Wachstum bremsen, wird mit einer daraus resultierenden wachsenden politischen Polarisierung die Akzeptanz des europäischen Integrationsprozesses geschwächt. Es wird ein zeitnaher Ausstieg aus der sehr lockeren Geldpolitik empfohlen, um die Zukunft der Europäischen Union zu sichern.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B25|Competition or conflict? Beyond traditional ordo-liberalism|"According to the traditional ordo-liberal view of the Freiburg School, the central role of the state in economic affairs is to set up rules that create a competitive order within which private actors have sufficient incentives to coordinate their economic affairs efficiently. Underlying this view is the implicit assumption that, given the right institutional framework, competition within markets is mainly characterized by peaceful and conflict-free rivalry between actors that leads to an optimal allocation of resources. In such a setting, competition may be described as a ""record-type"" game. This view, however, ignores the possibility that competition itself may very well trigger conflict rather than having an appeasing effect. In this case, competition appears to be a ""struggle-type"" game in which competitors invest in conflict activities that are not efficiency enhancing but rather resource wasting. Against this background, ordo-liberalism has yet to provide a clear-cut distinction between competition and conflict. In addition, it fails to identify - in a normative way - which institutional and regulatory framework could hamper conflict sensitivity of economic competition, given the harmful effect of conflict on the security of property rights. Our contribution investigates how the ordo-liberal research program needs to be extended when introducing conflict."
B25|Behavior and cognition of economic actors in evolutionary economics|Abstract An evolutionary perspective on the nature of economic activity requires a theory of human behavior and cognition that highlights human creativity and innovativeness, while at the same time recognizing that in many arenas of economic life change is slow and more routine aspects of behavior obtain. It is proposed that Herbert Simon’s conception of human behavior as largely “bounded rational” is capable of suiting both aspects. However, to be able to encompass the enormous advances humans have achieved over the years in their ability to meet a variety of wants, a theory of behavior and cognition suitable for evolutionary economics needs to recognize the evolving cultural context of economic behavior and cognition.

B25|Looking at Piketty from the Periphery|This working paper discusses Piketty´s already famous book. It remarks some of the strong sides of the book, before critically discussing some aspects. It is argued that Piketty could have benefitted by using other theories of capital, different than the neoclassical one adopted. The note also places Piketty´s limited contribution, as seen in a more comprehensive context, in which international relations and reversal causality between growth and distribution are considered. The notes ends by pointing to the fact that Piketty presents modern development´s main stylized fact in a wrong way, because he is too narrowly focused on the developed regions
B25|Economic Growth of a Rapidly Developing Economy: Theoretical Formulation|The subject matter of the article is the description of economic growth. Modern economy is characterized by a high rate of changes. These changes are the limiting parameters of modern development, which requires a modification of the basic models of growth, the substantiation of the expediency and necessity of a rapid development strategy. In a simple mathematical form, the statement of the problem of economic growth in the â€œgreen economyâ€ is examined, in which the costs of environmental measures are not considered a priori as hampering economic development (as it is common for a number of modern neoclassical and neo-Keynesian growth models). The methodological basis of the article are the econometric approach and modelling method. The article has a theoretical character. The main hypothesis supposes that the rapid development strategy cannot make an adequate development strategy under certain conditions, but may be acceptable in other its specific conditions. In this sense, the important growth conditions are the availability of resources, the effectiveness of institutions and the current economic structure, the technological effectiveness of economy, as well as the conditions of technological development (â€œgreen economyâ€ ) and the path of such development. In the article, on the theoretical level of analysis, the substantiation of the adequacy of the rapid development strategy for an economic system is given, whose goal is to achieve the standard of living of the countryleader. Based on the assumptions introduced, the period for which the rapid development strategy might be implemented and the economic lag of the country might be reduced from the country-leader is determined. The conditions that ensure the impact of innovations on the rate of economic development are summarized. The introduced range of dependencies and relations can be useful for the elaboration of the theory of innovation development and for the formation of a new conceptual framework of the model of economic growth of a rapidly changing economic system (competing at high speeds). Based on the analysis of proposed theoretical models for Russia, the following conclusion is made: the rapid development strategy may be effective only if it combines the stimulation and innovations as well as the classic productions, therefore, recreating the earlier lost sectors of economics. This will help to overcome the technological gap.
B25|Chicago Economics in the Making, 1926-1940. A Further Look at US Interwar Pluralism|The aim of this paper is to unfold a rich body of archival material that can shed new light on the nature and evolution of interwar Chicago economics. Specifically, this paper is based on a scrutiny of the PhD qualifying exams on Economic Theory at Chicago from 1926 to 1940. The qualifying tests (supplemented by the courses’ programs) show the existence of two important turning points in the shaping of Chicago economic training. The first one is in 1927, when John M. Clark, the undisputed leader of the Chicago Department of Economics during the heyday of institutionalism, moved to Columbia, leaving open ground to the restructuring of the courses according to a different and more analytical approach already represented in the Department by Viner and, in a narrower field, by Paul Douglas. The arrival at Chicago of figures such as Knight, Schultz and Simons definitely shifted the balance toward neoclassical theory. A second turning point occurred in 1933 when the qualifying test in Economic Theory was divided into two major fields: price and distribution theory on the one side; money and business cycle on the other. This innovation reveals the importance acquired by monetary theory in economic training at a time that is commonly associated with the nurturing of what was later named as the “Chicago monetary tradition.”

Denn hier wird ""dem Markt"" bzw. ""der erweiterten Ordnung"" eine Übervernunft zugeschrieben, die von keinem menschlichen Wesen kognitiv zu bewältigen ist. Hayek landet folgerichtig bei dem Bild, ""den Markt"" wie einen Gott anzusehen und ihm gottgleiche Attribute zu verleihen."
B25|Still the queen of the social sciences? (Post-)Crisis power balances of 'public economists' in Germany|As an immediate reaction to the recent financial crisis, it has been criticized that many economists are still acting as economic advisers for Ministries or the bureaucracy, although they have not been able to foresee the crisis . Academic economists still hold central positions in policy making; they influence decisions in economic expert panels or research departments in national and supranational organizations. Beside their role as policy advisors, economists also engage in public debates in a more narrow sense as technical economic experts as well as in a broader sense as 'public intellectuals' in the process of the transmission of economic knowledge in public (economic) policy discourses. In spite of the manifold critique about the state of economics in the aftermath of the crisis, an even increasing presence of economists and economic experts can be observed in the pu blic sphere during the last years . On the one hand this reflects the still dominant position of economics in the social sciences as well as the sometimes ignorant attitude of economists towards findings of other social sciences. On the other hand this pape r shows that the public debate on politico - economic issues among economists is dominated by a specific sub group of economists, tightly connected to an institutional network of 'German neoliberalism'. This group of 'public economists' (i) is dominant in pub lic debates even after the financial crisis, (ii) reproduces the formative German economic imaginary of the Social Market Economy in a German neoliberal interpretation and (iii) has a good access to German economic policymaking, rooted in a long history of economic policy advice.
B25|[Ensayo] Liberalismo e instituciones: Douglass North y la economía neoclásica|Este ensayo es un intento de comprender los aportes y debilidades de la economía institucional de Douglass North y la forma como esta se relaciona con los postulados básicos del liberalismo y la economía neoclásica. Se examina la teoría de la sociedad propuesta por el liberalismo y, de una parte, la forma como resuelve los problemas de coordinación y cohesión social en una economía de mercado donde se preservan las libertades individuales y, de otra, su relación con los postulados del paradigma neoclásico. Se concluye que, en la teoría de North, se encuentran los elementos para construir una teoría general de las instituciones pero que su análisis se encuentra limitado porque lo incorpora a un marco neoclásico. La razón es que North no desarrolla una teoría del valor alterna. No obstante, su propuesta teórica lleva a reconsiderar los postulados liberales, al tiempo que enriquece el debate económico pues permite tener una visión más amplia de los fenómenos sociales, políticos y económicos.
B25|Survival Value And A Robust, Practical, Joyless Individualism: Thomas Nixon Carver, Social Justice, And Eugenics|The aim of this paper is to provide a compressive assessment of Thomas Nixon Carver’s thought - from his early formative years in the 1880s to his post WWII career as a journalist and pamphleteer. The main (albeit not exclusive) focus of this paper will be on the theoretical and philosophical coordinates of Carver’s “new liberalism” - his own definition - and how this broad vision was intrinsically connected with an explicit hierarchical and eugenic approach to human nature. Just as important, what follows is also an attempt to increase our general understanding of the extent in which eugenic considerations permeated the realm of political economy during the first decades of the last century and how, in some specific cases as that of Carver, this influence persisted after the end of the Progressive Era.
B25|Formal definitions of information and knowledge and their role in growth through structural change|The article provides a way to quantify the role of information and knowledge in growth through structural adjustments. The more is known about environmental patterns, the more growth can be obtained by redistributing resources accordingly among the evolving sectors (e.g. bet-hedging). Formal equations show that the amount of information about the environmental pattern is directly linked to the growth potential. This can be quantified by treating both information and knowledge formally through metrics like Shannon's mutual information and algorithmic Kolmogorov complexity from information theory and computer science. These mathematical metrics emerge naturally from our evolutionary equations. As such, information becomes a quantifiable ingredient of growth. The policy mechanism to convert information and knowledge into growth is structural adjustment. The presented approach is applied to the empirical case of U.S. export to showcase how information converts into growth potential.

It offers a new reading of his 1937 paper, ""Economics and Knowledge,"" that draws on unpublished lecture notes in which he articulated more fully the distinctions he made in the paper between a ""pure logic of choice,"" or the economic calculus, and an ""empirical element,"" which he would later call the competitive market order. Next, the paper shows that Hayek continued to try to develop his ideas about the role of the economic calculus through the 1950s and early 1960s, an effort that has been missed because it never led to any published work. Finally, the paper examines Hayek's attempt to articulate a theory of the market process, one that would be at the same level of generality as the economic calculus, in lectures he gave at the University of Virginia. He never developed a full-fledged formal theory, but his failed efforts still bore fruit in leading him to his contributions on spontaneous orders and the (verbal) theory of complex phenomena. This work anticipated contributions by others who were more technically trained."
B25|Two minds that never met: Frank H. Knight on John M. Keynes once again â€“ a documentary note. Perham C. Nahl's notes from Frank H. Knight's course on Business Cycles, University of California, 1936|This note presents new archival evidence about Frank H. Knight's views on John M. Keynes. The relevant material is composed of a series of lecture notes taken by Perham C. Nahl in Frank H. Knight's course on Business Cycles at the University of California at Berkeley in the fall of 1936. It emerges from the notes that the methodological gap between Keynes and Knight was irreducible, which explains the harsh tone of Knight's published review of The General Theory. Connected to this is Knight's strenuous defense of the â€˜postulates of classical political economyâ€™ as criticized by Keynes in chapter 2 of his book, an argument that was better expounded in the classroom than in the review. However, besides strong criticisms, a few constructive remarks can also be found in the notes. In criticizing Keynes, Knight proposed an interesting analysis of the business cycle that he did not develop in the published review of The General Theory, and there is even some evidence that Knight was attracted to Keynes's discussion of â€˜liquidity preference.â€™
B25|"Still the queens of social sciences? (Post-)Crisis power balances of ""public economists"" in Germany"|"In spite of the manifold critique about the state of economics in the aftermath of the financial crisis, an even increasing presence of economists and economic experts can be observed in the public sphere during the last years. On the one hand this reflects the still dominant position of economics in the social sciences as well as the sometimes ignorant attitude of economists towards findings of other social sciences. On the other hand this paper shows that the public debate on politicoeconomic issues among economists is dominated by a specific subgroup of economists, tightly connected to an institutional network of ""German neoliberalism"". This group of ""public economists"" (i) is dominant in public debates even after the financial crisis, (ii) reproduces the formative German economic imaginary of the Social Market Economy in a German neoliberal interpretation and (iii) has a good access to German economic policymaking, rooted in a long history of economic policy advice."
B25|Hayek’s monetary theory and policy: A note on alleged inconsistency|Challenging the dominant view, we claim that Hayek’s monetary views did not significantly change over his lifetime. The prevalent perception of early Hayek as a money stream stabilizer and late Hayek as a price level stabilizer is attributable to an unjustified normative interpretation of Hayek’s positive analysis. We argue that in his contributions to monetary theory, Hayek took the goals of monetary policy as exogenously given and analysed the efficiency of different means of achieving them. Hayek’s allegedly inconsistent transformation from a critic to an advocate of price level stabilization is explained by a change of issues under his focus, rather than by a change in his positive views. We also claim that Hayek was always aware that every practical monetary policy involves difficult trade-offs and that he was therefore reluctant to impose his own value judgments on what people should strive for.

B25|Truth or precision? Some reflections on the economists’ failure to predict the financial crisis|Abstract The failure of professional economic forecasters to predict the financial crises has led many to question the credibility of modern economics as a reliable foundation for economic policy. If economists were unable to foresee so big a crisis, how can they be trusted to cure or prevent it? Several accounts of this failure exist. The paper offers a tentative answer based on the lessons that may be drawn from the wisdom of a short list of past and present economists: Hayek, Neville Keynes, Mankiw, Tinbergen, Maynard Keynes and Lucas. The glue to keep such an odd bunch together is the distinction between truth and precision provided by science historian Ted Porter.
B25|Adómorál, bizalom és kényszerek - adózási motivációk Magyarországon korrupciós botrányok idején<BR>[Tax morale, trust and constraints: Tax-compliance motivations in Hungary during corruption scandals]|A viselkedési közgazdaságtani és a gazdaságpszichológiai kutatások szerint az adózási magatartást részben kényszerű, részben önkéntes motivációk, az adómorál alakítják. Tanulmányunk ezekre a megközelítésekre összpontosít, tudomásunk szerint ez az első hazai kutatás, amely az intézményi bizalomnak és az eljárási méltányosságnak az adófizetési attitűdökkel kapcsolatos összefüggéseit elemzi. Két - 2013-ban, illetve 2015-ben készült - reprezentatív felmérés alapján vizsgáljuk a magyar állampolgárok adózási motivációit. Az adatfelvételek időpontjának sajátossága, hogy a köztes időszakban az adóhatóság (NAV) működését korrupciós botrányok árnyékolták be. Várakozásunknak megfelelően az intézményi bizalom gyengesége és az észlelt korrupció jelentősen rombolják az adómorált, miközben a kényszerű adófizetést nem befolyásolják érdemben. Vizsgálatunk hipotézisünket cáfoló eredménye, hogy az önkéntes adófizetési hajlandóság Magyarországon is erősebb a kényszerűnél. Végül hipotézisünkkel összhangban szignifikáns és az egyéb tényezőktől függetlenül is kimutatható a NAV-botrányok negatív hatása az adóhatóság iránti bizalomra.

B25|The Institutional Fundamentals of Turkey's Economic Performance: A New Institutional Perspective|In this thesis, the effect of Turkey's institutional structure on economic performance is analyzed by using transaction cost and credible commitment which are contributed by New Institutional Economics. According to this school, neoclassical economics ignores transaction cost, bounded rationality, incomplete contracts and property rights. So these models will not represent the real world. But it's known that the transaction cost is always positive in the real world. According to this reality, to begin with the institutions containing the New Institutional Economics are investigated and the relationship between institutions and economic performance is explained. Afterwards defining, measuring and effects of transaction cost topics are mentioned. Soon after we handled the political transaction cost. In the next chapter, the policymaking process and credible commitment are explained. The role of institutions on formation of institutional policies and the 3 determiner legislative-executive-judiciary and the seperation of powers are discussed and credible commitment is clarified in this context. By giving the theoretical framework of this issues, Turkey's progress is reviewed. The important contribution of this thesis is by following New Institutional Economics perspective, first defining the political transaction cost and credible commitment and after showing the effects Turkey's institutional structure to economic performance by using time series analysis with structral breaks. Findings indicate that the transaction cost and credible commitment determined by institutional structure are highly important on investment decisions and national income.

B25|Growth of the World Population in the Past 12,000 Years and Its Link to the Economic Growth|Data describing the growth of the world population in the past 12,000 yearsare analysed. It is shown that,if unchecked, population does not increase exponentially but hyperbolically. This analysis reveals three approximately-determined episodes of hyperbolic growth: 10,000-500 BC, AD 500-1200 and AD 1400-1950, representing a total of about 89% of the past 12,000 years. It also reveals three demographic transitions: 500 BC-AD 500, AD 1200-1400 and AD 1950-present, representing the remaining 11% of the past 12,000 years. The first two transitions were between sustained hyperbolic trajectories. The current transition is to an unknown trajectory. There was never any form of dramatic transition from stagnation to growth, described often as a takeoff, because there was no stagnation in the growth of the world population. Correct understanding of the historical growth of human population is essential in the correct interpretation of the historical growth of income per capita.
B25|Economic theory in IMEMO|(The Soviet period) The article deals with the history of economic research at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO) of the Russian Academy of Sciences. This history is analyzed in the context of the Soviet and world economic science. The specific nature of Soviet economic theory is characterized as well as a special position of IMEMO, in its function of the leading think-tank in the field of world economy and international relations. Two main directions of theoretical work of IMEMO economists are identified: transition from the facts and statistical data towards a revision of dogmatic Marxism, and from Western theories to original ideas and practical recommendations. The connection of the theory and applied expertise is given a special attention.
B25|The Economic Problem of a Community: ontological reflections inspired by the Socialist Calculation Debate|Implicitly, the Socialist Calculation Debate is about the connection between neoclassical theory and reality. It involves several ontological presuppositions, with wide-ranging implications. Our purpose is to discuss one of these presuppositions. We want to scrutinise the view, implicit in the ‘market socialist’ arguments, that things have economic roles or functions independently of the social environment in which they exist. ‘Primary factors’ and techniques of production are taken to exist independently of social arrangements; jointly with consumer preferences, they are supposed to define the economic problem of a community. In analysing this view, we borrow from F. A. Hayek, complementing his reflections with those of Donald Davidson, Willard Quine, and Tony Lawson. We also discuss a second problem, which follows from the first: if, in contrast with market socialists’ view, the economic roles of things depend holistically on complex social processes, how can we compare alternative forms of economic organisation?
B25|The Impossibility of Democratic Socialism: Two Conceptions of Democracy|Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny (1994) have used Public Choice analysis to criticize market socialism. Peter J. Boettke (1995) and Peter T. Leeson and Boettke (2002) have argued that F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom (2007 [1944]) constituted a form of Public Choice analysis as well, in particular presaging an application of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem to democratic socialism. This essay demonstrates that additionally, Hayek's book adumbrated the distinction between liberal or limited democracy and illiberal or totalitarian democracy. This distinction between two conceptions of democracy provides another means of criticizing democratic socialism. The democratic political system and socialist economic system are fundamentally incompatible, making democratic socialism impossible, in the sense that democracy cannot fulfill for socialism what democratic socialists expect from it. Democratic socialism will fail, not because those in power will betray their trust or abuse their power, but because the fundamental institutional constraints of democracy are incompatible with socialist economics.
B25|Interest Groups and the Impossibility of Democratic Socialism: Hayek, Jewkes, and the Arrow Theorem|Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny (1994) have used Public Choice analysis to criticize market socialism. Peter J. Boettke (1995) and Peter T. Leeson and Boettke (2002) have argued that F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom (2007 [1944]) constituted a form of Public Choice analysis as well. Boettke and Leeson say that Hayek adumbrated a form of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. This essay shows that Hayek was joined by John Jewkes in presaging a form of the Arrow theorem. In addition, this essay expands on the analysis by Boettke and Leeson, elucidating the broader implications which the Arrow theorem has for democratic socialism in particular. Democratic socialism is demonstrated to be impossible, in the sense that it cannot successfully accomplish the goals of its advocates. This is because the Arrow theorem implies that democratic political institutions are fundamentally incompatible with socialist economics.
B25|Labor Economics in a Planned Economy: F. A. Hayek and John Jewkes on the Impossibility of Democratic Socialism|Milton Friedman (1962) is associated with the claim that political and economic freedom cannot be distinguished (cf. Lawson and Clark 2010), using the famous example that there can be no freedom of speech where the government owns the printing presses. Less well-known is F. A. Hayek's example, drawn from labor economics, used to illustrate the same principle. Hayek was joined in this by his less well-known colleague, John Jewkes. Hayek and Jewkes argued that without a freely operating price system, central economic planning cannot function without compulsory regimentation of labor. Similarly, no state may simultaneously fix “fair” wages and demand a given pattern of productive output and employment. It is impossible to both achieve income equality and accomplish an economic plan. Hayek's and Jewkes's examples help explain why democratic socialism is impossible, in the sense that it cannot accomplish what its advocates desire.
B25|The Foreign Policy of a Democratic Socialist Regime: From Intervention to Protection to Warfare|Discussions of democratic socialism have focused on whether that system is compatible with domestic civil liberties. Less attention has been paid to its foreign policy implications. Despite the widespread acceptance of the democratic peace hypothesis, democratic socialism would be incompatible with peaceful foreign relations. Economic intervention and economic planning – even democratic – cannot be successful without insulating the domestic economy from foreign competition. This implies economic nationalism and autarky. Moreover, democratic socialism is often justified by the notion that the democratic will of the people should be absolutely sovereign. Such a conception of democracy has no place for constitutional limits on power. Such an unlimited democracy would soon prove illiberal and liable to be captured by a demagogic authoritarian dictator, and this would only exacerbate the deleterious foreign policy consequences of economic nationalism. Democratic socialism is therefore incompatible with the cosmopolitan and humanitarian values of democratic socialists.
B25|Qwerty, Йцукен И Српска Ћирилица: Треба Ли Нам Нови Стандард?<BR>[QWERTY, ЙЦУКЕН and Serbian keyboard: do we need new standard?]|The article considers the compatibility of the Serbian cyrilic with the script layouts that is on the keyboards of typewriters and computers used. With the short overview on the most popular keyboard layout (so called universal, i.e. QWERTY, that is primarily intended to Anglo-Saxon and German world, and ЙЦУКЕН, intended to the part of the world that use the Cyrillic script), it is pointed that the layout that now as Serbian named is, realy the minor modification of the QWERTY is. In the second part of the article, with the use of Markov chains, on the empirical example of the Migration, one of the most popular novel of the Serbian literature, it was shown the incompatibility of these layouts for the Serbian Cyrillic script, and with this the need for new standard was emphasized. У раду се анализира компатибилност српског ћириличног писма с распоредима слова који се користе на тастатурама писаћих машина, односно компјутера. Уз кратак осврт на најзаступљеније распореде (тзв. универзални, односно QWERTY, намењен превасходно англосаксонском и германском свету, и ЙЦУКЕН, намењен делу света који користи ћирилично писмо), указује се да је распоред који данас важи за „српску тастатуру” заправо мања модификација QWERTY-ја. У другом делу рада, уз коришћење апаратуре Марковљевих ланаца, на емпиријском примеру Сеоба, једног од најпознатијих романа српске књижевности, показана је некомпатибилност ових распореда за српско ћирилично писмо и тиме истакнута потреба тражења новог стандарда.
B25|The Freedom of the Prices: Hayek's Road to Serfdom Reassessed|Recent debate has centered around the contemporary relevance and even the original validity of F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom. Was it directed against command socialism only or against welfare-state interventionism as well? Should the book even be read anymore? This essay takes a step back from the dichotomy between socialism and interventionism and explores two specific ideas of Hayek's which deserve renewed attention: first, his claim that economic liberty is the fundamental liberty and that political liberty is merely secondary in value. Second, Hayek's conception of the rule-of-law, which has implications for contemporary command-and-control regulation. Furthermore, that Hayek's philosophical conception of the rule-of-law in the Road to Serfdom is related to his economic theory of prices in “The Use of Knowledge in Society.” While Hayek's specific target in the Road to Serfdom was command socialism, his book embodied arguments which are more widely applicable and relevant today.
B25|Schumpeter, Veblen and Bourdieu on Institutions and the Formation of Habits|As we know, Joseph Alois Schumpeter is one of the greatest economists of all times, while Thorstein Veblen is an economist and sociologist who made seminal contributions to the social sciences. Pierre Bourdieu, meanwhile, is one of the most famous structural sociologists, who has consistently worked on economic dynamics. These three scholars have laid the foundations of a socioeconomic perspective. However, several important aspects of their works remain less widely discussed, or even inadequately explored in a comparative manner. Of course, investigating the origins of their ideas in evolutionary and institutional economics and re-evaluating comparatively the influences that shaped their works is quite useful for promoting dialogue between Economics and Sociology. Within this framework, this essay focuses on the conceptual relationship between Schumpeter, Veblen and Bourdieu. Evolution and Change shape the economic life in their respective works and, in such a framework a central point of their analyses is the interdependence between the cultural, social and economic spheres. Furthermore, an economic sociology is built around the concept of habit formation. The three great authors’ systemic views focus on the various institutions and other aspects of cultural, social and economic life, where habits are formed and cover diverse fields and notions such as Consumption, Preferences, Art, Knowledge, Banking and even Capitalism. For instance, all three social scientists acknowledged the fact that the internal dynamics of capitalism introduce structural instabilities into the economic system. Also, they recognized that research and knowledge development is a collective social process. However, from a methodological perspective, their main emphasis is on the emerging dynamic evolution of habits, which is perceived as the interruption of already existing social norms and the conflict between routine and change. Several differences between Schumpeter, Veblen and Bourdieu are observed and analysed and ideas for future research are presented.
B25|“Reviewing Path Dependence Theory in Economics: Micro–Foundations of Endogenous Change Processes”|This paper proposes a critical review of some of the main applications of path-dependence in economic theory. In particular, it calls attention on those theories clarifying the micro-foundations of path-dependent processes in economics. In the field of innovation, path-dependence shows the endogenous character of technological change, revealing the complex interplay among firm’s structural specificities, irreversibility, creativity, localized learning, externalities, feedbacks and contingent disturbing factors. In cognitive and institutional economics, the path-dependent character of learning processes, shown by cognitive and neurobiological studies, suggests interesting explanations for economic and institutional inefficiency persistence and, in general, for institutional genesis and evolution processes. Micro-foundations of economic path-dependence offer new opportunities for further extending theoretical and empirical economic research. For instance, they could contribute to extend economic self-organization approach, which has focused on the non-linear character of economic dynamic processes and has described economic systems as dissipative and entropic structures. In this sense, path-dependence represents a fertile tool for further clarifying economic and institutional dynamics and a precious opportunity of interdisciplinary research.
B25|The Complementary Relationship Between Institutional and Complexity Economics: The Example of Deep Mechanismic Explanations| Analyzing economic systems from an evolutionary-institutional or a complexity perspective are two complementary approaches to economic inquiry. I discuss three arguments in favor of this hypothesis: (i) eminent institutional economists have examined the economy as what today could be considered a complex system; (ii) complexity economists lack meta-theoretical foundations which could be provided by institutionalist theory; and (iii) institutional economists could benefit from using methods of complexity economics. In this context, I argue that scholars considering the economy to be complex should seek to explain it by discovering social mechanisms instead of focusing on prediction. In order to distinguish between alternative explanations, scholars should refer to the deepness of an explanation, rather than to Occam’s razor.
B25|The Narrow and the Broad Approach to Evolutionary Modeling in Economics|Some models in evolutionary economics rely on direct analogies to genetic evolution: Assuming a population of firms with routines, technologies and strategies on which forces of diversity generation and selection act. This narrow conception can build upon previous findings from evolutionary biology. Broader concepts of evolution allow either many or just one adaptive entity instead of necessarily requiring a population. Thus, an institution or a society can also be understood as the evolutionary entity. Both the narrow and the broad approach have been extensively used in the literature, albeit in different literature traditions. The paper gives an overview over the conception and the development of both approaches to evolutionary modeling and argues that a generalization is needed to realize the full potential of evolutionary modeling.

Major attempt to overcome them, leads to application of the Transaction cost economics developed by Coase, Williamson, etc. On its own turn, it creates new contradictions, part of which are treated by the present paper from the point of evolutionary political economy.

B25|Fisher and Mises on Zero Interest: A Reconsideration|This article demonstrates that the pure time-preference theory of Ludwig von Mises is inconsistent. A productivity element is studied in the Fisher model, and it is shown that time preference is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the existence of interest. An attempt is also made to reconcile the Austrian theory with the neoclassical theory of interest. It is suggested that the key difference lies in the definition of interest as such, and it is concluded that the Austrian theory is only a special case of a more general neoclassical framework.
B25|Czech Economist Karel Engliš and his Relation to The Austrian School in the First Half of the 20th Century|This article analyses opinions and teleological approach of Czech economist Karel Engliš (1880-1961) and his relation to the Austrian Economics during the first three decades of the 20th century. He grew out from the Austrian subjective psychological school although he later refused its methodological psychological subjectivism and value theory. Engliš formed an original teleological economic school upon Kant´s noetics. This paper describes Engliš´s relation to the Austrian school: the polemic approach of Karel Engliš to Austrian Economics, followed by Engliš´s agreement with certain postulates of the Austrian School. Engliš supported the conclusions of the Austrian School regarding irreplaceability of economic individualism as the basis for a modern economic market system.
B25|A critique of the Richardson equations|We review, and extend, one of the classic dynamic models of conflict in economics by Richardson (1919) and Boulding (1962). Restrictions on parameters are relaxed to account for alliances and for peace-keeping, yielding new dynamic patterns of conflict. In addition, we explore an incrementalist version of the model as well as a stochastic one and show how this affects its theoretical stability properties. Using Monte Carlo techniques as well as time series analyses based on GDELT data (for the Ethiopian-Eritreian war, 1998-2000), we also assess the empirical usefulness of the model. It turns out that the simulations fail to converge in a large number of cases, and that one important prediction of the model is not borne out by the data. We therefore conclude that the Boulding-Richardson equations are of limited use for modelling (de-)escalation in dynamic conflict.

B25|The new institutional economics - main theories|The aim of this arti cle is to show that the New Insti tuti onal Economics is an interdisciplinary stream combining economics, law, organizati on theory, politi cal sciences, sociology, and anthropology. The main theories which are part of the New Insti tuti onal Economics are: Agency Theory, Property Rights Theory and Transaction Costs Theory. The basic assumptions of these theories are mentioned in this paper. This article is an introduction to the New Institutional Economics and its main theories. For this purpose, it presents a brief guide for those who are interested in the New Institutional Economics. Finally, the article is accompanied by a short review of examples of empirical studies connected with these theories.
B25|O poszukiwaniu przyczyn bogactwa i nędzy narodów w teorii Darona Acemoglu i Jamesa A. Robinsona|Celem artykułu jest analiza głównych koncepcji, jakie wysuwano w ciągu dwu stuleci rozwoju nauk ekonomicznych, próbując odpowiedzieć na fundamentalne dla ekonomii pytanie badawcze, a mianowicie: jakie czynniki warunkują rozwój gospodarczy poszczególnych krajów i społeczeństw? Przegląd i uporządkowanie istniejących stanowisk umożliwia uzyskanie niezbędnego punktu odniesienia dla oceny jednej z najnowszych koncepcji autorstwa Darona Acemoglu i Jamesa A. Robinsona spopularyzowanej w bestsellerowej monografii Why Nations Fail? The Origins of Power, Prosperity and Poverty [2012; wyd. polskie 2014]. Metodę badawczą pozwalającą na realizację powyższego celu stanowią pogłębione studia literaturowe. Najistotniejsze wnioski z przeprowadzonej analizy można sprowadzić do stwierdzenia, że: (1) gros autorów wskazuje wiele elementów istotnych dla rozwoju gospodarczego (teorie jednoczynnikowe zdarzają się sporadycznie), (2) ogół istniejących teorii można umieścić w ramach spektrum rozciągającego się od koncepcji, w których nadrzędna rola jest przypisana różnorakim komponentom środowiska naturalnego (co prowadzi do wysuwania różnych odmian hipotezy geograficznej), po wyjaśnienia, w których na pierwszym planie postawione są czynniki zależne od aktywności człowieka (co owocuje wariantami hipotezy instytucjonalnej). Koncepcja Acemoglu i Robinsona plasuje się zdecydowanie bliżej instytucjonalnego krańca wskazanego spektrum, choć wprowadzenie przez tych badaczy trudnego do akceptacji i obrony na gruncie ich własnych rozważań rozgraniczenia pomiędzy hipotezami: instytucjonalną i kulturową niesłusznie sugeruje, że instytucje można rozpatrywać niezależnie od ich kontekstu kulturowego oraz prowadzi do osłabienia wymowy ich skądinąd wartościowej teorii.
B25|Modern Makroiktisadi Uzlaşının Kayıp Ekonomi Politiği: Yerleşik Formalist, Yerleşik Kuramsal ve Yerleşik Politik Uzlaşı|For the last three decades, the Mainstream macroeconomics has been witnessing a “theoretical consensus” between the New Classic Economics (NCE) and New Keynesian Economics (NKE). This consensus is a consensus of “New Classical Models” which are based on rational expectations and perfect markets assumptions and “New Keynesian Models” which are based on sticky wage, sticky prices and rational expectations assumptions, it is a “New Neo Classical Synthesis Economics”. In this study, macro consensus discussion that stands out in the mainstream economics literature will be defined as “Mainstream Macro Theoretical Consensus”, “Mainstream Formalist Methodological Consensus” and “Mainstream Macro Politics Consensus” and the performance of consensus economics will be discussed. Then, the dilemmas and weakness of mainstream methodology against crisis will be prioritized.
B25|In the New Institutional Economics Approach R. Coase and Law, D. North and Social Psychology Context: Pluralist Approach Opportunities in Economics|In this study the relation between the OIE and the NIE (New Institutional Economics) approach is analyzed. In this way, the emphasis is on the main contrasting points of both approaches to mainstream economics. The institutions are as stated by both the precursors of the OIE and NIE approaches, Veblen, Commons, Coase and North analyzed as thinking habits, as behavior constraints in the social rules, as the legal context of the liberal theory. OIE and the NIE approaches demonstrate continuity through ontological point of view towards the concept of institution. Despite theoretical and methodological differences between them, due to the continuity relationship, the NIE plays a carrier role in transferring heterodox terms to mainstream economics. The continuity relation provided by institutions strengthens the pluralist methodology in the economy.
B25|Spontaneous order and social norms. Hayek’s theory of socio-cultural evolution|Hayek’s theory of socio-cultural evolution is a generalization of his theory on spontaneous market order. Hayek explains both the emergence of market and social institutions serving as a social basis for that order within the framework of a unified evolutionary logic. This logic interprets the emergence and survival of spontaneous order and group-level rules of conduct as an unintended consequence of human action. In order to explain the emergence of social norms exclusively on the basis of methodological individualism, one would have to give up an exclusively evolutionary explanation of these norms. Since Hayek applies the invisible-hand explanation to the investigation of social norms, he combines the position of methodological individualism with functionalist-evolutionary arguments in his analysis. Hayek’s theory of socio-cultural evolution represents a theory in the framework of which methodological individualism and functionalism do not crowd out but complement each other.
B25|The Changing Face of Economics? Ethical Issues in Contemporary Economic Schools as a Consequence of Changes in the Concept of Human Nature|The last financial crisis combined with some recent social trends (like growing inequality or environmental problems) inspired many contemporary economists to the re-evaluation of actual economic knowledge in the search for solutions to these problems. Modern economic schools (especially heterodox ones) stress the meaning of ethical issues in economics more often. The thesis of the paper is that this revival of the ethical face of present economics depends very strongly on the changing assumptions of human nature within economics and other disciplines which work alongside economics, such as social psychology or business ethics, for instance. In order to prove the thesis, the paper provides an evaluation of current economic schools, especially within the heterodoxy, in search of their ethical aspects, and presents them as a result of the changing assumptions about human beings within those schools. This ethical dimension of human beings manifests itself in different ways, which can be perceived as a result of it being based on different ethical schools and different psychological and philosophical assumptions about human nature. Therefore, the paper also considers the current developments of the view on human beings in contemporary schools of economic ethics.
B25|Economics as a Discipline of Instrumental Reason. Looking at Economics as a Science from the Perspective of the Frankfurt School of Philosophy|The article is built around the analysis of The critique of instrumental reason by Horkheimer, applied to issues connected with the philosophy of economics. Positive economics is under-stood as an example of a discipline where the pragmatic paradigm has been implemented. Therefore, economics functions within the boundaries of what Horkheimer called instrumental rationality. The starting point is the intellectual source shared by economics and the Frankfurt School, namely Kant’s philosophy of rationality. In the first part of the article, three of Kant’s ideas that are fundamental to economics are presented, and then the development of their application in philosophy of science, as seen by Horkheimer in 1947, is laid out. The second part of the article consists of enumerating various distinctive features of economics that set it apart from other social sciences and which constitute factors for which it can be considered a realm of the reign of ‘instrumental rationality’, with all the threats such an approach provokes. The above-mentioned features concentrate on treating humans in economics as a means, not as a goal. This aspect of the philosophy of science of the Frankfurt School (unlike its critique of capitalism as an economic system) has not been widely received.
B25|Economics Of Integration. A Debate Outline|Integration is geographically larger than the EU or European region and did start as one of new specific economic processes of the postwar era. There are at least two types of integration, of which the EU one proves qualitatively distinguished as currently. Such a new movement equally reaches its specific economic thinking which’s development proves as complex as producing increasing dilemmas for management and political decision. The paradox is that one century time ago paces to be taken were better viewed than the immediate future here and now appears to the current generation.
B25|Post-Communist Capitalism: Still Elusive|The failure of communism prompted Central and East European nations to opt for capitalism. Yet the central-planning heritage, especially the traces the latter has left in the people's minds, has rendered capitalism's rules hardly applicable in the newly emerged market economies. The difficulty has been further compounded by the effects of the recent global economic crisis, which has severely dented the trust in capitalism as a whole, especially the liberal American-type, where unrestricted financial markets make the rule.
B25|Du libéralisme historique à la crise sociale du xx e siècle. La lecture de Wilhelm Röpke|The characteristic features of the civilization crisis described by Wilhelm Röpke (1899-1966) could be understood as an attack against collectivism and planning. Massification in all spheres of society reaches an apex in the economic field, mainly through big business’ concentration and the enslavement of workers. Nevertheless, Wilhelm Röpke dismisses both historical liberalism and socialist planning. This article shows that his refusal is grounded in a specific historical interpretation : that of a causal pathway from one (liberalism) to the other (planning), with respect to the intensification of the same harmful trends. Therefore, the social crisis of the twentieth century follows from the inner decline of liberalism. We can understand the contemporary period solely by the analysis of primary causes, which are rooted in the previous century. The study reconstructs this complex discourse by linking Röpke’s cultural, sociological and economical fields of inquiry. Classification JEL : B25, B31
B25|Explicaciones Austriacas y Estructuralistas de la Crisis Financiera Internacional de 2008|El documento compara y sintetiza los enfoques teóricos de la escuela austriaca y estructuralista en torno a la crisis financiera internacional de 2008. Huerta de Soto (2010) será el autor a tener en cuenta como representante de la escuela austriaca, mientras que por parte de la escuela estructuralista se tomarán autores referentes de la Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (CEPAL). Por último se añaden conceptos atribuidos a Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia y Mauro (2010), Misnky (1992) y Calvo, Izquierdo y Talvi (2006) con el ánimo de presentar una alternativa para entender la crisis.
B25|Schumpeterian innovations, financial innovations and instability: An institutional perspective|This paper seeks to assess the nature of financial innovations as regards the economic stability throughout an institutional framework within the Schumpeterian tradition. While in the Schumpeterian evolutionary process entrepreneurial innovations are assumed to lead the entire economy towards economic development, financial innovations do not obviously generate the same positive outcome for economic evolution. To point to the ambiguous nature of financial innovations the paper suggests a monetary interpretation of Schumpeterian capitalist dynamics and sheds light on the role of the institutional environment to ensure viable economic development. It then argues that in highly liberalized environment, unconstrained financial dynamics may lead to system-wide crises and make public regulatory schemes necessary for the sake of systemic stability.
B25|La dinámica del empresario en la sociedad. De la Escuela Austriaca a la economía social de mercado|Una de las grandes aportaciones al pensamiento económico la constituye la aportación centroeuropea, desde la Escuela Austriaca a la Escuela de Freiburgo, sobre cuyas bases se desarrolla el ordenamiento económico de una economía social de mercado. Toda esta línea de conocimiento se caracteriza, en primer lugar, por la integración de la economía en la sociedad. Esto es, se desarrolla la dimensión societaria de la economía orientada a la persona y en base al principio de competencia. Es su gran comprensión de la realidad económica y del papel de la persona a la que caracteriza en búsqueda de libertad y responsabilidad para la «acción» de la persona. Es la gran contribución a un orden de libertad en el que la figura del empresario, de la «empresalidad», es el eje del desarrollo económico, el desarrollo schumpeteriano. A lo que la Escuela de Freiburgo contribuye con el diseño del ordenamiento económico-societario que enmarca en el «sistema de valores» la acción de la persona. Este ordenamiento económico define en base a principios y reglas el desarrollo de la organización económica en la sociedad. Walter Eucken impulsa esta conceptualización del orden económico como la referencia común para la actuación de la persona. El empresario juega un papel decisivo, en su dimensión societaria, para garantizar la dinámica de una economía de mercado que «funcione bien», que haga factible su existencia y garantice la eficiencia económica, por un lado, y el equilibrio social, por el otro. Una economía social de mercado es un «sistema de valores» societarios que integra los «fines» de la economía en la sociedad: el desarrollo integral de la persona mediante el uso eficiente de los recursos escasos. Eficiencia económica y equilibrio social garantizan un orden de libertades en el que puede desarrollarse el empresario si contribuye con su competencia y con el principio de subsidiaridad a su desarrollo.
B25|Spontaneous order and social norms. Hayek’s theory of socio-cultural evolution|Hayek's theory of socio-cultural evolution is a generalization of his theory on spontaneous market order. Hayek explains both the emergence of market and social institutions serving as a social basis for that order within the framework of a unified evolutionary logic. This logic interprets the emergence and survival of spontaneous order and group-level rules of conduct as an unintended consequence of human action. In order to explain the emergence of social norms exclusively on the basis of methodological individualism, one would have to give up an exclusively evolutionary explanation of these norms. Since Hayek applies the invisiblehand explanation to the investigation of social norms, he combines the position of methodological individualism with functionalist-evolutionary arguments in his analysis. Hayek's theory of socio-cultural evolution represents a theory in the framework of which methodological individualism and functionalism do not crowd out but complement each other.
B25|Rethinking of Coase Theorem: Externalities and Uncertainty|A behavior of economic agents in many respects depends on taking into account those conditions that have appeared around them. Traditionally, to such conditions, researchers have referred the uncertainty and factors of the institutional control, often projected on a value of the transaction costs. Studies in stimulants for any form of the agents’ behavior lead us to an analysis of the Coase theorem, which is expected to explain a number of similar regularities. However, ambiguous approaches to the theorem interpretation generate conflicts in a perception and identification of externalities. It is a solution to this challenge, which is a focus of this research. In a critical review of works by Coase and his followers, the theorem statement has been made clearer; we have also put forward a hypothesis on an origin of the externalities and introduced additional criteria to identify them. The paper has given a scientific rationale for an author’s assumption that the utility of impure goods depends on the vector of the externalities, which ultimately determines the stratification in a field of the externalities (positive or negative).
B25|Friedrich Hayek and his visits to Chile|F. A. Hayek took two trips to Chile, the first in 1977, the second in 1981. The visits were controversial. On the first trip he met with General Augusto Pinochet, who had led a coup that overthrew Salvador Allende in 1973. During his 1981 visit, Hayek gave interviews that were published in the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio and in which he discussed authoritarian regimes and the problem of unlimited democracy. After each trip, he complained that the western press had painted an unfair picture of the economic situation under the Pinochet regime. Drawing on archival material, interviews, and past research, we provide a full account of this controversial episode in Hayek’s life.
B25|Theories of finance and financial crisis: Lessons for the Great Recession|This paper presents an overview of different models which explain financial crises, with the aim of understanding economic developments during and possibly after the Great Recession. In the first part approaches based on efficient markets and rational expectations hypotheses are analyzed, which however do not give any explanation for the occurrence of financial crises and thus cannot suggest any remedies for the present situation. A broad range of theoretical approaches analyzing financial crises from a medium term perspective is then discussed. Within this group we focused on the insights of Marx, Schumpeter, Wicksell, Hayek, Fisher, Keynes, Minsky, and Kindleberger. Subsequently the contributions of the Regulation School, the approach of Social Structures of Accumulation and Post-Keynesian approach, which focus on long-term developments and regime shifts in capitalist development, are presented. International approaches to finance and financial crises are integrated into the analyses. We address the issue of relevance of all these theories for the present crisis and draw some policy implications. The paper has the aim to find out to which extent the different approaches are able to explain the Great Recession, what visions they develop about future development of capitalism and to which extent these different approaches can be synthesized.
B25|Michael Polanyi’s economics: A strange rapprochement|In this paper we provide an analysis of Michael Polanyi's contribution to economics. We stress two major influences on Polanyi's economics: first, Hayek's opposition to central planning and his defence of self-organization as a superior mechanism for coordinating individual plans; second, Keynes' macroeconomic disequilibrium approach to the adjustment of savings and investment that called for government intervention. Polanyi blent these two influences and provided an idiosyncratic synthesis, which is an unfortunately neglected contribution in the field of economics. Moreover, we show that this synthesis is consistent with two important features of Polanyi's intellectual background: on the one hand, liberalism, which entailed two overlapping notions of freedom (traditional private freedom together with public liberty); on the other hand, his humanistic end-oriented type of evolutionism tainted with Catholic ideas. The paper highlights that these two features go hand in hand with Polanyi's view of tacit knowledge, which shapes his original and rich reflection about institutions.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

B25|The Road to Servomechanisms: The Influence of Cybernetics on Hayek from The Sensory Order to the Social Order|This paper explores the ways in which c ybernetics influenced the works of F. A. Hayek from the late 1940s onwar d. It shows that the concept of negative feedback, borrowed from cybernetics, was central to Hayek’s attempt of giving an explanation of the principle to the emergence of human purposive behavior. Next, the paper discusses Ha yek’s later uses of cybernetic ideas in his works on the spontaneous formation of social orders. Finally, Hayek’s view on the appropriate scope of the use of cybernetics is considered.
B25|Regional Economic Development, Social Capital and Governance: A Buchanian Approach|The purpose of this paper is to consider some of the challenges lying ahead of policy makers in the context of regional development. Regional economic development encompasses the economics and other resources that a region can mobilize for its own sustainable development and competitiveness. It is only recently that regions have developed tools and means for analysing the performance of their firms and organizations. Public and private governance bodies have recognized that ever-changing economic conditions bring renewed externalities, which are difficult to capture. Gaps in regional performances have been attributed to important, but often intangible factors such as social capital. Regional economics has taken on board those concerns by considering networks, trust and local procedures in their studies. Nevertheless, the issue remains that regional governance seems intractable in market terms alone. In this paper, we tackle the issue of governance in the context of regional development thanks to Buchanan’s approach of choices and costs. To provide such an assessment, we contribute by merging economics and sociology, where we shift the cost focus from the classic economic concern for equilibrium towards a concern for social utility.
B25|Regional Economic Development, Social Capital and Governance: A Comparative Institutional Analysis France - Sweden|The purpose of this paper is to consider how social capital enhance or hamper regional economic development due to governance systems. To answer this question, we take a comparative institutional perspective between France and Sweden based on OECD regional outlook indicators. It comprises 1- a comparison of both countries regional and municipal governances; 2- a definition of social capital as a social utility function of region or localities, i.e. their “social atmosphere”. 3- A comparison of the participation rate in interest groups in both countries indicating a propensity to collaborate with institutions. The result of the paper shows a differential intensity of participation to interest groups between France and Sweden and an effect of local political institutions on countries’ “social atmosphere”. In conclusion, we show differential values between France and Sweden in terms of political ethics supporting the formation of social capital. We suggest policy implication to increase entrepreneurial solution in civil society.
B25|Historical Features of a Weekly Structured Economy : The Case Study of Romania|The course of Western economies modern history (since the sixteenth century) appears to have as 'target' the rationalization of economic decisions, namely the identification of the most effective solutions to minimize transformation costs and, in particular, transaction costs, to maximize earnings. Throughout each historical period there were civilizations considered superior (core economies), as well as forms of organization (cultures) classified as inferior or 'backward' (called periphery). The first ones irradiated to the latter the already implemented and verified modern institutional forms (separation of powers, universal direct and secret suffrage, codifying of national legislation according to the traditional Romano-Germanic laws, etc.). For every area of the globe exposed to modernization pressure, the institutional effectiveness was decided by the higher, lower or almost non-existent compatibility of the previous 'cultural accumulation' with the type of 'culture' inherent in the new institutional structures. During the periods of institutional transfers, the essential cultural features of the countries that have 'imported' institutions modeled in other cultural environments have probably been disregarded. The social, political and economic evolution of Romania during the past five centuries has some peculiarities which consecrate Romania as a weakly structured society during the modern and contemporary periods. The present paper tries to highlight the main features of the Romanian society and economy that reveal the mentalities and explain the behaviors configured and crystallized through the centuries until today.
B25|The concept of Ordnungspolitik through the lens of the theory of limited and open access orders|The paper argues that there are certain parallels between the ideas of ordoliberalism and the framework of limited and open access order (LAO/OAO) as developed by North, Wallis, Webb and Weingast (NWWW): Both approaches focus on the “interdependence of orders”, and both share an emphasis on state capacity in processes of social transition. I also argue that the ideas of the ordoliberals might give impulses for the further development of the LAO/OAO research agenda. Firstly, whereas NWWW mainly deal with the transition process from LAO to OAO, the members of the Freiburg school intensely dealt with the danger that an OAO might revert into an LAO. Accordingly, they spent much effort on developing policy proposals that aimed at preventing such a ‘re-feudalisation’ (Franz Böhm) of society. Secondly, especially when it came to the issue of accomplishing reforms, they also considered the role of informal institutions and beliefs, a topic somewhat neglected in the LAO/OAO-framework in its present form.

B25|Incompatible institutions: socialism versus constitutionalism in India|There has been a decline in rule of law in India, reflected in the frequent amendments to the Indian Constitution. This paper analyzes the historical, ideological, and economic context for constitutional amendments to understand the reason for the deterioration of constitutionalism in India. I argue that the formal institutions of socialist planning were fundamentally incompatible with the constraints imposed by the Indian Constitution. This incompatibility led to frequent amendments to the Constitution, especially in the area of Fundamental Rights. Consequently, pursuit of socialist policies gradually undermined the Constitution. The contradictory mixture of socialism and constitutionalism led to economic and political deprivations that were never intended by the framers. I demonstrate this incompatibility using evidence from five-year-plans and constitutional amendments in India. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
B25|“The other side of the argument”: Isaiah Berlin versus F. A. von Hayek on liberty, public policies, and the market|The present paper is concerned with the nexus between the different dimensions of liberty, public policies, and the market mechanism. We argue that in order to evaluate the performance of the market mechanism in promoting freedom comprehensively, both the opportunity and the process aspect of liberty must be taken into consideration. Depending on where the emphasis is laid, the achievements of the market mechanism and market interventions through government action in promoting liberty appear in a different light. Two authors have developed encompassing concepts of liberty that can be applied for such a purpose: Isaiah Berlin and F. A. von Hayek. We analyse where Berlin and Hayek are in disagreement and discuss how their different views result in directly conflicting policy preferences. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
B25|The evolution of human nature and its implications for politics: a critique|This paper examines the tradition of attempts to support particular political or social views by referring to biological knowledge about human nature. It is argued that such arguments involve two steps, an argument from biological knowledge to general claims about human nature, and a normative argument from such general claims to the desirability of a particular social order. The concept of human nature serves as a bridge concept connecting these argumentative steps. Furthermore it is argued that both argumentative steps face serious problems, as the first argument stands on a weak biological basis and the second argument is unable to arbitrate between competing political or social positions. By examining four examples of arguments that attempt to connect biological knowledge to political/social views (by Peter Kropotkin, Peter Singer, Richard Alexander and Larry Arnhart) it is shown what such arguments can achieve, and what not. It is concluded that the proper role of arguments from biology to society is to serve as compatibility checks on our political, economic, and societal views, but not to provide actual support for some political/social views over competing ones.

B25|Elections vs. political competition: The case of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|In models of political economy, institutionalization of free and open elections is presented as infusing competition into a monopolized regime. Due to elections, representative democracies are thought to reflect the will of the majority as opposed to the will of the elites. I challenge the idea that elections are a necessary condition of a well-functioning democratic system. In the liberal system of nobles’ democracy in the Kingdom in Poland, noble masses were able to shape political outcomes despite the absence of elections. In fact, it was the adoption of free royal elections in 1573 that undermined the democratic regime and contributed to the demise of the country. I argue that nobles’ democracy emerged from competition between the king and the regional rulers for the loyalty of nobles and that the system collapsed when royal elections disincentivized kings from seeking the nobles’ support.

B25|Hayek, the Nobel, and the revival of Austrian economics|This paper re-evaluates the orthodox understanding of the role which the 1974 award of the Nobel Prize in Economics to F.A. Hayek had on the revival of Austrian Economics in the later part of the 20th century. The orthodox view, which focuses exclusively on the sociological role of the award on returning Austrian economists to the conversation among academic economists, omits the critical role of purely doctrinal developments. In particular, the work done in the decade 1937–1948 is argued to be central to the Austrian revival. In this decade, both Hayek and Mises independently developed new clarifications of Austrian thought which represented an extension of the subjectivist tradition in economics: Mises’ emphasis on human entrepreneurial action and Hayek’s exploration of the role of knowledge in the market process. The interest of a generation of younger academics to the ideas developed in that critical decade is thus understood to be the true cause of the Austrian revival, with the award of the Nobel Prize serving a catalytic rather than causative role.

B25|Discovery processes, science, and ‘knowledge–how:’ Competition as a discovery procedure in the laboratory|These edited remarks explore the relationship of the thought of F.A. Hayek to the development of experimental economics and related programs in economic design. Particularly emphasized are the insights of Hayek with respect to competition and their importance to the theoretical justification for, and empirical results derived from, the experimental study of market behavior. These remarks include some personal commentary on experimental methods, from the early double auctions of the 1960s through more recent work exploring the nature of business cycles. Finally, the intellectual history of the market structures examined in Vernon Smith’s work is discussed, comparing the exploration of the double auction to the horse market of Bohm-Bawerk, as well as the general insight of Adam Smith that causality stems from the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange to the discovery of specialization.

B25|Lobotomizing the defense brain|Economists model national defense as a pure public good optimally provided by a benevolent and omnipotent “defense brain” to maximize social welfare. I critically consider five assumptions associated with this view: (1) that defense and security is a pure public good that must be provided by a national government, (2) that state-provided defense is always a “good” and never a “bad”, (3) that the state can provide defense in the optimal quantity and quality, (4) that state expenditures on defense are neutral with respect to private economic activity, and (5) that state-provided defense activities are neutral with respect to domestic political institutions. I discuss an alternative framework—the “individualistic view”—for analyzing defense provision and suggest it is superior for understanding reality.

B25|The constructivist view of entrepreneurial opportunities: a critical analysis|The notion that opportunities exist objectively “out there” has been repeatedly assaulted by scholars who counter that opportunities are subjectively constructed or created. This paper intends to restore the balance by bringing the critical strands of inquiry themselves under critical scrutiny. Beyond the formulation of some original lines of critique and the drawing of attention to some foundational yet insufficiently studied issues, this article further contributes the following: (1) it juxtaposes a taxonomical ordering of constructivist approaches; (2) it identifies angles of complementarity and contradiction with the objectivist perspective; and (3) it brings subtle conceptual distinctions into prominence.

B25|Baudrillard Goes to Kyiv: Institutional Simulacra in Transition|The transition process in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union from 1989 onward has been focused on the reform of institutions in order to re-orient the economy. However, throughout the former Soviet space, “transition” has been merely a label for many countries, covering the reality of a fundamental lack of change in either political or economic institutions. Using the idea of simulacra and simulation, first posited by philosopher Jean Baudrillard in 1981, I show how institutional change in transition for some prominent “transition economies” has proceeded through stages in simulation. In particular, using examples from Central Asia and Ukraine, I examine how crucial institutions have changed from a perversion of reality into symbols that are divorced from any reality. Current events in Ukraine show that institutional simulacra can exposed when an exogenous reality forces its way through.
B25|The Rise of Money and Class Society: The Contributions of John F. Henry|"This paper explores the rise of money and class society in ancient Greece, drawing historical and theoretical parallels to the case of ancient Egypt. In doing so, the paper examines the historical applicability of the chartalist and metallist theories of money. It will be shown that the origins and the evolution of money were closely intertwined with the rise and consolidation of class society and inequality. Money, class society, and inequality came into being simultaneously, so it seems, mutually reinforcing the development of one another. Rather than a medium of exchange in commerce, money emerged as an ""egalitarian token"" at the time when the substance of social relations was undergoing a fundamental transformation from egalitarian to class societies. In this context, money served to preserve the faÃ§ade of social and economic harmony and equality, while inequality was growing and solidifying. Rather than ""invented"" by private traders, money was first issued by ancient Greek states and proto-states as they aimed to establish and consolidate their political and economic power. Rather than a medium of exchange in commerce, money first served as a ""means of recompense"" administered by the Greek city-states as they strived to implement the civic conception of social justice. While the origins of money are to be found in the origins of inequality, a well-functioning democratic society has the power to subvert the inequality-inducing characteristic of money via the use of money for public purpose, following the principles of Modern Money Theory (MMT). When used according to the principles of MMT, the inequality-inducing characteristic of money could be undermined, while the current trends in rising income and wealth disparities could be contained and reversed."
B25|Is Monetary Financing Inflationary? A Case Study of the Canadian Economy, 1935-75|Historically high levels of private and public debt coupled with already very low short-term interest rates appear to limit the options for stimulative monetary policy in many advanced economies today. One option that has not yet been considered is monetary financing by central banks to boost demand and/or relieve debt burdens. We find little empirical evidence to support the standard objection to such policies: that they will lead to uncontrollable inflation. Theoretical models of inflationary monetary financing rest upon inaccurate conceptions of the modern endogenous money creation process. This paper presents a counter-example in the activities of the Bank of Canada during the period 1935-75, when, working with the government, it engaged in significant direct or indirect monetary financing to support fiscal expansion, economic growth, and industrialization. An institutional case study of the period, complemented by a general-to-specific econometric analysis, finds no support for a relationship between monetary financing and inflation. The findings lend support to recent calls for explicit monetary financing to boost highly indebted economies and a more general rethink of the dominant New Macroeconomic Consensus policy framework that prohibits monetary financing.
B25|Disproportionality and Business Cycle from Tugan-Baranovskij to Spiethoff|In the second half of the 19th century, German-speaking countries developed a very intense economic debate about crises. Mikhail Ivanovich Tugan-Baranovskij’s analysis may be considered as the point of transition between different crisis theories and the development of organic thinking about the business cycle. It was an integral part of the German debate and had a decisive influence on Arthur Spiethoff’s elaboration – perhaps the most organic analysis of the cycle developed within the German historical school. Arthurs Spiethoff’s influence was recognized by important authors such as Friedrich A. von Hayek and Joseph A. Schumpeter. Both the Austrian economists admitted their debt toward the German scholar in elaborating their business cycle theories. The present paper aims to illustrate one of the important roots in Spiethoff’s approach, an approach that in turn became a crucial reference for other important economists.
B25|The implications of the concept of exaptation for a theory of economic change|The term exaptation, coined by Gould and Vrba, refers to those characters that are useful for survival but that were not selected for this purpose. In this paper I will focus on the notion of exaptation in socio economic systems and on its implications for a theory of economic change. In socio-economic systems, an exaptation is the result of a process through which the initial attribution of new functionalities to existing socio-economic entities (agents, artifacts, social institutions) leads to new entities and new relationships between entities. The notion of exaptation forces to examine the processes of change in socio-economic systems in terms of an interaction-based ontology that I will provide, following the complexity theory of innovation. I will use this ontology to highlight how processes of economic change can be analysed in terms of emergent phenomena and in particular in terms of the emergence of new specific functionalities and qualitatively new entities and relationships. I will refer these processes to the relationships between agent and artifacts, and to the organization of the economy and society. This second type of process of emergence will be examined with reference to the changing characteristics and functions of the division of labour emerging from the historical processes of interaction between quantitative and qualitative changes of production relations. I will conclude that economic change cannot be analysed in terms of a mere recombination of existing things or in terms of selection-variation mechanisms. It must be analysed through the dynamic historical process by which “a new thing leads to another”. In these processes of transformation the causality links are themselves the results of processes in which ex ante potential causality links can be transformed into different (and new) effective (or actual) causality links.
B25|G. Knapp’s State Theory of Money: History and Current Perspectives|The paper considers the historical contexts of Georg Knapp’s nominalistic theory of money, and reconstructs its basic arguments. The contemporaneous critical reactions to Knapp are analyzed, as well as some more recent versions of chartalism, and the strengths and weaknesses of the chartalist insights in monetary theory and policy.
B25|Which Human Qualities Can Economic Liberalism Be Based on?|"The article asks which human qualities can serve as the base for a liberal economic policy. The author is looking for an answer to this question in the classical works of economic liberalism — in the books by F. Bastiat, L. von Mises, F. von Hayek, W. Eucken, and M. Friedman. The two main qualities can be summarized as follows: the relatively high rank of freedom among human values and rational utilitarian calculus. It is assumed that in those countries where the both human prerequisites are present the liberal policy (for instance, liberal reforms) can be self-supportive and may have good results. On the contrary, if the first prerequisite is missing and a liberal policy can be based only on rational calculus, the ""paternalistic"" liberalism prevails and chances for success are much smaller."
B25|Guidelines for Institutional Changes in the Residential Real Estates Market|The process of institutionalization of the market of residential real estates implies the creation of new economic mechanisms and effective insti­tutional conditions to alleviate the interaction be­tween the different partners in the market. Initially, and in some aspects until now, the Bulgarian mar­ket of residential real estates is characterized by unevenness in the development of its component parts and sporadic investment activity of the main market players. At present, it may rather be said that at the Bulgarian market of residential real es­tates separate economic and legal conditions for its establishment and development are formed, and not for the overall institutional system. From the standpoint of institutional theory these processes have traditionally been viewed as a system of evolving structures that respond to changes in the environment, but the mecha­nisms of the reactions are determined by the internal for the systems processes. Full functioning of the market, according to the conceptual framework of Douglas North, suggesting a dynamic institutional environment which defines the “rules of the game” and insti­tutional agreements - organizations as “partici­pants” in it; the processes of change in formal / informal rules, but also their respective con­trols in compliance with the rules are bound by the imposition of institutional changes. Insti­tutional changes can be created “ bottom-up” in the very businesses and organizations. The attitude of “participants” institutional activity to­wards institutional changes is the focus of this article and the study. The main characteristics are studied- features, factors and conditions of the real estate agencies, i.e. determinants of their institutional activity, which according to the author can act as activating (and in some cases prohibitive) institutional changes in the market of residential real estates. At its core, this trend seems to improve the institutional structure, and hence the institutional condi­tions. And this leads to the prevention of op­portunistic behavior and affects positively the transparency of the market.
B25|Institutional Determinants Of Regional Diversity Of Labor Market In Poland|The article focuses on regional diversity of the Polish Labor Market from institutional perspective. The Polish Labor Market is geographically diverse in terms of unemployment and employment rates, and also in terms of economic development. At the end of 2013 the difference between the lowest and the highest unemployment rate in the Polish regions was 12.1% (Wielkopolska located in the West Poland has unemployment rate of 9.6% and Warmia - Mazury in the East has unemployment of 21.7%). The question arises whether this difference comes from the structural or institutional sources. The paper describe the character of Polish Labor Market, whereas in the second part, it traces the impact of institutional variables such as real wage, Kaitz index and Gender gap on the regional unemployment rate in 2002–2012 in Poland.
B25|Ordoliberalism And The Macroeconomic Policy In The Face Of The Euro Crisis|The global economic crisis and the crisis in the euro zone exposed the deep differences of opinion between German economists and scientists from Anglo-Saxon countries. The German approach conceptually differs in the views on the strategies and tools of anti-crisis policy, especially fiscal stimulus in the Keynesian-style, quantitative easing monetary policy of the ECB, the question of financial assistance to Greece and restructuring its debt. The other areas of difference are the approach to the rules in macroeconomic policy, fiscal consolidation, and interpretation of current account surplus. Given the size and performance of the German economy it is important to understand the reasons for these opposites, which constitute the research goal of this article. Considerations are based on the thesis that ordoliberal thought still has a strong impact on the practice of macroeconomic policy in Germany and also at the European level. The analysis is built on the short overview of ideological foundations of the German social market economy and its most important postulates, which then will be applied for interpretation of intellectual distinctions between economists from Germany and other countries in the theoretical and practical dimensions of the economic policy observed in Europe.

B25|Ordoliberalizm a polityka makroekonomiczna w obliczu kryzysu strefy euro|The global economic crisis and the crisis in the euro zone exposed the deep differences of opinion between German economists and scientists from other European countries and the US. The German approach conceptually differs in the views on the strategies and tools of anti-crisis policy, especially fiscal stimulus in the Keynesian-style, quantitative easing monetary policy of the ECB, the question of financial assistance to Greece and restructuring its debt. The other areas of difference are the approach to the rules in macroeconomic policy, fiscal consolidation, and interpretation of current account surplus. Given the size and performance of German economy it is important to understand the reasons for these opposites, which constitute the research goal of this article. Considerations are based on the thesis that ordoliberal thought still has a strong impact on the practice of macroeconomic policy in Germany and also at European level. The analysis is built on the short overview of ideological foundations of the German social market economy and its most important postulates, which then will be applied for interpretation of intellectual distinctions between economists from Germany and other countries in the theoretical and practical dimensions of economic policy observed in Europe. The methodology includes the critical literature studies and the comparative analysis of macroeconomic policy through the prism of economic thought.
B25|George Orwell and the Incoherence of Democratic Socialism|George Orwell's famous fictions, Animal Farm and Nineteen-Eighty Four were intended to advocate democratic socialism by portraying undemocratic forms of socialism as totalitarian. For Orwell, democracy was a political institution which would limit the abuse of power. But there are several problems with democratic socialism which ensure its failure. In Orwell's novel A Clergyman's Daughter, Orwell's views of economics and politics are inconsistent and conflicting in a way that ensures democratic socialism will not succeed on Orwell's terms. Democratic socialism in general is criticized according to F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom and John Jewkes's The New Ordeal by Planning, whose arguments differ crucially from those against market socialism by Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny. An economic analysis of the political institutions of democratic socialism shows that democratic socialism must necessarily fail for political (not economic) reasons even if nobody in authority has ill-intentions or abuses their power.
B25|Two Opposing Economic-Literary Critiques of Socialism: George Orwell Versus Eugen Richter and Henry Hazlitt|Orwell's famous fictions, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four criticized totalitarian forms of socialism from a Public Choice perspective, assuming that socialism would work as an economic system as long as the proper political institutions were in place to curb the potential for the abuse of power. This is contrasted with two novels by others who took the opposite approach: Richter's Pictures of the Socialistic Future and Hazlitt's Time Will Run Back. These two assumed that the political implementation of socialism would be perfect but that socialism would necessarily turn totalitarian because of the problem of economic calculation. These novels assumed away the Public Choice problem of institutions and the abuse of power and focused on the political implications of socialism as a purely economic system. Contrasting these two sets of novels shows how the Austrian and Public Choice schools criticize socialism in two entirely different ways.
B25|Conceptual Challenges of Observability for Transaction Sector in Economy|"Stimuli for the sustainable economic development are mainly kept owing to a balanced sectoral structure. An ideal ratio between the transformation (production) and transaction components helps to smooth shocks from crises of institutional reforms. A nature of institutional reforms has led to a conclusion of an evolutionary expansion both in terms of a number of institutions themselves (horizontal supplement), and the complexity in elaborating rules and regulations for the proper behaviour (vertical supplement). These and other causes logically lead to strengthening in the transaction sector. In terms of a missing conventional agreement on an evaluation of the transaction sector in economy, the paper has presented a review and the authors have systematized some typical errors and inconsistencies in approaches. In opposition to the ""cost-based"" evaluation method by J. Wallis and D. North, the authors have presented an available alternative method to measure the value of the transaction sector using ""cost"" parameters. The research has shown the efficiency of the used ""cost"" approach to the evaluation that eliminates significant errors in the recalculation of the volume of the transaction sector in the economy."

B25|F. A. Hayek'in Bilgisizlik Teorisi Çerçevesinde Piyasa, Denge ve Planlama<BR>[Market, Equilibrium, and Planning within the Framework of F.A. Hayek's Theory of Ignorance]|In this article, the implications of the theory of ignorance developed by Hayek to economic theory and policy will be examined. The theory of ignorance appeared especially in the second period of Hayek’s career and has been applied to the field of economics, politics, and law. Accordingly, people do not have knowledge about the institutions they’ve got today, knowledge which other people have, their actions and the results of them. This kind of knowledge cannot exist as cumulative and the amount of it cannot be enhanced by technological developments. Hence, developing theories, making plans and practices as if we have complete knowledge will not conclude as we desire. This study will discuss and sum up Hayek’s criticizes on market perception, the assumption of perfectly competitive market, and equilibrium analysis of mainstream economics, his contributions to the possibility of economic calculation in socialism and central planning, and recent development in information theory of mainstream economics.
B25|Behavioural rules: Veblen, Nelson-Winter, Oström and beyond|Rules as devices for the analysis of economic behaviour have earned increasing recognition since Elinor Ostrom’s work was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 2009. This contribution illustrates the use of such analytical device in three foundational pioneering areas of application: The sociology of Thorstein Veblen, the organisational studies of Nelson and Winter, and Elinor Ostrom’s analysis of resource governance systems. A comparison of their respective uses of the analytical concept of behavioural rules reveals their major objective: the systematic interpretation of empirical observations. While their works provide convincing evidence on the analytical power of rules, neither has realised the full potential for generalisation toward a theory of rule-based economics. Such generalisation has recently been achieved by Dopfer and Potts. Adhering to ‘instrumental realism’ their theoretical framework integrates key elements of the reasoning about rules presented here, and achieves general applicability to the analysis of the origination and diffusion of rules, and of their use for economic operations.
B25|Entrepreneurship: State of grace or human action? Schumpeter’s leadership vs Kirzner’s alertness|Joseph A. Schumpeter developed a very well-known theory of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship, centred on the concept of ‘new combinations’. According to him, innovation and entrepreneurship are destructive elements driving the system beyond an equilibrium position and setting in motion a competitive process, in order to reach a new equilibrium point. Though Austrian, Schumpeter was never a member of the Austrian School of Economics. However, his position as regards entrepreneurship is widely commented on by Austrian School members. In particular, Israel M. Kirzner devoted his research activity to develop an alternative concept of entrepreneurship rooted in Misesian human action and the concept of ‘alertness’. This paper aims to analyze and compare the two positions, in an attempt not so much to stress differences but to find possible common paths for further developments of the concept of entrepreneurship.
B25|At the Root of Economic Fluctuations: Expectations, Preferences and Innovation. Theoretical Framework and Empirical Evidences|The present paper aim to develop the Austrian Theory of Business Cycle in order to conclude that economic fluctuations are unavoidable. The conventional version of Austrian business cycle theory focuses on a temporary imbalance between natural and monetary rates of interest. When, because of the role of monetary authorities in defining the monetary rate, the two values are in a situation of imbalance, the resulting expansion stage is followed by a recession. On the other hand, if instead the expansive phase arises without any interference by monetary authorities but through re-adaptation of the productive structure to a modified structure of temporal preferences, a period of sustainable growth begins that will not be followed by a crisis. The purpose of this essay is to demonstrate, on the other hand, that because of profit-expectations and the combined action of Schumpeterian elements (imitations-speculations and the ‘creation of money’ by banks), even a so-called ‘sustainable’ boom will be affected by a liquidation and settling crisis. What distinguishes the latter situation from the conventional case of imbalance between monetary and natural rates is not the onset or otherwise of a crisis but, rather, its intensity and duration. We will define as natural an economic cycle characterised by a stage of expansion considered to be ‘sustainable’ in the Austrian theory but followed by an inevitable readjustment crisis. In conclusion we will try to link our theoretical conclusions with the crisis emerged in the Western world in 2007, to test the explanatory power of our theoretical framework.
B25|Ludwig M. Lachmann contro la Scuola di Cambridge<BR>[Ludwig M. Lachmann against the Cambridge School]|While in the early 1930s Keynes and Hayek were the major figures in a heated academic debate about money and capital, in which Keynes also and especially involved the Italian Piero Sraffa, it might seem at first sight that the Austrian economist set aside an organic demolition of the ideas expressed in 1936 by his rival in the General Theory. But the ‘Austrian knight’ of a new Vienna-Cambridge debate, in the subsequent decades, was the German economist Ludwig M. Lachmann (1906-1990), a student of Hayek at LSE during the 1930s and later a professor in Johannesburg and New York. Lachmann was one of the protagonists of the Austrian revival after 1974 and the founding leader of the ‘hermeneutic stream’, opposed by the Rothbardian stream. Lachmann, defending Keynes’s subjectivism and expectation theory, revived the Vienna-Cambridge controversy, criticising not Keynes but his followers, in particular the ‘new’ Cambridge School, developed by Joan Robinson and Piero Sraffa. Lachmann’s life sight was to build a new economics paradigm, centred on the idea of market process, expectations and kaleidic society (Shackle).
B25|Evolution-Based Approaches in Economics and Evolutionary Loss of Information|Evolutionary economics provides a self-organizing stabilizing mechanism without relying on mechanic equilibria. However, there are substantial differences between the genetic evolutionary biology, and the evolution of institutions, firms, routines or strategies in economics. Most importantly, there is no genetic codification and no sexual reproduction in economic evolution, and the involved agents can interfere consciously and purposefully. This entails a general lack of fixation and perhaps the quick loss of information through a Muller's ratchet like mechanism. The present contribution discusses the analogy of evolution in biology and economics and considers potential problems resulting in evolutionary models in economics.
B25|The Boulding-Richardson Model Revisited|We review, and extend, one of the classic dynamic models of conflict in economics by Richardson (1919) and Boulding (1962). It turns out that the stability properties of the model change if one takes a more realistic “incrementalist” view, and that chance / friction can easily be incorporated into the standard model by defining a probability of (de-)escalation. This analysis is not just a study in the history of economic thought, but also relevant for the development of simulation models for the analysis of conflict dynamics.
B25|"MINIMUM WAGE AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN ROMANIA: AN INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE (International Conference ""Recent Advances in Economic and Social Research"", 13-14 mai 2015, București)"|The institutional economics perspective is less present in the field of minimum wage law’s implications, despite the fact that labor market is one of the most regulated markets in every economy. At its beginnings, the minimum wage legislation has been subject of intense controversies between the institutionalist and neoclassical economists, but the mainstream point of view has gained ground. Still, in the last decade the institutional economics perspective has made some progress in this area, its contributions being limited to justifying the necessity of the minimum wage legislation based on some arguments borrowed from the old institutionalists, especially from John Commons. This paper is focused on the minimum wage law’s implications on the business environment in Romania. The institutional hypothesis that guides the entire reasoning in this paper is: any entrepreneurial endeavor means, basically, that the entrepreneurs act in an existing institutional frame. The formal regulations, such as minimum wage legislation, affect entrepreneurial behavior by creating and altering transaction costs. The aim of this paper is to offer an explanation to the evasive entrepreneurship in Romania using the concept of transaction costs related to the institutional rigidities created by the minimum wage legislation.

He criticized the prevalent interpretation of the rationality of human actions their infallibility, and the identification of rationality with the motivation of the action only ""material"" needs and interests. In addition, the article presents the ideas of Mises on a wide range of issues in the field of methodology and epistemology of economics and other social sciences."
B25|L’alternative monétaire Bitcoin : une perspective institutionnaliste|Depuis quelques années, nous assistons à l’émergence de monnaies d’un genre nouveau, reposant sur des procédés cryptographiques, gérées en pair à pair selon un consensus distribué. La plus représentative d’entre elles, le Bitcoin, est lancée après la crise financière de 2008 et vient contester un ordre monétaire fondé sur le crédit et le pouvoir bancaire. Ces crypto-monnaies viennent heurter la conception traditionnelle de la monnaie : unitaire, souveraine, territoriale et centralisée. Par conséquent, elles interrogent la théorie et renouvellent le débat sur la nature de la monnaie. Dans ce papier, nous proposons d’analyser le Bitcoin au filtre d’une théorie institutionnaliste de la monnaie. En tant qu’institution sociale, la monnaie est plus qu’une technologie, car elle participe à la construction d’un espace marchand s’articulant avec un ordre socio-économique. C’est pourquoi nous mettons en évidence les arguments de la contestation et les racines idéologiques qui sous-tendent le système Bitcoin : décentralisation, anti-étatisme (cryptage) et naturalisation de la monnaie (minage). En mettant en avant la notion centrale de confiance, nous nous intéressons ensuite à la capacité du projet Bitcoin à construire un ordre monétaire, certes alternatif, mais stable.
B25|Behavioural Economics as a New Trend in Economics – An Overview (Ekonomia behawioraln jako nowy nurt ekonomii - zarys problemtyki)|Behavioural economics is a fast developing field in modern economics and is associated with empirical and experimental studies. A distinct characteristic of behavioural economics is its multidisciplinary nature. The observation of subjects requires psychological and sociological research, and, in order to define behavioural theories, it is necessary to integrate the knowledge developed within social sciences. Hence, economists must not only extend their area of interest, but also abandon the assumption about rational individuals. Behavioural economics thus goes beyond the narrow limits imposed by the homo oeconomicus concept. This article aims to present the achievements of behavioural economics. The issues presented in this study do not describe the whole range of behavioural economics, but only refer to selected elements. The first part focuses on the relationship between economics and psychology, and the origins, concept and characteristics of behavioural economics. Further, the most important objections against the behavioural approach to economics are discussed, together with behaviourism in other trends in economics. Finally, major conclusions end this study.
B25|Entrepreneurial Attitudes of Students from the Selected Lublin Universities vs the Development of Academic Entrepreneurship (Ekonomia ewolucyjna jako jeden z nurtow wspolczesnej ekonomii – zarys problematyki)|Evolutionary economics is considered to be part of heterodox economics, which focuses on developments in the economic system, their reasons and consequences. Accepting that the reality is dynamic, contemporary evolutionary economics examines the ways in which the economy evolves, seeking origins and mechanisms of its dynamics. These statements reflect the fundamental ontological and methodological characteristics of evolutionary economics. This article aims at defining evolutionary economics and presenting its historical roots, current views and prospects for development. The issues put forward do not describe its entire range, but only selected elements. This paper is theoretical and consists of five parts. The first part concentrates on explaining the concept and key assumptions of evolutionism in social sciences. Further, the essence of evolutionary economics and its origins are discussed. Owing to the length requirements, the focus is exclusively on presenting the views of the most prominent representatives of this scientific discipline. The final part synthesises fundamental weaknesses of evolutionary economics and prospects for its development.
B25|Understanding long run economic development as an evolutionary process|A broad sketch of an evolutionary theory of long run economic development is presented in this article, considering the basic processes and structures involved. The problematic orientation of Neoclassical growth theory is discussed, pointing out its limited macroeconomic perspective, the weak consideration of technological change and of demand, the lack of attention to institutional settings. An explanation of economic development has to consider the key role of innovation and the process of creative destruction, in the context of Schumpeterian insights and evolutionary perspectives. I argue that economists need to consider three somewhat separate bodies of research on economic development. One is the evolutionary analysis that follows Schumpeter. A second is the research on technological advance as an evolutionary process. The third is focused on institutions and how they mold the development process, and how they themselves evolve. Moreover, the role of demand in shaping growth dynamics and business cycles—stressed by Keynes and post-Keynesian approaches—has to be integrated in such evolutionary perspectives in ways that are only now starting to emerge.

B25|The best horse in the Viennese stables: Gottfried Haberler and Joseph Schumpeter|Haberler knew Schumpeter as a mentor, colleague and fatherly friend for almost 25 years. His well-known obituary of Schumpeter, besides offering an overview of Schumpeter’s work, brings to light a wealth of biographical information, invaluable spadework for future biographers. The obituary draws attention to various facets of Schumpeter’s multi-layered personality and notes the ironical tone in his writings. Schumpeter draws on irony as a rhetorical strategy when he considers the prospects for capitalism in Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy. The ironical mode as a common ploy for dealing with disaster is ingrained in the Austrian culture of Schumpeter’s youth. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
B25|The Schumpeter–Hilferding Nexus|The paper interprets certain parts of Joseph Schumpeter’s oeuvre in association with the writings of Rudolf Hilferding. For instance, we show that Hilferding’s conception of economic development has striking similarities with Schumpeter’s respective thesis. Also, Hilferding expressed the thesis that ‘the size and technical equipment of the monopolistic combination ensure its superiority’ which has striking similarities with the so-called Schumpeterian Hypothesis. Furthermore, Hilferding made a distinction between the entrepreneur who is in charge of the use of capital in production and the capitalist who advances his capital and bears the risk. There, Hilferding identified another personality who has similar tasks to those of an innovative manager. It is exactly this separation of roles which is at the core of Schumpeter’s famous analysis. Moreover, regarding credit, for both theoreticians, it is determined by its demand side i.e. creation of credit money resulting from the demand for investment funds and is indispensable for the functioning of capitalism. In this context, their views on economic instability have further similarities, since for both theorists, development presupposes an innovation, which enables the firm to earn an extra profit and stimulates the demand for credit in order to finance new investments through credit creation. As for socialism, Hilferding regarded it as the organization of production not by and for the benefit of capitalist magnates but by and for society as a whole, whereas for Schumpeter socialism is an institutional arrangement that vests the management of the productive forces with some public authority. Finally, regarding imperialism, Schumpeter differentiated himself from Hilferding and considered it to be an ‘old’ inheritance from pre-modern capitalist eras, which was bound to disappear contrarily to Hilferding, who regarded imperialism as a ‘new’, characteristic of capitalism in its ‘latest’ stage. In brief, some of Schumpeter’s ideas are probably not quite as unique as they appeared to be, since many of them could be described as a reworking of Hilferding’s views. Apparently, Schumpeter’s originality is, at least partly, based on the approaches on which he built his oeuvre. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
B25|Joseph Schumpeter and Simon Kuznets: comparing their evolutionary economic approaches to business cycles and economic growth|The connections between the work of Simon Kuznets and Joseph Schumpeter are discussed from a history of economic thought perspective. First, their broad perspectives on economic evolution are compared and contrasted. It is argued that Kuznets assigned a greater role for institutional change in economic evolution and he had a greater interest in the distribution of income and how it changes with economic development. Second, Kuznets’ controversial review of Schumpeter’s two volume book, Business Cycles, is reassessed. This leads directly to discussion of their differing methodological approaches. Third, their respective views on the determination of economic growth are compared and it is argued that Kuznets’ laid a stronger foundation for future neo-Schumpeterian research on economic growth. The paper concludes with some discussion of how evolutionary economists using modern perspectives, such as ’micro-meso-macro’, can draw upon the works of these great economists to provide an empirical methodology that can be used to explain economic growth and its fluctuation.

B25|Eduard März and Joseph Schumpeter|The paper starts off with a portrayal of Eduard März’ life in Vienna and of the impact that environment had on his early scientific work. The paper proposes that the shared experience had a strong bearing on the relationship between the student M¨arz, “that fascinating immigrant” (James Tobin), and his teacher Schumpeter, the “high priest of his science” (M¨arz). The paper highlights the various facets of this unique relationship including the interesting differences in the interpretations of the student and his teacher regards Marxian theory, Austro-Marxism and social policy.

B25|Schumpeter, Minsky and the financial instability hypothesis|Hyman Minsky pioneered the idea of the financial instability hypothesis to explain how swings between robustness and fragility in financial markets generate business cycles in the economic system. Yet few economists have recognized that this elemental idea originates not only from the financial theory of investment and investment theory of business cycles put forward by John Maynard Keynes, but also in the credit view of money and finance advocated by Joseph Schumpeter. Nevertheless, Minsky described Schumpeter’s business cycle theory as ‘banal’ because it relied on the real economy as Walras represents. The reason was that money was endogenous in Schumpeter’s earlier view, as it emerged out of the credit system, which allowed for a discussion of the relationship between production and finance. This essay will focus on how Minsky related some ideas from Schumpeter’s Theory of Economic Development with those in Keynes’ General Theory Money and finance provide a link between Keynes’ view of the investment decision as a determinant of output and employment with Schumpeter’s view of the investment decision as a determinant of innovation and economic growth.

A description of Schumpeter’s interaction with friends and collaborators as well as opponents, of the intellectual struggles he was engaged in as well as the ideological dimensions of his life and approaches sheds an interesting light on a scholar whose oeuvre received full admiration only some decades after he passed away in 1950.

B25|The Theory of Capital as a Theory of Capitalism – Hidden Austrian Contributions to a Historically Specific Approach to Capital|Before economists and sociologists came up with their own definitions of the term “capital,” it was commonly understood as money invested in businesses by their owners or shareholders, and it continues to be understood this way in everyday business practice. In a recent article, Geoffrey Hodgson (2014) advises economists to return to this pre-Smithian usage of the term. The present paper takes up Hodgson’s demand and develops a theory of capital that is based upon this business notion of capital. It also argues that the Austrian theory of capital, if interpreted correctly, can serve as a starting point. Despite the conviction of its adherents to the contrary, the Austrian theory of capital is not universal or ahistorical, but dovetails with Hodgson’s vision of an approach to capital which analyses historically specific features of capitalism.

B25|Economics of Unlimited Supply of Labor and Asymmetric Power|Since around 2000 the education premium and the level of employment in high-skill occupations has stagnated, if not actually begun to shrink. This brings into question the generally held view that in advanced countries, while potentially harmful for those who work with their hands, globalization and technological change benefit those who work with their minds. The paper argues that these unexpected labor market trends are the result not so much of autonomous changes in technology as much as they are that of the large power asymmetry between capital and labor that developed in the last few decades. The global oversupply of labor appears to have revived a pattern of skill replacing technological change that is reminiscent of 19th century capitalism. The relative abundance of cheap labor creates an incentive to chip away whatever component can be routinized from complex tasks that are performed by expensive skilled workers so that they can be offshored and automated. The paper develops a game theoretical definition of asymmetric power and shows why in labor markets characterized by a structural imbalance between supply and demand, market exchange ceases to be a positive-sum game, and how that can favor skill replacing technological change over one that augments skills. While autonomous innovations determine what non-routine task can at all be transformed into routine ones, the attractiveness of doing so is not independent of major shifts in labor market conditions.
B25|A Study on the Asymmetry of the News Aspect of the Stock Market: Evidence from Three Institutional Investors in the Taiwan Stock Market|This paper uses daily data to investigate the behavior of institutional investors in Taiwanâ€™s stock market. We adopted TGARCH and EGARCH models to test various news. We found that, for the entire sample, a significant clustering phenomenon exists in the investment behavior of three institutional investors, and the impact due to a change of news content shows significant asymmetry and leverage effects. That is, the impact of bad news from the market is stronger than that of good news. In addition, an asymmetric phenomenon can also be seen for the international news aspect as responded to by foreign institutional investors. This phenomenon is more significant than those of the dealers and institutional trust investors. Moreover, the asymmetric phenomenon as responded to by the dealers for domestic news is more significant than those of foreign investors and institutional trust investors.

B25|The formal-informal economy dualism in a retrospective of economic thought since the 1940s|Central to the scientific debate about the 'informal sector' and the validity of the concept used to be a twofold challenge. The crux laid not only in the objective to explain the widely visible persistence of the informal economy in developing countries, but also in the identification of its roots and the proliferation conditions to be met ex ante. The present paper aims at establishing a link between the theories on informality and marginalization which is another important issue that has arisen within the discussions on the causes of persistent poverty a few years ago. Both concepts are interlinked and self-enforcing. On the macroeconomic level, any economy - be it formal or informal - consists of a set of different economic sectors and any of these sectors basically consists of an accumulation of people on the microeconomic level. Every time one looks at the macro level where political and economic conditions frame the dynamics of the formal and the informal economy, one has at the same time to look at the micro-level where the social and economic conditions determine the incentives for every actor to participate either in the formal, the informal or in both economies. Informality has multiple sources depending on whether the agent took a voluntary choice or had to involuntary opt-out from an institutional system. In this paper, the connection between informality and involuntary exclusion shall be examined in a retrospective of economic thought since the 1940s. The roots of the intertwined concepts of informality and economic exclusion have been laid in the dual economy theories of the 1940s-1950s. Recapitulating the works of Julius BOEKE, Arthur LEWIS, John HARRIS & Michael TODARO, Albert HIRSCHMAN and other socio-economists of that time, it will be argued that one of the necessary reasons for the persistence of the informal economy in developing countries is the dualism in institutional frameworks that leads to the marginalization of social groups and their subsequent exclusion from formal economic activities. By referring to the groundbreaking Africa studies of Keith HART (1971) and the INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION (1972), special emphasis will be given to the causal reciprocity between informality, marginalization and economic exclusion. The paper closes with a brief overview of current schools of thought that deal very differently with the issue of informality and economic exclusion.
B25|Theories of finance and financial crisis – Lessons for the Great Recession|This paper presents an overview of different models which explain financial crises, with the aim of understanding economic developments during and possibly after the Great Recession. In the first part approaches based on efficient markets and rational expectations hypotheses are analyzed, which however do not give any explanation for the occurrence of financial crises and thus cannot suggest any remedies for the present situation. A broad range of theoretical approaches analyzing financial crises from a medium term perspective is then discussed. Within this group we focused on the insights of Marx, Schumpeter, Wicksell, Hayek, Fisher, Keynes, Minsky, and Kindleberger. Subsequently the contributions of the Regulation School, the approach of Social Structures of Accumulation and Post-Keynesian approach, which focus on long-term developments and regime shifts in capitalist development, are presented. International approaches to finance and financial crises are integrated into the analyses. We address the issue of relevance of all these theories for the present crisis and draw some policy implications. The paper has the aim to find out to which extent the different approaches are able to explain the Great Recession, what visions they develop about future development of capitalism and to which extent these different approaches can be synthesized.
B25|Hayeks Überinvestitionstheorie|"Die Austrian Business Cycle-Theorie behauptet, dass am Anfang eines konjunkturellen Aufschwungs eine kreditfinanzierte Überinvestition stattfindet, die (in der Version Garrisons und in Anlehnung an von Mises) eventuell von einer Überkonsumtion begleitet wird. Beiden Varianten liegt die Überinvestitionstheorie Hayeks zugrunde, die dieser umfassend in ""Preise und Produktion"" (1931) darstellt, wobei er eine Reihe von Vorarbeiten benutzt, unter anderem seine eigenen Überlegungen zur Konjunktur- und Geldtheorie von 1929. In den beiden Jahren dazwischen erfolgt eine Verschiebung des Objekts seiner Kritik vom Bankensystem zur Zentralbank, der Hayek im Jahr 1931, das heißt inmitten einer weltweiten Deflation und angesichts knappen Geldes, empfiehlt, das Geld noch mehr an die Zügel zu legen, die Zinsen nicht zu senken, sondern zu erhöhen. Solche paradoxen Konsequenzen sind gerechtfertigt, wenn sie aufgrund einer logisch einwandfreien Theorie gezogen werden, die den härtesten empirischen Überprüfungen ausgesetzt worden ist. Letzteres setzt eine mathematische Modellierung voraus, die sowohl den Intentionen Hayeks als auch den Anforderungen der Volkswirtschaftlichen Gesamtrechnungen genügt. Ein hoffentlich erfreulicher Nebeneffekt der vorgeschlagenen algebraischen Modellierung der Überinvestitionstheorie Hayeks besteht darin, dass dem modernen Ökonomen die Überinvestitionstheorie Hayeks näher gebracht wird, deren theoretischen Gehalt und empirische Fruchtbarkeit er nach Durchsicht dieser Seiten wohl selber beurteilen können wird."
B25|Pereat Iustitia, Fiat Mundus: What is Left of the European Economic Constitution after the OMT-Litigation?|What kind of law are Germany’s Constitutional Court and the CJEU concerned with when they decide upon European and national powers in the realms of monetary, economic and fiscal policy? Is it still possible to identify some meta-legal conceptual basis for the ordering functions attributed to law in these fields? It seems that Europe’s responses to the financial crisis have no theoretical foundation, neither in some variety of economic liberalism, nor in some Keynesian counter-vision. Do we really have to leave it to ECB to define the notion of monetary policy and to then develop and use instruments to implement its decisions? With these queries, we do not insinuate that this lack of conceptual orientation can be attributed to some wilful disregard of well-founded legal commands. Instead, we submit that Europe is exposed to a state of emergency which has led to the restless search for new modes of crisis management which damage the integrity of law. Were the two dissenting judges of the 2nd Senate of the German Constitutional Court right with their suggestion that the Bundesverfassungsgericht (BVerfG) should dismiss the complaints of Peter Gauweiler and Others? Did their non possumus respect the law’s limits and therefore the law’s integrity? Or did instead the CJEU act as a good guardian of European constitutionalism through its de facto unconditioned legalisation of executive federalism?
B25|Darwinian paradigm, cultural evolution and human purposes: on F.A. Hayek’s evolutionary view of the market|The claim that the Darwinian paradigm of blind-variation-and-selective-retention can be generalized from the biological to the socio-cultural realm has often been questioned because of the critical role played by human purposeful design in the process of cultural evolution. In light of the issue of how human purposes and evolutionary forces interact in socio-economic processes the paper examines F.A. Hayek’s arguments on the “extended order” of the market (capitalism), in particular with regard to their policy implications. Its focus is on the tension that exists in Hayek’s work between a rational liberal and an agnostic evolutionary perspective. A re-construction of his arguments is suggested that allows for a reconciliation of these seemingly contradictory views. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014

In this study we restrict ourselves to the problem of testing exponentiality against non-monotonic aging notions. We model non-monotonic aging using the notions of bathtub failure rate, increasing and then decreasing mean residual life and new worse then better than used in expectation classes. The different tests of exponentiality against these alternatives are discussed in detail. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014
B25|Los inicios de la Experiencia Cooperativa Mondragón<BR>[The beginnings of the Mondragon´s Coopetrative Experence]|Este artículo analiza los orígenes y la evolución inicial de la Experiencia Cooperativa Mondragón (ECM). A lo largo de estas tres décadas (1955-1985), se produce el surgimiento y la consolidación de la ECM. Esta Experiencia, radicalmente innovadora en su origen, llegó a tener 19.161 trabajadores en el año 1985; unas ventas por valor de 841,4 millones de euros y un total de 94 cooperativas asociadas a Caja Laboral, distribuidas por toda la geografía vasca. En estos treinta años, las cooperativas conocieron coyunturas económicas muy favorables que supieron aprovechar para crecer, junto con otras más desfavorables en las que desplegaron todo su potencial de intercooperación para resistir y fortalecerse mutuamente. En este periodo, se produjeron cambios significativos en las bases institucionales del Grupo. Los profundos cambios sociales, económicos y políticos acontecidos en la sociedad vasca, fueron acompañados por cambios de tipo cognitivo y normativo en el seno del cooperativismo, mientras que los aspectos reguladores se mantuvieron, siendo estos últimos, los elementos identitarios más vigorosos del cooperativismo.
B25|Walter Eucken's role in the early history of the Mont Pèlerin Society|In the history of economic thought Walter Eucken is mostly known for his impact in establishing the Social Market Economy in post-war Germany. Even though there is a growing interest in his ideas especially from an Austrian and a Constitutional Economics perspective, his influence on the discussions within neoliberalism and, more specifically, his impact in the course of the foundation of the Mont Pèlerin Society (MPS) are not yet widely considered. In this paper we attempt to show that Eucken was very influential in the formation of the MPS and that German ordoliberalism had a significant imprint on the early history of the society. It is primarily Eucken's correspondence with F. A. Hayek and Wilhelm Röpke in this context which we present and analyze, complementing it with some hypotheses about early influences between Eucken and Hayek in terms of methodology and epistemology. Subsequently we show, by regarding the first MPS meetings between 1947 and 1949 (general and organizational), that there was - even at this early stage in the development of the MPS - a widening gap between a Continental European and an Anglo-Saxon understanding of neoliberalism, despite the personal friendships and high collegial respect especially between Eucken, Hayek and Röpke; Ludwig von Mises playing a special role in this setting. We illustrate this development also by discussing personal memories of Leonhard Miksch, a student of Eucken and a participant of the MPS meeting in 1949, recorded in his so far unpublished diary.
B25|Reflections on the Impact of the New Economic, Sociological and Historical Institutionalism in Institutional Social Policy|This paper intends to make a reflection and analysis of the impact of theoretical and methodological frameworks of reference on different neo-institutional approaches in social policy. The paper questions the functionality and continuity of the institutions that are responsible for the functions of designing and implementing programs of social policy, given the profound changes on the environment of economic globalization processes. The method used primarily focuses on critical analysis and reflection. It is concluded that the institutions of welfare and social security must develop the technological, organizational and administrative skills to create and maintain institutional effects that go beyond being conductive to efficiency, effectiveness and equitable development.

B25|Economics of Qwerty and Fgğıod|After summarizing the path dependency concept which began with the article named as “Clio and the Economics of Qwerty” written by Paul David in 1985, I will associate the path dependency with the reasons of why is F keyboard not used widely instead of Q keyboards, even though F keyboards were tried to be mandatory by the state in our country.
B25|Finance and Crisis; Marxian, Institutionalist and Circuitist approaches|Most mainstream neoclassical economists completely failed to anticipate the crisis which broke in 2007 and 2008. There is however a long tradition of economic analysis which emphasises how growth in a capitalist economy leads to an accumulation of tensions and results in periodic crises. This paper first reviews the work of Karl Marx who was one of the first writers to incorporate an analysis of periodic crisis in his analysis of capitalist accumulation. The paper then considers the approach of various subsequent Marxian writers, most of whom locate periodic cyclical crises within the framework of longer-term phases of capitalist development, the most recent of which is generally seen as having begun in the 1980s. The paper also looks at the analyses of Thorstein Veblen and Wesley Claire Mitchell, two US institutionalist economists who stressed the role of finance and its contribution to generating periodic crises, and the Italian Circuitist writers who stress the problematic challenge of ensuring that bank advances to productive enterprises can successfully be repaid.
B25|What If Marx And Veblen Met…|The aim of this study is to analyse both the differences and the similarities between Marx and Veblen regarding historical specificity, evolution, and alienation. Starting with their discussions on these subjects, this article builds on the analyses of capitalism. The goal of this study is not to collapse Marx and Veblen into one another but rather to understand capitalism by presenting the complementary relationship of the two economists’ analyses and to introduce an appropriate analytical framework for understanding capitalism. This study consists of three parts. The first part examines how Veblen regarded Marx’s analysis, and how Marx especially viewed Darwin’s theory of evolution. Marx’s approach to evolution and Veblen’s criticism of Marx on this topic will constitute the general framework of this part. The second part of the study evaluates the level of agreement or disagreement between Veblen and Marx on the idea of historicism from the perspective of dialectical materialism. The last part a alyses Marx and Veblen’s different ideas of the concept of alienation. The two economists’ views on the capitalist system will be determined based on these three concepts, introducing the similarities between them as well as the differences.
B25|L'institution de la famille. Un nouveau motif de séparation entre Commons et Veblen|This paper deals with Commons’s and Veblen’s position on the specific institution of family. Commons adheres to the conventional pattern in which men are in charge of the livelihood and woman of the affective side. He admits the inequality between men and women. The historical evolution let simply expect the development of relationships based more on persuasion than on coercion. Veblen, for his part, backs feminism. According to him, women must become emancipated and work outside the home. Keeping them within the household enables men to establish a domination mainly expressed through “conspicuous” consumption and “vicarious” leisure. Classification JEL : B15, B25, J16, J70
B25|D'une « démocratie créatrice » à un « capitalisme raisonnable ». Lecture croisée de la philosophie de J. Dewey et de l'économie de J.R. Commons|J. Dewey and J.R. Commons have shared a common intellectual and practical engagement for democracy. This paper contends that the proximity of their analysis is larger than the explicit tribute Commons’ conception of social sciences pays to Dewey’s social philosophy. On the basis of a cross-lecture of these authors, we show their convergences on democracy as an ethical ideal and on democratic state as an ongoing process, as well as the complementary answers they give to the problems faced by democracy. We underline that Commons has made a notable contribution to pragmatism by expanding Dewey’s « creative democracy » to a « reasonable capitalism ». Classification JEL : B25, B31, B40
B25|An Overview On The Banking System From Oltenia (1944-1948)|This article intends to be a short incursion into the history of the banking system from Oltenia, during 1944-1948. For establishing the place of the financial institutions in the entire national banking and credit system, it was necessary the consulting of a great number of archive documents that kept the most numerous and significant documents, useful for our theme. The materials we have studied (reports, correspondence, minutes, statistic data etc.) have offered us a more ample image on the financial institutions, from the studied area, institutions that contributed, according to their possibilities, to the support of the population with credits, necessary for the productive activities, and the supplying with convenience products.
B25|The National Bank Of Romania From State Body To Autonomus Authority|This article presents the evolution of the National Bank of Romania from the status of a central government body to the one of autonomous public institution, through laws that have governed it from its setting up (1880) to the present. As an autonomous administrative authority, central bank finds its first foundation, in legal terms, in the provisions of Romanian Constitution of 1991, revised in 2003, and, secondly, in the normative acts that make up the legislative framework necessary for carrying out banking activity, especially Law no. 312/2004 on the Status of the National Bank of Romania. The originality of this article lies in the fact that the analysis of the legal texts was done in correlation with the historical context in which they were adopted and with the evolution of the political regime and of the Romanian economy, from the capitalist economy, to the centralized economy and, finally, to the market economy.
B25|Albert O. Hirschman y la economía del desarrollo: lecciones para el presente|Albert Hirschman vivió casi cinco años en Colombia, donde según él, adquirió un punto de vista. Este punto de vista le permitió formular una aproximación original al desarrollo, alejada de las grandes teorías y del mero empirismo; lo llamó una estrategia de desarrollo y, en ella, resaltaba los eslabonamientos entre sectores productivos pero, sobre todo, las habilidades, creencias y expectativas necesarias, y muchas veces inexplotadas, para hacer posible un proceso dinámico de toma de decisiones. Estaba convencido de que los individuos eran más que simples beneficiarios de las políticas de desarrollo y los veía como agentes activos de sus propios procesos. Este artículo, después de explorar su punto de vista, presenta las posibles lecciones de Hirschman a la economía del desarrollo actual, en general, y al método de experimentos sociales controlados, en particular. Albert Hirschman spent almost five years in Colombia were he said he had acquired a point of view. This point of view led him to formulate an original approach to development, far from grand theories and mere empiricism. What he called a strategy of development relied not only on linkages between productive sectors but mostly on skills, beliefs and expectations necessary, and many times unexploited, to make a proactive decision process possible. He was convinced individuals were more than recipients of development policies, and saw them as active agents of their own development processes. In this paper, after exploring this point of view, I present what I see as Hirschman's possible lessons for modern day development economics, in general, and randomized field experiments, in particular. Albert Hirschman a vécu près de cinq années en Colombie où, selon lui, il s’est fait un point de vue. Ce point de vue lui a permis de formuler une approche originale du développement, éloignée des grandes théories et du simple empirisme ; il l’a appelée une stratégie de développement et il y soulignait les échelons entre les secteurs productifs mais surtout, les talents, croyances, et expectatives nécessaires, et souvent inexploitées pour permettre un processus dynamique de prise de décisions. Il était convaincu de ce que les individus étaient davantage que de simples bénéficiaires des politiques de développement et les voyait comme des agents actifs de leurs propres processus. Cet article, après avoir exploré son point de vue, présente les possibles leçons d’Hirschman sur l’économie du développement actuel en général, et sur la méthode d’expérimentations sociales contrôlées, en particulier. Albert Hirschman morou quase cinco anos na Colômbia onde, segundo ele, adquiriu um ponto de vista. Este ponto de vista lhe permitiu formular uma aproximação original ao desenvolvimento, afastada das grandes teorias e do mero empirismo; o chamou de uma estratégia de desenvolvimento e, nele, ressaltava os encadeamentos entre setores produtivos mas, principalmente, as habilidades, crenças e expectativas necessárias, e muitas vezes inexploradas, para tornar possível um processo dinâmico de tomada de decisões. Estava convencido de que os indivíduos eram mais do que simples beneficiários das políticas de desenvolvimento e os via como agentes ativos dos seus próprios processos. Este artigo, depois de explorar o seu ponto de vista, apresenta as possíveis lições de Hirschman à economia do desenvolvimento atual, em geral, e ao método de experimentos sociais controlados, em particular.
B25|How pursuing wealth annihilates the arts of life. Interpretative essay of Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren from J. M. Keynes (1930)|Keynes’ rationale in Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren uses three pivotal themes: economic growth, man’s occupation and the love of money. Interpretations either focus on one specific theme, or disregard parts of the rationale. We consider the rationale as a whole and show that Keynes displays a criticism of capitalism, as it destroys the possibility to enjoy the affluence it has produced.
B25|Capital circulation and the explanation of economic change by Marschak, Frisch and Leontief|We analyze a series of macroeconometric models developed in the years of high theory by Marschak, Frisch and Leontief. These models share an explanation of growth, cycles and fluctuations (“economic change”), based on the analysis of the circulation of capital goods among producers. They disaggregate the macroeconomic production function so as to introduce multiple producers and capital goods. We show that these models offer two main explanations of economic change: one is based on the spread of technological change through the producers’ exchanges network; the other is based on the coordination problems between producers in the capital circulation process.
B25|Cycles «versus» growth in schumpeter A graphical interpretation of some core theoretical remarks|Schumpeter’s business cycle and growth theory encompasses two distinct types of superposition. The first one is well known from its graphical representation provided in Schumpeter’s Business Cycles [1939], namely the superposition of different waves or cycles of varying magnitude. There already is an element of combination of growth (Kondratiev) and cyclical movements such as “ordinary” business cycles (Juglar) here, although the connection between these waves of different order is not elaborated. Another point which is much more rarely discussed in the literature is Schumpeter’s strict technical separation between a growth trend and cyclical waves in real-world economies. It appears as if the general interpretation of Schumpeter’s statement here has also been influenced by the aforementioned graphical representation. The argument for the distinction between underlying growth on the one hand, and cyclical elements on the other, is put forward strongly in two papers [1927; 1935] especially, but lacks a graphical sketch of the core ideas by Schumpeter himself. The present paper aims at proposing just this by interpreting Schumpeter’s logic, thereby illustrating the model in more detail and hinting at a possible inaccuracy in the Business Cycles graph.
B25|Evolutionary economics and household behavior|This paper provides an introduction to the field of evolutionary economics with emphasis on the evolutionary theory of household behavior. It shows that the goal of evolutionary economics is to improve upon neoclassical economics by incorporating more realistic and empirically grounded behavioral assumptions and technological innovation and that the goal of the evolutionary theory of household behavior is to improve upon the neoclassical theory of household behavior by replacing the neoclassical assumption of selfish utility maximization with bounded rationality and satisficing and by incorporating the reaction of households to the introduction of new goods and services. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of loss aversion and self-interest versus altruism.
B25|Diversity in patterns of industry evolution: How an intrapreneurial regime contributed to the emergence of the service robot industry|How do new industries emerge? This paper aims to answer this question by analyzing the key actors in this process. We focus on the new industry of service robot. By using data of Japanese patent applications, we analyze the role of new firms and of collaborations. We find that the emergence of the industry is mainly triggered by established large firms, rather than by new firms. We further show that collaborations are at the core of new industry formation, but that they possess distinct properties. As the emergence of this new industry matches to the characteristics of Japan's institutional and knowledge regime we essentially argue that the notion of regimes with fewer start-ups being inefficient is erroneous. Our main conclusion is that industry emergence in intrapreneurial regimes seems to be distinctive from entrepreneurial regimes.
