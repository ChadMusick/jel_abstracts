I38|The Long-Term Effects of Cash Assistance|We investigate the long-term effects of cash assistance for beneficiaries and their children by following up with participants in the Seattle-Denver Income Maintenance Experiment. Treated families in this randomized experiment received thousands of dollars annually in extra government benefits for three or five years in the 1970s. We match experimental records to Social Security Administration data using a novel algorithm and find that treatment decreased adults' post-experimental annual earnings by $1,800 and increased disability benefit applications by 6.3 percentage points, possibly driven by occupational changes. In contrast, children in treated families experienced no significant effects on any main variable studied.
I38|How Does Inequality of Opportunities Affect the Distribution of Economic Wellbeing in Cameroon|The objective of this study is to measure the empirical effects of inequality of opportunities (IOP) on the distribution of economic wellbeing, which is captured by consumption per adult equivalent of households in Cameroon. To this effect, we apply both the parametric and non-parametric approaches to measure the magnitude of IOP, and Shapley’s method for its decomposition. The results show that IOP has an estimated effect of 25% in 2001 and 35% in 2007. Its main sources are the agro-ecological zone with a contribution of 45.59% in 2001 and 44% in 2007, the place of residence with a contribution of 31.22% in 2001 and 29.49% in 2007, and the distance relative to a good road with a contribution of 12.57% and 13.83%, respectively. We recommend that the government should reinforce national integration policies for local agricultural product markets. She should also extend in rural areas, vocational training that characterizes human capital in urban areas; and she should expand and improve road infrastructure, especially in rural areas.
I38|Making economic growth and well-being compatible: evidence from Japan|Whether economic growth improves the human lot is a matter of conditions. We focus on Japan, a country where reforms in the mid-1990s shifted the country from a pattern of rampant economic growth and stagnant well-being, to one of modest growth and increasing well-being. We discuss the policy reforms and analyze the changes that explain the increase in well-being. In particular, we assess whether the factors that explain the increase are consistent with those expected from the reforms. We apply Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition to World Values Survey data. Results show that well-being increased due to improved conditions for elderly people, people with children, and women, in other words, the primary groups targeted by the reforms. We conclude that adopting a system of social safety nets contributes to make economic growth compatible with increasing well-being over time.
I38|An Unconventional Way to Support Health Expenditure|Here, we propose a taxation scheme towards the implementation of universal health care under Beveridge model. In our proposed framework, a small amount of health tax is imposed on each and every non-cash transaction including transactions through debit and credit card, credit transfer, direct debit and cheque which is found to be solely sufficient to cover up entire health expenditure of a nation. We have shown empirically that a $1.84$ USD levy on every non-cash transaction is enough to meet up the annual health expenditure in the CEMEA (Central Europe, Middle East and Africa) region. For Latin America (LA), Emerging Asia (EA), Mature Asia and the Pacific (MAP) and North America (NA) this value is found to be $4.51$, $2.04$, $15.93$ and $21.07$ USD respectively. Moreover, as the proposed levy is collectable electronically without any human intervention, no additional logistic support is required for the implementation of the scheme.
I38|How Much Do We Save If We Move From Commercial to Social Insurance?|Commercial insurance system acts like a memoryless system in a way that the premiums paid by the policyholders in one accounting period will be of no avail to them during subsequent periods. Here, we argue that if the insurance scheme is implemented as a not-for-profit trust fund (social insurance) instead of a for-profit limited liability company (commercial insurance) then it will effectively and less expensively hedge against unforeseen losses. If the profit of the insurance company is retained instead of being distributed to the stockholders and there is no agency commission then after a certain number of years, all upcoming claims can be addressed from the interest income of the accumulated profit and the policyholders do not need to pay any premium afterwards. Here, we algebraically calculate the time period required to achieve such a perpetual insurance system as the policyholders after a certain period of time, do no longer need to pay any premium in order to get coverage from losses. In the next step, we empirically calculate the required time period to attain a perpetual zero premium insurance scheme for some 20 (twenty) general insurance companies incorporated in Bangladesh.
I38|Counter sanctions and well-being population of Russia: econometric analyses|This article examines the impact of counter-sanctions on the welfare of Russia’s population. We build a multiple-choice model and calculate the probability of being in a particular group of well-being based on the price (cost) of consumed counter-sanctions goods. The next step is the construction of a structural demand-supply system for estimating similar domestic good’s production elasticities. By knowing elasticity estimates we determine the price response to particular import closure. According to our estimates Russia's counter-sanctions led to an increase in poverty by 2.64 %.
I38|A supply-demand model of the size of public sector and Wagner's law|In this paper, we develop a supply-demand model for the public sector, measured as governments' tax revenues divided by GDP. We use a political equilibrium with a rule of majority. The model takes into account inefficiencies caused by taxes and includes costs associated with public goods provision to consumers. We show that the size of the public sector depends on the median voter's income, size of population, costs associated with taxpaying, and quality of institutions, which reflect costs of public goods provision. The estimates for the OECD countries (2000-2017), using dynamic panel model techniques, are in line with the theoretical predictions; however, they do not confirm Wagner's law. Our estimates suggest that the size of the government sector grows as income increases, but at a slower rate. We show that the quality of institutions matters: a more effective government raises the share of public sector; better regulations, which permit and promote private sector development, reduce it.
I38|Modern Democracy-Welfare State and Public Goods. A current consequence for Greece|People expect the state to create jobs and provide them with a social security net. Whatever its defects, whatever the virtues of the private sector, no structure other than the state can today provide citizens with the basic public goods. Under the present right-wing government of Nea Dimokratia in Greece, which is not particularly at odds with neoliberalism, a very active role of the state is not expected. Also is nor expected the introduction of a serious program of public investment and demand boosting to stimulate the national economy and enter into a virtuous circle of recovery. Greece, which has undergone the economic crisis with drastic cuts in its traditionally deficient social state, has to respond directly to the marked underinvestment in public goods (in key areas such as education, health, natural disasters, dealing with decent living conditions).The most important tool for inputting resources is the tax system.
I38|Social Investment, Employment Outcomes and Policy and Institutional Complementarities: A Comparative Analysis across 26 OECD countries|Social investment has become a widely debated topic in the comparative welfare state literature. To date, there are, however, only a couple of systematic comparative empirical analyses that focus on the employment outcomes associated with social investment. This study contributes to the social investment literature by empirically analysing the extent to which variation in employment outcomes across 26 OECD countries over the period 1990-2010 can be explained by effort on five social investment policies using time-series cross-sectional analyses. Apart from focusing on employment rates, we additionally explore associations with qualitative aspects of the employment outcomes relying on novel indicators. The analyses account for theoretically relevant confounding variables that were omitted in existing studies, notably labour market institutions. We find robust evidence for a positive association between effort on active labour market policies and employment rates. For other policies we obtain mixed results, dependent on the employment outcome being studied. Subsequently, we explore the role of policy and institutional complementarities in the assessment of the employment effects of social investment policies. We show how social investment policies interact and how their effect is moderated by effort on other policies. Additionally, our analysis shows that the complementarity of social investment policies varies across welfare state regimes. Finally, explorative analyses suggest that there are positive synergies between more and better jobs, which could in part be attributable to effort on social investment.
I38|Social Innovation and Social Policy: Empowerment of indigenous women the management of sustainable productive organizations in Vietnam and Mexico|The present proposal, as an area of opportunity, addresses the empowerment of indigenous women, as a mechanism that seeks to achieve the development of management skills of sustainable productive organizations in the short, medium and / or long term, create individual commitment to develop their own potentialities and to generate an answer for their social change and human development. This in support of the strategy to combat poverty and social exclusion, through the development of productive projects, through the management of sustainable productive organizations that seek to improve the living conditions and social position of indigenous women. The importance of the research is that it seeks to deepen the social exclusion processes present in indigenous women, in order to propose alternative solutions in order to overcome their condition of multidimensional poverty and that seek to strengthen the actions for empowerment in the development of their management capacities themselves that are elements that promote the development of sustainable productive organizations.
I38|Integrated Investment Appraisal of Water and Sanitation Projects: A Case of Senegal Water and Sanitation Project|This study is an appraisal of a rural water and sanitation project in Senegal. The Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) done in this study employs the Integrated Investment Appraisal Approach (IIA) which typically includes the financial, economic, stakeholder and risk analyses of the project. The impacts on all major stakeholders are quantified. Senegal’s water supply coverage was 75 percent in 2004. Of the 75 percent of the total population. 64 percent of the rural population is covered, and 90 percent of the urban population has access to water. In the case of sanitation, however, with only 33 percent coverage of the entire population of Senegal. To further improve the water and sanitation sector of Senegal, especially in the rural areas, the African Development Bank (AfDB) decided to intervene with a series of engagements. This study is the appraisal of the first phase of the African Development Bank’s (AfDB) engagement in the rural water and sanitation in Senegal. This initiative is directed towards ensuring that Senegal reaches its millennium development goals. The intervention is structured such that addresses the needs of both the water supply and sanitation infrastructure.
I38|Exploring inter-household transfers:An assessment using panel data from Turkey|This paper aims to contribute to the growing literature on the crowding out/in effect of public transfers on private ones by using two consecutive four-year SILC panel data from Turkey covering years 2008-2011 and 2012-2015. Over the period under study, the number of beneficiaries has increased and the welfare system has expanded to segments of society that were uncovered before. In order to quantify the interaction between public and private transfers, we estimate the effects of public transfers on the amount and likelihood of receiving private transfers by controlling various household characteristics and individual heterogeneity through panel structure. We find that public transfers at the individual level lead to crowding out effects, while public transfers targeting household has no significant neutralizing effect on private transfers. Comparing results from different periods, we observe that the effect of both altruistic motive and crowding-out are decreasing. Additionally, we broaden the definition of standard private transfers to include rent-free (subsidized) housing support. Our results reveal that broadly defined private transfers have a downstream character, are less altruistically motivated and produce less crowding-out effect compared to standard definition.
I38|Further evidence of the relationship between social transfers and income inequality in OECD countries|In this paper, we have revised the estimates of the effects of social transfers on income inequality. We have accounted for reverse causality using an instrumental variable derived via a theoretical model, which identifies the main driver of social transfers from the interaction between the electoral system and the coalition or party winning the election, and have estimated, in the OECD countries, that a 1\% increase in the share of social transfers reduces income inequality by one-half of a percentage point. This result appears to be robust to different components of expenditure, alternative model specifications and falsification tests. Only countries with a high corruption level appear to violate this empirical regularity. Our estimates show that bureaucratic inefficiencies caused by corruption are responsible for the lack of benefit of social transfers on economic inequality.
I38|In-kind transfers in Brazil: household consumption and welfare effects|Programa de AlimentaÃ§Ã£o dos Trabalhadores (PAT) creates tax incentives for firms to provide 20 million workers with in-kind transfers in Brazil. Economic theory supports they are distortive when compared to cash transfers but this is not clear when the latter are subject to payroll taxes. Using a propensity score analysis we find evidence that PAT increases poor households food consumption between 15.7% and 25.0% and deadweight loss associated with distortions reach US$63.1 (R$150.1) million. Overconsumption, however, may not be increasing workerâ€™s nutrition, as aimed by the program.
I38|Impact of Formal Climate Risk Transfer Mechanisms on Risk-Aversion: Empirical Evidence from Rural Ethiopia|This study examines the effect of smallholder farmers’ access to a formal climate risk transfer mechanism on their risk preferences. Survey and experimental data were collected from smallholder farmers that have access to weather index-based crop insurance (WICI) in Ethiopia. We use an endogenous switching (ESP) model to address self-selection and simultaneity bias. Results from the ESP model show that farmers who purchased WICI are less likely to be risk-averse compared with non-purchaser farmers. Similarly, non-purchasers would have attained a significant reduction in their risk-aversion if they had taken up the insurance product. We also find that WICI has a positive and statistically significant effect on farmers’ real-life risk-taking behavior as exemplified by mineral fertilizer use. The implication of our findings is that formal climate risk transfer mechanisms can positively influence households’ economic decisions and outcomes, through reducing risk aversion. Therefore, they can possibly contribute to poverty alleviation and economic development within agrarian economies that are exposed to recurrent and severe climate shocks.
I38|The Graduation approach for the reduction of extreme poverty: impact evaluation of Sembrando Oportunidades Familia por Familia in Paraguay|Rural poverty, a widespread problem for the Paraguayan government over the last decade –as well as for other economies in the region-, led to the implementation, in 2016 and 2017, of the “Sembrando Oportunidades Familia por Familia” pilot program, an initiative based on the graduation approach to reduce the incidence of extreme poverty in rural areas. Evaluating the intervention results is essential to understand the effectiveness of this approach in reducing poverty in the Paraguayan context, where the government is in charge of its implementation. For this evaluation, an instrumental-variable impact evaluation and a results evaluation were conducted, showing significant positive changes in the treated households’ productive capacity and savings behavior as well in their perception of wellbeing. These results are useful for the design of a program that can help to effectively overcome extreme poverty in this and other developing countries. This exercise is part of the set of evaluations carried out by the Platform for Evaluation and Learning of the Graduation Program in Latin America (www.plataformagraduacionla.info).
I38|Trayectorias de desarrollo de los jóvenes en zonas de posconflicto: diagnóstico y propuestas de política|El presente estudio, financiado por la Fundación Ford y el IDRC, realiza un diagnóstico acerca de las trayectorias de desarrollo de jóvenes residentes en las zonas más afectadas por el conflicto (municipios PDET), las principales barreras estructurales que afrontan y propone intervenciones concretas que permitan maximizar las probabilidades de la realización de sus proyectos de vida. La investigación se apoya en un análisis cuantitativo y cualitativo de múltiples fuentes de información incluida la implementación de una encuesta representativa y trabajo de campo cualitativo. El análisis deja cuatro mensajes principales: (1) Los jóvenes que habitan los municipios PDET se encuentran rezagados en comparación con aquellos que habitan otros municipios. (2) Los jóvenes que habitan los municipios PDET se encuentran en un alto grado de vulnerabilidad (educativa, de fecundidad y de salud emocional). (3) Al comparar dentro de estos municipios a jóvenes han sido víctimas directas, encontramos que el conflicto ha afectado de manera negativa sus trayectorias de vida observadas y sus aspiraciones. (4) Aunque el conflicto armado ha tenido un impacto negativo en los sueños y expectativas de los jóvenes, la mayoría mantiene sus sueños de continuar sus estudios y ejercer en diferentes profesiones.
I38|Cultivos de Coca y Violencia: El cambio después de iniciados los diálogos de paz|Con la salida de las FARC, el grupo guerrillero que monopolizó el mercado de la cocaína y el mayor causante de violencia en el país, se vuelve relevante estudiar el comportamiento del mercado de las drogas y los cambios en las dinámicas de violencia. El propósito de este trabajo es analizar el impacto que tiene ser un municipio cocalero en la violencia regional y ver cómo dicho impacto se comporta después de empezados los Diálogos para la Paz en 2012. Los modelos empleados demuestran que la presencia de cultivos de coca entre los años 2000 y 2017 incrementa en 11,1% el índice de violencia, y que el impacto es 2,35% más fuerte después de 2012.
I38|La pobreza en Quibdó: Norte de carencias|A pesar de que la pobreza en Colombia se redujo considerablemente en las últimas cuatro décadas, Quibdó es la ciudad capital donde se mantienen los peores indicadores. El presente documento utiliza información cartográfica y espacial para caracterizar la pobreza de las comunas e identificar posibles trampas espaciales de pobreza en la capital chocoana. Los resultados muestran que la zona norte tiene los indicadores de pobreza y violencia más altos en la ciudad. No obstante las grandes inversiones en los últimos cinco años, se registra una persistencia en las condiciones de pobreza en Quibdó. Por ejemplo, el indicador de necesidades básicas insatisfechas continúa por encima del observado en varias ciudades capitales cuatro décadas atrás. Finalmente, el documento propone una opción de inversiones en varios sectores que podría ayudar a cerrar las brechas de pobreza a 2030. **** ABSTRACT: Besides an overall poverty reduction in Colombia in the last four decades, Quibdó remains as the capital city with the worst indicators. This paper assesses poverty in the communes of the city using spatial information and geographical maps attempting to identify possible spatial poverty traps. The results indicate that the north of the city faces the highest indicators of poverty and violence. Although public investment has increased in the last 5 years, the conditions of poverty persist. For example, the rate of unsatisfied basic needs remain higher than other capital cities four decades ago. To end with, the paper prioritizes investment in several sectors in order to bridge the poverty gap in 2030.
I38|Análisis de la Pobreza y Condiciones de Vida en Valledupar|En Valledupar la pobreza ha incrementado durante los últimos cuatro años, pasando de 27% en 2014 a 33,4% para 2017. La distribución del ingreso también sufrió un revés importante durante el mismo periodo de tiempo, cuando el coeficiente de Gini pasó de 0,42 a 0,46, lo que indica que en 2017 hubo una mayor concentración de la riqueza que en 2014 (DANE, 2018). Este documento estudia los principales factores que han incidido en el aumento de la pobreza y propone una serie de inversiones para contrarrestar la desmejora en las condiciones de vida de los valduparences. Los resultados indican que el deterioro en el mercado laboral (empleo, salarios e informalidad) y la calidad de la educación son los factores que explican el incremento en pobreza. Las inversiones propuestas en temas de educación, vivienda y trabajo, que reducirían la pobreza y generarían un entorno propicio para el desarrollo económico de Valledupar, requieren de $230 millones de dólares para los próximos 10 años, lo que implicaría un esfuerzo fiscal adicional por generar $22,8 millones de dólares adicionales anuales hasta 2030. **** ABSTRACT: Poverty rate increased six percentage points in the past four years in Valledupar (DANE, 2018). The income distribution deteriorated as well during the same period of time. This document studies the main factors that explain the rise in poverty in Valledupar during 2014-2017 and proposes a series of investments that will help the city to overcome this drawback in their economic and social development. The results show that the worsening in labor market conditions (wages, employment and informality rate) due to negative shocks in coal prices and low quality of education are the factors driving the poor performance of Valledupar in terms of poverty reduction. We propose a set of investments in education, labor policy and housing that cost $230 millions of dollars for the next 10 years, in order to create structural conditions for development and lower poverty.
I38|Economía del desarrollo en Colombia. análisis de las coincidencias entre el paradigma propuesto por Rubén D. Utria y el enfoque de Amartya sen en las instituciones y libertades instrumentales|El desarrollo es un fenómeno complejo y dinámico que se refiere al proceso de transformación y evolución de las instituciones y los sistemas por medio de los cuales los individuos de un país se relacionan tanto con sus compatriotas como con las personas del resto del mundo. El enfoque económico predominante ha relegado a un segundo plano el análisis de variables importantes para el estudio del desarrollo, como lo son: el nivel de escolaridad media, la calidad del aire, el nivel de desigualdad, el nivel de confianza, el riesgo político de corrupción dentro de entidades gubernamentales, entre otros. El presente ensayo busca, apoyándose en los aportes teóricos de Amartya Sen y Ruben Darío Utria, analizar el desarrollo en Colombia desde una perspectiva más completa que la ofrecida por la teoría económica tradicional, la cual ha confundido el desarrollo con crecimiento y ha tratado de cuantificar el nivel de desarrollo de los países por medio del Producto Interno Bruto (PIB) per cápita. *** Development is a complex and dynamic phenomenon that refers to the process of transformation and evolution of institutions and systems through which individuals in a country relate both to their compatriots and people in the rest of the world. The dominant economic approach has relegated to the background the analysis of essential variables for the study of development, such as the average level of schooling, air quality, level of inequality, consumer confidence, the political risk of corruption within government entities, among others. The present essay seeks, based on the theoretical contributions of Amartya Sen and Ruben Darío Utria, aims to analyze development in Colombia from a more complete perspective than that offered by traditional economic theory, which has confused development with growth and has tried to quantify the level of development of countries through the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita.
I38|Using RCTs to Estimate Long-Run Impacts in Development Economics|We assess evidence from randomized control trials (RCTs) on long-run economic productivity and living standards in poor countries. We first document that several studies estimate large positive long-run impacts, but that relatively few existing RCTs have been evaluated over the long-run. We next present evidence from a systematic survey of existing RCTs, with a focus on cash transfer and child health programs, and show that a meaningful subset can realistically be evaluated for long-run effects. We discuss ways to bridge the gap between the burgeoning number of development RCTs and the limited number that have been followed up to date, including through new panel (longitudinal) data, improved participant tracking methods, alternative research designs, and access to administrative, remote sensing, and cell phone data. We conclude that the rise of development economics RCTs since roughly 2000 provides a novel opportunity to generate high-quality evidence on the long-run drivers of living standards.
I38|Universal Basic Income: Some Theoretical Aspects|In this paper, we review possible theoretical justifications of a universal basic income (UBI) scheme and also examine the determinants of its feasibility and scope. We begin by contrasting the unconditionality of UBI with the many conditions that typically accompany other welfare policies. Possible justifications for an unconditional UBI range from pure normative reasons to practical reasons due to the problem of screening beneficiaries and imperfections in institutions in charge of implementing tax and welfare policies. We also explore theoretically the conditions that determine the feasibility and size of a UBI. The broad picture that emerges from our review is that both normative and practical considerations make UBI easier to defend as a tool of poverty alleviation in poor economies than a tool to achieve social justice in rich ones.
I38|Demand and Welfare Analysis in Discrete Choice Models with Social Interactions|Many real-life settings of consumer-choice involve social interactions, causing targeted policies to have spillover-effects. This paper develops novel empirical tools for analyzing demand and welfare-effects of policy-interventions in binary choice settings with social interactions. Examples include subsidies for healthproduct adoption and vouchers for attending a high-achieving school. We establish the connection between econometrics of large games and Brock-Durlauf-type interaction models, under both I.I.D. and spatially correlated unobservables. We develop new convergence results for associated beliefs and estimates of preference-parameters under increasing-domain spatial asymptotics. Next, we show that even with fully parametric specifications and unique equilibrium, choice data, that are sufficient for counterfactual demand - prediction under interactions, are insufficient for welfare-calculations. This is because distinct underlying mechanisms producing the same interaction coefficient can imply different welfare-effects and deadweightloss from a policy-intervention. Standard index-restrictions imply distribution-free bounds on welfare. We illustrate our results using experimental data on mosquito-net adoption in rural Kenya.
I38|The Role of Electoral Incentives for Policy Innovation: Evidence from the U.S. Welfare Reform|We investigate whether the decision to experiment with novel policies is influenced by electoral incentives. Our empirical setting is the U.S. welfare reform in 1996, which marked the most dramatic shift in social policy since the New Deal. We find that electoral incentives matter: governors with strong electoral support are less likely to experiment with policies than governors with little electoral support. Yet, governors who cannot be reelected experiment more than governors striving for reelection. The importance of electoral incentives is robust to controlling for governor ideology, voter preferences for redistribution, the influence of the legislature, or for learning among states. A comparison of the role of governor ideology and electoral incentives reveals that both contribute about equally to policy experimentation.
I38|Partnering with Civil Society Organizations. The role of volunteers and not for profit organizations in the provision of welfare services|The purpose of this article is to make a distinctive contribution to the emergence of a new form of partnership between municipalities and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs). These collaborations are articulated at the border between the public and the society as well as between the formal and the informal economy. We revise the Esping-Andersen paradigm about the three main welfare regimes, where the welfare state, the family and the market are seen as three sources of managing social risks (Esping-Andersen, 1999), and we illustrate how the collaboration between CSOs and local administrations might improve the connection between the state and the citizens. In the perspective of the Third Sector Reform, which is actually underway in Italy, the hybridization of different forms of organizations could bring innovative solutions to the new real social risks of the communities. Specifically, this form of collaboration between local public administrations and the CSOs is part of the theme of volunteering and social citizenship, which advocates citizens’ empowerment in the production of social welfare and services of general interest. This area of collaboration is positioned between social rights and social obligations and provides a contribution that fosters the redistributive capacity of the public sphere through a participatory policy making.
I38|Households at risk of severe material deprivation: the cases of Italy and Spain|This paper documents how the phenomenon of severe material deprivation spread out in Italy and Spain in the recent past. These two European countries have experienced an increasing risk of poverty since the economic crisis, when more than 20% of households fell under the poverty line. Moreover, a considerable share of these households are also materially deprived. Stylized facts suggest that, despite pertaining to the same area, even before the onset of the Great Recession, they look different in relative terms, since they show heterogeneous severe material deprivation rates, below and above the EU average. The percentage for Spain is below the average, while the share for Italy is above the average and almost double that for Spain. The analysis reveals which households characteristics are associated to the risk of being severely materially deprived and whether the risk differs across Spain and Italy.
I38|Long-run consequences of informal elderly care and implications of public long-term care insurance|In this paper, I estimate a dynamic structural model of labor supply, retirement, and informal care supply, incorporating labor market frictions and the German tax and benefit system. I find that informal elderly care has adverse and persistent effects on labor market outcomes and therefore negatively affects lifetime earnings, future pension benefits, and individuals' well-being. These consequences of caregiving are heterogeneous and depend on age, previous earnings, and institutional regulations. Policy simulations suggest that, even though fiscally costly, public long-term care insurance can offset the personal costs of caregiving to a large extent - in particular for low-income individuals.
I38|Non-Take-Up of Means-Tested Social Benefits in Germany|This paper presents non-take-up rates of benefits from the German Income Support for Job Seekers scheme, called Unemployment Benefit II (Arbeitslosengeld II ). Eligibility to these benefits is simulated by applying a microsimulation model based on data from the Socio-economic Panel for the years 2005 to 2014. To ensure the quality of the results, feasible upper and lower bounds of nontake-up are shown for different simulation assumptions. By employing a binary choice framework, determinants of the decision (not) to take-up benefits are studied by means of a cross-sectional probit regression and a fixed effects linear probability model. The findings of this study indicate that rates of non-take-up are substantial and time-stable in the decade after the Hartz IV reform of 2005. On average, the share of households that do not claim benefits despite being eligible, amounts to 55.7 percent of all eligible households in that period. The issue of non-take-up has further important implications for the determination of the standard benefit rate. Since the legally defined calculation procedure does not account for non-take-up households in the reference group, the approximated consumption expenditure that is considered as necessary for a dignified life is calculated too low. The results of this study suggest that the legally defined monthly adult lump sum amount in the year 2014 would have been twelve euros higher if the issue of non-take-up was accounted for in the methodology. Based on the findings, the paper aims to give policy recommendations.
I38|Impacto de los Programas de Transferencias de Ingresos en la Calidad de la Vivienda Familiar: Evidencia para el Plan de Inclusión Social, Argentina|Se busca identificar si el Plan de Inclusión Social, un programa de transferencias de ingresos implementado en San Luis en 2003, tuvo efecto sobre el porcentaje de individuos que habitan viviendas de calidad inadecuada. Se construye un panel de datos a nivel aglomerados para el periodo 1996-2006, y se utiliza el Método del Control Sintético para identificar el impacto causal del programa sobre la variable de interés. Los resultados sugieren que el programa posibilitó una reducción de 1.85 puntos porcentuales en el porcentaje de individuos que habitan viviendas de calidad inadecuada, siendo este resultado robusto a diferentes pruebas de falsación.
I38|Solidarities towards disadvantaged households. The case of households headed by women|Private solidarities take various forms in Madagascar. Transfers between households are among of the most common. We analyze the transfer system, taking into account the gender of the head of household. We analyze the relationship between private transfers and public transfers. We use data from the Rural Observatory of Manakara located in Southeastern Madagascar. Our results show clear differences in the payment and receipt of transfers, by gender of the head of the household. Understanding such mechanisms is therefore essential for the development of targeted public policies.
I38|Housing Allowances Alone Cannot Prevent Rent Arrears|[eng] This article examines the extent to which housing allowances ensure continued access to affordable housing in France. According to data from the 2013 Housing Survey (enquête Logement, Insee), the most recent national housing survey available, one in four recipients of housing allowances experienced financial difficulties during a 24‑month period (compared to one in ten non‑recipients). The safety net role of housing allowances is studied through their effect in the event of job loss. The analysis is based on two points of discon­tinuity in terms of income: the eligibility threshold and the ceiling for the maximum rate of allowance. Probit regression results show that recipients of housing allowances are not significantly better protected. Housing allowances also fail to correct inherent disadvantages across households. In fact, the risk of difficulties in paying rent appears to be linked to a combination of factors: low income, unexpected events, certain family composition and places of residence increases the risk.
I38|Job loss, disability insurance and health expenditures|We analyse the causal effect of job loss on disability insurance enrolment on a five-year horizon and the implications on health expenditures. Using individual level administrative panel data from Hungary, we follow individuals displaced due to a mass lay-off and compare their labour force status to non-laid-off individuals with similar employment and health history, chosen with propensity score matching. According to our estimates, being laid off increases the transition probability to disability by 50% (or 1.4% points) in four years, and half of the excess transitions occur within the first year. We find a greater than average effect among older individuals and those who were in worse health before. Outpatient, inpatient and pharmaceutical expenditure increases 3.5-4 times when a laid-off individual takes up disability benefit, and decreases slightly afterwards, but does not reach the pre-disability levels. This health expenditure pattern resembles that observed around the diagnosis of previously undetected chronic diseases, such as diabetes or hypertension, but genuine health shocks may also be present. The increase in health expenditure corresponds to 20-25% of the additional disability payments in the medium term.
I38|In-work benefits across Europe|In-work benefits, often in the form of earned income tax credits (EITCs), have become increasingly popular over the last decades. Early versions of in-work benefits in the US, the UK and Ireland, primarily motivated as a poverty alleviation measure, have been followed by a large expansion of in-work benefits in other European countries, stressing employment goals rather than redistributive concerns. This review describes the in-work benefit schemes in a selection of countries across Europe and summarizes the evidence of these schemes. The selected countries are France, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Sweden.
I38|Multiple Births, Birth Quality and Maternal Labor Supply: Analysis of IVF Reform in Sweden|In this study we examine the passage of a reform to in-vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures in Sweden in 2003. Following publication of medical evidence showing that pregnancy success rates could be maintained using single rather than multiple embryo transfers, the single embryo transfer (SET) was mandated as the default IVF procedure. Using linked registry data for the period 1998-2007, we find that the SET reform was associated with a precipitous drop in the share of multiple births of 63%. This narrowed differences in health between IVF and non- IVF births by 53%, and differences in the labor market outcomes of mothers three years after birth by 85%. For first time mothers it also narrowed the gap in maternal health between IVF and non-IVF births by 36%. Our findings imply that more widespread adoption of SET could lead to massive gains, reducing hospitalization costs and the foregone income of mothers and improving the long-run socioeconomic outcomes of children. This is important given that the share of IVF facilitated births exceeds 3% in several industrialized countries and is on the rise.
I38|It’s a long walk: Lasting effects of maternity ward openings on labour market performance|Studies showing that large-scale public health interventions in early life have lasting economic consequences are still scarce and rarely disclose the mechanisms. Being born in a hospital versus having a traditional birth attendant at home represents the most common early life policy change worldwide. Knowing the consequences of this policy is also important given the ongoing enlargement of maternity hospitals. In 1931–1946, the Swedish state subsidized the opening of new maternity wards, which led to the gradual decline of home deliveries assisted by midwives. Maternity wards offered improved conditions for mothers and newborns, including hygiene, surgical proficiency and medications, and health monitoring. By applying a difference-in-differences approach and geocoding techniques to register-based individuallevel data on the total population, observed from birth until the age of 65, this paper explores the long-term economic effects of access to better health services at birth using the opening of maternity wards throughout the country as an early life quasi-experiment. The paper first finds that the reform substantially reduced neonatal mortality in the short term by 19.0–26.5 deaths per 1000. Capturing survivors of the affected cohorts at the ages of 47–64, it then shows sizable long-term effects of the introduction of maternity wards on labour income (2.4–4.7 per cent) and disability pensions (4.4–11.9 per cent). The effects run directly through better health and indirectly through higher levels of schooling. Small-scale local maternity wards yield a larger social rate of return than large-scale hospitals, stemming from the treatment of normal births.
I38|Labor market Integration of Refugees in Scandinavia after 2015|Sweden, Denmark and Norway have long been refugee destinations. All three countries received record numbers of asylum seekers between 2015 and 2016. This paper gives an overview and comparison on integration policies and labor market outcomes for refugees in the three countries after 2015. The paper also provides lessons from Scandinavia on fostering successful labor market integration for refugees.
I38|The Causal Impact of Removing Children from Abusive and Neglectful Homes|This paper measures impacts of removing children from families investigated for abuse or neglect. We use removal tendencies of child protection investigators as an instrument. We focus on young children investigated before age 6 and find that removal significantly increases test scores and reduces grade repetition for girls. There are no detectable impacts for boys. This pattern of results does not appear to be driven by heterogeneity in pre-removal characteristics, foster placements, or the type of schools attended after removal. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that development of abused and neglected girls is more responsive to home removal.
I38|The Labor Market Impacts of Universal and Permanent Cash Transfers: Evidence from the Alaska Permanent Fund|What are the effects of universal and permanent cash transfers on the labor market? Since 1982, all Alaskan residents have been entitled to a yearly cash dividend from the Alaska Permanent Fund. Using data from the Current Population Survey and a synthetic control method, we show that the dividend had no effect on employment, and increased part-time work by 1.8 percentage points (17 percent). Although theory and prior empirical research suggests that individual cash transfers decrease household labor supply, we interpret our results as evidence that general equilibrium effects of widespread and permanent transfers tend to offset this effect, at least on the extensive margin. Consistent with this story, we show suggestive evidence that tradable sectors experience employment reductions, while non-tradable sectors do not. Overall, our results suggest that a universal and permanent cash transfer does not significantly decrease aggregate employment.
I38|Improving Access and Quality in Early Childhood Development Programs: Experimental Evidence from The Gambia|This paper studies two experiments of early childhood development programs in The Gambia: one increasing access to services, and another improving service quality. In the first experiment, new community-based early childhood development (ECD) centers were introduced to randomly chosen villages that had no pre-existing structured ECD services. In the second experiment, a randomly assigned subset of existing ECD centers received intensive provider training. We find no evidence that either intervention improved average levels of child development. Exploratory analysis suggests that, in fact, the first experiment, which increased access to relatively low quality ECD services, led to declines in child development among children from less disadvantaged households. Evidence supports that these households may have been steered away from better quality early childhood settings in their homes.
I38|Effects of Maternal Work Incentives on Adolescent Social Behaviors|This study exploits variations in the timing of welfare reform implementation in the U.S. in the 1990s to identify plausibly causal effects of welfare reform on a range of social behaviors of the next generation as they transition to adulthood. We focus on behaviors that are important for socioeconomic and health trajectories, estimate effects by gender, and explore potentially mediating factors. Welfare reform had no favorable effects on any of the youth behaviors examined and led to decreased volunteering among girls, increases in skipping school, damaging property, and fighting among boys, and increases in smoking and drug use among both boys and girls, with larger effects for boys (e.g., ~6% for boys compared to 4% for girls for any substance use). Maternal employment, supervision, and child’s employment explain little of the effects. Overall, the intergenerational effects of welfare reform on adolescent behaviors were unfavorable, particularly for boys, and do not support longstanding arguments that limiting cash assistance leads to responsible behavior in the next generation. As such, the favorable effects of welfare reform for women may have come at a cost to the next generation, particularly to boys who have been falling behind girls in high school completion for decades.
I38|Free Education Helps Combat Child Labor? The Effect of a Free Compulsory Education Reform in Rural China|This paper evaluates the effect of a free compulsory education reform in rural China on the incidence of child labor. We exploit the cross-province variation in the roll-out of the reform and apply a difference-in-differences strategy to identify the causal effects of the reform. We find that the exposure to the free compulsory education significantly reduces the incidence of child labor for boys, but has no significant effect on the likelihood of child labor for girls. Specifically, one additional semester of free compulsory education decreases the incidence of child labor for boys by 8.3 percentage points. Moreover, the negative effect of the reform on the likelihood of child labor is stronger for boys from households with lower socioeconomic status. Finally, the free compulsory education reform may induce parents to reallocate resources towards boys within a household and thus may enlarge the gender gap in human capital investment.
I38|Parental Beliefs, Investments, and Child Development: Evidence from a Large-Scale Experiment|This paper experimentally estimates medium term impacts of a large-scale and low-cost parenting program targeting poor families in Chile. Households in 162 public health centers were randomly assigned to three groups: a control group, a second group that was offered eight weekly group parenting sessions, and a third group that was offered the same eight group sessions plus two sessions of guided interactions between parents and children focused on responsive play and dialogic reading. In spite of its short duration and intensity, three years after the end of the intervention, the receptive vocabulary and the socio-emotional development of children of families participating in either of the treatment arms improved (by 0.43 and 0.54 standard deviation, respectively) relative to children of nonparticipating families. The treatments also led to improvements in home environments and parenting behaviors of comparable magnitudes, which far outlasted the short duration of the intervention.
I38|Inquiry and Problem Based Pedagogy: Evidence from 10 Field Experiments|We analyze evidence from 10 at-scale field experiments in four countries on the effect of inquiry- and problem-based pedagogy (IPP) on students’ math and science test scores. IPP creates active problem solving opportunities in settings that derive meaning to the child. Students learn by collaboratively solving real life authentic problems, developing explanations, and communicating ideas. We find that IPP increased math test scores by 0.18 standard deviations and science test scores by 0.16 standard deviations after 7 months. Moreover, the results are robust across a wide set of geographic, socio-economic, and cultural, age/grade, and teacher background contexts.
I38|Better Together?: The Effects of Integrated Social Services for Women|We study the effects of integrated social services on the utilization and subjective life satisfaction of women in El Salvador. The Ciudad Mujer “one-stop shop” centers integrate health, legal, employment and other services into a single secure environment for women. These integrated services could boost demand by reducing the cost of access, improving quality and exploiting complementarities in service provision. Using a randomized encouragement design, 4,062 women in the vicinity of three centers were randomly encouraged to visit Ciudad Mujer (treatment group) or a local health clinic (placebo group), or they received no encouragement (control group). Approximately 1 year later, women who were exposed to Ciudad Mujer through encouragement visited the center an additional 2.1 times, increased the use of public services by 0.47s.d. and reported an improvement of 10% in life satisfaction relative to both the placebo and control groups.
I38|Redistributive Impacts of Fiscal Policies in Mexico: Corrections for Top Income Measurement Problems|This study assesses the redistributive impacts of fiscal instruments in a 2014 Mexican household budget survey (ENIGH) correcting for potential top-income measurement problems. We use two correction methods based on within-survey information to re-estimate the redistributive impacts of contributory pensions and cash-like transfers; direct taxes; indirect taxes and subsidies; and in-kind transfers. The two methods are: survey-sample reweighting for households’ nonresponse probability, and replacing of top incomes using synthetic values from the Pareto distribution. This replacing is implemented either on all core income concepts, or on net market income from which it is passed onto other incomes through fiscal rules. These corrections yield higher inequality as measured by the Gini (0–9 pc.pt. increase) and the top 1% and 10% income shares (0–5, and 1–5 pc.pt. increases), consistently between the reweighting and replacing methods, and consistently across all income concepts. Moving from pre-fiscal market income to post-fiscal final income, corrections for nonresponse fall slightly, while corrections for mismeasurement rise. Taxable income is subject to the highest inequality, which further undergoes the highest upward correction for top income problems, potentially consistent with evidence of earnings misreporting among the rich. Conversely, nontaxable income has a strong equalizing impact of 3.3–4.5 points of the Gini further accentuated under the top-income corrections. The corrections confirm the inequality-neutral impact of pensions in Mexico, and equalizing impacts of transfers, direct taxes, indirect taxes and subsidies, and in-kind transfers. In-kind transfers, cash-like transfers and direct taxes have the strongest equalizing impacts of 4.7–5.7, 1.6–1.9, and 1.2–2.2 points of the Gini, respectively. Indirect taxes and subsidies are weakly equalizing, by 0.4-0.6 points. Finally, top-income measurement challenges retain their magnitude across the 2010, 2012 and 2014 ENIGH, but household nonresponse becomes more positively selected over time, causing more serious biases.
I38|The evolution of tax implicit value judgements, redistribution and income inequality in the UK: 1968 to 2015|An issue of interest in the literature that explores the drivers of inequality is the distributional bearing of tax and transfer policy, where an important theme concerns changes in the relative treatment of alternative population subgroups. We develop an empirical approach for quantifying the value judgements implicit in the relative treatment of demographic subgroups by a tax and transfer system. We apply this approach to UK data reported at annual intervals between 1968 and 2015, documenting remarkable improvements in tax and transfer treatment enjoyed by some population subgroups – particularly families with children and age pensioners – relative to the wider population. We show that accounting for the changing value judgements implicit in tax and transfer policy provides a fresh perspective on the evolution of income inequality and redistribution; one that departs from the prevailing view that UK inequality stopped rising from the early 1990s.
I38|Accounting for the distributional effects of the 2007-2008 crisis and the Economic Adjustment Program in Portugal|This paper develops a new method to model the household disposable income distribution and decompose changes in this distribution (or functionals such as inequality measures) over time. It integrates both a micro-econometric and microsimulation approaches, combining a flexible parametric modelling of the distribution of market income with the EUROMOD microsimulation model to simulate the value of taxes and benefits. The method allows for the quantification of the contributions of four main factors to changes in the disposable income distribution between any two years: (i) labour market structure; (ii) returns; (iii) demographic composition; and (iv) tax-benefit system. We apply this new framework to the study of changes in the income distribution in Portugal between 2007 and 2013, accounting for the distributional effects of the 2007-2008 crisis and aftermath policies, in particular the Economic Adjustment Program (EAP). Results show that these effects were substantial and reflected markedly different developments over two periods: 2007-2009, when stimulus packages determined important income gains for the bottom of the distribution and a decrease in income inequality; 2010-2013, when the crisis and austerity measures took a toll on the incomes of Portuguese households, particularly those at the bottom and top of the distribution, leading to an increase in income inequality.
I38|Evaluation of Language Training Programs in Luxembourg using Principal Stratification|In a world increasingly globalized, multiple language skills can create more employment opportunities. Several countries include language training programs in active labor market programs for the unemployed. We analyze the effects of a language training program on the re-employment probability and hourly wages of the unemployed simultaneously, using highquality administrative data from Luxembourg. We address selection into training by exploiting the rich administrative information available, and account for the complication that wages are “truncated” by unemployment by adopting a principal stratification framework. Estimation is undertaken with a mixture model likelihood-based approach. To improve inference, we use the individual’s hours worked as a secondary outcome and a stochastic dominance assumption. These two features considerably ameliorate the multimodality problem commonly encountered in mixture models. We also conduct sensitivity analysis to assess the unconfoundedness assumption employed. Our results strongly suggest a positive effect (of up to 12.7 percent) of the language training programs on the re-employment probability, but no effects on wages for those who are observed employed regardless of training participation. It appears that, in the context of an open and multilingual economy, language training improve employability but the language skills acquired are not sufficiently rewarded to be reflected in higher wages.
I38|Ireland's peculiar microfinance revolution, c. 1836-1845|In the decade before the famine, Ireland experienced a boom in Microfinance Institutions (MFIs). This paper analyses the motivations of MFI proponents and practitioners, and finds evidence linking the boom in MFIs with the introduction of the poor law in 1838. Many contemporary writers saw microfinance as a complex tax avoidance/reduction scheme that could lessen the burden on rate payers by helping the poor help themselves. The link between MFIs and the poor law is confirmed by an econometric analysis of MFIs at the level of the poor law union.
I38|Unravelling Hidden Inequities in a Universal Public Long-Term Care System|We investigate whether publicly subsidized long-term care (LTC) is allocated according to needs, independently from income, using administrative data from all applicants for public LTC in Catalonia, from 2011 to 2014. We measure the level of horizontal inequity in subsidies to compensate informal care costs, formal home care, and institutional care using objective detailed information on needs. Our findings suggest that the system is inequitable; cash transfers are distributed among the financially better-off, while the use of nursing homes is concentrated among the worse-off. Additionally, we assess the inequity in the form of provision (voucher versus in- kind) and its implications for the equity in the time to access. Our results show that while in-kind provision is concentrated among the worse-off, the better-off are more likely to receive a voucher to (partly) subsidize LTC expenses. However, this duality does not imply inequity in the time to access a nursing home.
I38|The Old-Age Security Motive for Fertility: Evidence from the Extension of Social Pensions in Namibia|The old-age security motive for fertility postulates that people's needs for old-age support raise the demand for children. We test this widespread idea using the extension of social pensions in Namibia during the nineties. The reform eliminated inequalities in pension coverage and benefit across regions and ethnic groups. Combining differences in pre-reform pensions and dfferences in exposure across cohorts, we show that pensions substantially reduce fertility, especially in late reproductive life. This article provides the first quasi-experimental quantification of the old-age security motive. The results suggest that improving social protection for the elderly could go a long way in fostering fertility decline in Sub-Saharan Africa.
I38|Measuring the Distributional Impact of Taxation and Public Spending: The Practice of Fiscal Incidence Analysis|Taxation and public spending are key policy levers the state has in its power to change the distribution of income. One of the most commonly used methods to measure the distributional impact of a country’s taxes and public spending is fiscal incidence analysis. Rooted in the field of Public Finance, fiscal incidence analysis is the method utilized to allocate taxes and public spending to households so that one can compare incomes before taxes and transfers with incomes after them. Standard fiscal incidence analysis just looks at what is paid and what is received without assessing the behavioral responses that taxes and public spending may trigger on individuals or households. This is often referred to as the “accounting approach.” Although the theory is quite straightforward, its application can be fraught with complications. The salient ones are discussed here. While ignoring behavioral responses and general equilibrium effects is a limitation of the accounting approach, the effects calculated with this method are considered a reasonable approximation of the short-run welfare impact. Fiscal incidence analysis, however, can be designed to include behavioral responses as well as general equilibrium and inter-temporal effects. This article focuses on the implementation of fiscal incidence analysis using the accounting approach.
I38|The Market Value of Public Education - A Comparison of Three Valuation Methods|Publicly provided education is both an important public expenditure and a relevant in-kind transfer, often to the poorest households. This paper compares three methods to value education services and their distributive impact. The methods are: (i) The first method is cost of provision, according to which education is worth what it costs the state to provide it; (ii) The second method is to value educational services using the labor market as the measure of their worth; (iii) The third is to match private educational expenditures, paid for by students or their parents, with equivalent public education services, and then value the latter according to the price of the former. The results from all three approaches do not fall far from each other. The imputed income from publicly provided education reduces inequality by between 3 and 4 Gini points and increases incomes by about 6%. My conclusion is that the value of public education in Brazil is close to 6% of household income and it is quite distributive, whatever the valuation method used.
I38|Leaving No One Behind: Can Tax-Funded Transfer Programs Provide Income Floors in Sub-Saharan Africa?|"We use results from nine different country-based Commitment to Equity (CEQ) Assessments in sub-Saharan Africa to demonstrate the welfare impact in low- and middle-income countries of policy scenarios which (a) redirect current subsidy expenditures to direct cash transfer programs; (b) establish income floors to be funded from both current subsidy expenditure as well as from additional revenues generated through current direct and indirect tax instruments; and (c) target direct cash transfer spending to poor populations or to general populations (a ""universal"" transfer). Results indicate that at baseline the existing combination of taxes and transfers increases post-fiscal poverty in all countries but upper middle-income Namibia and South Africa. This result - which we call fiscal impoverishment - is most often due to the fact that the poor pay consumption taxes but receive very little in cash transfers and an exceedingly small share of total subsidies. Reallocating expenditures on general price subsidies to targeted transfers would yield better poverty outcomes in most countries, but a portion of the not-so-poor poor would then receive no transfers at all. Results also show that setting income floors equivalent to international poverty lines and funding the necessary transfers with direct taxes from individuals is often not feasible for two reasons: there is extreme reranking of individuals (from preto post-fiscal income) and negative post-fiscal incomes for tax-paying individuals and the tax burden on the nonpoor would be significantly higher. Scenarios establishing income floors are more likely to be feasible when the required additional funding is financed by a proportional increase in indirect taxes"
I38|Respuestas en los ingresos frente a un programa de transferencias monetarias: evidencia de un notch a partir de registros administrativos de Uruguay|This work examines the discontinuity created by the income test of the main cash transfer program of Uruguay, to derive the responses of lower-incomes households to the incentives of the policy. Program administrative microdata matched with social security records and a novel methodology for the analysis of behavioral responses to transfers has allowed us to complement the evidence of the effects of this type of program on the labor market, analyzing the impacts in the intensive margin. Our main results from bunching estimations show that there was no significant effect on reported formal income, or when considering different characteristics of the household and the employment of its members. Since the low salience of the eligibility threshold could be a potential explanation for the lack of responses, we implemented an event study analysis of the beneficiaries who experienced a temporary suspension or exclusion from the program. In this case, there is evidence of significant responses from this subgroup of households, which suggests that the salience of the program design could explain part of the responses in the intensive margin. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, explores the intensive margin responses, an aspect less studied in the literature on the effects of CCT programs. Secondly, it focuses on a notch in budget constraint to derive the responses, a discontinuity less employed in the growing literature on bunching. Furthermore, the results of this paper have implications for the design of public policies, showing the importance of the degree of salience to explain the effects of this type of program.
I38|Are not any silver in the cloud? Subjective well-being among deprived young people|Young people suffer higher levels of deprivation than older people, mainly in developing countries. They not only deal with social obstacles to getting a job or to staying in the education system, but they can also erect barriers which prevent them from achieving desirable trajectories in the future. We analyze the effect of a Social Intermediation Program (JeR) on Subjective Well-being and present how SWB is constructed and the different channels of its change. We develop a simple theoretical model to link subjective well- being with the individual and reference wealth, the efort and the level of aspirations, and how they can be affected by JeR. To overcome selection issues and to be able to identify causal effects, we estimate the model through instrumental variables using distance in meters between the individual house and the closest JeR center. We nd a negative impact of JeR on Subjective Well-being and the main channel of this change is through Subjective Relative Wealth, i.e., the relation between the individual and the reference wealth, but there is no effect through the other theoretical channels: the levels of effort or aspirations. These results are heterogeneous by psychological features; they are higher among those with low aspiration levels and external locus of control. We also find JeR has a positive effect on the dispersion of SWB, pushing down those on the left part of the distribution and maintaining SWR as the main channel. Finally, we disentangle the main program characteristics that might generate this effect giving relevant information for the policymakers.
I38|Transfer Program Enforcement and Children's Time Allocation|We estimate the enforcement level of conditionalities of two transfer programs and how they affect teenagers' time use, in particular, their school attendance, labor supply, and home production. We develop a structural discrete choice model in which young individuals and their parents decide how to allocate their time, including the decision of whether to attend school. They also choose how many hours to work in the market, time in home production, and leisure. To estimate the model, we use household panel data which combines administrative records and surveys covering the period of 2005-2012 in Uruguay, during which two consecutive CCT programs were introduced with different designs. Our model captures not only the share of individuals who are in fact in studies, working and those who neither study nor work, but also the share and the number of hours in market work and home production, and the GPA distribution. The policy experiments performed indicate that school attendance can be increased by raising thelevel of enforcement and by changing who in the household receives the cash transfer from the parents to the teenagers
I38|Is India’s Employment Guarantee Program Successfully Challenging Her Historical Inequalities?|By providing 100 days of guaranteed employment to every rural household, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) can challenge the hegemony of the landed elite as major employers in the Indian countryside and raise market wages which have long been depressed. This paper shows that the impact of NREGA is conditioned and complicated by historical inequalities in agricultural landownership which have persisted since the colonial period. I find that in the lean season of agriculture, the program is highly successful in raising wages and generating more public employment in districts that were not characterized by historically high levels of socio-economic inequality. In these districts, the increase in public employment crowds-out labor primarily from domestic work, reflected in increased women’s participation in the program. However, high inequality in landownership adversely impacts the bargaining power of workers and the enforcement of their entitlements under NREGA. This is most evident when I examine the impact of NREGA on rural wages. I find that in districts where land is concentrated in the hands of relatively few large landowners, private agricultural wages declined despite NREGA, whereas they remain largely unchanged in districts that have more equitable land distribution. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that NREGA has not become a credible alternative to private employment in regions with high land inequality.
I38|Household Financial Decisions After the 2008 Chilean Pension Reform|We evaluate the effect of the 2008 Chilean pension reform, that introduced a basic pension to the poorest part of the elder population, in terms of decisions regarding debts and assets. We apply a difference-in-difference estimation method to longitudinal survey data representative of the Chilean population. Our evidence suggests that those who started receiving basic pension increased their holding and amount of debt. It may be that some people used the basic pension as a collateral for acquiring more debt, rather than using it as a way to finance new investments. The increase in debt positions is proportionally higher when compared to the variation in asset positions. We interpret this measure as an indicator of debt sustainability. Moreover, debt ratio increases significantly more for women, who may be particularly exposed to financial shocks. This result raises concern on the potential financial vulnerability of the population that was targeted by the reform.
I38|Co-production as an interpretative framework in the creation of value in public services|Co-production is an important strand of the current public services reform agenda across the world. Several authors and institutions argued that co-production concept has the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public services becoming a key response to the need for the reform of public services. Moreover co-production can be a way to co-create public value. Nevertheless the growing body of literature, coproduction continues to be a multifaceted and not strongly definite concept with some shortcomings. One of the main gap regards the lack of studies that address the outcomes of the co-production process. There is a dominance of studies dedicated at the identification of influential factors or at the conceptualization of different co-production types showing that most academics aimed their study at the co-creation/co-production process rather than their outcomes. This paper aims at filling this gap by proposing a methodological pathway, composed by 6 steps, to evaluate the impact of co-production on outcomes. The six step are presented and, then mastered trough an application to a concrete case. The application regard the separate collection service. We tested the presence of a relation between the propensity of municipalities toward coproduction and a measure of effectiveness. Results showed Municipalities with an higher attitude to enhance citizen’s co-production reaching better recycling achievements.
I38|Estimating and Decomposing Conditional Average Treatment Effects: The Smoking Ban in England|We develop a practical method for estimating and decomposing conditional average treatment effects using locally-weighted regressions. We illustrate with an application to the smoking ban in England using a regression discontinuity design, based on Health Survey for England data. We estimate average treatment effects conditional on socioeconomic status and decompose these effects by smoking location. Results show, the ban had no effect on the level of active smoking, but significantly reduced average exposure to second-hand smoke among non-smokers by 1.38 hours per week. Our method reveals a complex relationship between socioeconomic status and the effect on passive smoking. Decomposition analysis shows that these effects stem primarily from exposure reductions in pubs, but also from workplace exposure reductions for high socioeconomic status individuals.
I38|Testing preferences for basic income|Inspired by Fröhlich and Oppenheimer (1990), an experimental survey in the lab was designed to find out if preferences for three different redistribution schemes differ under a veil of ignorance. The three schemes are a stylized version of the status quo German welfare state (A), a control scheme without income taxation and redistribution (B) and one in which a flat tax-financed basic income is paid to all (C). Furthermore, the study investigates whether the introduction of a basic income induces a decrease in the time allocation to paid and unpaid work. The results point to no significant difference in allocated working hours between A and C. Concerning preferences, access to information on implications of schemes and self-interest played a central role in their definition.
I38|Ireland’s Peculiar Microfinance Revolution, c. 1836-1845|In the decade before the famine, Ireland experienced a boom in Microfinance Institutions (MFIs). This paper analyses the motivations of MFI proponents and practitioners, and finds evidence linking the boom in MFIs with the introduction of the poor law in 1838. Many contemporary writers saw microfinance as a complex tax avoidance/reduction scheme that could lessen the burden on rate payers by helping the poor help themselves. The link between MFIs and the poor law is confirmed by an econometric analysis of MFIs at the level of the poor law union.
I38|Corruption in Tax and Taxing the Corruption|Most of the countries in the world face corruption and struggling against to it in many aspects. Due to various loopholes and institutional inefficiencies it continues to be pressing issues which affects public in various dimensions. The long existence of corruption around the world made an illusion to the policy makers and public as it is unavoidable and adjustable. This creates an intuition to esquire into what makes the corruption market successful all over the world for many centuries and what Economic theory is operate behind it. In this paper an inquiry is made into how the corruption market works effectively without any intervention. It also explore the possibility of the Ronald Coase theory’s to control the corruption and justifies what intervention is needed to achieve optimal amount of corruption. It concludes that to achieve the optimal amount of corruption in the society all farms of corruptions has to be internalized by introducing a permit and tax for corruption.
I38|Improving Access and Quality in Early Childhood Development Programs: Experimental Evidence from the Gambia|This paper studies two experiments of early childhood development programs in The Gambia: one increasing access to services, and another improving service quality. In the first experiment, new community-based early childhood development (ECD) centers were introduced to randomly chosen villages that had no pre-existing structured ECD services. In the second experiment, a randomly assigned subset of existing ECD centers received intensive provider training. We find no evidence that either intervention improved average levels of child development. Exploratory analysis suggests that, in fact, the first experiment, which increased access to relatively low quality ECD services, led to declines in child development among children from less disadvantaged households. Evidence supports that these households may have been steered away from better quality early childhood settings in their homes.
I38|Maternal Health, Children Education and Women Empowerment: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from India|The empirical evidence on the inter-generational effects of maternal health interventions is inconclusive, particularly the impact on cognitive ability of children. In this paper, we study one such popular policy from India, viz, the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) which is a agship health and safe motherhood program. We exploit plausible exogenous variation in exposure to the program generated by the institutional features of the implementation, in a cross-sectional difference-in-difference framework to find evidence of reduction in academic test scores of children whose parents remained unexposed to the policy intervention. We also find that such children spend less time on homework during the week, were less likely to attend and enjoy school. We also find negative effects on women empowerment measures for the unexposed women. The results suggest that the JSY led to increase in women empowerment and improved cognitive outcomes for children.
I38|What Is the Value Added by Using Causal Machine Learning Methods in a Welfare Experiment Evaluation?|Recent studies have proposed causal machine learning (CML) methods to estimate conditional average treatment effects (CATEs). In this study, I investigate whether CML methods add value compared to conventional CATE estimators by re-evaluating Connecticut's Jobs First welfare experiment. This experiment entails a mix of positive and negative work incentives. Previous studies show that it is hard to tackle the effect heterogeneity of Jobs First by means of CATEs. I report evidence that CML methods can provide support for the theoretical labor supply predictions. Furthermore, I document reasons why some conventional CATE estimators fail and discuss the limitations of CML methods.

We apply this approach to UK data reported at annual intervals between 1968 and 2015, documenting remarkable improvements in tax and transfer treatment enjoyed by some population subgroups - particularly families with children and age pensioners - relative to the wider population. We show that accounting for the changing value judgements implicit in tax and transfer policy provides a fresh perspective on the evolution of income inequality and redistribution; one that departs from the prevailing view that UK inequality stopped rising from the early 1990s.
I38|The Urgent Need for an Economics of “Hategoatism”|The word “scapegoat” is defined as “a person made to bear the blame for others,” and similarly, “scapegoatism” refers to “the act or practice of assigning blame or failure to another, as to deflect attention or responsibility away from oneself” (Collins English Dictionary and Dictionary.com, respectively.) While these definitions do not mention economics specifically, in most cases the blame on the scapegoat is economic in nature. Scapegoatism also provides a convenient, though extremely inferior, substitute for valid analyses of economic problems. Scapegoatism, however, has a partner, dehumanization, which is the process of demonizing certain people as less than human and unworthy of humane treatment. Scapegoatism is not only accompanied by dehumanization, but it is often motivated by it. Thus, “scapegoatism” is a euphemism and it is understudied as a result, because there is no single term of art that combines scapegoatism and dehumanization. This paper offers a solution to this semantic dilemma by proposing the new term, “HATEGOATISM,” for the simultaneous existence of scapegoatism and dehumanization. Only one subfield of economics regularly embraces hategoatism, which is Libertarianism (where the “HATEGOAT” is government workers). Economists must lead by example by combating hategoatism, and that requires cleaning their own house first.
I38|Labor market policy and subjective well-being during the Great Recession|Average subjective well-being decreased in Europe during the Great Recession, primarily among people with less than a college education and people younger than retirement age. However, some countries fared better than others depending on their labor market policies. More generous unemployment support, which provided income replacement or programs to assist unemployed workers find jobs, mitigated the negative effects for most of the population, although not youth. In contrast, stricter employment protection legislation exacerbated the negative effects. We present further evidence that suggests the exacerbating effects of employment protection legislation are due to greater rigidities in the labor market, which in turn affect perceived future job prospects. Our analysis is based on two-stage least squares regressions using individual subjective wellbeing data obtained from Eurobarometer surveys and variation in labor market policy across 23 European countries.
I38|The quasi-market of employment services in Italy|This paper aims to study the shortcomings and merits of the first experiment of quasi-market in the provision of employment services: the Lombardy DUL (Dote Unica Lavoro). This system, which has inspired the 2015 national reform within the Jobs Act, has reactivated and revitalized the sector by providing important job opportunities to jobless workers. The system has the typical problems of quasi-markets in the provision of public services (lion's share of private organizations; cherry picking; gaming). However, different expedients are devised in the program to minimize these shortcomings. The empirical analysis suggest that such phenomena if existent are at a physiological level. Analysis of the determinants of completing successfully the program provides non-trivial results as to, among others, the role organizations of different ownership type and of services provided.
I38|Impact of welfare sanctions on employment and benefit receipt: Considering top-up benefits and indirect sanctions|This comprehensive study on UB-II-sanctions in Germany, applying PSM, presents the ex-post effects of welfare sanctions on several employment states for diverse (sub-)groups of employable welfare recipients. Besides unemployed, we also regard employed, and indirectly affected household members. The monthly updated ATT show the development of the sanction effect over two years. We find sanction effects as highly volatile over time and strongly dependent on individual factors and on circumstances like the timing of the sanction. In total, we suppose tendentially positive effects on the probabilities to enter employment and to exit welfare, at least in the short run. The positive effects tend to work stronger in the short run, and the negative effects tend to work stronger in the medium and long run. Hence, the shorter the time horizons of studies on welfare sanctions are, the more the positive effects are overrated systematically. Especially the frequently occurring cases with strongly negative slopes of cumulated ATT indicate that the early positive effects, mainly driven by people with good labor market perspectives, are at the cost of people with strongly detrimental sanction effects, even in the long run.
I38|Impact of welfare sanctions on the quality of subsequent employment: Wages, incomes, and employment stability|"This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of sanction effects on post-welfare employment quality in Europe using the outcome variables daily wage, yearly income, and covering job stability with the durations of three employment states: employed, unemployed, and supplementary benefit receipt. Applying PSM, we estimate the treatment effects (ATT) of UB-II-sanctions in Germany based on a rich administrative data set. Novelties of this study are the analysis of postwelfare sanction effects also for employed welfare recipients (""Aufstocker"") and for indirectly affected employable household members. Our analyses reveal highly significant and strongly negative effects of benefit sanctions on the quality of post-welfare employment in the short and long run. In terms of income and employment stability we find a catch-up process which is by far not strong enough to compensate the loss within two years. For employed welfare recipients the negative effects on income and job stability even exceed the effects for unemployed. Particularly striking are the remarkably strong and highly significant negative effects on indirectly affected unemployed household members."
I38|Long-run consequences of informal elderly care and implications of public long-term care insurance|In this paper, I estimate a dynamic structural model of labor supply, retirement, and informal care supply, incorporating labor market frictions and the German tax and benefit system. I find that informal elderly care has adverse and persistent effects on labor market outcomes and therefore negatively affects lifetime earnings, future pension benefits, and individuals'well-being. These consequences of caregiving are heterogeneous and depend on age, previous earnings, and institutional regulations. Policy simulations suggest that, even though fiscally costly, public long-term care insurance can offset the personal costs of caregiving to a large extent - in particular for low-income individuals.
I38|Delivering Parenting Interventions through Health Services in the Caribbean|Integrating early childhood interventions with health and nutrition services has been recommended, however there is limited information on interventions that are effective and feasible for delivery through health services. In this trial we developed and evaluated a parenting program that could be integrated into primary health center visits.
I38|Cash, Conditions and Child Development: Experimental Evidence from a Cash Transfer in Honduras|We explore the effects of a randomly assigned conditional cash transfer in Honduras (Bono 10000) on early childhood development. We find significant impacts on cognitive development in children 0-60 months, with an average effect size of 0.13 SD. We show differential impacts by type of transfer: 0-5-year-old children from families receiving the “health” transfer, which targeted families with 0-5-year-old children only, benefited significantly from the program, whereas 0-5 year-olds in families receiving the “education” transfer, which targeted 6-18 year-olds, perceived no benefit. In comparison with other programs, the effect of this impact is sizeable (0.34 SD on average). Although the overall program appears to have slightly changed some behaviors that might affect children (i.e. decreased probability of maternal employment, and increased maternal self-esteem), we did not find heterogenous impacts of the Bono across these variables. Results are explained mainly by differences in conditions: while the “education” component imposed conditions only on children of schooling age, the “health” transfer required regular health checkups of 0-5 year old children. The “health” transfer families were more likely to attend health checkups, which may have induced behavior changes that improved children’s health and cognitive development, including purchasing more nutritious food. These results imply that cash without well-targeted conditions attached, might not be as effective for the development of young children.
I38|Measuring the Quality of the Home Environment of Young Children in Uruguay: Socioeconomic Gradients in the Home Inventory|Uruguay is one of very few countries in Latin America that has a nationally representative, longitudinal survey of early childhood development. In 2015–2016, during the second wave of the survey, an observational module on the home environment was administered at scale for the first time. The module included items from two subscales (responsiveness and acceptance) of a widely used instrument that measures the quality of the physical and emotional environment: the HOME inventory. We find that the set of items administered from the HOME has very good concurrent validity with child development and maternal personality traits, as well as with other relevant socioeconomic variables. In line with the literature, our analysis shows that children from the most vulnerable families are exposed to a lower-quality home environment—that is, less responsive and more punitive. Interestingly, Uruguayan children are exposed to better environments as compared to children in predominantly rural samples from the Latin America and Caribbean region; however, they present comparable environments when compared to similar samples from countries such as Brazil and Chile.
I38|An Empirical Total Survey Error Decomposition Using Data Combination|Survey error is known to be pervasive and to bias even simple, but important estimates of means, rates, and totals, such as poverty statistics and the unemployment rate. To summarize and analyze the extent, sources, and consequences of survey error, we define empirical counterparts of key components of the Total Survey Error Framework that can be estimated using data combination. Specifically, we estimate total survey error and decompose it into three high level sources of error: representation error, item non-response error and measurement error. We further decompose these sources into lower level sources such as a failure to report a positive amount and errors in amounts conditional on reporting a positive value. For error in dollars paid by two large government transfer programs, we use administrative records on the universe of program payments in New York State linked to three major household surveys to estimate the error components we define. We find that total survey error is large and varies in its size and composition, but measurement error is always by far the largest source of error. Our application shows that data combination makes it possible to routinely measure total survey error and its components. The results allow survey producers to assess error reduction strategies and survey users to mitigate the consequences of survey errors or gauge the reliability of their conclusions.
I38|Effects of Maternal Work Incentives on Adolescent Social Behaviors|This study investigates the effects of welfare reform in the U.S. in the 1990s, which dramatically limited cash assistance for low-income families, on the next generation as they transition to adulthood. We estimate effects by gender and focus on behaviors that are important for socioeconomic and health trajectories and represent early observable consequences of the reforms for the next generation. Using two nationally-representative datasets, we exploit differences in welfare reform implementation across states and over time in a difference-in-difference-in-differences framework to identify plausibly causal effects of welfare reform on a range of prosocial and antisocial behaviors (volunteering, participating in clubs/teams/activities, skipping school, getting into fights, damaging property, stealing, hurting others, smoking, using alcohol, using marijuana, using other illicit drugs). We explore maternal employment, supervision, and child's employment when not in school as potential mediators. We find that: (1) Welfare reform had no favorable effects on any of the youth behaviors examined. (2) Welfare reform led to a decrease in volunteering among girls. (3) Welfare reform led to increases in skipping school, damaging property, and getting into fights among boys. (4) Welfare reform led to increases in smoking and drug use among both boys and girls, with generally larger effects for boys (e.g., approximately 6% for boys compared to 4% for girls for any substance use). (5) The mediators we are able to consider explain little of the observed effects of welfare reform. Overall, the results from this study suggest that the intergenerational effects of welfare reform on adolescent behaviors were unfavorable, particularly for boys, and do not support longstanding arguments that incentivizing maternal employment by limiting cash assistance leads to responsible behavior in the next generation. As such, the social gains of welfare reform for women found in previous studies may have come at a cost to the next generation, particularly to boys who have been falling behind girls in terms of high school completion for decades.
I38|Baby Bonuses and Early-Life Health Outcomes: Using Regression Discontinuity to Evaluate the Causal Impact of an Unconditional Cash Transfer|We use administrative data from South Australia to study the impact of an unconditional cash transfer on child health. We use the unanticipated introduction of the Australian Baby Bonus (ABB), a one-off payment of AU$3,000 (US$2,400) made to families with a newborn, to isolate its causal effect. The ABB reduces the number of potentially preventable hospitalizations and emergency department presentations for respiratory problems in the first year of life. Findings from survey data suggest that households spent the windfall income on electricity and private health insurance. There is no robust evidence that the ABB increased accidents or non-essential good consumption.
I38|Free Education Helps Combat Child Labor? The Effect of a Free Compulsory Education Reform in Rural China|This paper evaluates the effect of a free compulsory education reform in rural China on the incidence of child labor. We exploit the cross-province variation in the roll-out of the reform and apply a difference-in-differences strategy to identify the causal effects of the reform. We find that the exposure to the free compulsory education significantly reduces the incidence of child labor for boys, but has no significant effect on the likelihood of child labor for girls. Specifically, one additional semester of free compulsory education decreases the incidence of child labor for boys by 8.3 percentage points. Moreover, the negative effect of the reform on the likelihood of child labor is stronger for boys from households with lower socioeconomic status. Finally, the free compulsory education reform may induce parents to reallocate resources towards boys within a household and thus may enlarge the gender gap in human capital investment.
I38|From Citizen's Rights to Civic Responsibilities|In less developed countries the state does not extends its legality homogenously. A share of the population suffers its absence or its illegal presence. In this article we argue that such irregular state intervention has more negative consequences that previously thought. Individuals who suffer lack of access to citizen's rights blame the state for their hardship, and negatively reciprocate by ignoring their civic duties. The building blocks of our hypothesis are attribution theory and reciprocity. We provide evidence based on self-report survey data for almost one hundred developing countries; an observational study where compliance with civic duties can be objectively assessed; and a list experiment. The evidence indicates that people who are discriminated by government officials, or workers who do not receive legally-mandated benefits, are less likely to comply with civic duties such as voting and paying taxes. Exclusion erodes civic responsibilities.
I38|Multiple Births, Birth Quality and Maternal Labor Supply: Analysis of IVF Reform in Sweden|In this study we examine the passage of a reform to in-vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures in Sweden in 2003. Following publication of medical evidence showing that pregnancy success rates could be maintained using single rather than multiple embryo transfers, the single embryo transfer (SET) was mandated as the default IVF procedure. Using linked registry data for the period 1998-2007, we find that the SET reform was associated with a precipitous drop in the share of multiple births of 63%. This narrowed differences in health between IVF and non-IVF births by 53%, and differences in the labor market outcomes of mothers three years after birth by 85%. For first time mothers, it also narrowed the gap in maternal health between IVF and non-IVF births by 36%. Our findings imply that more widespread adoption of SET could lead to massive gains, reducing hospitalization costs and the foregone income of mothers and improving the long-run socioeconomic outcomes of children. This is important given that the share of IVF facilitated births exceeds 3% in several industrialized countries and is on the rise.
I38|Parental Beliefs, Investments, and Child Development: Evidence from a Large-Scale Experiment|This paper experimentally estimates medium term impacts of a large-scale and low-cost parenting program targeting poor families in Chile. Households in 162 public health centers were randomly assigned to three groups: a control group, a second group that was offered eight weekly group parenting sessions, and a third group that was offered the same eight group sessions plus two sessions of guided interactions between parents and children focused on responsive play and dialogic reading. In spite of its short duration and intensity, three years after the end of the intervention, the receptive vocabulary and the socio-emotional development of children of families participating in either of the treatment arms improved (by 0.43 and 0.54 standard deviation, respectively) relative to children of nonparticipating families. The treatments also led to improvements in home environments and parenting behaviors of comparable magnitudes, which far outlasted the short duration of the intervention.
I38|Quantifying the intangible impact of the Olympics using subjective well-being data|Hosting the Olympic Games costs billions of taxpayer dollars. Following a quasi- experimental setting, this paper assesses the intangible impact of the London 2012 Olympics, using a novel panel of 26,000 residents in London, Paris, and Berlin during the summers of 2011, 2012, and 2013. We show that hosting the Olympics increases subjective well-being of the host city's residents during the event, particularly around the times of the opening and closing ceremonies. However, we do not _nd much evi- dence for legacy e_ects. Estimating residents' implicit willingness-to-pay for the event, we do not _nd that it was worth it for London alone, but a modest wellbeing impact on the rest of the country would make hosting worth the costs.
I38|Did the ACA Medicaid Expansion Save Lives?|We estimate the effect of the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion on county-level mortality in the first four years following expansion. We find a reduction in all-cause mortality in ages 20 to 64 equaling 11.36 deaths per 100,000 individuals, a 3.6 percent decrease. This estimate is largely driven by reductions in causes of death likely to be influenced by access to health care, and equates to one life saved per 310 newly covered individuals. A cost-benefit analysis shows that the improvement in welfare due to mortality responses may offset the entire net-of-transfers expenditure associated with the expansion.
I38|Cost-Effective Public Daycare in a Low-Income Economy Benefits Children and Mothers|This paper evaluates the impacts of a public program that introduced access to part-time childcare centers for children younger than four years of age in poor urban areas in Nicaragua. We explore the effects of this program on several measures of children's and parental outcomes. Our identification strategy exploits the original randomization and the distance to the centers, using Instrumental Variables (IV) and Marginal Treatment Effects (MTE) methods to tackle imperfect compliance with the original treatment assignments. We present a theoretical model to rationalize our IV assumptions. We find a positive impact of 0.35 standard deviations on the personal-social domain of a widely used development test, and an impact of 14 percentage points on mothers' work participation. Our results are robust to different econometric specifications. We also find suggestive evidence that quality greatly matters for the impacts at the child level, but not at the mother level.
I38|Experimental Long-Term Effects of Early-Childhood and School-Age Exposure to a Conditional Cash Transfer Program|Numerous evaluations of conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs show positive short-term impacts, but there is only limited evidence on whether these benefits translate into sustained longer-term gains. This paper uses the municipal-level randomized assignment of a CCT program implemented for five years in Honduras to estimate long-term effects 13 years after the program began. We estimate intent-to-treat effects using individual-level data from the population census, which allows assignment of individuals to their municipality of birth, thereby circumventing migration selection concerns. For the non-indigenous, we find positive and robust impacts on educational outcomes for cohorts of a very wide age range. These include increases of more than 50 percent for secondary school completion rates and the probability of reaching university studies for those exposed at school-going ages. They also include substantive gains for grades attained and current enrollment for others exposed during early childhood, raising the possibility of further gains going forward. Educational gains are, however, more limited for the indigenous. Finally, exposure to the CCT increased the probability of international migration for young men, from 3 to 7 percentage points, also stronger for the non-indigenous. Both early childhood exposure to the nutrition and health components of the CCT as well as exposure during school-going ages to the educational components led to sustained increases in human capital.
I38|Social Policy in Mexico and Argentina|This paper is a comparison between two programs implemented to combat poverty in Latin America: Prospera (Prosper) in Mexico and AsignaciÃ³n Universal por Hijo (Universal Assignment for Child) in Argentina. The first section offers a review of the emergence of the welfare state, examining economic and urban development in both countries and the underlying trends of social policy instruments. The analysis is based on the political nature of social problems and the actions undertaken to confront them. The paper offers a theoretical perspective, often questioning the very foundation of the social policy that serves as the main framework for the social programs, in order to present the policies' scope, successes, and disadvantages with reference to social equity and the well-being of their participants.
I38|Redistributive Impacts of Fiscal Policies in Mexico: Corrections for Top Income Measurement Problems|This study assesses the redistributive impacts of fiscal instruments in a 2014 Mexican household budget survey (ENIGH) correcting for potential top-income measurement problems. We use two correction methods based on within-survey information to re-estimate the redistributive impacts of contributory pensions and cash-like transfers; direct taxes; indirect taxes and subsidies; and in-kind transfers. The two methods are: survey-sample reweighting for households’ nonresponse probability, and replacing of top incomes using synthetic values from the Pareto distribution. This replacing is implemented either on all core income concepts, or on net market income from which it is passed onto other incomes through fiscal rules. These corrections yield higher inequality as measured by the Gini (0–9 pc.pt. increase) and the top 1%- and 10%-income shares (0–5, and 1–5 pc.pt. increases), consistently between the reweighting and replacing methods, and consistently across all income concepts. Moving from pre-fiscal market income to post-fiscal final income, corrections for nonresponse fall slightly, while corrections for mismeasurement rise. Taxable income is subject to the highest inequality, which further undergoes the highest upward correction for top income problems, potentially consistent with evidence of earnings misreporting among the rich. Conversely, nontaxable income has a strong equalizing impact of 3.3–4.5 points of the Gini further accentuated under the top-income corrections. The corrections confirm the inequality-neutral impact of pensions in Mexico, and equalizing impacts of transfers, direct taxes, indirect taxes and subsidies, and in-kind transfers. In-kind transfers, cash-like transfers and direct taxes have the strongest equalizing impacts of 4.7–5.7, 1.6–1.9, and 1.2–2.2 points of the Gini, respectively. Indirect taxes and subsidies are weakly equalizing, by 0.4-0.6 points. Finally, top-income measurement challenges retain their magnitude across the 2010, 2012 and 2014 ENIGH, but household nonresponse becomes more positively selected over time, causing more serious biases.
I38|RÃ©formes agricoles, emploi et rÃ©duction de la pauvretÃ© : une analyse en Ã©quilibre gÃ©nÃ©ral dynamique|Le Niger ambitionne de mobiliser et valoriser ses ressources en eau pour satisfaire ses besoins dâ€™irrigation.

Dans les deux sceÌ narios, on observe une ameÌ lioration significative de la production agricole, la croissance eÌ conomique et le revenu des meÌ nages agricoles. Toutefois, les effets sont nettement plus importants lorsque des efforts sont fournis pour mobiliser les eaux de surface. / Niger aims to mobilize and leverage water resources to meet its irrigation water needs. This study evaluates the impact of large-scale water mobilization on macroenomic aggregates: agricultural production, employment, household income, and poverty. The dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model was used to set up a first scenario to examine the repercussions of an increase of groundwater production and another scenario on the effects of a growth of surface water supplies. The results, estimated over a period of 15 years, show transmission mechanisms according to the preferred types of investments. In both scenarios, we observe a significant improvement of agricultural production, economic growth, and agricultural household income. However, the effects are obviously more important with greater efforts to mobilize surface waters.
I38|Welfare Effects of a Non-Contributory Old Age Pension: Experimental Evidence for Ekiti State, Nigeria|Many countries in the developing world have implemented non-contributory old-age pensions. Evidence of the impact of such policies on the elderly in Sub-Saharan Africa is scarce, however. In this paper, we provide the first evidence from a randomized evaluation of an unconditional, non-contributory pension scheme targeted at the elderly in Ekiti State, Nigeria. Our findings show that treated beneficiaries self-reported better quality of life, more stable mental health, and better general health. We also provide evidence of spillover effects on labor outcomes and on household expenditure patterns as well as support for demand- side interventions aimed at improving the welfare of elderly poor citizens and other household members.
I38|The Effects of EITC Exposure in Childhood on Marriage and Early Childbearing| This study analyzes the effect of exposure to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in childhood on marriage and childbearing in early adulthood. Results suggest that exposure in childhood leads women to delay marriage and first births in early adulthood (ages 18-25), but not men. These results have implications for the well-being of both individuals exposed to the EITC in childhood as well as their future children. In addition, because childless adults cannot claim the EITC until age 25, our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that these delays likely save up to $199 million annually in social welfare costs.
I38|Le politiche per l’assistenza: il Reddito di cittadinanza|During 2018 and the first part of 2019 the Italian debate on public expenditure for cash transfers has been dominated by two arguments: “Quota 100” for pensions and the Citizen’s Income (CI) for social assistance. This chapter is entirely devoted to the CI, which represents a turning point in policies against poverty in Italy, with positive aspects and some problems. After section 2, which updates the indexes on poverty and inequality in Italy, section 3 traces the history and the main contents of CI, formulating also some proposals to improve its design. Then a discussion of the quantitative effects of CI on poverty follows. Finally, section 5 deepens the relationship between poverty and the labour market, and the role that the CI could play in this context.
I38|Demand and Welfare Analysis in Discrete Choice Models with Social Interactions|Many real-life settings of consumer choice involve social interactions, causing targeted policies to have spillover effects. This paper develops novel empirical tools for analyzing demand and welfare effects of policy interventions in binary choice settings with social interactions. Examples include subsidies for health product adoption and vouchers for attending a high-achieving school. We establish the connection between econometrics of large games and Brock-Durlauf-type interaction models, under both I.I.D. and spatially correlated unobservables. We develop new convergence results for associated beliefs and estimates of preference parameters under increasing domain spatial asymptotics. Next, we show that even with fully parametric specifications and unique equilibrium, choice data, that are sufficient for counterfactual demand prediction under interactions, are insufficient for welfare calculations. This is because distinct underlying mechanisms producing the same interaction coefficient can imply different welfare effects and deadweight-loss from a policy intervention. Standard index-restrictions imply distribution-free bounds on welfare. We illustrate our results using experimental data on mosquito-net adoption in rural Kenya.
I38|Can unconditional in-kind transfers keep children out of work and in school? Evidence from Indonesia|The International Labour Organisation estimates that 152 million children are engaging in child labour globally which creates a need for evidence based policies and interventions to eliminate it. Particularly, there is limited evidence about the effect of in-kind transfers on child labour, impeding policy development. We address this evidence gap by examining the impacts of an unconditional in-kind transfer, a subsidised rice program, on child labour as well as schooling, using household survey data from Indonesia. To identify the causal effect we employ coarsened exact matching with difference-in-differences estimator. The results indicate that the program is effective in increasing the probability of schooling for girls though it does not have a significant impact on the probability of working as a child. However, as an unconditional in-kind transfer, its ability to increase schooling for girls, especially of those who are not currently attending school, provides an important policy implication on how a food subsidy program can indirectly influence child wellbeing.
I38|Does Rice for Poor Subsidy Reduce Child Marriage?|Reducing child marriage is seen as one of the essentials to women’s empowerment and wellbeing, ending the intergenerational cycle of poverty and rights violation. In this paper, we use a longitudinal household survey from Indonesia to study whether a food subsidy (Raskin) reduces child marriage. Modelling treatment assignment with Coarsened Exact Matching and Differences-in-Differences, we show that the unconditional rice subsidy significantly reduces the likelihood of marrying as a child.
I38|Soda Wars: The Effect Of A Soda Tax Election On University Beverage Sales|We examine how soda sales changed due to the campaign attention and election outcome of a local excise tax on sugar‐sweetened beverages. Using panel data of beverage sales from university retailers in Berkeley, California, we estimate that soda purchases relative to control beverages significantly dropped immediately after the election, months before the tax was implemented in the city of Berkeley or on campus. Supplemental scanner data from off‐campus retailers reveal this result is not unique to the university setting. Our findings suggest soda tax media coverage and election outcomes can have larger effects on purchasing behavior than the tax itself. (JEL D12, H20, C23, I38, Q18)
I38|La pobreza en Quibdó: Norte de carencias|A pesar de que la pobreza en Colombia se redujo considerablemente en las últimas cuatro décadas, Quibdó es la ciudad capital donde se mantienen los peores indicadores. El presente documento utiliza información cartográfica y espacial para caracterizar la pobreza de las comunas e identificar posibles trampas espaciales de pobreza en la capital chocoana. Los resultados muestran que la zona norte tiene los indicadores de pobreza y violencia más altos en la ciudad. No obstante las grandes inversiones en los últimos cinco años, se registra una persistencia en las condiciones de pobreza en Quibdó. Por ejemplo, el indicador de necesidades básicas insatisfechas continúa por encima del observado en varias ciudades capitales cuatro décadas atrás. Finalmente, el documento propone una opción de inversiones en varios sectores que podría ayudar a cerrar las brechas de pobreza a 2030. **** ABSTRACT: Besides an overall poverty reduction in Colombia in the last four decades, Quibdó remains as the capital city with the worst indicators. This paper assesses poverty in the communes of the city using spatial information and geographical maps attempting to identify possible spatial poverty traps. The results indicate that the north of the city faces the highest indicators of poverty and violence. Although public investment has increased in the last 5 years, the conditions of poverty persist. For example, the rate of unsatisfied basic needs remain higher than other capital cities four decades ago. To end with, the paper prioritizes investment in several sectors in order to bridge the poverty gap in 2030.
I38|Análisis de la Pobreza y Condiciones de Vida en Valledupar|En Valledupar la pobreza ha incrementado durante los últimos cuatro años, pasando de 27% en 2014 a 33,4% para 2017. La distribución del ingreso también sufrió un revés importante durante el mismo periodo de tiempo, cuando el coeficiente de Gini pasó de 0,42 a 0,46, lo que indica que en 2017 hubo una mayor concentración de la riqueza que en 2014 (DANE, 2018). Este documento estudia los principales factores que han incidido en el aumento de la pobreza y propone una serie de inversiones para contrarrestar la desmejora en las condiciones de vida de los valduparences. Los resultados indican que el deterioro en el mercado laboral (empleo, salarios e informalidad) y la calidad de la educación son los factores que explican el incremento en pobreza. Las inversiones propuestas en temas de educación, vivienda y trabajo, que reducirían la pobreza y generarían un entorno propicio para el desarrollo económico de Valledupar, requieren de $230 millones de dólares para los próximos 10 años, lo que implicaría un esfuerzo fiscal adicional por generar $22,8 millones de dólares adicionales anuales hasta 2030. **** ABSTRACT: Poverty rate increased six percentage points in the past four years in Valledupar (DANE, 2018). The income distribution deteriorated as well during the same period of time. This document studies the main factors that explain the rise in poverty in Valledupar during 2014-2017 and proposes a series of investments that will help the city to overcome this drawback in their economic and social development. The results show that the worsening in labor market conditions (wages, employment and informality rate) due to negative shocks in coal prices and low quality of education are the factors driving the poor performance of Valledupar in terms of poverty reduction. We propose a set of investments in education, labor policy and housing that cost $230 millions of dollars for the next 10 years, in order to create structural conditions for development and lower poverty.
I38|Economic impacts of the vale-cultura (culture voucher): a computable general equilibrium model|Restricted access to consumption of cultural goods and services is one of the major problems faced by this sector in Brazil. To address this issue, the federal government created the Vale-Cultura, a voucher in which individuals receive an income transfer to be used exclusively for purchasing cultural goods and services. The aim of this study is to analyze the impacts of the Vale-Cultura in the cultural sector and in the economy in general. The methodology applied is the Brazilian Recursive Dynamic General Equilibrium model (BRIDGE). Our simulations found that GDP growth is driven mainly by the increase in household consumption. There is a positive variation in welfare, assessed by the equivalent and compensating variations in income for beneficiaries of the vouchers. Finally, a positive growth is projected at the level of activity of cultural sectors and negative growth in others, showing a reallocation of productive factors.
I38|When Income Effects are Large: Labor Supply Responses and the Value of Welfare Transfers|I estimate the long-run income effect of welfare transfers on individual labor supply. Using Italian administrative data on the universe of survivor insurance recipients, I implement a regression discontinuity design around a change in survivor insurance generosity based on the spouse's death date. I find that survivors fully offset the benefit loss with increases in earnings. Labor force participation and program substitution are the main margins of adjustment. I consider potential explanations for the large income effect. Evidence suggests that the value of additional income in the widowhood state is large, driving large participation responses to survivor benefit cuts.
I38|The Causal Impact of Removing Children from Abusive and Neglectful Homes|This paper uses administrative data to measure causal impacts of removing children from families investigated for abuse or neglect. We use the removal tendency of quasi-experimentally assigned child protective service investigators as an instrument for whether authorities removed and placed children into foster care. Our main analysis estimates impacts on educational outcomes by gender and age at the time of an investigation. We find that removal significantly increases standardized test scores for young girls. There are no detectable impacts on the test scores of girls removed at older ages or boys of any age. For older children, we also find few significant impacts of removal on the likelihood of having a juvenile conviction, graduating from high school, enrolling in a postsecondary institution, or having a teenage birth. We investigate potential mechanisms driving heterogeneous impacts by gender and age. Our results do not appear to be driven by heterogeneous effects on foster care placement, school mobility and quality, or participation in special education programs. For girls, we find that removal significantly increases the likelihood of post-investigation criminal charges or incarceration for parents and caretakers who are the perpetrators of abuse or neglect.
I38|Does School Lunch Fill the “SNAP Gap” at the End of the Month?|This article investigates the relationship between the timing of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit payments and participation in school lunch and breakfast using the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey. An event study approach examines participation over the five‐day window before and after the SNAP payment. We find that school lunch participation decreases by 17–23 percentage points immediately after the SNAP payment among 11–18 year olds while breakfast drops by 19–36 percentage points. The decline begins the day prior to payment. We find no effects for 5–10 year olds. Models examining participation over the full SNAP month using individual fixed effects yield similar findings. Among teenagers, participation in school lunch and breakfast decline in the first two weeks of the SNAP month, increasing afterward. Non‐school meals show the opposite pattern. Overall, results indicate SNAP households rely more on school lunch and breakfast toward the end of the SNAP month.
I38|Effects of Maternal Work Incentives on Adolescent Social Behaviors|This study investigates the effects of welfare reform in the U.S. in the 1990s, which dramatically limited cash assistance for low-income families, on the next generation as they transition to adulthood. We estimate effects by gender and focus on behaviors that are important for socioeconomic and health trajectories and represent early observable consequences of the reforms for the next generation. Using two nationally-representative datasets, we exploit differences in welfare reform implementation across states and over time in a difference-in- difference-in-differences framework to identify plausibly causal effects of welfare reform on a range of prosocial and antisocial behaviors (volunteering, participating in clubs/teams/activities, skipping school, getting into fights, damaging property, stealing, hurting others, smoking, using alcohol, using marijuana, using other illicit drugs). We explore maternal employment, supervision, and child’s employment when not in school as potential mediators. We find that: (1) Welfare reform had no favorable effects on any of the youth behaviors examined. (2) Welfare reform led to a decrease in volunteering among girls. (3) Welfare reform led to increases in skipping school, damaging property, and getting into fights among boys. (4) Welfare reform led to increases in smoking and drug use among both boys and girls, with generally larger effects for boys (e.g., approximately 6% for boys compared to 4% for girls for any substance use). (5) The mediators we are able to consider explain little of the observed effects of welfare reform. Overall, the results from this study suggest that the intergenerational effects of welfare reform on adolescent behaviors were unfavorable, particularly for boys, and do not support longstanding arguments that incentivizing maternal employment by limiting cash assistance leads to responsible behavior in the next generation. As such, the social gains of welfare reform for women found in previous studies may have come at a cost to the next generation, particularly to boys who have been falling behind girls in terms of high school completion for decades.
I38|Universal Basic Income in the US and Advanced Countries|We discuss the potential role of Universal Basic Incomes (UBIs) in advanced countries. A feature of advanced economies that distinguishes them from developing countries is the existence of well developed, if often incomplete, safety nets. We develop a framework for describing transfer programs, flexible enough to encompass most existing programs as well as UBIs, and use this framework to compare various UBIs to the existing constellation of programs in the United States. A UBI would direct much larger shares of transfers to childless, non-elderly, non-disabled households than existing programs, and much more to middle-income rather than poor households. A UBI large enough to increase transfers to low-income families would be enormously expensive. We review the labor supply literature for evidence on the likely impacts of a UBI. We argue that the ongoing UBI pilot studies will do little to resolve the major outstanding questions.
I38|Market Inefficiency and Household Labor Supply: Evidence from Social Security’s Survivors Benefits|We study the effects of the Social Security survivors benefits program on household labor supply and the efficiency implications for insurance and credit markets. We use U.S. population tax records and exploit a sharp age discontinuity in benefit eligibility for identification. We find that eligibility induces considerable reductions in labor supply both among newly-widowed households in the immediate post-shock periods and among already-widowed households whose benefit receipt is entirely predictable. The evidence points to liquidity constraints, rather than myopia, as a leading operative mechanism underlying household responses to anticipated benefits. Our findings identify important inefficiencies in the life insurance market and in the allocation of credit. Our results further highlight the protective insurance role of the social program and the importance of liquidity provided by the government, and they suggest potential gains from expanding and smoothing the program’s benefit schedule.
I38|Investigating Treatment Effects of Participating Jointly in SNAP and WIC when the Treatment is Validated Only for SNAP|USDA operates several food assistance programs aimed at alleviating food insecurity. We study whether participation in both SNAP and WIC alleviates food insecurity compared with participation in SNAP alone. We bound underlying causal effects by applying nonparametric treatment effect methods that allow for endogenous selection and underrepresented program participation when validation data are available for one program (treatment) but not the other. We estimate average treatment effects using data from the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS). FoodAPS includes administrative data to validate SNAP participation. Information on local food prices allows us to construct a food expenditure-based monotone instrumental variable that does not require a typical IV exclusion restriction. Under relatively weak monotonicity assumptions, we identify that the impact of participating in both programs relative to SNAP alone is strictly positive, suggesting that the programs are nonredundant. This evidence can support improved design and targeting of food programs.
I38|SNAP and Paycheck Cycles|It is well documented that individuals do not spend the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits smoothly over the month after receipt. Rather, recipients spend a disproportionate share of benefits at the beginning of the benefit month. This has costs for recipients and stores. There is also evidence that other income streams, such as Social Security and paychecks, are not spent smoothly. The presence of these other income streams may bias estimates of the effects of this SNAP cycle on consumption for working SNAP beneficiaries and those who receive other government benefits. We use data from United States Department of Agriculture's National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey to explore how the SNAP cycle is affected by accounting for these other income streams. We find suggestive evidence that the cycle is more pronounced for workers who are paid on a weekly or monthly basis, but little evidence that cycles in other income streams mitigate or exacerbate the SNAP cycle.
I38|Is a Decentralized Right-to-Work Policy Feasible?|Evidence on the implementation of India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee Act suggests that the available work is often rationed by local leaders in poor areas, and that this is an important factor limiting the scheme’s impact on poverty. The paper offers explanations for this empirical finding, with likely relevance to other decentralized, rights-based, programs. It is shown that rationing of work opportunities can arise under decentralized implementation in poor places even when the center wants to honor the employment guarantee. Two main drivers of such rationing are identified: local administrative costs and local corruption. Administrative reforms by the center can have perverse effects. Policy implications are drawn for how to better assure that the stipulated rights are attained in practice.
I38|An Empirical Total Survey Error Decomposition Using Data Combination|Survey error is known to be pervasive and to bias even simple, but important estimates of means, rates, and totals, such as the poverty and the unemployment rate. To summarize and analyze the extent, sources, and consequences of survey error, we define empirical counterparts of key components of the Total Survey Error Framework that can be estimated using data combination. Specifically, we estimate total survey error and decompose it into three high level sources of error: generalized coverage error, item non-response error and measurement error. We further decompose these sources into lower level sources such as a failure to report a positive amount and errors in amounts conditional on reporting a positive value. For error in dollars paid by two large government transfer programs, we use administrative records on the universe of program payments in New York State linked to three major household surveys to estimate the error components we define. We find that total survey error is large and varies in its size and composition, but measurement error is always by far the largest source of error. Our application shows that data combination makes it possible to routinely measure total survey error and its components. The results allow survey producers to assess error reduction strategies and survey users to mitigate the consequences of survey errors or gauge the reliability of their conclusions.
I38|Combining Administrative and Survey Data to Improve Income Measurement|We describe methods of combining administrative and survey data to improve the measurement of income. We begin by decomposing the total survey error in the mean of survey reports of dollars received from a government transfer program. We decompose this error into three parts, generalized coverage error (which combines coverage and unit non-response error and any error from weighting), item non-response or imputation error, and measurement error. We then discuss these three sources of error in turn and how linked administrative and survey data can assess and reduce each of these sources. We then illustrate the potential of linked data by showing how using linked administrative variables improves the measurement of income and poverty in the Current Population Survey, focusing on the substitution of administrative for survey data for three government transfer programs. Finally, we discuss how one can examine the accuracy of the underlying links used in the combined data.
I38|Can Economic Policies Reduce Deaths of Despair?|Midlife mortality has risen steadily in the U.S. since the 1990s for non-Hispanic whites without a bachelor’s degree, and since 2013 for Hispanics and African-Americans who lack a bachelor’s degree. These increases largely reflect increased mortality from alcohol poisoning, drug overdose and suicide. We investigate whether these “deaths of despair” trends have been mitigated by two key policies aimed at raising incomes for low wage workers: the minimum wage and the earned income tax credit (EITC). To do so, we leverage state variation in policies over time to estimate difference-in-differences models of drug overdose deaths and suicides, using data on cause-specific mortality rates from 1999-2015. Our causal models find no significant effects of the minimum wage and EITC on drug-related mortality. However, higher minimum wages and EITCs significantly reduce non-drug suicides. A 10 percent increase in the minimum wage reduces non-drug suicides among adults with high school or less by 3.6 percent; a 10 percent increase in the EITC reduces suicides among this group by 5.5 percent. Our estimated models do not find significant effects for a college-educated placebo sample. Event-study models confirm parallel pre-trends, further supporting the validity of our causal research design. Our estimates suggest that increasing both the minimum wage and the EITC by 10 percent would likely prevent a combined total of around 1230 suicides each year.
I38|The use and misuse of income data and extreme poverty in the United States|More than half of all misclassified households have incomes from the administrative data above the poverty line, and several of the largest misclassified groups appear to be at least middle class based on measures of material well-being. In contrast, the households kept from extreme poverty by in-kind transfers appear to be among the most materially deprived Americans.
I38|Freeing Financial Education via Tablets: Experimental Evidence from Colombia|Financial knowledge is critical for making sound decisions that foster financial health and protect consumers from predation. A widely-used tool for building this capability is financial education. Yet evidence suggests that conventional approaches which teach concepts in classroom-style settings are ineffective and expensive at scale, especially for lower-income users. More recent findings indicate that customizing financial education to the needs, interests, and location of participants may increase impact, though doing so in a cost-effective and scalable way remains challenging. This randomized evaluation of a tablet-based financial education program with mostly female recipients of a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program in Colombia offers evidence for how to design and scale an effective digital-based financial education program. Results indicate that the LISTA Initiative had significant positive impacts on financial knowledge, attitudes, practices, and performance, increasing for poorer, less educated, and more rural populations, with users exhibiting increased financial health over two years later. Critical mechanisms included well-designed content and a social learning component. Yet the longer-term impact on formal financial inclusion was limited, suggesting the possible benefits of combining supply-side solutions with financial education interventions.
I38|The Effect of SNAP on the Composition of Purchased Foods: Evidence and Implications|We use detailed data from a large retail panel to study the effect of participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on the composition and nutrient content of foods purchased for at-home consumption. We find that the effect of SNAP participation is small relative to the cross-sectional variation in most of the outcomes we consider. Estimates from a model relating the composition of a household’s food purchases to the household’s current level of food spending imply that closing the gap in food spending between high- and low-SES households would not close the gap in summary measures of food healthfulness.
I38|Federalizing Benefits: The Introduction of Supplemental Security Income and the Size of the Safety Net|In 1974, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) federalized cash welfare programs for the aged, blind, and disabled, imposing a national minimum benefit. Because of pre-existing variation in generosity, SSI differentially raised payment levels in states below its benefit floor, but had no effect in states that paid above it. We show that SSI increased disability participation in states with the lowest pre-SSI benefits, but shrank non-disability cash transfer programs. For every four new SSI recipients, three came from other welfare programs. Each dollar of per capita SSI income increased total per capita transfer income by just over 50 cents.
I38|Food Stamps and America’s Poorest|The paper provides the first assessment of: (i) America’s progress in lifting the lower bound—the floor—of the distribution of real income; (ii) whether the country’s largest antipoverty program, SNAP (“food stamps”), helped do so. An operational method of estimating the floor is implemented on micro survey data spanning 30 years, with various robustness and significance tests. SNAP partially compensated the poorest, and helped stabilize the floor. Nonetheless, the floor has been sinking over the last 30 years. The efficiency of SNAP in lifting the floor has declined over time. Full coverage of the poorest would lift the floor appreciable.
I38|Selection into Identification in Fixed Effects Models, with Application to Head Start|Many papers use fixed effects (FE) to identify causal impacts of an intervention. In this paper we show that when the treatment status only varies within some groups, this design can induce non-random selection of groups into the identifying sample, which we term selection into identification (SI). We begin by illustrating SI in the context of several family fixed effects (FFE) applications with a binary treatment variable. We document that the FFE identifying sample differs from the overall sample along many dimensions, including having larger families. Further, when treatment effects are heterogeneous, the FFE estimate is biased relative to the average treatment effect (ATE). For the general FE model, we then develop a reweighting-on-observables estimator to recover the unbiased ATE from the FE estimate for policy-relevant populations. We apply these insights to examine the long-term effects of Head Start in the PSID and the CNLSY. Using our reweighting methods, we estimate that Head Start leads to a 2.6 percentage point (p.p.) increase (s.e. = 6.2 p.p.) in the likelihood of attending some college for white Head Start participants in the PSID. This ATE is 78% smaller than the traditional FFE estimate (12 p.p). Reweighting the CNLSY FE estimates to obtain the ATE produces similar attenuation in the estimated impacts of Head Start.
I38|Reducing and Preventing Homelessness: A Review of the Evidence and Charting a Research Agenda|Homelessness may be both a cause of and one of the more extreme outcomes of poverty. Governments at all levels have a variety of tools to combat homelessness, and these strategies have changed dramatically over the past quarter century. In this paper, we catalog the policy responses, the existing literature on the effectiveness of these strategies, and the major gaps that need to be addressed in future research. We focus on studies from randomized controlled trial evaluations and the best quasi-experimental designs, and discuss outstanding questions that can be addressed with these same methods.
I38|Changes in Family Structure and Welfare Participation Since the 1960s: The Role of Legal Services|This paper evaluates the effects of the War on Poverty’s Legal Services Program (LSP) on family structure and welfare participation. LSPs provided subsidized legal assistance to poor communities, focusing on divorce and welfare access. We use a difference-in-differences research design based on the rollout of the program to 251 counties from 1965 to 1975. We find temporary increases in divorce and persistent increases in welfare participation and nonmarital birth rates. Nonmarital births rose because marriage rates fell, not because birth rates rose. Expanded access to legal institutions thus contributed, directly and indirectly, to changes in family structure in the 1960s.
I38|Financing social protection in Namibia|Namibia is an upper middle-income country with one of the most comprehensive social protection systems in Africa. It provides cash transfers and complementary social assistance to a range of vulnerable groups including children, the elderly and people with disabilities, at a cost equivalent to 4.5% of GDP in 2016/17. Public-sector workers are well covered by social insurance, although there are gaps in provision for the private sector. Social protection, in particular cash transfers, has proven highly effective at reducing poverty and inequality and mitigating the impact of high unemployment, although these remain persistent challenges. For Namibia to achieve its development objectives, social protection will need to play an even greater role in the future, but scaling up social protection in the current context of low economic growth and fiscal consolidation will be challenging. This paper charts the evolution of social protection provision and expenditure, locates social protection within the context of Namibia’s broader fiscal framework and proposes options for enhancing its impact without increasing public spending.
I38|Towards universal social protection: Lessons from the universal health coverage initiative|Universal social protection (USP) is becoming high priority in many developing countries’ agendas. However, information on what has worked well – and not so well – is limited. This study reviews a wide range of recent country experiences with universal health coverage (UHC) financing and implementation in order to draw lessons and help governments elaborate policies for USP and the extension of social protection. It looks at different pathways and delivery and financing challenges to universalism in health coverage and takes a close look at equity issues. It concludes with some key takeaways from UHC implementation and its implications for USP. One important message of this study is that while the UHC experience cannot be mechanically transposed to the USP agenda, a number of lessons can be drawn. Moreover, the benefits in terms of coverage and equity of better integrating USP and UHC appear tremendous.
I38|Improving well-being through better housing policy in New Zealand|New Zealand’s housing supply has not kept pace with rising demand, including from net immigration. Affordability has worsened, particularly for low-income renters. Government action is underway to allow new housing through initiatives such as the Urban Growth Agenda, KiwiBuild and the Housing and Urban Development Authority, but further steps are needed to improve well-being. Clear overarching principles for sustainable urban development and rationalisation of strict regulatory containment policies would allow the planning system to better respond to demand for land. Incentives for local governments to accommodate growth could be increased by giving them access to additional revenue linked to local development. More user charging and targeted rates would also help to fund infrastructure required to service new housing. Government delivery of affordable housing through KiwiBuild should be re-focused towards enabling the supply of land to developers, supporting development of affordable rental housing and further expanding social housing in areas facing shortages.This Working Paper relates to the 2019 OECD Economic Survey of New Zealand (http://www.oecd.org/economy/new-zealand-economic-snapshot/).
I38|Effects of tax-benefit policies on the income distribution and work incentives in Estonia|The paper studies the impact of tax-benefit policies on the distribution of household incomes and work incentives in Estonia. It makes use of microsimulation modelling approach and applies the EU tax-benefit model EUROMOD to quantify the first-order effects of policy changes in 2016-2018 and of a range of alternative policy scenarios aimed at increasing the adequacy of social benefits. According to the simulations, 2016-2017 policies increased household incomes relative to inflation and were both poverty and inequality reducing. Alternative policy scenarios indicate that, among the considered options, increasing the generosity of the subsistence benefit and relaxing its means test by halving the withdrawal rate (currently at 100%), would have the highest first-order impact for a given fiscal cost. However, these measures would also weaken work incentives, which points to a conventional equity-efficiency trade-off. Other simulations demonstrate some scope for improving work incentives at low and middle-income levels together with modest reductions in poverty and inequality.This Working Paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of Estonia(http://www.oecd.org/economy/estonia-economic-snapshot/)
I38|The economy of well-being: Creating opportunities for people’s well-being and economic growth|As well-being has matured as a statistical and measurement agenda, it has become increasingly relevant as a “compass” for policy, with a growing number of countries using well-being metrics to guide decision-making and inform budgetary processes. One remaining challenge has consisted in providing policy-makers with a better understanding of the linkages between the drivers of well-being and economic growth. This paper develops the concept of an “Economy of Well-being” as a basis for highlighting these linkages and showing how policy can most effectively leverage them. The paper defines an economy of well-being around the idea of a “virtuous circle” in which individual well-being and long-term economic growth are mutually reinforcing. It also explores the characteristics of an economy of well-being and the conditions under which it can be sustained. Secondly, based on a survey of existing empirical evidence, the paper contributes to outline how economies of well-being can be built. It provides analysis of several important channels through which economic growth and well-being support and reinforce one another, focusing on the multidimensional impact of policies in four areas that research has shown to be important for well-being: Education and Skills; Health; Social Protection and Redistribution; and Gender Equality.
I38|The Minimum Income Scheme as a poverty reduction mechanism:the case of the Basque Country|This paper analyses the impact of a Minimum Income Scheme (MIS), which operates in the Basque Country, one of the 17 Spanish Autonomous Regions, by assessing its efficacy in fighting poverty. We evaluate the effect or the MIS with respect to two different poverty measures. The first one is that defined by the administrative criteria of eligibility. The second one corresponds to Sen’s poverty measure that permits a simple decomposition of poverty into three different components, incidence, intensity and inequality. The results show that the MIS has reduced substantially all dimensions of poverty, even though there is scope for improvement both in coverage and efficiency.
I38|Understanding the average impact of microcredit expansions: a Bayesian hierarchical analysis of seven randomized experiments|Despite evidence from multiple randomized evaluations of micro- credit, questions about external validity have impeded consensus on the results. I jointly estimate the average effect and the heterogeneity in effects across seven studies using Bayesian hierarchical models. I find the impact on household business and consumption variables is unlikely to be transformative and may be negligible. I find reasonable external validity: true heterogeneity in effects is moderate, and approximately 60 percent of observed heterogeneity is sampling variation. Households with previous business experience have larger but more heterogeneous effects. Economic features of microcredit interventions predict variation in effects better than studies’ evaluation protocols.

I38|What Works at Scale? A Framework to Scale Up Workforce Development Programs|Workforce development policymakers have access to a growing catalog of training programs evaluated with rigorous randomized controlled trials. This evidence base identifies programs that work in specific geographic and temporal contexts but may not necessarily work in other contexts or at a scale sufficient to meet regional workforce needs. The author examines a sample of recent randomized controlled trials of workforce development programs and reports to what extent this body of evidence informs policymakers about what works at scale. The author finds that most programs are implemented at a small scale, use nonrandom samples from the population of interest, and are concentrated in the most populous urban areas and U.S. states. The author then discusses a method to help state and local policymakers, technical colleges, training providers, and other workforce development organizations adopt evidence-based policies in their local contexts and at scale. The two-step method includes a check on the assumptions in a program’s theory of change and an assessment of the sensitivity of projected results to violations in assumptions such as program completion rates. The author provides an example of the method applied to a hypothetical metropolitan area that seeks to adopt an evidence-based training program for youth with barriers to employment.
I38|Landlords and Access to Opportunity|Despite being eligible for use in any neighborhood, housing choice vouchers tend to be redeemed in low-opportunity neighborhoods. This paper investigates how landlords contribute to this outcome and how they respond to efforts to change it. We leverage a policy change in Washington, DC, that increased voucher rental payments only in high-rent neighborhoods. Using two waves of a correspondence experiment that bracket the policy change, we show that most opportunity landlords screen out prospective voucher tenants, and we detect no change in average screening behavior after a $450 per month increase in voucher payments. In lease-up data, however, enough landlords do respond to increased payments to equalize the flow of voucher tenants into high- vs. low-rent neighborhoods. Using tax data and listings from a website specializing in subsidized housing, we characterize a group of marginal opportunity landlords who respond to higher payments. Marginal opportunity landlords are relatively rare, list their units near market rates, operate on a small scale, and negatively select into the voucher program based on hard-to-observe differences in unit quality.
I38|Nonlinear Pricing in Village Economies|This paper examines the price of basic staples in rural Mexico. We document that nonlinear pricing in the form of quantity discounts is common, that quantity discounts are sizable for typical staples, and that the well-known conditional cash transfer program Progresa has significantly increased quantity discounts, although the program, as documented in previous studies, has not affected on average unit prices. To account for these patterns, we propose a model of price discrimination that nests those of Maskin and Riley (1984) and Jullien (2000), in which consumers differ in their tastes and, because of subsistence constraints, in their ability to pay for a good. We show that under mild conditions, a model in which consumers face heterogeneous subsistence or budget constraints is equivalent to one in which consumers have access to heterogeneous outside options. We rely on known results (Jullien (2000)) to characterize the equilibrium price schedule, which is nonlinear in quantity. We analyze the effect of nonlinear pricing on market participation as well as the impact of a market-wide transfer, analogous to the Progresa one, when consumers are differentially constrained. We show that the model is structurally identified from data on prices and quantities from a single market under common assumptions. We estimate the model using data from municipalities and localities in Mexico on three commonly consumed commodities. Interestingly, we find that nonlinear pricing is beneficial to a large number of households, including those consuming small quantities, relative to linear pricing mostly because of the higher degree of market participation that nonlinear pricing induces. We also show that the Progresa transfer has affected the slopes of the price schedules of the three commodities we study, which have become steeper as consistent with our model, leading to an increase in the intensity of price discrimination. Finally, we show that a reduced form of our model, in which the size of quantity discounts depends on the hazard rate of the distribution of quantities purchased in a village, accounts for the shift in price schedules induced by the program.
I38|Early Lessons in Implementing the Sustainable Development Goals in India: The Example of Assam|Assam has made vigorous efforts since 2015 towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Cognizant of the state’s weak progress in development, its recent governments – irrespective of political affiliation– adopted the SDGs and Assam became the first state in India to do so. The paper discusses in detail the steps taken so far which include developing an overall vision of an SDG-fulfilled Assam in 2030; preparing a comprehensive strategy in a participatory fashion to achieve that vision; and steps taken to implement and monitor the strategy. The Assam experience has many important lessons. These include the criticality of motivating staff at all levels to instill the SDGs in every aspect of their work and the role of leadership in this respect; proactively forging partnerships with all stakeholders including the legislature and the judiciary and creating an environment for such partnerships to flourish; the general need for adopting a result and outcome-based development process that the SDGs represent abandoning narrow departmental and output-based activity and practice. These would require initiating institutional and organizational changes including to ensure that major improvements take place in project implementation processes. Also essential is inculcating a culture of innovation –including technological innovation–in every sphere of public service; and developing effective coordinating mechanisms to ensure that all concerned stakeholders work synergistically to achieve the SDG outcomes. Also, very critical is the role of national and global partners in supporting Assam’s earnest efforts as the resource, knowledge and capacity gaps that Assam faces are too large for it to fill through its own means –even with its best efforts.
I38|The (lack of) Distortionary Effects of Proxy-Means Tests: Results from a Nationwide Experiment in Indonesia|Many developing country governments determine eligibility for anti-poverty programs using censuses of household assets. Does this distort subsequent reporting of, or actual purchases of, those assets? We ran a nationwide experiment in Indonesia where, in randomly selected provinces, the government added questions on flat-screen televisions and cell-phone SIM cards to the targeting census administered to 25 million households. In a separate survey six months later, households in treated provinces report fewer televisions, though the effect dissipates thereafter. We find no change in actual television sales, or actual SIM card ownership, suggesting that consumption distortions are likely to be small.
I38|Point Estimates of Household Bargaining Power Using Outside Options|We propose measuring household bargaining power with partners' relative outside options. Our estimate of outside options is the sum of predicted earnings and observed unearned income. This estimation approach allows researchers to generate level estimates of bargaining power for each household, and in each period or state of the world, without making assumptions about utility functional forms. Instead, the main assumption we make is on the functional relationship between bargaining power and outside options. Our primary contribution is to provide researchers with a new measurement option that complements the existing suite of techniques. Paired with the contemporary household models presented in Chiappori and Mazzocco (2017), this new measurement approach opens the door to new analyses of household bargaining. After developing the measure, we present an application that demonstrates the nature of questions that can be answered with our approach. We present the first causal evidence on important outstanding policy questions: the extent to which the Government of Mexico's Progresa empowered women, and the subsequent impact of that empowerment on diet. We estimate that Progresa increased women's bargaining power by 35% from 1998 to 1999. We find that this empowerment caused a 10% increase in household demand for fruits and vegetables and an 8% increase in demand for animal products. We show that the marginal effect of power on diet has an inverse-U shape, with household nutritional attainment maximized when partners are relatively equal, and that this marginal effect is an increasing function of household income.
I38|The Effect of the Brexit Referendum Result on Subjective Well-being|We study the effect of the Brexit referendum result on subjective well-being in the United Kingdom. Using a quasi-experimental design, we find that this outcome led to an overall decrease in subjective well-being in the UK compared to a control group. The effect is driven by individuals who hold an overall positive attitude towards the EU and shows little signs of adaptation. Subjective well-being of those with a very negative attitude towards the EU increases in the short-run but turns negative, possibly due to unmet expectations. Using three different measures of socio-economic connection between the UK and other European countries, we generally do not find evidence supporting the presence of spillover effects of the Brexit referendum result on subjective well-being of individuals in other EU countries.
I38|Acceptability of Urban Transport Pricing| Several studies all over the world have considered transport pricing measures as promising attempts to solve urgent traffic problems in urban areas. An important precondition for the successful implementation of pricing measures is public and political acceptability. However, empirical findings show that the acceptability of such measures is rather low. The general objectives of this report are to assess acceptability of various urban transport pricing measures and policy packages, to analyse the reasons for the lacking acceptability and how this may be improved where appropriate. The relevant policy packages were derived from AFFORD Deliverable 1 (Milne, Niskanen and Verhoef, 2000). A public acceptability questionnaire survey was carried out in Athens, Como, Dresden and Oslo. The political acceptability survey was carried out as a phone interview with politicians in Como and Dresden.
I38|Essays on public economics| This doctoral thesis is a collection of four essays in public economics that look at various public policies and their impacts on low-income and otherwise vulnerable individuals. The essays share the general aim of studying the effectiveness of public policies in achieving their stated goals. The first essay is single-authored by the candidate, and the latter three are collaborations with one or more co-authors. In the first essay, I use a unique dataset compiled from Finnish registers and surveys to provide a comprehensive characterisation of the take-up behavior of Finnish welfare benefits (housing allowance and social assistance) using descriptive methods. I provide various stylised facts on take-up and discuss how income dynamics matter for understanding take-up and benefit targeting. The second essay focuses on the impact of information on benefit takeup. We study the information campaign in the context of the introduction of the guarantee pension program in Finland in 2011 and find that receiving a mailed information letter and application form significantly increased take-up compared to non-recipients. In the the third essay, we analyse the impact of employersâ€™ disability insurance (DI) contributions on the incidence of disability pensions among their workers. Experience rating is used in DI in Finland in order to increase employersâ€™ incentives to prevent disabilities among their workers. We use detailed data and an empirical strategy that allows us to identify the causal effect of experience rating on disability inflow. Our analysis finds that the policy is not effective in reducing disabilities. The fourth essay uses a theoretical framework to provide optimal tax and transfer rules for poverty reduction in developing countries. We modify the standard optimal tax framework by restricting tax instruments to be linear, which are more feasibly implemented in countries with a lower administrative capacity. We show that when we change from the standard objective of welfare maximisation to that of poverty minimisation, which better depicts the concrete objectives of such countries, the optimal tax and transfer rules are changed.
I38|Rural Affordable Rental Housing : Quantifying Need, Reviewing Recent Federal Support, and Assessing the Use of Low Income Housing Tax Credits in Rural Areas|Recently, there has been significant interest in the high levels of rental cost burden being experienced across the United States. Much of this scholarship has focused on rental cost burdens in larger urban areas, or at the national level, and has not explored differences in the prevalence of rental cost burden in urban versus rural communities. In this paper, I find that rental cost burdens are a challenge facing both urban and rural communities. However, despite the need for affordable rental housing in rural communities identified, I find the amount of resources made available by the federal government to address this challenge are at a low point relative to recent history. My analysis of federal resource availability also finds one program has been an important and resilient tool for the development and preservation of affordable housing in urban and rural communities: the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. Congress delegated much of the LIHTC program’s implementation to the states, whereby states choose many of the factors to prioritize when allocating LIHTCs to specific projects. Therefore, I explored each state’s qualified allocation plan to identify whether specific factors make it more or less likely rural areas will receive a “fair share” of LIHTC allocations based on their need relative to non-rural areas. My analysis did not identify a specific factor or set of factors that systematically increased or decreased the likelihood of allocations being proportionate to the relative needs of a state’s rural communities. However, I did identify a number of factors that by their very design appeared to affect positively or negatively the likelihood that specific types of projects or project locations would receive allocations. Interviews with industry stakeholders confirmed that many of these factors are affecting developer decisions and may be unintentionally disadvantaging smaller, more remote rural projects.
I38|Designing UISAs for Developing Countries|The benefits of implementing Unemployment Insurance Savings Accounts (UISAs) are studied in the presence of the multiple sources of information frictions often existing in developing countries. A benchmark incomplete markets economy is calibrated to Mexico in the early 2000s. The unconstrained optimal allocation would imply very large welfare gains relative to the benchmark economy (similar to an increase in consumption of 23% in every period). More importantly, in presence of multiple sources of information frictions, about half of those potential gains can be accrued through the implementation of UISAs with replacement rates between 40-50%, contribution rates between 10-15%, an initial liquidity transfer of about 20 quarters of average income, and higher payroll taxes to finance those initial stocks.
I38|Natural hazards and internal migration: The role of transient versus permanent shocks|We analyse internal migration triggered by natural disasters in Bangladesh. We conducted a survey in nine coastal districts and two major cities in Bangladesh to investigate whether floods and cyclones, which can be considered as transient shocks, affect interregional migration differently compared to riverbank erosion that causes loss of lands and thus generates shocks that are permanent in nature. Our findings suggest that transient shocks induce households to move to nearby cities while permanent shocks push people to big cities with more opportunities. Comparing income and expenditure of migrants and non-migrant households, we find that the former group is better-off relative to their counterpart, indicating that welfare can be improved by facilitating migration. Rising exposure to climate change induced natural disasters around the world imply that our findings will be increasingly relevant for designing policies to address vulnerability, particularly for disaster prone countries with weak social safety nets.
I38|The impact of large-scale social protection interventions on grain prices in poor countries: Evidence from Ethiopia|There has long been concern that cash and in-kind transfers might affect prices in developing country food markets. While there have been a number of studies at highly aggregated levels, much less is known about the effects of cash transfers on local food prices and even less about how they compare to food transfers. We consider this issue in the context of a large social protection intervention, Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Programme. Using 12 months of price data from 233 localities and controlling for temporal, location, and market characteristics we find: Cash transfers have no effect on food prices. There is some evidence that food transfers reduce food prices. Maize transfers reduce aggregate grain prices, wheat transfers reduce the price of maize, and the negative effect of food transfers on food prices is larger in more remote markets. However, the magnitudes of these effects are trivially small, both in absolute and percentage terms.
I38|Cash transfers, polygamy, and intimate partner violence: Experimental evidence from Mali| Cash transfer programs primarily targeting women in Latin America and East Africa have been shown to reduce intimate partner violence (IPV), but knowledge gaps remain on how impacts differ by program features and context. Using a randomized control trial, we investigate the IPV impacts of Maliâ€™s national cash transfer program (JigisÃ©mÃ¨jiri), which primarily targets men in a West African context where nearly 40 percent of households are polygamous. The program causes significant decreases in IPV in polygamous households â€“ where physical violence decreases by 7 percentage points, emotional violence decreases by 12 percentage points, and controlling behaviors decrease by 16 percentage points but has limited effects in nonpolygamous households. Evidence on mechanisms suggests that the program led to significant decreases in menâ€™s stress and anxiety among polygamous households, and larger reductions in disputes in polygamous households compared to non-polygamous households.
I38|The Impact of Conditional Cash Transfers on Households Investments in Productive Assets and Activities: Evidence from the Juntos Programme in Peru|This paper provides an impact evaluation of the Juntos programme on householdsâ€™ decisions to invest in livestock and agricultural and non-agricultural assets used for income generating activities. Using Propensity Score Matching and Difference in Difference techniques, we show: i) that beneficiaries are significantly more likely to invest in productive assets and activities with respect to non-beneficiaries; ii) that Juntos is more likely to relax liquidity constraints rather than to be used as an insurance for risky investments; iii) that the programs benefits the poor but not the poorest of the poor. Duration and transfers regularity do not produce significant differences between groups of beneficiaries. However, results show a sustained impact of the programme over time.
I38|The distributional impact of social spending in Peru|Peru has made great progress in reducing poverty and inequality in the past decade alongside high economic growth. Albeit this progress, the incidence of poverty and inequality remain high. This paper examines the distributional and poverty impact of the public tax and transfer system in Peru. It applies an extended income approach that accounts for the value of publicly-provided health, education and childcare services. Accounting for public services is important since unequal access to basic services is a main development challenge for low and middle income countries. We find that public social spending reduces overall inequality by almost 7 Gini points. This reduction is mainly driven by in-kind benefits while the impact of taxation and direct cash transfers is small. Income differentials within regions explain approximately four fifths of overall inequality compared to diffierences between regions, which explain about one fifth. This ratio remains largely unaffected by public redistribution. Mean levels of welfare vary widely across regions. This is also because social spending achieves litte poverty reduction. It decreases absolute poverty by 2-3 percentage points in terms of monetary income and up to 9 percentage points or 25% when accounting for public service use. The largest share of the poor, over 50%, are not reached by social assistance. To tackle poverty more effectively, transfer levels and coverage need to be increased. Current policies seem insuffcient to achieve a more equitable income distribution.
I38|Improving Children Health and Cognition: Evidence from School-Based Nutrition Intervention in India|We present experimental evidence on the impact of delivering double-fortified salt (DFS), salt fortified with iron and iodine, through the Indian school-feeding program called “mid-day meal” on anemia, cognition, and math and reading scores of primary school children. We conducted a field experiment that randomly provided a one-year supply of DFS at a subsidized price to public primary schools to prepare mid-day meal in one of the poorest regions of India. The DFS treatment had significantly positive impacts on hemoglobin levels and reduced the prevalence of anemia by 20 percent but these health gains did not translate into statistically significant impacts on cognition and test scores. While exploring the heterogeneity in effects, we find that treatment had statistically significant gains in anemia and test scores among children with higher treatment compliance. We further estimate that the intervention was very cost effective and can potentially be scaled up without much financial burden.
I38|Defining and Measuring Workforce Development in the United States in a Post-Bipartisan Era|The bipartisan acceptance of a federal role in workforce development policy is no longer in play as a result of ideological differences in the definition of workforce development which arise from a lack of coherent and misunderstood outcomes. My attempt here is to posit a new definition for workforce development that explains what these activities actually are and to raise three criteria for outcome metrics that can be used to evaluate the success of workforce investment under this new definition. By suggesting the process of workforce development and by proposing metric criteria which we can use to measure progress, I believe that a new bipartisan consensus can re-emerge, while recognizing the limitations of federal public expenditure. This consensus can, then, be used to generate a more appreciative role of active labor market policy at the national level using a process-evaluation model.
I38|Natural Hazards and Internal Migration: The Role of Transient versus Permanent Shocks|We analyse internal migration triggered by natural disasters in Bangladesh. We conducted a survey in nine coastal districts and two major cities in Bangladesh to investigate whether floods and cyclones, which can be considered as transient shocks, affect interregional migration differently compared to riverbank erosion that causes loss of lands and thus generates shocks that are permanent in nature. Our findings suggest that transient shocks induce households to move to nearby cities while permanent shocks push people to big cities with more opportunities. Comparing income and expenditure of migrants and non-migrant households, we find that the former group is better-off relative to their counterpart, indicating that welfare can be improved by facilitating migration. Rising exposure to climate change induced natural disasters around the world imply that our findings will be increasingly relevant for designing policies to address vulnerability, particularly for disaster prone countries with weak social safety nets.
I38|Does Money Relieve Depression? Evidence from Social Pension Expansions in China|We estimate the impact of pension enrollment on mental well-being using China's New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS), the largest existing pension program. Since its launch in 2009, more than 400 million Chinese have enrolled in NRPS. We first describe plausible pathways through which pension may affect mental health. We then use the national sample of China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) to examine the effect of pension enrollment on mental health, as measured by CES-D and self-reported depressive symptoms. To overcome the endogeneity of pension enrollment or of income change on mental health, we exploit geographic variation in pension program implementation. Results indicate modest to large reductions in depressive symptoms due to pension enrollment; this effect is more pronounced among individuals eligible to claim pension income, among populations with more financial constraints, and among those with worse baseline mental health. Our findings hold for a rich set of robustness checks and falsification tests.
I38|Evaluation of Language Training Programs in Luxembourg Using Principal Stratification|"In a world increasingly globalized, multiple language skills can create more employment opportunities. Several countries include language training programs in active labor market programs for the unemployed. We analyze the effects of a language training program on the re-employment probability and hourly wages of the unemployed simultaneously, using high-quality administrative data from Luxembourg. We address selection into training by exploiting the rich administrative information available, and account for the complication that wages are ""truncated"" by unemployment by adopting a principal stratification framework. Estimation is undertaken with a mixture model likelihood-based approach. To improve inference, we use the individual's hours worked as a secondary outcome and a stochastic dominance assumption. These two features considerably ameliorate the multimodality problem commonly encountered in mixture models. We also conduct sensitivity analysis to assess the unconfoundedness assumption employed. Our results strongly suggest a positive effect (of up to 12.7 percent) of the language training programs on the re-employment probability, but no effects on wages for those who are observed employed regardless of training participation. It appears that, in the context of an open and multilingual economy, language training improve employability but the language skills acquired are not sufficiently rewarded to be reflected in higher wages."
I38|Neoliberal populism in Turkey and its crisis|"Turkey was shown as a model country by Western capitals in the early 2000s because it successfully embraced the neoliberal economic path and ""moderate Islamist"" values. In the last couple of years, however, Turkey has been in a state of turmoil, which has included the failure of the so-called democratization process and a rapid rise in authoritarianism. Surprisingly, the Justice and Development Party (AKP) of Turkey has been among a few political parties worldwide which have managed to stay in office, despite implementing a neoliberal economic model since 2002. This paper suggests that the ""neoliberal populism"" framework can be applied to understand the seemingly contradictory dynamics of the so-called success story of the AKP. First, the paper explains the main features of the neoliberal populist model in Turkey. This model is characterized by the implementation of neoliberal austerity measures alongside the introduction of a new welfare regime and the widening of financial inclusiveness. The main result of neoliberal populism is the enfeeblement of labor movement. Second, the paper argues that once the neoliberal populist model was established, it changed the structure of the political conflict. In this new structure, power struggles have taken the form of intra-elite conflict, rather than class struggle. The paper also suggests that a recent change to the executive presidential system in Turkey should be understood in the context of a continuing power struggle among the ruling classes, one that has been unfolding since 2007."
I38|Eine Bewertung aktueller Vorschläge zur Reform der Grundsicherung|Mit Beiträgen von Andrea Nahles und Robert Habeck liegen zwei neue Vorschläge zur Reform der Grundsicherung vor. Im Wesentlichen geht es darum, Leistungen auszuweiten und Mitwir-kungspflichten abzuschwächen. Im Vorschlag von Robert Habeck wird sogar eine vollständige Abschaffung der Verpflichtung zu Eigenbemühungen zur Überwindung der Hilfebedürftigkeit postuliert. Die Vorschläge berücksichtigen nicht die bisher erzielten Erfolge bei der Arbeits-marktintegration von Leistungsempfängern. Sie können auch keine Begründung bieten, die sich auf funktionale Mängel des Status quo stützt. Stattdessen liegt die Begründung in der als negativ eingeschätzten Wahrnehmung der Grundsicherung in der Öffentlichkeit - ein Bild, das nicht zu-letzt durch die undifferenzierte Kritik seitens der Autoren überhaupt erst erzeugt wird. Die Vor-schläge sind überwiegend nicht geeignet, die Integration von Leistungsempfängern in den Ar-beitsmarkt zu verbessern. Bedenkenswert ist allenfalls eine Bündelung und stärkere Pauschalie-rung von Leistungen sowie die Reform der Freibetragsregeln bei der Kombination von Erwerbs- und Transfereinkommen.
I38|Langzeitarbeitslosigkeit: Entwicklung, Ursachen und Lösungsansätze|Während sich der Arbeitsmarkt in Deutschland weiterhin gut entwickelt, wird gemeinhin angenommen, dass im Segment der Langzeitarbeitslosen keine oder nur geringe Fortschritte zu verzeichnen seien. Dies trifft nicht uneingeschränkt zu. So ist die Anzahl der Langzeitarbeitslosen seit ihrem Höchstwert von 1,8 Millionen im Jahr 2006 bis zum Jahr 2016 auf die Hälfte gesunken. Nicht zu Unrecht wird mitunter darauf hingewiesen, dass die offizielle Anzahl der Langzeitarbeitslosen aufgrund der Messmethode das Problem unterschätzt. Doch auch wenn stattdessen die Entwicklung der Langleistungsbezieher betrachtet wird, die über einen längeren Zeitraum Leistungen nach dem SGB II beziehen, ist eine Besserung der Lage durchaus erkennbar. Es dürfte dennoch unstreitig sein, dass das Problem kaum als gelöst angesehen werden kann. Nach wie vor sind knapp eine Million Menschen länger als zwölf Monate ohne Arbeit. Noch größer ist die Anzahl derer, die sich nicht nachhaltig aus der wiederkehrenden Abhängigkeit von Lohnersatz- oder Transferleistungen befreien können. Oft handelt es sich um Personen mit Qualifikationsdefiziten, Ältere, Personen mit gesundheitlichen Einschränkungen oder Personen mit einer Kombination aus diesen Merkmalen. 69 Prozent der Langzeitarbeitslosen streben eine Tätigkeit an, für die keine abgeschlossene Berufsausbildung vorausgesetzt wird oder sind älter als 55 Jahre. Bisherige Ansätze der Arbeitsmarktpolitik haben nur begrenzt Erfolge gezeigt. Ein Grund dafür könnte sein, dass die Mittel der Job-Center für Eingliederungsleistungen strukturell unterfinanziert sind. Das stagnierende Gesamtbudget muss zu immer größeren Teilen zur Finanzierung steigender Verwaltungsausgaben herangezogen werden. Seit 2012 sanken die für Arbeitsmarktpolitik verausgabten Mittel um 386 Millionen Euro. Zwar sank auch die Anzahl der erwerbsfähigen Hilfebedürftigen, dies reichte zur Kompensation aber nicht aus. Das nominale pro-Kopf-Budget ist in diesem Zeitraum um acht Prozent gesunken. Eine Lösung des Problems muss folglich erstens darin bestehen, den Job-Centern ein ausreichendes Budget zur Verfügung zu stellen. Zweitens gilt es, geeignete arbeitsmarktpolitische Maßnahmen zu ergreifen. In dieser Hinsicht können die Befunde der Evaluationsforschung wichtige Hinweise liefern. Vorsicht ist bei der Idee geboten, einen dritten Arbeitsmarkt für vermeintlich chancenlose Langzeitarbeitslose einzurichten. Dies käme dem Versuch gleich, das Arbeitslosenproblem zu lösen, indem man diese in den Staatsdienst übernimmt. Stattdessen erscheint es angebracht, die Bemühungen um die Aktivierung zu intensivieren. Dazu braucht es eine höhere Kontaktdichte zwischen Arbeitslosen und Fallmanagern, die nur mit einer entsprechend ausgebauten Betreuungsrelation sichergestellt werden kann.
I38|Argumente für den Verkauf kommunaler Wohnungen|Die kommunalen Wohnungsgesellschaften in Deutschland verfügen noch über einen Bestand von 2,3 Millionen Wohnungen. Diese Wohnungen befinden sich vor allem in Großstädten, womit auch der kommunale Wohnungsbestand vom Immobilienmarktboom seit 2000 profitiert. In den 2000er Jahren wurde der öffentliche Wohnungsbestand reduziert, was damals zu zahlreichen Protesten führte und noch heute Gegenstand der politischen Diskussionen ist. Angesichts der stark gestiegenen Preise sollte aber erneut über Verkäufe nachgedacht werden. Mit einem Verkauf könnten sich zahlreiche Kommunen auf einen Schlag entschulden oder zumindest ihre Schulden deutlich abbauen. Damit könnte die Zinslast gesenkt und Mittel für Investitionen in die soziale Infrastruktur freigesetzt werden, namentlich für die Sanierung von Schulen, die Einrichtung von Kitas, den Erhalt und Ausbau des ÖPNV oder auch für die Feuerwehr und die Polizei. Das Gegenargument, kommunale Wohnungsunternehmen leisteten einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Sozialpolitik, greift nicht, da viele kommunale Wohnungsgesellschaften längst zu ähnlichen Konditionen vermieten wie große, ehemals öffentliche Wohnungsgesellschaften. Und selbst wenn unterhalb des Marktniveaus angeboten wird, profitieren hiervon nur zu einem geringen Teil bedürftige Haushalte: Nur 16,9 Prozent der Mieter kommunaler Wohnungen in Berlin verfügen über ein Einkommen von weniger als 60 Prozent des Median-Einkommens und gelten damit als armutsgefährdet, aber über 20 Prozent verfügen über mehr als 120 Prozent des mittleren Einkommens. Auch die unter dem Begriff der Stadtrendite subsummierten Leistungen der Wohnungsgesellschaften für die Stadt sind nicht überzeugend. Schließlich engagieren sich auch private Wohnungsunternehmen aus Eigeninteresse für die soziale Stabilität und Attraktivität ihrer Stadtviertel, da hiervon auch ihre Rendite abhängt. Angesichts gleichgerichteter Interessen bestehen somit genügend Ansätze für Kooperationen von Kommunen und privaten Wohnungsunternehmen. Ein Verkauf kommunaler Wohnungsunternehmen oder zumindest einzelner Bestände sollte daher geprüft werden, um die wirtschaftlichen Rahmenbedingungen der Städte und damit schluss-endlich die Lebensbedingungen deren Bewohner zu verbessern.
I38|Wo Pflegebedürftige häufig Sozialhilfe in Anspruch nehmen: Hilfe zur Pflege in den einzelnen Regionen|Die Anzahl der Pflegebedürftigen, die auf Hilfe zur Pflege angewiesen sind, steigt immer weiter. Auch wenn dies nicht zwangsläufig bedeutet, dass Pflegebedürftigkeit zunehmend in die Bedürftigkeit führt - denn insgesamt steigt auch die Zahl der Pflegebedürftigen - ist dies doch eine weitere Herausforderung, der die Politik begegnen muss. Betroffen sind hier vor allem auch die Träger der Sozialhilfe, die nicht auf Bundesebene angesiedelt sind: Je nach Bundesland sind unterschiedliche Träger für die Hilfe zur Pflege verantwortlich - Kreise (und damit mittelbar die Kommunen) und kreisfreie Städte, höhere Kommunalverbände wie beispielsweise die Landschaftsverbände, teilweise die Länder direkt. Allerdings ist diese Herausforderung keineswegs bundesweit gleich dringlich. Erstens variieren die Ausgaben für die Hilfe zur Pflege je nach Bundesland erheblich - und das nicht nur absolut, sondern auch pro Empfänger der Hilfe zur Pflege. Zweitens unterscheiden sich die Zahlen der Empfänger der Hilfe zur Pflege auch innerhalb der Bundesländer zwischen den einzelnen Kreisen und kreisfreien Städten - sowohl gemessen an der jeweiligen Bevölkerung als auch im Verhältnis zu den jeweiligen Pflegefallzahlen vor Ort. Angesichts dieser regional divergierenden Inanspruchnahme der Hilfe zur Pflege ist daher nicht nur der Bund, sondern in zunehmendem Maß auch die Kommunalpolitik gefragt, um gemäß der Bedingungen vor Ort die passenden Strategien zu entwickeln. Denn die Bundespolitik kann nur einheitliche Rahmenbedingungen festlegen, die je nach kommunaler Problemlage spezifischen Lösungen aber lassen sich nur durch Engagement der Beteiligten in den Regionen finden.
I38|"Stellungnahme zu einer öffentlichen Anhörung des Ausschusses für Gesundheit: zu dem Antrag ""Eigenanteile in Pflegeheimen senken - Menschen mit Pflegebedarf finanziell entlasten"" (BT-Drucksache 19/960)"|"Immer mehr Menschen nehmen die Sozialhilfeleistung ""Hilfe zur Pflege"" in Anspruch. Allerdings bedeutet das nicht automatisch, dass Pflegebedürftigkeit heute häufiger in die Bedürftigkeit führt als noch vor zehn Jahren. Denn auch die Pflegefallzahlen insgesamt sind in den letzten Jahren immer weiter gestiegen. Setzt man die Anzahl der Empfänger von Hilfe zur Pflege und die der Pflegebedürftigen insgesamt ins Verhältnis, zeigt sich, dass der Anteil der Hilfeempfänger an den Pflegebedürftigen fast konstant geblieben ist - ein Aufwärtstrend hat nicht stattgefunden. Das gilt nicht nur im bundesweiten Durchschnitt, sondern auch für die einzelnen Bundesländer - allerdings mit deutlichen regionalen Unterschieden: Waren in Hamburg in 2015 knapp ein Viertel der Pflegebedürftigen auf diese staatliche Unterstützung angewiesen, haben in Brandenburg im selben Jahr nur rund 7 Prozent diese Sozialleistung erhalten. Erkennbar ist bisher nur, dass im bundesweiten Durchschnitt insbesondere Pflegebedürftige, die in Pflegeheimen versorgt werden, Hilfe zur Pflege beziehen: So erhalten zwar ungefähr ein Drittel aller Pflegebedürftigen in Pflegeheimen ""Hilfe zur Pflege"", von einer generellen, drastischen Zunahme in den letzten Jahren kann aber auch hier nicht die Rede sein. Auch hier zeigen sich allerdings regionale Unterschiede: Insbesondere in den Stadtstaaten Berlin (45 Prozent), Hamburg (55 Prozent) und Bremen (66 Prozent), aber auch in den Flächenländern Sachsen (66 Prozent) und Schleswig-Holstein (68 Prozent) leben anteilig weniger Empfänger von Hilfe zur Pflege in Einrichtungen als im bundesweiten Durchschnitt - in Berlin werden sogar mehr Empfänger außerhalb von Einrichtungen gepflegt. Auch diese bundeslandspezifischen Anteile sind seit 2009 weitestgehend konstant geblieben und schwanken um die hier ausgewiesenen Werte. So gibt es durchaus regionale Unterschiede, aber keine deutlichen Hinweise, dass sich in bestimmten Bundesländern Probleme in der Vergangenheit massiv verschärft haben. Das heißt jedoch nicht, dass dies auch für die Zukunft gilt. Entscheidend sind hier nicht nur Faktoren wie die künftige Einkommens- und Vermögenssituation der Haushalte und ihre familiäre Situation, sondern auch die Höhe der Pflegekosten, die durch den Fachkräftemangel weiter steigen können. Aus diesem Grund ist die Politik gefordert, mindestens für Planungssicherheit zu sorgen und die Leistungen der Pflegepflichtversicherung zu stabilisieren. Denn nur so ist private Vorsorge möglich. Ob eine Pflicht zur ergänzenden Vorsorge für den Pflegefall nötig ist, kann nach dem gegenwärtigen Forschungsstand nicht eindeutig beantwortet werden. Dazu ist bisher zu wenig darüber bekannt, wie genau Menschen für den Pflegefall vorsorgen. Möglicherweise reicht eine deutliche und offene Kommunikation aus, um private Vorsorge zusätzlich zu erleichtern. Möglicherweise sind auch neue, freiwillige Formen im Bereich einer ergänzenden Vorsorge hilfreich."
I38|Optimal Taxation under Different Concepts of Justness|A common assumption in the optimal taxation literature is that the social planner maximizes a welfarist social welfare function with weights decreasing with income. However, high transfer withdrawal rates in many countries imply very low weights for the working poor in practice. We reconcile this puzzle by generalizing the optimal taxation framework by Saez (2002) to allow for alternatives to welfarism. We calculate weights of a social planner’s function as implied by the German tax and transfer system based on the concepts of welfarism, minimum absolute and relative sacrifice, as well as subjective justness. For the latter we use a novel question from the German Socio-Economic Panel. We find that the minimum absolute sacrifice principle is in line with social weights that decline with net income. Absolute subjective justness is roughly in line with decreasing social weights, which is reflected by preferences of men, West Germans, and supporters of the grand coalition parties.
I38|Social image concerns and welfare take-up|Using a laboratory experiment, we present first evidence that social image concerns causally reduce the take-up of an individually beneficial transfer. Our design manipulates the informativeness of the take-up decision by varying whether transfer eligibility is based on ability or luck, and how the transfer is financed. We find that subjects avoid the inference both of being low-skilled (ability stigma) and of being willing to live off others (free-rider stigma). Using a placebo treatment, we exclude other explanations for the observed stigma effects. Although stigma reduces take-up, elicitation of political preferences reveals that only a minority of “taxpayers” vote for the public transfer.
I38|Prekarität in Deutschland?!|Vor dem Hintergrund der sozialen Marktwirtschaft wird Prekarität als eine Folge von arbeitsmarkt- und sozialpolitischen Veränderungen diskutiert. Es wird bilanziert, dass der soziale Zusammenhalt der Arbeitsgesellschaft in Deutschland gefährdet ist. Im Anschluss an diese Diskussion geht die vorliegende Studie empirisch der Frage nach, ob ein Prekariat existiert: Gibt es Personengruppen, die trotz Erwerbstätigkeit dauerhaft in Unsicherheit leben? Konzentriert sich Prekarität hauptsächlich auf geringqualifizierte Personen oder ist sie vor allem an bestimmte Lebensphasen und -übergänge gebunden? Damit Prekarität in ihren verschiedenen Facetten und Abstufungen erfasst werden kann, wird in dem vorliegenden Papier ein umfassendes Set an Indikatoren zur quantitativen, multidimensionalen Messung von (kumulativer) Prekarität vorgestellt. Auf Basis des Sozioökonomischen Panels (SOEP) werden je sieben Indikatoren operationalisiert, mit denen sowohl prekäre Beschäftigung als auch prekäre Haushaltslagen erfasst und im Zeitverlauf (1993-2012) analysiert werden können. Damit soll der Grundstein für eine quantitative Analyse von Prekarität gelegt werden, um vor diesem Hintergrund die Institutionen des Arbeitsmarkts und der sozialen Sicherung zukünftig neu bewerten zu können.
I38|Money vs. Time: Family Income, Maternal Labor Supply, and Child Development|We study the effect of family income and maternal hours worked on child development. Our instrumental variable analysis suggests different results for cognitive and behavioral development. An additional $1,000 in family income improves cognitive development by 4.4 percent of a standard deviation but has no effect on behavioral development. A yearly increase of 100 work hours negatively affects both outcomes by approximately 6 percent of a standard deviation. The quality of parental investment matters and the substitution effect (less parental time) dominates the income effect (higher earnings) when the after-tax hourly wage is below $13.50. Results call for consideration of child care and minimum wage policies that foster both maternal employment and child development.
I38|Eu transfers and euroscepticism: can’t buy me love?|This paper investigates whether EU redistributive policies improved the public attitude toward European integration, both in terms of public opinion and in terms of political preferences. We build a new dataset combining data from the European Social Survey, different data sources for political parties’ stances and transfer records from EU institutions. We focus on the regional Cohesion Policy, within which the Convergence Objective program offers a quasi-experimental framework that allows us to single out these effects by means of a regression discontinuity approach. Results show that EU transfers have mitigated the rise of Eurosceptic attitudes and reduced the political consensus for anti- EU parties in long-time recipient regions. We estimate that increasing the regional per capita EU transfers by 1000€ over the 2000-2014 period reduces the share of Eurosceptic individuals by about 8 percentage points and voters’ support for anti-EU parties by 10 percentage points. The effects are homogeneous across different socio-economic groups, including the most disadvantaged ones. Other attitudes that are often associated with Euroscepticism (i.e. anti-trade and anti-immigration stances) are not substantially affected by EU regional transfers.
I38|Fiscal decentralisation and the distributive incidence of the great recession|We argue that fiscal decentralisation is one important explanation for variation in distributive outcomes following the Great Recession. Using a difference in differences approach, we examine how fiscal decentralisation mediated the link between spatial distribution, redistributive effort, and interpersonal inequality in 21 OECD cases in the years following the Great Recession. We find that fiscally decentralised nations saw increased interpersonal inequality and lower redistribution, but lower inter-regional inequality. We attribute these results to the weaker redistributive mechanisms in fiscally decentralized nations, which increased interpersonal inequality while preserving market-driven productivity declines in high productivity areas that temporary increased regional convergence.
I38|Development Economics Meets the Challenges of Lagging U.S. Areas: Applications to Education, Health and Nutrition, Behavior, and Infrastructure|This chapter examines the development economics evidence base for insights into policy reforms that would benefit struggling areas in the United States. My focus is on improving education, physical and mental health, infrastructure, and institutions. First, consistent with findings on education policy effectiveness, I propose raising the legal minimum dropout age (prospectively to 19), providing better information about the benefits of completing high school, supporting targeted paraprofessional tutoring, and providing family financial incentives for attending school and graduating from high school. Second, to improve health outcomes in struggling areas, the focus is using and building on existing effective health and nutrition programs and services, identifying ways to include more families who are eligible for but not participating in these programs. Moreover, the recent development and behavioral economics evidence base has extended our understanding of the psychological, cognitive, and economic behavioral lives of the poor; the literature highlights the ways that poverty can impede cognitive functioning, with implications for policies to uplift lagging U.S. areas. Third, a review of evidence on the benefits of improving lagging rural and urban area transportation infrastructure points to the likely benefits of improved connectivity for lagging U.S. areas: reversing the legacy of past discriminatory policies, encouraging sector-based clusters, and extending access to high-speed internet. Finally, the chapter highlights the relevance of some cross-cutting themes in development economics, including the high returns to reliable household microdata and the importance of improving institutions to enable more inclusive, substantial, and lasting progress.
I38|Targeting mechanisms for cash transfers using regional aggregates|Abstract We propose an empirical method for improving food assistance scoring and targeting, which minimizes under-coverage and leakage of food and cash assistance programs. The empirical strategy relies on a joint econometric estimation of food insecurity and economic vulnerability indicators at the household level, using data-driven instead of predetermined quantiles. We applied the method to recent micro data on Syrian refugees in Lebanon, to explore how regional and community-based aggregates can improve the targeting effectiveness of aid programs, notably food aid by the World Food Program in Lebanon. Our results confirm that using regional aggregates are useful for augmenting the Balanced Poverty Accuracy Criterion, and our method performs much better than the current policy in terms of targeting effectiveness and accuracy for economically vulnerable households.
I38|Gender Biases in Bank Lending: Lessons from Microcredit in France|Abstract The evidence on gender discrimination in lending remains controversial. To capture gender biases in banks’ loan allocations, we observe the impact on the applicants of a microfinance institution (MFI) and exploit the natural experiment of a regulatory change imposing a strict EUR 10,000 loan ceiling on microcredit. Descriptive statistics indicate that the presence of the ceiling is associated both with bank-MFI co-financing and with harsher treatment of female borrowers. To investigate causal links, we develop an econometric approach that addresses the concerns of selection biases, multicollinearity, and endogeneity. Our empirical findings suggest that the change in the MFI’s gender-related attitude was triggered by banks through co-financing. Hence, we speculate that co-financing pushes ceiling-constrained MFIs to import whatever biases in loan granting that the banks are prone to. Overall, this paper stresses that apparently benign regulations such as loan ceilings can significantly harm the women’s empowerment efforts made by MFIs.
I38|Early-life correlates of later-life well-being: evidence from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study|We here use data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) to provide one of the first analyses of the distal (early-life) and proximal (later-life) correlates of older-life subjective well-being. Unusually, we have two distinct measures of the latter: happiness and eudaimonia. Even after controlling for proximal covariates, outcomes at age 18 (IQ score, parental income and parental education) remain good predictors of well-being over 50 years later. In terms of the proximal covariates, mental health and social participation are the strongest predictors of both measures of well-being in older age. However, there are notable differences in the other correlates of happiness and eudaimonia. As such, well-being policy will depend to an extent on which measure is preferred
I38|Economic incentives, disability insurance and labor supply|Using a difference-in-difference model on full population data, I estimate the labor market response to a 2015 Norwegian disability insurance (DI) reform. The reform introduced an incentive program to encourage DI beneficiaries to increase their labor supply, and I find that the program significantly increased the average working hours and modestly affected the labor market participation of DI beneficiaries. There is significant heterogeneity in the estimated effects; young beneficiaries respond positively along the extensive and the intensive labor supply margins. The analysis accentuates the importance of analyzing both labor supply margins when evaluating the effects of DI reforms.
I38|Caseworker's Discretion and the Effectiveness of Welfare-to-Work Programs|In this paper we focus on the role of caseworkers in the assignment and take-up of welfare-to-work programs. We conduct a field experiment that generates exogenous variation in the assignment to different policy regimes to caseworkers. The experiment allows us to provide evidence on the effectiveness of welfare-to-work programs and to study how caseworkers exploit their discretion in assigning these programs to welfare recipients. We find substantial heterogeneity in how caseworkers assign welfare-to-work programs. Participation in the experiment and learning about the effectiveness of the different programs does not induce caseworkers to focus more on the effective programs. This implies that obtaining knowledge about welfare-to-work programs is not enough to improve policy, also effort on implementation is required.
I38|Universal preschool programs and long-term child outcomes: A systematic review|What are the long-term effects of universal preschool programs on child outcomes? We review 26 studies using natural experiments to estimate the effects of universal preschool programs for children aged 0-6 years on child outcomes measured from third grade to adulthood. Studies comparing preschool with parental, family, or other informal modes of care show mixed effects on test scores, and on measures related to health, well-being, and behavior. However, all estimates for outcomes related to adequate primary and secondary school progression, years of schooling, highest degree completed, employment, and earnings indicate beneficial average effects of universal preschool programs. Three of the included studies calculate benefits-to-costs ratios and find ratios clearly above one. Universal preschool tends to be more beneficial for children with low socioeconomic status, and there are not consistently different effects for boys or girls. Only three studies compare two alternative types of universal preschool programs in terms of long-term outcomes.
I38|Cesarean Sections for High-Risk Births: Health, Fertility and Labor Market Outcomes|Despite the fact that Cesarean section (C-section) is the most commonly performed surgery in a number of industrialized countries, little is known about the long-term consequences for the mothers and children involved. In this study, I use a sample of high-risk births—namely, breech births, in which the fetus is presented with its head upward instead of downward—to study the causal effect of C-sections on child health and on the health, fertility and labor market responses for mothers. Because selection into C-section may be endogenous, I exploit an information shock to doctors in 2000, in which new scientific evidence about the benefits of planned C-sections for breech births led to a sharp 23% increase in planned C-sections. Using Swedish registry data, I find that having a C-section improves child health in both the short and long run, indicated by higher Apgar scores at birth and fewer nights hospitalized during ages 1-7. I find little evidence to suggest any significant impact on maternal health, future fertility or maternal labor market outcomes.
I38|Integration after 2015. What can Sweden learn from Germany?|In 2015 and 2016 almost 2.7 million asylum seekers travelled to Europe in search of protection. More than half of them, 1.4 million people, sought refuge in Germany or Sweden. Germany received the most people by far but Sweden took in more as a share of its population. The big influx of refugees induced major changes in migration and integration in both countries. This paper compares the policies on labour market integration in both countries focusing on what Sweden can learn from Germany to improve integration.
I38|Inspiration for integration. Labour market policies for refugees in five Northern European countries|The refugee influx in 2015 marked the largest mass movement in Europe since WWII. More than half of the arrivals applied for asylum on the northernmost edge of the continent: Germany was the top destination by far but Sweden received more asylum seekers relative to its population. The Netherlands, Norway, and Denmark also took in significant numbers. The developments in 2015 caused several of these countries to reconsider their policies on migration and integration of refugees. This paper compares the policies in these five countries after 2015 focusing on what Sweden can learn from the others.
I38|The European Social Pillar: A Threat to Welfare and Prosperity?|In November 2017, the European Union proclaimed its fourth pillar, The European Pillar of Social Rights., to promote a “truly pan-European” labour market. A large number of specific social rights are endorsed. This paper investigates the potential short- and long-term consequences of the social pillar on the welfare and prosperity of Europe. Moreover, we discuss its potential effects on the legitimacy of the European Union. Our conclusions indicate that rather than to “support and complement” the social and labour market policies of the Member States, the European Union is likely to replace these policies with the “better” goals of the Union in an effort to fully implement the principles established in the social pillar. The principle of subsidiarity in this case promotes centralisations. There are strong reasons to believe that increased centralisation to EU-level in these areas will reduce preference satisfaction, weaken accountability and decrease efficiency and innovation. In the long run the social pillar therefore is likely to be a threat to welfare and prosperity in Europe, and as a consequence, cause damage to the legitimacy of the European Union.
I38|Long-Term Effects of Childhood Nutrition: Evidence from a School Lunch Reform|We examine the long-term impact of a policy that introduced free and nutritious school lunches in Swedish primary schools. For this purpose, we use historical data on the gradual implementation of the policy across municipalities and employ a difference-in-differences design to estimate the impact of this lunch policy on a broad range of medium and long-term outcomes, including lifetime income, health, cognitive skills, and education. Our results show that the school lunch program generated substantial long-term benefits, where pupils exposed to the program during their entire primary school period have 3 percent greater life-time earnings. In addition, we find the effect to be greater for pupils that were exposed at earlier ages and for pupils from poor households. Finally, exposure to the school lunch program had substantial effects on educational attainment and health and these effects can explain a large part of the return to school lunches.
I38|The Factors Of Physical Activities In Russian Youth: Evidence From Micro-Data|Physical activity is considered today as a leading factor in health and well-being in developed countries. With decreasing levels of alcohol and tobacco consumption, widespread sedentary lifestyles have taken centre stage among the predictors of non-communicable diseases. That is why Russia, along with other countries, has adopted the “Physical activity strategy for the WHO European Region 2016–2025”. Young people are among the target groups of public policy promoting physical activity. This paper investigates physical activity among young people aged 15 to 24 years. The empirical study is based on a descriptive and econometric analysis of micro-data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS), 2000–2016. The research shows that 50% of young men and 65% of young women do not exercise on a regular basis. Both for men and for women, the probability of physical activity is positively related to their educational level, household income, and residence in capital cities. Negative relations were found between the probability of physical activity and smoking, status of married person, and employed and non-employed status. The results for alcohol consumption, body mass index and self-assessed health are inconclusive for this age group. The results confirm the necessity of better-targeted public policy motivating physical activity in youth. Overall, policy measures motivating young people to take part in physical activity will have a long-term effect. Habits developed in youth often persist into adulthood. The result will be a gain in the health and longevity of the Russian population.
I38|Money vs. time: family income, maternal labor supply, and child development|We study the effect of family income and maternal hours worked on child development. Our instrumental variable analysis suggests different results for cognitive and behavioral development. An additional $1,000 in family income improves cognitive development by 4.4 percent of a standard deviation but has no effect on behavioral development. A yearly increase of 100 work hours negatively affects both outcomes by approximately 6 percent of a standard deviation. The quality of parental investment matters and the substitution effect (less parental time) dominates the income effect (higher earnings) when the after-tax hourly wage is below $13.50. Results call for consideration of child care and minimum wage policies that foster both maternal employment and child development.
I38|The Effects of Universal Public Childcare Provision on Cases of Child Neglect and Abuse|We investigate the impact of childcare provision on cases of child abuse and neglect in Germany between 2002 and 2014. For identification, we exploit a governmental reform introducing mandatory early child care. The implementation at the county level generated large temporal and spatial variation in childcare coverage. Our measure of child abuse and neglect comes from a unique high-quality administrative data set that covers all child protection cases at the German county level. The estimated ITT effect shows a decline by 0.24 cases per 1,000 children if a county increases childcare slots above the median, which is a reduction of 21.4 percent from the mean. This finding is of high economic relevance given the enormous costs of child abuse and neglect for the society. Our results show that the provision of universal public child care can be an effective policy to prevent part of these costs.
I38|"The ""family 500+"" child allowance and female labour supply in Poland"|In 2016 the Polish government introduced a large new child benefit, called “Family 500+”, with the aim to increase fertility from a low level and reduce child poverty. The benefit is universal for the second and every further child and means-tested for the first child. Increasing out-of-work income significantly, the transfer can reduce incentives to participate in the labour market. We study the impact of the new benefit on female labour supply, using Polish Labour Force Survey data. Based on a difference-in-differences methodology we find that the labour market participation rates of women with children decreased after the introduction of the benefit compared to childless women. The estimates suggest that by mid-2017 the labour force participation rate of mothers dropped by 2- 3 percentage points, depending on the estimation specification, as a result of the “Family 500+” benefit. The effect was higher among women with lower levels of education and living in small towns.
I38|Redistribution via VAT and Cash Transfers: An Assessment in Four Low and Middle Income Countries|As in high-income countries, reduced rates of vat and vat exemptions (preferential vat rates) are a common feature of indirect tax systems in lmics. Many of the goods and services that are granted preferential rates - such as foodstuffs and kerosene - seem likely to receive such treatment on the grounds that they provide a means for the government to indirectly target poorer households, for whom such expenditures may take up a large proportion of their total budget. We use microsimulation methods to estimate the impact of preferential vat rates in four lmic countries, considering their effect on revenues, poverty, inequality, and across the consumption distribution. We consider whether other policy tools might be better suited for the pursuit of distributional objectives by estimating the impact of existing cash transfer schemes and a hypothetical scenario where the revenue raised from broadening the vat base is used to fund a universal basic income (ubi) in each country. We find that although preferential vat rates reduce poverty, they are not well targeted towards poor households overall. Existing cash transfer schemes are better targeted but would not provide a suitable means of compensation for a broader vat base given issues related to coverage and targeting mechanisms. Despite being completely untargeted, a ubi funded by the revenue gains from a broader vat base would create large net gains for poor households and reduce inequality and most measures of extreme poverty in each of the countries studied - even if only 75% of the additional vat revenue was disbursed as ubi payments.
I38|The return to work and how it is taxed: a dynamic perspective| This paper provides an empirical account of the dynamic return to work, and how this is affected by taxes and benefits. In doing so we bring the insights from the literature on dynamic labour supply to the issue of estimating the financial return to work and how it is taxed, where the past literature has focused on the current period return. We do this with two new summary measures: the forward-looking replacement rate (FLRR), which measures the dynamic return to working at all, and the forward-looking participation tax rate (FLPTR), which measures the impact of personal taxes and transfers on the dynamic return to work, and implement these using simulated data from a sophisticated, structural dynamic model of education and labour supply. We find that the dynamic return to work is much higher than a static measure would imply: at the start of working life, the expected FLRR and static RR differ by at least 5 percentage points for more than two thirds of women, and by over 10 percentage points for over a third of women. These results are driven by returns to experience. In contrast, we find a dynamic perspective makes relatively little difference to the extent to which personal taxes and transfers reduce the return to work, with the expected FLPTR and static PTR differing little for most women in our data. This mainly reflects the fact that that the UK tax and benefit system tends to treat the future returns to working today similarly to how it treats the current-period return.
I38|Globalization, income tax structure and the redistribution–progressivity tradeoff|We build a simple model in which (i) households select their country of residence depending on income taxation and on the cost of migrating and living abroad, and (ii) globalization comes with a decrease in the cost of migration. Globalization leads to (i) a maximum between-country income-tax gap which is lower for the high incomes, (ii) a decrease in income tax rates and (iii) a convergence in the taxation structures of the different countries. In addition, globalization generates changes in income tax schedules and redistribution which display three successive stages. In the first stage, the redistribution goal is consistent with tax progressivity. In the second stage, the tax schedule becomes regressive at the top. Thirdly, if the migration cost continues to decline, the government can typically not achieve its redistribution goal, even if redistribution is its first priority, and there is no equilibrium taxation schedule, the tax structure becoming volatile. These results are in line with observed facts. Finally, the model shows that globalization tends to generate and magnify a trade-off between less redistribution and less tax progressivity. This provides an explanation for the middle class curse and the social democrat curse experienced by a large majority of advanced countries over the last three decades.
I38|Program evaluation and ethnic differences: the Pension 65 program in Peru|We show that the introduction of a non-contributory pension program (Pension 65) in Peru had remarkably different effects for its three main ethnic groups, i.e., Mestizo, Quechua, and Aymara. The Aymara beneficiaries of the program have experienced larger increases in health and life satisfaction compared to other Peruvians. Using a panel life satisfaction regression, we find evidence for preference heterogeneity between the Aymara and the other ethnic groups that is consistent with the observed differences. Finally, we turn to the question of how the pension program can be evaluated in a robust manner while respecting the preference heterogeneity between the ethnic groups. We propose the natural criterion that a program benefits a recipient if she is lifted to a higher indifference curve. We show that the pension program was beneficial for all groups, but that more Aymara beneficiaries were lifted to a higher indifference curve compared to other Peruvians. Our proposed criterion can be useful to evaluate programs in all cases where preference differences matter.
I38|Insurance, Redistribution, and the Inequality of Lifetime Income|In this paper, we study how the tax-and-transfer system reduces the inequality of lifetime income by redistributing lifetime earnings between individuals with different skill endowments and by providing individuals with insurance against lifetime earnings risk. Based on a dynamic life-cycle model, we find that redistribution through the tax-and-transfer system offsets around half of the inequality in lifetime earnings that is due to differences in skill endowments. At the same time, taxes and transfers mitigate around 60% of the inequality in lifetime earnings that is attributable to employment and health risk. Progressive taxation of annual earnings provides little insurance against lifetime earnings risk. The lifetime insurance effects of taxation may be improved by moving to a progressive tax on lifetime earnings. Similarly, the lifetime insurance and redistributive effects of social assistance may be improved by requiring wealthy individuals to repay any social assistance received when younger.
I38|Intergenerational Spillovers in Disability Insurance|Does participation in a social assistance program by parents have spillovers on their children's own participation, future labor market attachment, and human capital investments? While intergenerational concerns have figured prominently in policy debates for decades, causal evidence is scarce due to nonrandom participation and data limitations. In this paper we exploit a 1993 policy reform in the Netherlands which tightened disability insurance (DI) criteria for existing claimants, and use rich panel data to link parents to children's long-run outcomes. The key to our regression discontinuity design is that the reform applied to younger cohorts, while older cohorts were exempted from the new rules. We find that children of parents who were pushed out of DI or had their benefits reduced are 11% less likely to participate in DI themselves, do not alter their use of other government safety net programs, and earn 2% more in the labor market as adults. The combination of reduced government transfers and increased tax revenue results in a fiscal gain of 5,900 euros per treated parent due to child spillovers by 2014. Moreover, children of treated parents complete an extra 0.12 years of schooling on average, an investment consistent with an anticipated future with less reliance on DI. Our findings have important implications for the evaluation of this and other policy reforms: ignoring parent-to-child spillovers understates the long-run cost savings of the Dutch reform by between 21 and 40% in present discounted value terms.
I38|Distributional Effects of Welfare Reform for Young Adults: An Unconditional Quantile Regression Approach|The paper evaluates the distributional effects on earnings and income of requiring young welfare recipients to fulfill conditions related to work and activation. It exploits within-social insurance office variation in policy arising from a geographically staggered reform in Norway. The reform reduced welfare uptake and for women had large, positive effects in the lower part of the earnings distribution. The effect on the distribution of total income is also positive, thus gains in earnings more than offset reduced welfare benefits. Fewer welfare payments and smaller caseloads make the policy highly cost-effective.
I38|The Labor Market Impacts of Universal and Permanent Cash Transfers: Evidence from the Alaska Permanent Fund|What are the effects of universal and permanent cash transfers on the labor market? Since 1982, all Alaskan residents have been entitled to a yearly cash dividend from the Alaska Permanent Fund. Using data from the Current Population Survey and a synthetic control method, we show that the dividend had no effect on employment, and increased part-time work by 1.8 percentage points (17 percent). Although theory and prior empirical research suggests that individual cash transfers decrease household labor supply, we interpret our results as evidence that general equilibrium effects of widespread and permanent transfers tend to offset this effect, at least on the extensive margin. Consistent with this story, we show suggestive evidence that tradable sectors experience employment reductions, while non-tradable sectors do not. Overall, our results suggest that a universal and permanent cash transfer does not significantly decrease aggregate employment.
I38|Does Workfare Work Well? The Case of the Employment Generation Program for the Poorest in Bangladesh|Evidence on the effectiveness of workfare as an anti-poverty program in developing countries is weak compared with the relatively well-established role of public works during economic crisis as a social safety net. This paper contributes to evidence building by examining the impact of a large-scale workfare program in Bangladesh, the Employment Generation Program for the Poorest. Taking advantage of the program's distinguishable feature of direct wage transfer to a person's bank account, the paper uses accessibility to local banks as an instrumental variable to identify the program's impacts on rural social assistance beneficiaries. Based on locality-by-time fixed effects models over two rounds of locality panel data, the analysis finds that the Employment Generation Program for the Poorest has contributed to increasing overall household consumption and reducing outstanding loans. In particular, expenditures on quality food and health care have significantly increased, which likely helps individuals continue to engage in income-generating activities in the labor market. However, the implementation costs and poor quality of public assets built through work projects could potentially undermine the program's efficiency. Moreover, further evidence is required on the impacts of work experience through workfare on subsequent labor market outcomes and the value of public assets, to assess the program's effectiveness compared with administratively simpler alternative instruments such as unconditional cash transfers.
I38|The Effect of Quarantining Welfare on School Attendance in Indigenous Communities|We analyze the impact of a recent initiative by the Australian Government to reduce disadvantage and improve children's welfare in Aboriginal communities. The policy – known as income management – quarantines 50 percent of welfare payments to be spent on priority goods (e.g., food, housing, education) and not on socially harmful goods (drugs, pornography, gambling). Our focus is on children's school attendance, which is a precise, high-frequency measure of community functionality and a key policy objective. We identify the causal impact of income management on attendance rates by exploiting exogenous variation in its staggered rollout across communities. We find no evidence that income management increased attendance. Rather, the introduction of income management reduced attendance by 2.7 percentage points (4 percent) on average in the first five months after which attendance eventually returned to its initial level. The attendance penalty is similar for boys and girls, but is larger for secondary school students and students with a tendency to attend school regularly. Exploring the potential mechanisms, we show that income management did not significantly affect student enrollments or mobility patterns into and out of Aboriginal communities. Nor are our results explained by confoundedness with other policy initiatives. Instead, we find that the attendance penalty associated with the introduction of income management is virtually zero after the adoption of more exible administrative arrangements suggesting that implementation issues may be responsible for the temporary reduction in school attendance that we observe.
I38|Take-up and Targeting: Experimental Evidence from SNAP|This paper develops a framework for evaluating the welfare impact of various interventions designed to increase take-up of social safety net programs in the presence of potential behavioral biases. We calibrate the key parameters using a randomized field experiment in which 30,000 elderly individuals not enrolled in – but likely eligible for – the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are either provided with information that they are likely eligible, provided with this information and also offered assistance in applying, or are in a “status quo” control group. Only 6 percent of the control group enrolls in SNAP over the next 9 months, compared to 11 percent of the Information Only group and 18 percent of the Information Plus Assistance group. The individuals who apply or enroll in response to either intervention receive lower benefits and are less sick than the average enrollee in the control group. The results are consistent with the existence of optimization frictions that are greater for needier individuals, suggesting that the poor targeting properties of the interventions reduce their welfare gains.
I38|Sukuk-waqf: The Islamic Solution for Public Finance Deficits|The majority of Muslim countries face increasing pressure on their budget, which pushes to more public spending. Eventually, the main victim of this situation will be the welfare of Muslim communities. Despite Islam does not tolerate negligence regarding the importance of State as major player in preserving the welfare of Muslim communities, it offers a third option to support public effort through the institution of Waqf. Indeed, this institution has played a crucial role all along Muslim civilization and it is invited to more innovation to answer to today’s challenges. Sukuk-Waqf can be seen as the perfect sustainable financing instrument offered by Islam to help sustain public spending by the people and for the people. This paper will try to examine the concept of Waqf, cash Waqf and Sukuk Waqf is Islam and their evolution during Muslim civilization. Finally, it will go through modern attempts to implement this model that can answer the need for financing to support public effort to preserve the welfare of Muslim citizens.
I38|Der Wohlfahrtstaat als Grundbestandteil des modernen demokratischen Staatsgefüges<BR>[The welfare state as a basic component of the modern democratic state structure]|Defining the welfare state is not a simpleminded task. Actually, there are numerous definitions which try to reflect at least some of the basic characteristics of the welfare state or its objectives and its functions. For some, there is primarily an institutional parameter, for others there are functional issues which have to be firstly indicated and for others, the ideological and political factors determine the definition and the attitude towards the welfare state. Apart from all these crucial ascertainments, there are some basic fundamental characteristics and values of the welfare state which render it as a precondition of the existence of the modern state. Unquestionably, it reflects a distinct part of the state but most importantly, it comprises a prerequisite for its existence. This is the exact aim of this paper; to surpass the theoretical diversifications and to find the fundamental common ground which forms the indispensability for the existence of the welfare state.
I38|Modern public finances as a proposal for an emerging country: The social approach in the fight against poverty in Mexico|In Mexico, the management of public resources has been questioned by the State, and mainly the results that the public administration at its three levels (federal, state and municipal), by the lack of transparency in the application and verification of public resources. The experience that gives us the operation of different emerging programs that focused on reducing social and economic inequality in the country, we can locate them as the first attempts in the search for a solution that is complex. Moving from the role of the benefactor and welfare state to the promoter of the regions and in the recognition of the focalization of priority attention areas, the path that has been taken is not only the beginning. Recognizing the public nature of public finances as a promoter of social development, we must understand it as the one assumed by the State through social, political and economic co-responsibility to solve poverty and marginalization of its own public policy orientation and vision of solution has been made since the eighties. From the above, we can point out some preliminary conclusions including the study of the indigenous language-speaking population with a high level of social exclusion in the methodology for the definition of multidimensional poverty in Mexico, will allow the allocation of public resources in the fight against poverty to be effective since it will make it possible to identify to the target population that is subject to social exclusion and marginalization. This invites us to a final reflection: What to do to address the just social demands of the indigenous population that is immersed in poverty, marginalization and exclusion? What to do so that they do not leave their communities, and if they have already done so, how to attend to the needs of family groups that are due to the expense of a remittance that may never arrive?
I38|Lumping Together Democracy and Dictatorship: Has Macro Dynamics of Poverty Remained Steady in Pakistan|In this study we check the relationship between macroeconomics variables with poverty. We select head count ratio proxy of poverty as dependent variable and GDP, unemployment rate, literacy rate, rural population and worker remittances as independent variables. For the analysis of the data we take time series data from 1987-2011 and established the long run and short run relationship between dependent and independent variables. First of all we check the normality of the data by descriptive statistics, further we check the stationarity of the data by applying ADF test. For long run relationship between dependent and independent variables we applied FMOLS techniques and relationship in short run checked by EMC methods. Results of the data shows, macroeconomic variables especially literacy rate and rural population has major factors that disturb poverty level in Pakistan. GDP have negative and insignificant impact on poverty. Literacy rate have positive and significantly related with poverty. Worker remittances have negative and significant impact on poverty, while rural population has negative and significant impact on poverty. Unemployment has positive and insignificant impact on poverty in Pakistan.
I38|Analysis Of Weaknesses Of Coastal Community Economy Empowerment Program (Pemp) And National Program Of Community Empowerment Of Independent Marine And Fisheries (Pnpm-Mkp) On Traditional Fishermen In Indonesia|Indonesia has an abundant fisheries resource. The potential has not been well this is marked by the small contribution of marine and fishery sector to the national income of only 14.7% of the total gross domestic product (GDP), compared to other countries. The dramatic phenomenon between the potential and utilization of marine resources implies to the predominant level of coastal communities who mostly work as fishermen at sea. In order to go to sea with a simple technology also with low human resources make the living standard of traditional fishermen may be categorized as poor. When compared to other farming groups in the agricultural sector, traditional fishermen are among the poorest. With an already many government empowerment programs, yet it has not managed to raise the standard of living for the traditional fishermen. The research is aimed to describe the implementation and weakness of Coastal Community Economy Empowerment Program (PEMP) and National Program of Community Empowerment of Independent Marine and Fisheries (PNPM-MKP) on the traditional fishermen of Percut Village, Percut Sei Tuan in North Sumatra, Indonesia. Type of research is descriptive with 10 traditional fishermen, the fishermen group committee and the marine and fisheries department’s officials. Data were collected by observation, in-depth interview and focus group discussion (FGD). The result of the study of socio-economic condition of traditional fishermen of Percut Village is badly seen from the indicators of housing and sanitation that are not suitable for healthy living, limited fishing equipment and over fishing catching areas.
I38|Challenges in Establishing an Islamic Banking and Finance System: Evidence from Ghana|After sixty-one years of independence, there is no single Islamic banking institution operating in Ghana. Given that Muslims are commanded to stay away from usury, coupled with the popularity of Islamic finance globally, it is surprising why the Islamic banking industry is yet to take root in the country. This paper seeks to determine whose responsibility it is to initiate the establishment of an Islamic banking and finance system. The genesis of Islamic banks in Egypt, Malaysia and Bangladesh were reviewed, and compared with the situation in Ghana. The analysis show that stakeholders such as devoted Muslim businessmen, governments, and well-informed Muslim groups, are well placed to initiate the establishment of Islamic banks.
I38|Macroeconomic Determinants of Infant Mortality in WAEMU Countries: Evidence from Panel Data Analysis|This paper investigates the macroeconomic determinants of infant mortality in WAEMU countries for the period 1980¨C2016. A panel data model from WAEMU countries was used to identify the macroeconomic determinants of infant mortality. We used fixed effects instrumental variables (FE-IV) estimator in panel data model. Our analysis using econometric estimations after correcting for endogeneity showed that female literacy, GDP per capita as a proxy for income, public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP and urbanization significantly affect infant mortality rate in a negative way.
I38|Corruption vs reforms: Why do voters prefer the former?|In this paper, we address the question of why voters tolerate corrupt politicians. Standard economic techniques such as expected utility maximization under uncertainty are employed. We show that a corrupt politician is less likely to institute reforms which can cause short-term losses for voters during a transitional period or lead with some probability to non-success. Voters' higher risk aversion causes an increased fear of reforms and higher tolerance for corruption. We also show that during an economic crisis the corruptionists' optimal strategy is not to institute reforms, as models with honest politicians predict, but to reduce the level of corruption. Using panel data techniques, we show that such a strategy is in line with the empirical CIS data; however, it follows with a short delay.
I38|Microfinance Models: Lessons Learned|Microfinance is crucial to accelerate economic growth in a country, and is also important for financial inclusion. This article is a concise brief on some microfinance delivery models with the aim to identify some lesson learned. Microfinance offers positive prospects for stronger development finance. The support of the government should be sustained and the model of microfinance delivery model should be reviewed from time to time.
I38|A lakhatás megfizethetősége: lakbérek és albérletpiac<BR>[Affordability of housing: rentals and apartment market]|The affordable and adequate housing in a safe environment is a basic necessity and a fundamental right. There are two major disadvantages of renting a home in Hungary today: uncertainty and high price. However, many international examples show that renting a home is often more popular and cheaper than buying a private home: while only 9% of the population rent a flat in Hungary, almost half of the population in Germany, and more than 40% in Austria and over 30 % in the Netherlands live in a rental apartment. Even the significant differences between the rental fees do not diminish the migration of the Central and Eastern European labour force, since an average of € 1,200 in London and € 1,500 in Berlin remain at the foreign employees for living after the payment of it, while at home it is only € 500. Housing affordability is a problem in all the European Union countries. It is worth noting that the tighter state oversight of the apartment market is commonplace in Western and Northern Europe.
