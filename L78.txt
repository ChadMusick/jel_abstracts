L78|Agency in regional path development: Towards a bio-economy in Värmland, Sweden|Despite significant interest in regional industrial restructuring in economic geography, surprisingly scarce attention has been paid to the changing role of agency over time. The current paper develops a framework for understanding the role of multiple types of agents and the agency they exercise for new path development. The framework is employed in a longitudinal study of industry development in Värmland, Sweden, from forestry towards a bio-economy. The analysis highlights how actors exercise very different types of agency in different periods of path development.
L78|Optimal Environmental Targeting in the Amazon Rainforest|This paper sets out an empirically-driven approach for targeting environmental policies optimally in order to combat deforestation. We focus on the Amazon, the worldâ€™s most extensive rainforest, where Brazilâ€™s federal government issued a â€˜Priority Listâ€™ of municipalities in 2008, to be targeted with more intense environmental monitoring and enforcement. In this setting, we first estimate the causal impact of the Priority List on deforestation using â€˜changes-in-changesâ€™ (Athey and Imbens, 2006), a flexible treatment effects estimation method, finding that it reduced deforestation by 40 percent and cut emissions by 39.5 million tons of carbon. Second, we develop a novel framework for computing targeted ex-post optimal blacklists. This involves a procedure for assigning municipalities to a counterfactual list that minimizes total deforestation subject to realistic resource constraints, drawing on the ex-post treatment effect estimates from the first part of the analysis. Accounting for spillovers, we show that the ex-post optimal list resulted in carbon emissions over 7.4 percent lower than the actual list, amounting to savings of more than $900 million, and emissions over 25 percent lower (on average) than a randomly selected list. The approach we propose is relevant for assessing both targeted counterfactual policies to reduce deforestation and quantifying the impacts of policy targeting more generally.
L78|AI and the Economy|We review the evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) is having a large effect on the economy. Across a variety of statistics—including robotics shipments, AI start-ups, and patent counts—there is evidence of a large increase in AI-related activity. We also review recent research in this area that suggests that AI and robotics have the potential to increase productivity growth but may have mixed effects on labor, particularly in the short run. In particular, some occupations and industries may do well while others experience labor market upheaval. We then consider current and potential policies around AI that may help to boost productivity growth while also mitigating any labor market downsides, including evaluating the pros and cons of an AI specific regulator, expanded antitrust enforcement, and alternative strategies for dealing with the labor market impacts of AI, including universal basic income and guaranteed employment.

L78|Boosting productivity and living standards in Thailand|The Prosperity pillar of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development calls for an integrated approach based on boosting productivity through diversification, upgrading technology and innovation, and increasing employment and entrepreneurship. Thailand needs to address all these challenges to achieve high-income country status by 2036. Over the past decade, limited structural reform and capital investment have held back productivity growth and improvements in well-being, and Thailand has lost ground vis-à-vis regional comparators. More recently, however, economic growth has started to regain momentum helped by a pick-up in global trade, which has supported exports, and by a substantial public infrastructure investment programme. Moving forward, Thailand will need to boost productive capacity in the face of intensified competition with regional peers and rapid demographic ageing. In addition, productivity gains will be increasingly necessary to drive growth. Key areas of focus include improving human resource development, encouraging technology diffusion via cluster development, promoting innovation and digitalisation, improving the SME policy framework and expanding regional integration, as emphasised in the government’s 12th Plan and Thailand 4.0. This Working Paper relates to the Initial Assessment report of the Multi-dimensional Country Review of Thailand (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/multi-dimensional-review-thailand.htm)
L78|The impact of resource tax reform on China's coal industry|Contributing to approximately two-thirds of primary energy consumption, coal usage is the focus of China's energy policies. To regulate the resource taxation system and reduce the burden of coal enterprises, the Chinese government launched a reform of its resource tax system in 2014 for coal, introducing the ad valorem system to replace the volume-based system that had been in place for the preceding thirty years. To assess the impact of the tax reform, this paper constructs two-stage dynamic game models by taking the coal and coal-fired power industries as the players. The market situations of shortage and oversupply are investigated separately. Empirical data are collected to estimate the model parameters for numerical simulations. The model results suggest that the tax reform will reduce both coal prices and the coal industry profitability if the tax levied on each ton of coal is maintained at the same level as before the reform, regardless of whether the market is in a shortage or an oversupply situation. However, the increased buyer's power will amplify the effect of the tax reform. The numerical simulations also provide an estimation of the tax rate of the ad valorem system that maintains the profit of the coal industry. Considering the demand and supply situations in China's coal market, policy recommendations are provided to guide further reform of China's resource tax system.
L78|Non-ferrous Metals Manufacturing: Vision for 2050 and Actions Needed|The European non-ferrous metals manufacturing industry is a strategic sector directly employing 500,000 people and supplying products for numerous crucial downstream industrial sectors. As a capital intensive industry, its investment horizon spans over decades and is thus particularly in need of adopting a long-term strategic perspective. This foresight study applied a highly participatory, qualitative methodology that gathered representatives of the non-ferrous metals industry, research institutions, policymakers, trade unions and stakeholders from upstream and downstream sectors. This methodology allowed: (1) to define a long-term (2050) vision for the non-ferrous metals manufacturing industry and (2) to propose concrete actions for the industry itself, policymakers, and other stakeholders, to address the challenges faced by the sector (trade and competition, innovation, resources, business integrity and skills) on its path towards the vision.
L78|Informing SPR Policy Through Oil Futures and Inventory Dynamics|This paper examines how information on the time pattern of expected future prices for crude oil, based on the term structure of futures contracts, can be used in informing whether to draw down, or contribute to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Such price information provides insight on expected changes in the supply-demand balance in the market and can also facilitate cost-effective transitions for SPR holdings. Backwardation in futures curves suggests that market participants expect shocks to be transitory, creating a stronger case for SPR releases. We use vector autoregression to analyze the relationship between the term structure of futures contracts, the management of private oil inventories, and other variables of interest. This relationship is used to estimate the magnitude of the impacts of SPR releases into the much larger global inventories system. Under the assumption that strategic releases can be modeled as surprise inventory additions, impulse response functions suggest that a strategic release of 10 million barrels would temporarily reduce spot prices by about 2% to 3% and mitigate backwardation by approximately 0.8 percentage points. Historical simulations suggest that past releases reduced spot prices by 15% to 20% and avoided about 5 percentage points of backwardation in futures curves, relative to a no-release counterfactual. This research can help policymakers determine when to release SPR reserves based on economic principles informed by market prices. It also provides an econometric model that can help inform the amount of SPR releases necessary to achieve given policy goals, such as reductions in prices or spreads.
L78|Determinants of economic fluctuations in the construction sec-tor|Awareness and ability to possibly eliminate the potentially adverse consequences of economic fluctuations can constitute an extremely important factor of the financial condition and competitive position of the company as well as the entire construction sector. Especially in the construction sector creating a catalog of fac-tors affecting economic fluctuations is important from the point of view of not only the economy but also the company. The analysis carried out in this article of situation fluctuations in the construction industry in recent years allow to specify the factors that largely determine the conditions for construction enterprises devel-opment and shaping their competitiveness. Research background: The specifics and operation conditions of enterprises including the construction sector companies cause sensitivity to economic fluctua-tions manifested in the cyclical disorders of economic activity level (business cy-cles). Background research work is to determine the effect of internal and external environment on a range of determinants of the economic situation fluctuations potentially occurring in the sphere of the construction sector. Purpose of the article: The aim of this article is to present the main factors affect-ing economic condition fluctuations in the construction sector and their impact on company operation. Methodology/methods: The following research methods and tools are used in this work: analysis and critique of literature, examination of documents, analysis and synthesis, descriptive statistics. Findings: The result of the study and documents analysis will include identifica-tion of factors affecting to the highest degree the economic fluctuations in the construction sector. These factors will be specified from among the macro-economic environment but mainly from the internal environment of the company. Developed proposals will be useful in building the short- and long-term operation strategy for both the construction companies and the entire sphere of the construc-tion sector.
L78|Investment Appraisal of Mining Projects Employing the FAST Modeling Standard|In this study a project model is built to conduct an appraisal and sensitivity analysis of a gold mine. At the same time, the most up to date modeling standard, known as FAST (i.e., Flexible, Appropriate, Structured, and Transparent), is implemented. The purpose of choosing this standard is to identify the strengths and weaknesses that may result from the implementation of this methodology for the modeling project appraisals. The FAST standard noticeably reduces the rate of error, while the speed of modeling and the appraisal of investment projects increase noticeably. The results of the analysis using FAST also becomes more communicable after implementing this standard. An important conclusion of the appraisal is that the royalty rates charged by governments on the extraction of gold are found to be too insensitive to the magnitude of the financial surplus generated by a specific mine. In particular, our study suggests that even if the royalty rates are increased up to six times, the project still generates a positive financial net present value for the mine owners. According to this finding it should be a public finance priority to redesign the systems for setting royalty rates in mineral producing countries that would allow host countries to benefit more from high return investments while at the same time not damaging the financial viability of higher cost natural resource extraction projects.

L78|Phasing out the U.S. Federal Helium Reserve: Policy insights from a world helium model|This paper develops a detailed partial equilibrium model of the global helium market to study the effects of the recently decided rapid phase out of the U.S. Federal Helium Reserve (FHR), a vast strategic stockpile accumulated during the 1960s. The model incorporates a detailed representation of that industry and treats both helium producers and the FHR as players in a dynamic non-cooperative game. The goal of each player is assumed to be the maximization of discounted profit, subject to technical and resource constraints. We consider two alternative policies aimed at organizing the phase out of the FHR: the currently implemented one and a less stringent one whereby the FHR would be allowed to operate as a profit-maximizing agent during an extended period of time. Evidences gained from a series of market simulations indicate that, compared to the current policy, a less stringent policy mandate systematically increases the financial return to the U.S. federal budget, always enhances environmental outcomes as it lowers helium venting into the atmosphere, and also augments global welfare in three out of the four scenarios considered in the paper.
L78|National strategies for securing a stable supply of rare earths in different world regions|The rising imbalance between increased demand for minerals and their tighter supply has resulted in growing concerns about their criticality. This has in turn stimulated both resource-rich and resource-poor countries to take an active role in implementing mineral strategies. The present paper explains why different world regions responded differently to the global problem of securing stable supply of critical minerals, in particular of rare earths. The paper is based on a comparative political economy framework and examines the extent to which distinct national policy styles, national interests, resource endowment and historical experience in tackling supply risk shaped the different policy choices. The overall findings show that despite their similar objectives, strategies undertaken by various regions tend to differ in their foci. Whereas Europe opts for a policy dialogue with resource-rich countries, Japan and the United States have a more hands-on approach in research and development initiatives. Australia's and China's policies instead, focus on development of domestic mining activities and on resource protection.
L78|Eu – Russia And The Energy Dimension Of The Eastern Partnership|The Energy Union Strategy, launched in February 2015, is a vast project aiming at identifying a set of common responses to a series of present and future challenges in the field of energy. The question of energy security occupies a central position in EU’s relationships with its neighbours. In this context, economic and political ties with the Russian Federation in its role of major supplier of energy resources to EU member states are of crucial importance. Acquiring a higher degree of independence from the Russian supply of natural gas has been proclaimed as a national priority by several ex-Soviet republics. Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia have recently signed Association Agreements with the EU. We look into the early stages of the implementation of AA’s and analyse their consequences on the EU – Russia relations in the energy field. A series of common characteristics and possible developments in the field of energy are analysed.
L78|Critical raw material strategies in different world regions|The rising imbalance between increased demand for minerals and their tighter supply has resulted in growing concerns about their criticality. This has in turn stimulated both resource-rich and resource-poor countries to take active role in implementing mineral policy strategies. This paper explains why different world regions responded differently to the global problem of securing stable supply of critical minerals, in particular of rare earths. The paper first provides an in-depth overview of development trajectories of critical mineral strategies through a historical case study analysis of major stakeholder regions - China, the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia. Next, it offers answers as to why they have responded the way they did: how national interest considerations, resource endowment circumstances, countries’ historical experience in tackling supply risk and their respective policy styles influenced the development of critical mineral policy choices within a comparative political economy framework. The overall findings show distinctive differences in policy strategies towards critical materials. Whereas Europe opts for a policy dialogue with resource-rich countries, Japan and the United States have a more hands-on approach in research and development initiatives. Australia and China instead, strive to promote domestic mining activities and to protect their resources through resource nationalist policies.
L78|Vehicle Scrappage and Gasoline Policy|"We estimate the sensitivity of scrap decisions to changes in used car values and show how this ""scrap elasticity"" produces emissions leakage under fuel efficiency standards, a process known as the Gruenspecht effect. We first estimate the effect of gasoline prices on used vehicle values and scrappage of vehicles with different fuel economies. We then estimate the scrap elasticity itself, which we find to be -0.7. When applied in a model of fuel economy standards, 13-16 percent of the expected fuel savings leak away through the used vehicle market. This effect rivals or exceeds the importance of the often-cited mileage rebound effect. (JEL H23, L62, L78, Q35, Q38, Q48, Q58)"

L78|Physician payments under health care reform|This study examines the impact of major health insurance reform on payments made in the health care sector. We study the prices of services paid to physicians in the privately insured market during the Massachusetts health care reform. The reform increased the number of insured individuals as well as introduced an online marketplace where insurers compete. We estimate that, over the reform period, physician payments increased at least 11 percentage points relative to control areas. Payment increases began around the time legislation passed the House and Senate—the period in which their was a high probability of the bill eventually becoming law. This result is consistent with fixed-duration payment contracts being negotiated in anticipation of future demand and competition.
L78|What do we know about the sharing of mineral resource rent in Africa?|Governments that lack the capacity to mine resources themselves have to attract foreign direct investment. However, since resources are not renewable, countries need to capture a ‘fair’ share of mineral resource rent to promote their development. While the sharp rise of the world prices of most minerals multiplied the total natural resources rents by 2.3 between 2002 and 2008 (World Bank, 2015), tax revenue earned by African governments from the non-renewable natural resource sector only grew by a factor of 1.5 (Mansour, 2014).The sharing of mineral resource rent between governments and investors is often criticised for being unfavourable to African governments. But what do we really know about the sharing of mineral resource rent in Africa? The aim of this study is to review theoretical and empirical studies on rent sharing in Africa and to note their limitations regarding knowledge of the actual sharing of mineral rent.

L78|Regulation of Insurance with Adverse Selection and Switching Costs: Evidence from Medicare Part D|I take advantage of regulatory and pricing dynamics in Medicare Part D to explore interactions among adverse selection, inertia, and regulation. I first document novel evidence of adverse selection and switching frictions within Part D using detailed administrative data. I then estimate a contract choice and pricing model that quantifies the importance of inertia for risk sorting. I find that in Part D switching costs help sustain an adversely-selected equilibrium. I also estimate that active ?decision making in the existing policy environment could lead to a substantial gain in annual consumer surplus of on average $400-$600 per capita--20 percent to 30 percent of average annual spending.
L78|Minería informal aurífera en Colombia. Principales resultados del levantamiento de la línea de base|En este documento se presentan los principales resultados del levantamiento de línea de base sobre minería informal de oro en cuatro departamentos colombianos (i.e. Antioquia, Bolívar, Chocó y Caldas). Este levantamiento de datos se realizó entre noviembre y diciembre de 2012. La selección de estos departamentos se debe a su importancia dentro de la producción aurífera y al mismo tiempo sus altos niveles de informalidad en la actividad minera. El objetivo de este levantamiento de línea de base es contar con información que permita caracterizar de mejor manera la actividad aurífera informal, conocer la cadena de valor del oro informal, realizar una caracterización socioeconómica del conductor minero, entre otros. Esta línea de base parte del marco muestral de las Unidades de Producción Minera de Oro Informales (UPMOI) del Censo Minero (2010-2011) y busca complementar la información ya existente y servir de base para la elaboración de una estrategia para la formalización minera en el país.

L78|Mining and Indonesia’s Economy: Institutions and Value Adding, 1870-2010|Indonesia has long been a major producer of minerals for international markets. Starting in 2014, it implemented legislation banning exports of unprocessed minerals and requiring producers to invest in processing facilities to add more value before export. This paper establishes what light past experiences in Indonesia with mining sheds on this recent development. It quantifies and discusses the growth of mining production in Indonesia since 1870. It analyses the institutional arrangements that past governments used to maximise resource rents and domestic value adding. The paper finds that production and exports of mining commodities were long dominated by oil, but increased and diversified over time, particularly since the 1960s. The development of the mining sector depended on changes in market prices, mining technologies and the cost of production, but particularly on the institutional arrangements that guided the decisions of foreign investors to commit to mining production and processing in Indonesia.
