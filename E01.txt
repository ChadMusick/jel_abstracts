E01|Agregados econÃ³micos y demogrÃ¡ficos regionales: ActualizaciÃ³n de RegData hasta 2018<BR>[Regional economic and demographic aggregates: RegData updated up to 2018]|En esta nota se describe brevemente la Ãºltima actualizaciÃ³n de RegData, una base de datos que recoge los principales agregados econÃ³micos y demogrÃ¡ficos de las regiones espaÃ±olas durante las Ãºltimas seis dÃ©cadas. En su mayorÃ­a, las series comienzan en 1950 o 1955 y se extienden hasta 2018. This note briefly describes the latest update of RegData, a database that collects the main economic and demographic aggregates of the Spanish regions over the last six decades. For the most part, the series begin in 1950 or 1955 and run until 2018.
E01|The Distribution of Well-Being among Europeans|We analyse the evolution of EU citizens’ living standards, considering the EU as a single country. Average living standards have improved considerably as the European integration process has unfolded. EU28 income inequality has steadily declined, mostly as a result of the macroeconomic convergence of new EU-accession countries. EU15 income inequality fell steadily until the mid-1980s, but picked up again during the economic turmoil following the Great Recession, largely reflecting the divergence between periphery and core countries in the euro area. Using a common EU standard reveals more progress in terms of poverty reduction. It also shows that the patterns of income convergence across member states differ across categories of residents, thus calling for a more careful consideration of the personal and national dimensions of EU policies.
E01|Between Communism and Capitalism: Long-Term Inequality in Poland, 1892-2015|How has Polish inequality evolved between communism and capitalism to reach one of the highest levels in Europe today? To address this question, we construct the first series on the long-term distribution of income in Poland by combining tax, household survey and national accounts data. We document a U-shaped evolution of inequalities from the end of the 19th century until today: (i) inequality was high before WWII; (ii) abruptly fell after the introduction of communism in 1947 and stagnated at low levels during the whole communist period; (iii) experienced a sharp rise with the return to capitalism in 1989. Between 1989 and 2015 the top 10% income share increased from 23% to 35% and the top 1% income share from 4% to 13%. Frequently quoted Poland's transition success has largely benefited top income groups. We find that inequality was high in the first half of the 20th century due to strong concentration of capital income at the top of the distribution. The secular fall after WW2 was largely to a combination of capital income shocks from war destructions with communist policies both eliminating private ownership and forcing wage compression. The rise of inequality after the return to capitalism in the early 1990s was induced both by the rise of top labour and capital incomes. We attribute this to labour market liberalisation and privatisation. However, the strong rise in inequality in the 2000s was driven solely by the increase in top capital incomes, which is likely related to current globalization forces. Yet overall, the unique Polish inequality history speaks about the central role of policies and institutions in shaping inequality in the long run.
E01|Double-counting of investment|The double-counting issue implies overstatement of levels of gross domestic product and national income.Ã‚Â A proposed alternative measure of product and income involves a form of full expensing for gross investment.
E01|GDP is a measure of output, not welfare. Or, HOS meets the SNA|What effect, if any, do changes in the terms of trade have on the level of output (GDP) or welfare? I examine this issue through two versions of a textbook, Hecksher-Ohlin-Samuelson (HOS), two-good model of a small, open economy. In the first version both goods are for final consumption. In the second, one good is an imported intermediate input into the other. In both versions, economic theory suggests that an improvement in the terms of trade raises welfare (consumption) but leaves aggregate output (GDP) unchanged. This follows from a continuous-time analysis using Divisia index numbers. I then show that a national income accountant applying the principles of the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA) would reach the same conclusions.
E01|Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa, 1885-2008|Estimates of GDP per capita are provided on an annual basis for eight SubSaharan African economies for the period since 1885. Although the growth experienced in most of SSA since the mid-1990s has had historical precedents, there have also been episodes of negative growth or “shrinking”, so that long run progress has been limited. Despite some heterogeneity across countries, this must be seen as a disappointing performance for the region as a whole, given the possibilities of catch-up growth. Avoiding episodes of shrinking needs to be given a higher priority in understanding the transition to sustained economic growth.
E01|La estructura sectorial de Colombia: Un análisis insumo-producto|En los últimos años ha existido el consenso de que la economía colombiana es muy dependente del sector minero – energético, por lo cual se deben encontrar formas de transformar el aparato productivo. El análisis insumo-producto ayuda a identificar cuales pueden ser los sectores que pueden contribuir a una mayor diversificación de economía, además de la clasificación por clústeres, los cuales no han cambiado tanto en los últimos quince años.
E01|Generación de empleos y clústeres|En este trabajo se utiliza la metodología insumo – producto para analizar la creación del empleo desde la perspectiva sectorial, al utilizar los multiplicadores del empleo los multiplicadores del empleo y mostrar las relaciones del empleo entre e intra – clúster de la economía. Se encuentra que los clústeres más cercanos a la demanda final son los de agro – industria e industria y construcción. Si se realiza algún estímulo sobre la demanda de los productos finales de estos clústeres se va a generar una mayor absorción del trabajo, no solo dentro de cada clúster, sino en el sistema productivo en general. El efecto se refuerza si existen conexiones fuertes con clústeres proveedores netos de insumos, tales como el de servicios o el de industria minero – energética.
E01|The Industry Anatomy of the Transatlantic Productivity Growth Slowdown|"By merging KLEMS data sets and aggregating over the ten largest Western European nations (EU-10), we are able to compare and contrast productivity growth up through 2015 starting from 1950 in the U.S. and from 1972 in the EU-10. Data are provided at the aggregate level, as well as for 16 industry groups within the total economy and 11 manufacturing subindustries. The analysis focuses on outcomes over four time intervals: 1950-72, 1972-95, 1995- 2005, and 2005-15. We interpret the EU-10 performance as catching up to the U.S. in stages, with its rapid growth of 1950-72 representing a delayed adoption of the inventions that propelled U.S. productivity growth in the first half of the 20th century, and the next EU-10 stage for 1972-95 as imitating the U.S. outcome for 1950-72. A striking finding is that for the total economy the ""early-to-late"" productivity growth slowdown from 1972-95 to 2005-15 in the EU-10 (-1.68 percentage points) was almost identical to the U.S. slowdown from 1950-72 to 2005-15 (-1.67 percentage points). There is a very high EU-U.S. correlation in the magnitude of the early-to-late slowdown across industries. This supports our overall theme that the productivity growth slowdown from the early postwar years to the most recent decade was due to a retardation in technical change that affected the same industries by roughly the same magnitudes on both sides of the Atlantic."
E01|Productivity Growth, Capital Reallocation and the Financial Crisis: Evidence from Europe and the US|How has capital reallocation affected productivity growth since the financial cri- sis? For example, have low interest rates disrupted the reallocation process? This paper calculates the effect on productivity growth of capital reallocation between industries. It uses an accounting framework, due to Jorgenson and his co-authors, that computes the contribution of capital services to productivity growth relative to one where rates of return are equalised between sectors: if capital persists in the low return sectors, the reallocation measure falls. Using data from 11 countries (the major EU economies plus the US), in 1997-2013, we nd: (a) the contribution of capital reallocation to productivity growth is lower in most economies after than before the financial crisis, notably in Mediterranean countries; (b) more capital real- location is correlated with lower real interest rates, contrary to the hypothesis that low real interest rates have hurt capital reallocation; (c) controlling for shocks, lower capital reallocation is associated with lower optimism, and weaker financial systems.
E01|Internal Migration, Social Stratiﬁcation and Dynamic Effects on Subjective Well Being|Using German panel data and relying on internal relocation, this paper investigates the anticipation and adaptation of subjective well-being (SWB) in the course of migration. We hypothesize that SWB correlates with the process of migration, and that such correlations are at least partly socially stratiﬁed. Our ﬁxed-effects regressions show no evidence of any anticipation of SWB before the event of migration, but a highly signiﬁcant and sustained positive adaptation effect. In general, internal migration seems to lead to a long-lasting increase in SWB. This is found to be the case for almost all analyzed socioeconomic and socio-demographic subgroups. The migration distance, the reasons for migration, and the individuals’ socio-demographic characteristics do not appear to have any important effects on the overall observed pattern. Our results suggest that regional mobility is less a response to certain stressors, but is, rather, a response to an opportunity to improve job- or housing-related living conditions, and that these improved conditions are reﬂected in individuals’ SWB. Thus, migration under these circumstances is triggered by opportunities rather than by constraints.

E01|What do we know about changing economic activity of firms?|Identifiation of primary economic activity of firms is a prerequisite for compiling several macro aggregates. In this paper we take a statistical approach to understand the extent of changes in primary economic activity of firms over time and across different industries. We use the history of economic activity of over 46000 firms spread over 25 years from CMIE Prowess to identify the number of times firms change the nature of their business. Using the count of changes, we estimate Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models to gain predictability over changing economic activity across industry groups. We show that a Poisson model accurately characterizes the distribution of count of changes across industries and that firms with a long history are more likely to have changed their primary economic activity over the years. Findings show that classification can be a crucial problem in a large dataset like the MCA21 and can even lead to distortions in value addition estimates at the industry level.
E01|The Labor Share of Income around the World: Evidence from a Panel Dataset|There are two fundamental reasons why factor shares have traditionally been overlooked in the economic literature. First, because of their nature, factor shares are conceptually difficult to define and measure. Second, they have for a long time been perceived as constant across time and space. We evaluate five different methodologies of estimation commonly used in the labor share literature and propose a new measurement. We then compile a global dataset of the labor income share across 151 economies—both developing and developed—for all or part of the period 1970–2015. Results show that our suggested indicator is correlated to the other five measures but it also retains unique information. Contrary to the traditional assumption of stable factor shares, we document the existence of considerable heterogeneity across economies and variability over time. Specifically, there has been a general decline in the labor share around the world, in particular from the mid-1980s onward.
E01|"Assessing House Prices: Insights from ""Houselev"", a Dataset of Price Level Estimates"|House price assessments relying on price indexes only have a number of limitations, especially if the available time series are short and series averages cannot be taken as reliable benchmarks. To address this issue, the present paper computes house prices in levels for 40 countries: all the EU countries and a number of other advanced and emerging economies. The baseline methodology makes use of information on the total value of dwellings in national accounts statistics and on total floor areas of existing dwelling stocks from census statistics. This top-down methodology simply consists of estimating the average house price per square metre dividing the total value of dwellings for the total floor area. For some countries, the information to carry out the baseline method is not available. In such cases, price level estimates are based on property advertisements on realtors' websites. A correction factor is applied to address the upward bias of prices asked by sellers as compared with transaction prices and improve cross-country comparability. House price level estimates make it possible to compute price to income (PTI) ratios yielding a clear interpretation: the average number of annual incomes needed to buy dwellings with a floor area of 100 m2. Using a signalling approach aimed at identifying PTI threshold that maximises the signal power in predicting downward price adjustments, it is found that a PTI close to 10 works as an across-the board rule of thumb for identifying potentially overvalued house prices. Moreover, when price levels are used in regression-based models to estimate fundamentals-based house price benchmarks, they allow us to exploit the cross-section variation in the data thereby providing additional insights compared with analogous benchmarks based on indexes.
E01|Introducing the Distributional Financial Accounts of the United States|This paper describes the construction of the Distributional Financial Accounts (DFAs), a new dataset containing quarterly estimates of the distribution of U.S. household wealth since 1989, and provides the first look at the resulting data. The DFAs build on two existing Federal Reserve Board statistical products --- quarterly aggregate measures of household wealth from the Financial Accounts of the United States and triennial wealth distribution measures from the Survey of Consumer Finances --- to incorporate distributional information into a national accounting framework. The DFAs complement other existing sources of data on the wealth distribution by using a more comprehensive measure of household wealth and by providing quarterly data on a timely basis. We encourage policymakers, researchers, and other interested parties to use the DFAs to help understand issues related to the distribution of U.S. household wealth.
E01|Syria in the Dark: Estimating the Economic Consequences of the Civil War through Satellite-Derived Night Time Lights|The Syrian Civil War has begun in 2011 and is still wrecking enormous damages on the country's economy, with an impressive toll measured in deaths, migration, and the destruction of the Syrian historical heritage and physical infrastructure. This paper examines the impact of the War on Syria's economy from the perspective of outer space, to bypass the issue of data availability due to the inaccessibility of the war-ravaged territory. The estimates obtained in this way are more pessimistic than the ones reported by international organisations. Starting from our estimates, we provide long-term projections for the country's economy, and estimate the window for GDP recovery at the pre-war levels. We discuss geo-political implications which could prevent our projections from happening.
E01|Owner-Occupied Housing, Inflation, and Monetary Policy| The treatment of owner-occupied housing (OOH) in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) affects inflation expectations, real interest rates, and hence market outcomes. After showing that none of the existing treatments of OOH are fit for purpose, we propose a new simplified user cost method with better properties. We then compare empirically eight treatments of OOH. Our preferred approach pushes up the CPI during housing booms. We relate our findings to the following macroeconomic debates: the disinflation puzzle, leaning against the wind, and the effectiveness of monetary policy in the presence of secular stagnation, the zero lower bound, and globalization.
E01|Long-term Trends in Gross Domestic Expenditure in Indonesia: Provisional Estimates|This paper seeks to overcome the fact that historical estimates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Indonesia are currently only available in constant prices. Using the expenditure approach it offers new estimates of Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE), the equivalent of GDP, in current prices. The paper anchors the estimates on Indonesia’s Input-Output (I-O) Tables available for benchmark years between 1969 and 2010, which reveal that until 1995 Indonesia’s official national accounts underestimated GDP and GDE. The paper combines corrections based on the I-O Tables with additional sources to present provisional new estimates of GDE in current prices for 1870-1941 and 1948-1995. It then analyses the composition of GDE, noting the generally modest proportions of discretionary public expenditure and capital formation, particularly during 1870-1913 and 1948-1966.
E01|Multilateral Sato-Vartia Index for International Comparisons of Prices and Real Expenditures|The Sato-Vartia (SV) index for bilateral price comparisons has impressive analytical properties and is used intensively in recent international trade and macroeconomic analyses. In this paper we propose several ways of constructing transitive multilateral version of the SV index. We show that the SV index is only one of many logarithmic indices that satisfy the factor reversal test discussed in index number theory. We derive closed form expressions for the generalized SV indices and empirically implement the new indices for making cross-country price comparison using World Bank data from the 2011 International Comparison Program.
E01|Short-Term macroeconomic evaluation of the German minimum wage with a VAR/VECM|The German minimum wage was introduced in January 2015. This paper investigates the short-term macroeconomic impacts of its introduction. Therefore, an estimated VAR/VECM is used to perform forecasts that are interpreted as counterfactual to the introduction of the minimum wage and compared to actual developments of six key macroeconomic variables. The deviations are interpreted as minimum wage effects. Robustness checks as well as a comparison with descriptive empirical results are performed to assess the validity of the results. Overall, small positive price effects, significant positive wage effects, and positive employment effects although not robustly estimated in their magnitude are found.
E01|The distribution of well-being among Europeans|We analyse the evolution of EU citizens’ living standards, considering the EU as a single country. Average living standards have improved considerably as the European integration process has unfolded. EU28 income inequality has steadily declined, mostly as a result of the macroeconomic convergence of new EU-accession countries. EU15 income inequality fell steadily until the mid-1980s, but picked up again during the economic turmoil following the Great Recession, largely reflecting the divergence between periphery and core countries in the euro area. Using a common EU standard reveals more progress in terms of poverty reduction. It also shows that the patterns of income convergence across member states differ across categories of residents, thus calling for a more careful consideration of the personal and national dimensions of EU policies.
E01|World Input-Output Database Environmental Accounts|This report describes the approach adopted for the update of the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) environmental accounts for the period 2000-2016. In constructing the WIOD-based energy and emission accounts we follow closely the methodology developed by Genty et al. (2012), with some adjustments due to changes in system boundaries, which are further detailed. This report illustrates the data adjustment steps required to reconcile energy and economic data which stem, for example, from different accounting principles. Special care has been taken to address problems related to time series breaks in order to achieve a smooth transition between the years 2009 and 2010 at the intersection between the original and new WIOD releases. Results for EU countries are compared with other data sources such as the previous WIOD time series, the Physical Energy Flows Accounts (PEFA) and the National Accounts Matrices with Environmental Extensions (NAMEA) showing a satisfactory goodness of fit, with some exceptions. A final comparison of the inter-temporal structure across periods is proposed in order to identify possible reasons of changes in the patterns of gross energy use.
E01|Earth Observation in a Cost-Benefit Analysis Perspective: Cosmo SkyMed Satellites of the Italian Space Agency|Over the past decade, an increasing number of high-resolution satellite images have become available to public administration, policymakers and scientists, boosting the amount of information they can obtain to manage and analyse different issues. Satellites allow observing different natural and socio-economic phenomena that would be very hard and costly to monitor from the ground with the same optimal coverage, accuracy and consistency, providing valuable information both to the private and public sector. These phenomena include global societal challenges, such as climate change and air pollution, as well as local ones such as precision farming, urbanisation and transport infrastructures monitoring. This working paper aims at paving the way to a comprehensive assessment of the socio-economic impact of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) concerning the creation of innovative products and services generated by the Earth Observation (EO). Although the wide range of potential applications of EO satellite data, little is known about the effective use of Cosmo SkyMed (CSK) data so far. Most of the benefits related to their availability remain potential, unexpressed and undervalued. The analysis also intends to identify the institutional and organisational barriers that limit their full exploitation and formulate sounds policy recommendations to release the untapped potential of the Italian space downstream sector.
E01|Minding Your Ps and Qs: Going from Micro to Macro in Measuring Prices and Quantities|Key macro indicators such as output, productivity, and inflation are based on a complex system across multiple statistical agencies using different samples and levels of aggregation. The Census Bureau collects nominal sales, the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects prices, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis constructs nominal and real GDP using these data and other sources. The price and quantity data are integrated at a high level of aggregation. This paper explores alternative methods for reengineering key national output and price indices using item-level data. Such reengineering offers the promise of greatly improved key economic indicators along many dimensions.
E01|Big Data and Firm Dynamics|We study a model where firms accumulate data as a valuable intangible asset. Data accumulation affects firms' dynamics. It increases the skewness of the firm size distribution as large firms generate more data and invest more in active experimentation. On the other hand, small data-savvy firms can overtake more traditional incumbents, provided they can finance their initial money-losing growth. Our model can be used to estimate the market and social value of data.
E01|Productivity Measurement: Racing to Keep Up|This paper provides a non-technical review of the literature and issues related to the measurement of aggregate productivity. I begin with a discussion of productivity measures, their performance in recent decades, and key measurement puzzles that emerge from the data. The remainder of the review focuses on two important questions. First, how do we make more accurate the measures of prices used to deflate nominal output so as to win (or at least not lose) the race for economic measurement to keep up with a changing economy? This section frames the issues and points to the most important and promising areas for further research. Second, what does or should GDP measure? I defend GDP as a valuable measure of production and offer suggestions for improving it. At the same time, I emphasize the importance of measuring economic welfare (well being) and highlight the value of supplementing GDP with a satellite account that measures economic welfare.
E01|Household Innovation, R&D, and New Measures of Intangible Capital|Household R&D (or household innovation) is an important source of innovation that has to date been largely overlooked in research related to national accounts. Indeed, it is not currently counted as investment in the literatures on household production and human capital. This paper develops time series estimates of nominal investment, real investment, and real capital stocks for household R&D for product innovations in the United States. (We focus on product innovations because survey data on services innovations in the household sector are not yet available.) In the U.S., we find that household product R&D is significant. Our estimate of real investment in 2017 is $41 billion (2012 dollars). This is about half of what producers spend in R&D to develop new products for consumers – a sizable fraction. Our estimate of the real capital stock of household product R&D in 2017 is $233 billion. We conclude that household R&D is an important feature of household activity and, more generally, of the overall landscape of innovation.
E01|Getting Smart About Phones : New Price Indexes and the Allocation of Spending Between Devices and Services Plans in Personal Consumption Expenditures|This paper addresses two measurement issues for mobile phones. First, we develop a new mobile phone price index using hedonic quality-adjusted prices for smartphones and a matched-model index for feature phones. Our index falls at an average annual rate of 17 percent during 2010-2018, close to the rate of decline in the price index used in the GDP Accounts. Given relatively flat average prices over this period, our index points to substantial quality improvement. Second, we propose a methodology to disentangle purchases of phones and wireless services when they are bundled together as part of a long-term service contract. Getting the allocation right is especially important for real PCE because the price deflators for phones and wireless services exhibit very different trends. Our adjusted estimates suggest that real PCE spending currently captured in the category Cellular Phone Services increased 4 percentage points faster than is reflected in published data.
E01|The Industry Anatomy of the Transatlantic Productivity Growth Slowdown|By merging KLEMS data sets and aggregating over the ten largest Western European nations (EU-10), we are able to compare and contrast productivity growth up through 2015 starting from 1950 in the U.S. and from 1972 in the EU-10. Data are provided at the aggregate level, as well as for 16 industry groups within the total economy and 11 manufacturing sub-industries. The analysis focuses on outcomes over four time intervals: 1950-72, 1972-95, 1995-2005, and 2005-15. We interpret the EU-10 performance as catching up to the U.S. in stages, with its rapid growth of 1950-72 representing a delayed adoption of the inventions that propelled U.S. productivity growth in the first half of the 20th century, and the next EU-10 stage for 1972-95 as imitating the U.S. outcome for 1950-72. We show that both the pace of aggregate productivity growth during 1972-95 for the EU-10 as well as its industrial composition matched very closely the growth record of the U.S. in the previous 1950-72 time interval. A striking finding is that for the total economy the “early-to-late” productivity growth slowdown from 1972-95 to 2005-15 in the EU-10 (-1.68 percentage points) was almost identical to the U.S. slowdown from 1950-72 to 2005-15 (-1.67 percentage points). There is a very high EU-U.S. correlation in the magnitude of the early-to-late slowdown across industries. This supports our overall theme that the productivity growth slowdown from the early postwar years to the most recent decade was due to a retardation in technical change that affected the same industries by roughly the same magnitudes on both sides of the Atlantic.
E01|A Forensic Examination of China's National Accounts|China’s national accounts are based on data collected by local governments. However, since local governments are rewarded for meeting growth and investment targets, they have an incentive to skew local statistics. China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) adjusts the data provided by local governments to calculate GDP at the national level. The adjustments made by the NBS average 5% of GDP since the mid-2000s. On the production side, the discrepancy between local and aggregate GDP is entirely driven by the gap between local and national estimates of industrial output. On the expenditure side, the gap is in investment. Local statistics increasingly misrepresent the true numbers after 2008, but there was no corresponding change in the adjustment made by the NBS. Using publicly available data, we provide revised estimates of local and national GDP by re-estimating output of industrial, construction, wholesale and retail firms using data on value-added taxes. We also use several local economic indicators that are less likely to be manipulated by local governments to estimate local and aggregate GDP. The estimates also suggest that the adjustments by the NBS were insufficient after 2008. Relative to the official numbers, we estimate that GDP growth from 2010-2016 is 1.8 percentage points lower and the investment and savings rate in 2016 is 7 percentage points lower.
E01|Measuring Global Economic Activity|A number of economic studies have used a proxy for world real economic activity derived from shipping costs. This measure turns out to depend on a normalization that has substantive consequences of which users of the index had been unaware prior to this paper. This paper further evaluates this and alternative measures in terms of treatment of trends, coherence with world output, and ability to predict commodity prices. I conclude that measures derived from world industrial production offer a better indicator of global real economic activity.
E01|Double-counting of investment|The national income and product accounts double-count investment, which enters once when it occurs and again in present value when the cumulated capital leads to more rental income. From the perspective of resources available intertemporally for consumption, the double-counting issue implies over-statement of levels of GDP and national income. There is also exaggeration of capital-income shares. A proposed alternative measure of product and income involves a form of full expensing for gross investment. In the steady state, revised product and income correspond to consumption. Outside of the steady state, the measure deviates from consumption because full expensing relates to the long-run flow of gross investment, not the current flow. At a practical level, the new concept requires only an extension from the standard depreciation rate to an effective rate that adds in the economy’s expected long-run rate of economic growth.
E01|Accounting for Innovations in Consumer Digital Services: IT Still Matters|"This paper develops a framework for measuring digital services in the face of ongoing innovations in the delivery of content to consumers. We capture what Brynjolfsson and Saunders (2009) call ""free goods"" as the capital services generated by connected consumers' stocks of IT digital goods, a service flow that augments the existing measure of personal consumption in GDP. Its value is determined by the intensity with which households use their IT capital to consume content delivered over networks, and its volume depends on the quality of the IT capital. Consumers pay for delivery services, however, and the complementarity between device use and network use enables us to develop a quality-adjusted price measure for the access services already included in GDP. Our new estimates imply that accounting for innovations in consumer content delivery matters: The innovations boost consumer surplus by nearly $1,800 (2017 dollars) per connected user per year for the full period of this study (1987 to 2017) and contribute more than 1/2 percentage point to US real GDP growth during the last ten. All told, our more complete accounting of innovations is (conservatively) estimated to have moderated the post-2007 GDP growth slowdown by nearly .3 percentage points per year.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
E01|Labor Shares in Some Advanced Economies|We study the joint impact of three measurement issues in the empirical literature on the labor share: (i) start and end periods for the empirical analysis; (ii) accounting for self-employment; and (iii) accounting for residential real estate income. When we correct for these three potential biases, we do not find a general decline in the labor share in our sample of advanced economies. In that respect the behavior of the US labor share after 2000 presents a puzzle.
E01|Rethinking growth and distribution in the US: Financial, healthcare and professional-business services as intermediate consumption of the economy|Since the 1980s, financial, healthcare and professional-business services (PBS) have grown rapidly and produced more of the US value-added, however, these services do not produce final uses for households. This paper explores the impacts of treating finance, healthcare, and PBS as intermediate consumption of the economy on US growth rates, decomposition of expenditures, and distribution of income over 1947-2017. After adjustments to the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs), the annual per capita growth declines by one-fourth after 1980, decomposition of expenditures changes in favor of investment and government spending, and the compensation of employees (CE) share of output declines sharply as more than 90% of the expenditures on finance, healthcare and PBS are financed out of CE. Average CE stagnates even though labor productivity continues to grow after adjustments; thus creating a productivity gap. The current treatment of finance, healthcare, and PBS in the NIPAs not only overestimates growth but also understates income inequality.
E01|What do we Know about Changing Economic Activity of Firms?|Identification of primary economic activity of Â¬firms is a prerequisite for compiling several macro aggregates. This paper takes a statistical approach to understand the extent of changes in primary economic activity of Â¬firms over time and across different industries. It uses the history of economic activity of over 46000 Â¬firms spread over 25 years from CMIE Prowess to identify the number of times Â¬firms change the nature of their business. Using the count of changes, it estimates Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models to gain predictability over changing economic activity across industry groups. The paper shows that a Poisson model accurately characterizes the distribution of count of changes across industries and that Â¬firms with a long history are more likely to have changed their primary economic activity over the years. Findings show that classification can be a crucial problem in a large dataset like the MCA21 and can even lead to distortions in value addition estimates at the industry level.
E01|GDP is a measure of output, not welfare. Or, HOS meets the SNA|What effect, if any, do changes in the terms of trade have on the level of output (GDP) or welfare? I examine this issue through two versions of a textbook, Hecksher-Ohlin-Samuelson (HOS), two-good model of a small, open economy. In the first version both goods are for final consumption. In the second, one good is an imported intermediate input into the other. In both versions, economic theory suggests that an improvement in the terms of trade raises welfare (consumption) but leaves aggregate output (GDP) unchanged. This follows from a continuous-time analysis using Divisia index numbers. I then show that a national income accountant applying the principles of the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA) would reach the same conclusions.
E01|The treatment of Intellectual Property in the National Accounts|The paper identifies flaws in the treatment of Intellectual Property as an intangible asset in the current national accounts international standards. It is proposed that the treatment should revert to that of the 1968 System of National Accounts (SNA), where payments for access to Intellectual Property were classified as property income (income transfers) and not as payment for services as in SNA 2008 and the European System of Accounts (ESA) 2010. This dramatic change in treatment has had unfortunate results, most visibly in the case of the revision to GDP estimates for Ireland. In 2016, the estimate for Ireland’s 2015 annual GDP growth was revised upwards from 7.8% to 26.3%. This was caused mainly by a relocation of a large multinational’s registration of Intellectual Property from mainland Europe. The associated access payments were treated as a set of new exports of services, with the subsequent large increase in the GDP level and growth measures of the Irish economy. This paper sets out how the current standards lead to this widely criticised change and proposes a model which is consistent with the 1968 SNA treatment.
E01|A Century of High Frequency UK Macroeconomic Statistics: A Data Inventory|This paper provides an inventory of the available macroeconomic statistics in the UK for the last hundred years or so. The focus is on documenting the higher frequency (daily, monthly and quarterly) macroeconomic data that are available after the World War 1, rather than longer run annual time series which has been the focus of other collections. It discusses some of the challenges that need to be overcome in order to create a continuous historical dataset over this period. The inventory follows the structure of the Economic Trends Annual Supplement (ETAS) that was produced for many years by the Office for National Statistics. It covers statistics on National Accounts, prices, labour market indicators, selected demand and output indicators and financial market data (including money and credit aggregates). Using this structure the paper explores to what extent it is possible to create a consistent, usable and comprehensive high frequency macroeconomic dataset back to the 1920s and earlier.
E01|Calibrating GDP fan charts using probit models with a comparison to the approaches of the Bank of England and Riksbank|Fan charts were pioneered by the Bank of England and Riksbank and provide a visuallyappealing means to convey the uncertainty surrounding a forecast. This paper describes amethod for parameterising fan charts around GDP growth forecasts by which the degree ofuncertainty is based on past forecast errors, but the skew is derived from a probit modelbasedassessment of the probability of a future downturn. The probit-based fan chartsclearly out-perform the Bank of England and Riksbank approaches when applied toforecasts made immediately preceding the Global Financial Crisis. These examples alsohighlight weaknesses with the Bank of England and Riksbank approaches. The Riksbank approach implicitly assumes that forecast errors are normally distributed, but over a long track record this is unlikely to be the case becauseforecasters are generally poor at predicting downturns, which leads to bias and skewin the pattern of forecast errors. Thus, the Riksbank fan chart is neither an accuraterepresentation of past forecast errors, nor is it a reflection of the risk assessmentunderlying the forecast. The Bank of England approach relies heavily on the judgment of the members of the Monetary Policy Committee to assess risks. However, even when they havecorrectly foreseen the nature of future risks, the quantitative translation of theserisks into the fan chart skew has been too timid. Perhaps one reason for this is thatthe fan chart prediction intervals based on historical forecast errors already appearquite wide so that inflating them by adding skew may appear embarrassing (at leastex ante).The approach advocated in this paper addresses these weaknesses by recognising thatforecast errors are not symmetrical: firstly, this leads to more compressed predictionintervals in the upper part of the fan chart (representing the possibility of under-prediction);and secondly, using the large forecast errors from past downturns to calibrate downwardskew clearly supports a more bold approach when there is a risk of a downturn. A weaknessof the probit model-based approach is that it will not predict atypical downturns. Forexample, in the current conjuncture it would not pick up risks associated with a ‘no deal’Brexit or a global trade war. However, a downturn triggered by atypical events may bemore severe if risk factors describing a typical business-financial cycle are also high.
E01|Tracking finance flows towards assessing their consistency with climate objectives|Achieving a low-greenhouse gas (GHG) development requires making finance flows consistent with this objective. In order to measure progress to date as well as inform future public action in this area, this paper calls for further efforts to track gross primary investments flows in new infrastructure and equipment and the refurbishment of such assets, as well underlying sources of finance. The proposed scope focuses on tangible fixed assets with a direct and significant impact on GHG emissions.
E01|Measuring consumer inflation in a digital economy|The effect on the household consumption price index from possible sources of error in capturing digital products depends on the weight of the affected products. To calculate upper bounds for this effect, we apply weights based on the average structure of household consumption in OECD countries to a maximum plausible overstatement of price change for each affected or potentially affected product. The products account for about 35% of household expenditure in 2005, declining to 32% in 2015. The upper bound simulation effect on the growth rate of the consumption deflator is somewhat less than –0.6 percentage points in 2015 – large enough to improve the picture of GDP and productivity growth in advanced economies. However, this would not overturn the conclusion that productivity growth has slowed substantially compared over the past decades.
E01|Pakistan Input-Output Table 2010-11|This paper develops Pakistan’s first Input-Output table (IOT) that follows the 2008 System of National Accounts. An IOT examines the structural changes in an economy. The present paper provides Pakistan’s IOT 2010-11 in an industry-by-industry format (42*42). The analysis of backward and forward linkages reveals that manufacturing of food products, beverages, textiles, electricity, gas, steam, air-conditioning and accommodation sectors have strong backward linkages while mining and quarrying, wood products, chemicals and chemical products, electricity, gas, steam, air-conditioning, warehousing and support activities for transportation sectors have strong forward linkages. For national economic growth to be sustainable, the government should facilitate economic activities in these sectors.
E01|The Evolution of Factor Shares: Evidence from Switzerland|While the labor share of income has decreased in most advanced economies since the 1980s, it has remained relatively stable in Switzerland. However, this does not imply that the capital share of income has also remained stable. Our results suggest that the share of imputed capital rental payments to income has decreased. Similar to other countries, Switzerland has seen an increase in the so-called factorless income share that cannot be readily attributed to capital and labor. The increase in factorless income may re ect a rise in economic rents, higher compensation for business risks, or increased compensation for unmeasured input factors, especially intangible capital. We find that the stable labor share in Switzerland cannot be traced back to high wage growth, but rather to subdued investment growth and a high growth rate of the labor force.
E01|Die Dimensionsanalyse und ihre Anwendung in der Ökonomik<BR>[Dimensional analysis and its application in economics]|The task of dimensional analysis is to check the formal correctness of formulas in a branch of empirical science and to explore the effects of a change in units of measurement on law-like formulas. Scale invariance is only a special case to ensure the neutrality of changes of units of measurement of independent variables on the variable to be explained. In general, mathematical functions and their applications in a discipline like economics are not scale-invariant. This alone should be a sufficient reason to deal more intensively with the question of the dependence of law-like formulations on the units of measurement of the variables integrated into them. There can be no dimensionless variables in an empirical scientific discipline. Even if there are numerous examples of variables that do not carry units of measurement, i.e. that are seemingly pure numbers, these variables do mean something special in observable reality. They capture a relationship which is important for the discipline and which is more than just a number. The dimension of an empirical quantity is anchored in a context that defines it. As a rule, these are the definitions of the system of national accounts, which show up to eight different dimensions even for simple aggregates such as GDP, investment or exports. Most of these dimensions are measured and reported in prices; they have the same unit of measurement, although they are different and are in need of a different treatment in an economic theory.
E01|Potential output, capital input and U.S. economic growth|The objective in this paper is to highlight the complex linkages of capital input to potential output in the U.S. nonfarm private business sector. For this purpose the analytical framework used by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is adapted and re-estimated using data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) over the period 1949-2016. By focusing on the changes in the composition of the capital stock in terms of structures, equipment and intangibles, average service lives, and the relative prices of producer’s to consumer’s goods, the paper allows for their influence on the capital input and traces the latter’s effects on the potential output. It is found that: (a) when the capital input is adjusted to reflect all aforementioned changes, the potential output decelerated in recent decades even faster than suggested by CBO’s estimates; (b) in the post-2007 period the shortfall in the estimated potential output widened relative to that computed by CBO, and (c) the faster deceleration of the potential output emanated from the declining share of structures in the capital stock and the spectacular decline in the prices of equipment relative to structures. Drawing on these findings it is concluded that, although the real economy may have overshoot its potential in the last few years, the forces that slow down potential output through changes in the capital input remain intact and, unless some remedial policies are instituted, they will continue to function as significant headwinds to U.S. economic growth, along with all others that are well known.
E01|Demand adjusted capital input and potential output in the context of U.S. economic growth|Two alternative measures of demand adjusted capital input for the U.S. non-farm private business sector are derived and their differential impacts on the potential supply of output are compared to those obtained using the unadjusted index of capital input published by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The results show that, allowing for the demand pressure on the fixed assets of firms, leads to three effects. It raises the level of estimated potential output well above CBO’s estimates; with the exception of the 1990s, the estimated growth rates turn out to be higher than those computed by CBO; and, lastly, the long term trend of the growth rates with and without the demand adjustment to the capital input is sloping downwards. The latter finding was not unexpected since aggregate demand, as reflected in the utilization rate of fixed assets by firms, has been trending downwards throughout the postwar period. Drawing on these findings it is concluded that the path to secular stagnation that the U.S. economy is following in the postwar period is not due solely to headwinds on the supply side. To some degree, perhaps significant, the deceleration in the expansion of productive capacity as well as in the intensity of its utilization is due to the declining long term aggregate demand.
E01|Stillbirths: How should its rate be reported, its disability-adjusted-life-years (DALY), and stillbirths adjusted life expectancy|Background A 2016 study standardized the definition of stillbirths. It estimated the rate as a proportion of total births. A 2015 paper addressed the problem of disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) for stillbirths. There has been no adjustment of life expectancy at birth to account for stillbirths. Methods and Results We follow mathematical and computational methods, use algebra to derive relationships, and large databases. We express the rate as a proportion of live births and use this rate to adjust life expectancy at birth for stillbirths. We then use the difference between the traditional life expectancy and stillbirths adjusted life expectancy (SALE) to obtain DALY for stillbirths for 194 countries, the Millennium Development Goal regions, and income groups. We show defining stillbirths’ rate as a proportion of live births enhances stillbirths’ importance, especially in poorer countries; negates some of its under-statement vis-a-vis neonatal mortality rate, accentuates its decrease; and permits inference about relative magnitudes of stillbirths and neonatal mortality from the two rates. Using it, we derive stillbirths adjusted life expectancy, and suggest it reflects a more complete and accurate measure of comparative life expectancies of different countries. Its difference from the traditional life expectancy is used to measure DALY for stillbirths that totals 165.3 million years worldwide. Conclusion Stillbirths almost equals neonatal mortality yet have not received almost equal attention. We hope highlighting them and adjusting life expectancy for it will spur health interventions so that grand convergence of health outcomes in different countries can be more rapidly achieved. We also believe SALE is a more complete and accurate measure of comparative life expectancies.
E01|National Accounts in the Anthropocene: Hueting’s environmental functions and environmentally Sustainable National Income: translation and relevance for ecosystem services|The UN System of National Accounts (SNA) calculates standard national income (NI) under the condition that owned capital is maintained. Roefie Hueting defined in 1969 environmental functions (state, stock) as the possible uses by humans of the environment. Their actual use (flow) nowadays are also called ecosystem services. Hueting defined in 1986 environmentally sustainable national income (eSNI) (flow) under the condition that the vital environmental functions are maintained for future generations. Then eΔ = NI – eSNI gives the national distance to environmental sustainability. Thus eΔ measures the level of ecosystem services concerning the part that infringes upon environmental sustainability, or the abusive part in the ecosystem services that are provided. This communication aspires at a translation of the terminologies by economist Hueting and ecologists in the research of ecosystem services.
E01|Fluctuations de prix des matières premières et économie congolaise : manne d’espoir ou de malédiction ?<BR>[Fluctuations in commodity price and the congolese economy: hope or curse manna?]|With the recent fall in commodity prices, the super-dependent economies of commodities, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have been shaken, especially as these countries consider commodity as manna falling from the sky. Movements in commodity prices have led to significant fluctuations. This article analyzes the short and long-term sensitivity of the Congolese economy to fluctuations in commodity prices and verifies the resource curse hypothesis in the DRC. Using the fully modified least squares method (FM-OLS), we estimated the error correction model. Our conclusions suggest that the Congolese economy suffers adverse effects on short and long-term commodity price shocks. The readjustment of the economy is slow and long. The national economy does not enjoy the benefits of commodity prices, but is only suffering the devastating effects. Hence the commodity do not seem like a manna of hope and the economy remains in an eternal whirlwind of curse. As the DRC does not have a solid fiscal space, the challenge is to find pragmatic, cost-effective solutions. Economic procyclicality weighs on political strategies, and ambitious processes of structural reforms are beneficial.
E01|From Twitter to GDP: Estimating Economic Activity From Social Media|Using all geo-located image tweets shared on Twitter in 2012-2013, I find that the volume of tweets is a valid proxy for estimating current GDP in USD at the country level. Residuals from my preferred model are negatively correlated to a data quality index, indicating that my estimates of GDP are more accurate for countries with more reliable GDP data. Comparing Twitter with more commonly-used proxy of night-light data, I find that variation in Twitter activity explains slightly more of the cross-country variance in GDP. I also exploit the continuous time and geographic granularity of social media posts to create monthly and weekly estimates of GDP for the US, as well as sub- national estimates, including those economic areas that span national borders. My findings suggest that Twitter can be used to measure economic activity in a more timely and more spatially disaggregate way than conventional data and that governments’ statistical agencies could incorporate social media data to complement and further reduce measurement error in their official GDP estimates.
E01|The Consumption Function: A New Perspective|The behaviour of aggregate consumption is conventionally understood from the perspective of the permanent income and life cycle hypotheses. Both of these hypotheses are deduced from the theory of constrained optimization as applied to a ‘representative agent’ that consumes and saves. An alternative way of understanding aggregate consumption expenditure is to see it as primarily a systemic outcome of the adoption of widely upheld rules (‘meso-rules’) that enable trading and contracting in a complex economic system. Such systems require order to function but they must also adapt and evolve. Correspondingly, aggregate consumption can be viewed as being determined by two contrasting historical processes: one involves an aggregation of pre-committed, rule-bound choices and the other open-ended aspirational choices of novel products. Both of these processes are influenced by economic incentives. This is the domain of neoclassical economic theory and it is found that such theorising can tell us a great deal once it is set in its proper historical context. Although a modern complex system perspective derived from the natural sciences is adopted, it is embedded in economic thinking. For example, connections are made to the insights and intuitions of Alfred Marshall, Joseph Schumpeter, Simon Kuznets, Friedrich Hayek and Maynard Keynes. What we understand from them, along with modern complex system analysis, is that, although it is individual decisions that are fundamental in any economic system, it cannot be the case that what we observe at the aggregate level just reflects the optimization decision of a representative agent. As Hayek observed, the role of individual is much more complex and important than this. Using half a century of data, the US consumption function is modelled successfully on the presumption that the economy is a complex system in which there has been the diffusion of a ‘culture of consumerism’ in the post-war era. This has involved the increasing adoption of a particular bundle of meso rules and this has resulted in a steadily increasing ratio of consumption to GDP that has been tending towards a limit. It was found that variables and perspectives drawn from neoclassical economic theory are important in explaining variations in the growth of aggregate consumption.
E01|Reducing Informality Using Two-Sided Incentives: Theory and Experiment|We study the impact of two-sided incentives on the reduction of informality. We model those incentives using the notion of network externalities, which link the (formal or informal) merchant’s profits to the type of customers they serve (formal or informal). Our theoretical framework yields two straightforward testable implications: the merchant will find more profitable to become formal (or informal), as long as more of their customers are formal (or informal); and, formal and informal commercial sectors may coexist in equilibrium. We test these hypotheses using data from a field experiment, conducted with micro and small enterprises in Lima, Peru. Our subjects had to choose, in a repeated fashion, among three ‘platforms’, which proxy for being formal, informal, or performing a reservation activity. We then changed the relative size of the network of formal vis-á-vis informal customers, in order to calculate the consumer’s network externality. We find that the network externality is relatively large, a result that opens up the possibility to reduce commercial informality using two-sided incentives. Moreover, the platform choice between the formal and informal sectors is sensitive to risk preferences.
E01|Estimación del Consumo a partir de sus Componentes Principales en la Tabla Insumo-Producto|Una forma de entender el consumo privado es subdividir esta variable macroeconómica agregada en sus componentes y estudiar las partes. En este documento se estima el comportamiento de los componentes más importantes del consumo privado al cual se denomina componentes principales. Tomando como punto de inicio la información de la Tabla Insumo Producto para distintos años, se utiliza un conjunto de variables proxi para cada componente a partir de los cuales se obtiene una distribución del consumo por componente para cada año. Los componentes restantes forman parte de una serie denominada Otros, cuyo rol es de disciplinar los resultados mediante el registro de ciertas regularidades en su conducta. Esta metodología permite proyectar el consumo privado con un bajo error de proyección.
E01|The Labor Share of Income Around the World: Evidence from a Panel Dataset|This study provides an evaluation of five different methodologies of estimation commonly used in the labor share literature and propose a new measurement. Theglobal dataset of the labor income share across 151 economies is compiledâ€”both developing and developedâ€”for all or part of the period 1970â€“2015. Results show that our suggested indicator is correlated to the other five measures but it also retains unique information. Contrary to the traditional assumption of stable factor shares, it documents the existence of considerable heterogeneity across economies and variability over time. Specifically, there has been a general decline in the labor share around the world, in particular from the mid-1980s onwards.
E01|All?s well that ends well; The end was never well: Collective memory in Khushwant Singh?s Train to Pakistan|The birth of two independent nations India and Pakistan from Hindustan in 1947 was not an easy process. The partition which was conceived for peace, harmony and order brought only violence and hostility on both parts of the country at that point in time. The repercussion of the partition can be seen in the present day also as durable peace since then has never been achieved between the two countries. The poignant partition inspired literature, which has collected the partition experiences of common folk. The partition literature which emerged as a separate genre of literature is a medium of cultural memory which helps in shaping the sensibility of contemporary readers. The present article seeks to examine the role of partition in degenerating the relationship between India and Pakistan and the collective memory shared by the contemporary people by a reading of Khushwant Singh?s Train to Pakistan, a masterpiece of partition literature.
E01|Relative Prices and Sectoral Productivity|We develop a model of the structural transformation with three sectors: agriculture, industry, and services. In addition to reallocation across sectors over time, the model also features a reallocation of consumption across services that differ in their labor intensity and a distribution sector. We use the model to infer sectoral productivity levels across countries by imposing restrictions from data on sectoral employment and final expenditure relative prices. The model implies that productivity levels in services relative to industry are lower in poor relative to rich countries, even though the final expenditure price of services to goods is higher in rich relative to poor countries. These sectoral labor productivity implications across countries are broadly consistent with the available sectoral data. The results suggest that improving productivity levels in services is critical in the aggregate productivity catch up of poor relative to rich countries.
E01|Experimental Economics and the New Commodities Problem|Brynjolfsson, Collis, Diewert, Eggers and Fox (2018) have used experimental economics to measure the welfare benefits of free commodities. In this paper, their methodological approach is adapted to measuring the benefits of new commodities which may or may not be free. Their approach leads to a new method for estimating Hicksian reservation prices. The new methodology in the present paper requires experimental estimates for household willingness to pay for new commodities or estimates for the compensation required for households to give up their use of a new commodity.
E01|Money and the Measurement of Total Factor Productivity|Firms have greatly increased their cash holdings since the mid-1990s. These holdings have an opportunity cost; i.e., allocating firm financial capital into monetary deposits means that investment in real assets is reduced. Traditional measures of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) do not take into account these holdings of monetary assets. Given the recent large increases in these holdings in the U.S. and other advanced economies, it is expected that adding these monetary assets to the list of traditional sources of capital services will reduce the TFP of the business sector. We measure this effect for the U.S. corporate and non-corporate business sectors.
E01|Dying Light: War and Trade of the Separatist-Controlled Areas of Ukraine|The paper investigates how war and the war-related government policies affected economic activity of the separatist-controlled areas of Ukraine. The paper applies a quasi-experimental study design to estimate the impact of two events on the separatist-controlled areas the introduction of the separatist control and the introduction of the second round of the trade ban, which was imposed by the government of Ukraine on the separatist-controlled territories in 2017. Using a difference-in-difference estimation procedure that controls for the yearly and monthly effects, individual fixed effects, and the region-specific time shocks, the study finds that the separatist rule decreased the economic activity by 38% in the Donetsk region and 51% in the Luhansk region according to the preferred specifications. At the same time, the trade ban of the year 2017 against the major industrial enterprises of the separatist-controlled areas decreased luminosity by 20%. The paper argues that the trade disruptions due to the war actions were nested within the negative effect of the separatist rule and accounted for half of it.
E01|Owner Occupied Housing in the CPI and its Impact on Monetary Policy during Housing Booms and Busts| The treatment of owner-occupied housing (OOH) is probably the most important unresolved issue in inflation measurement. How -- and whether -- it is included in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) affects inflation expectations, the measured level of real interest rates, and the behavior of governments, central banks and market participants. We show that none of the existing treatments of OOH are fit for purpose. Hence we propose a new simplified user cost method with better properties. Using a micro-level dataset, we then compare the empirical behavior of eight different treatments of OOH. Our preferred user cost approach pushes up the CPI during housing booms (by 2 percentage points or more). Our findings relate to the following important debates in macroeconomics: the behavior of the Phillips curve in the US during the global financial crisis, and the response of monetary policy to housing booms, secular stagnation, and globalization.
E01|Communicating uncertainty about facts, numbers, and science|Uncertainty is an inherent part of knowledge, and yet in an era of contested expertise, many shy away from openly communicating their uncertainty about what they know, fearful of their audience’s reaction. But what effect does communication of such epistemic uncertainty have? Empirical research is widely scattered across many disciplines. This interdisciplinary review structures and summarises current practice and research across domains, combining a statistical and psychological perspective. This informs a framework for uncertainty communication in which we identify three objects of uncertainty - facts, numbers, and science - and two levels of uncertainty: direct and indirect. An examination of current practices provides a scale of nine expressions of direct uncertainty. We discuss attempts to codify indirect uncertainty in terms of quality of the underlying evidence. We review the limited literature about the effects of communicating epistemic uncertainty on cognition, affect, trust, and decision-making. While there is some evidence that communicating epistemic uncertainty does not necessarily affect audiences negatively, impact can vary between individuals and communication formats. Case studies in economic statistics and climate change illustrate our framework in action. We conclude with advice to guide both communicators and future researchers in this important but so far rather neglected field.
E01|What drives total real unit energy costs globally? A novel LMDI decomposition approach|This paper presents a novel logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition framework that is tailor-made for unit cost indicators. It adds four new models to the existing LMDI model family. The main novelty of the new framework lies in the separation of quantity and price effects captured in unit cost indicators, while retaining the same desirable properties of traditional models. Four case studies apply the novel LMDI framework to the total real unit energy costs (total RUEC) indicator. Total RUEC represents the sum of direct energy costs (for energy products) and indirect energy costs (energy costs embedded in intermediate inputs and passed on along global value chains) as a fraction of value added. This yardstick allows for monitoring shifts in the burden of energy costs on industries. The first three case studies, based on the World Input-Output Database, cover the period between 1995 and 2009. For an up-to-date analysis, a fourth case study collects additional data for 2009-2016 from energy and economic statistics' institutions. Globally, up until 2009, rising costs for crude petroleum/natural gas and the rise of China in the global economy were the largest drivers of total RUEC. In general, increases of indirect energy costs were more substantial than were those of direct energy costs. The total RUEC of Chinese car manufacturers increased much more strongly than did that of American car manufacturers. After 2009 (until 2016), prices for crude petroleum/natural gas and value added generation were major decelerating factors of global direct RUEC, while increases in energy consumption had offsetting effects. This paper provides a suitable tool to scientists who want to build on unit cost indicators in their research in general and to all policy-oriented institutions concerned with monitoring and analysing the energy transition in particular.
E01|The Evolution of Factor Shares: Evidence from Switzerland|While the labor share of income has decreased in most advanced economies since the 1980s, it has remained relatively stable in Switzerland. However, this does not imply that the capital share of income has also remained stable. Our results suggest that the share of imputed capital rental payments to income has decreased. Similar to other countries, Switzerland has seen an increase in the so-called factorless income share that cannot be readily attributed to capital and labor. The increase in factorless income may reflect a rise in economic rents, higher compensation for business risks, or increased compensation for unmeasured input factors, especially intangible capital. We find that the stable labor share in Switzerland cannot be traced back to high wage growth, but rather to subdued investment growth and a high growth rate of the labor force.
E01|UK Regional Nowcasting using a Mixed Frequency Vector Autoregressive Model|Data on Gross Value Added (GVA) are currently only available at the annual frequency for the UK regions and are released with significant delay. Regional policymakers would benefit from more frequent and timely data. The goal of this paper is to provide these. We use a mixed frequency Vector Autoregression (VAR) to provide, each quarter, nowcasts (i.e. forecasts of current GVA which is as yet unknown due to release delays) of annual GVA growth for the UK regions. The information we use to update our regional nowcasts comes from GVA growth for the UK as a whole as this is released in a more timely and frequent (quarterly) fashion. To improve our nowcasts we use entropic tilting methods to exploit the restriction that UK GVA growth is a weighted average of GVA growth for the UK regions. In this paper, we develop the econometric methodology and test it in the context of a real time nowcasting exercise.
E01|An Epidemiological Model of Crisis Spread Across Sectors in The United States|This paper develops a discrete-time epidemiological model for the spread of crises across sectors in the United States for the period 1952-2015. It is the first to use an epidemiological approach with macroeconomic (Flow of Funds) data. An extension of the usual one-period Markov model to a two-period setting incorporates the concept of downturns that may either precede a crisis or from which the sector may recover and avert a crisis. The results indicate that the nonfinancial business and private depository institutions & money market mutual funds sectors are highly contagious while the monetary authority is the least contagious.
E01|Computerizing industries and routinizing jobs: Explaining trends in aggregate productivity|Complementarity across occupations and industries implies that the relative size of those with high productivity growth shrinks, reducing their contributions toward aggregate productivity growth and thereby resulting in its slowdown. This force, especially the shrinkage of occupations with above-average productivity growth through “routinization,” was present since the 1980s. Through the end of the 1990s, it was countervailed by the extraordinary productivity growth in the computer industry, of which output became an increasingly more important input in all industries (“computerization”). It was only when the computer industry’s productivity growth slowed that the negative effect of routinization on aggregate productivity became apparent.
E01|Alternative Methods for Interpolating PPPs|The paper draws on a previous paper by Diewert and Fox which addressed two problems: (i) how to measure aggregate real output and inflation for a group of countries and (ii) how to construct measures of real GDP for a group of countries where the country measures of real GDP are comparable across time and space. In order to address both problems, it is necessary that the group of countries construct Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs). The present paper looks at the related problem of interpolating PPPs between benchmark years when PPPs have been constructed. The paper shows that the method of interpolation that was suggested by Diewert and Fox is equivalent to a variant of the method used by the Penn World Tables to interpolate PPPs between benchmarks. The interpolation methods are compared to actual OECD PPPs for the years 2001-2017.
E01|Cliometrics|"Cliometrics has been defined and summarized in numerous scholarly articles. They all pretty much start with the obvious, that cliometrics is the application of economic theory and quantitative techniques to study history; and then move on to the origin of the name, the joining of Clio (the muse of history), with metrics (""to measure,"" or ""the art of measurement""), allegedly coined by economist Stanley Reiter while collaborating with economic historians Lance Davis and Jonathan Hughes.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
E01|Wealth distribution in Uruguay: capitalizing incomes in the dark|"Wealth inequality is arguably one of the key drivers of overall economic distribution and of major importance in its own right. However, relatively little is known about it, particularly in the developing world. In this article, Uruguay's wealth distribution and composition in 2012 are estimated -for the first time-, based on the capitalization method. Wealth distribution estimations are mainly based on very detailed tax micro-data and own estimations of aggregate national wealth. Results show that at least one third of total wealth is owned by the wealthiest 1% and top 10%Å½s share is almost 60%, whilst 35% is owned by the ""middle 40"". Financial wealth and business property in particular are heavily concentrated among the wealthiest 1%. Sensitivity tests are performed to assess the method's key assumptions, showing that main results are robust. Moreover, estimations are consistent with a novel household wealth survey and with real estate tax data."
E01|Africa Sector Database (ASD): Expansion and update|Since the construction of the Africa Sector Database (ASD) at the Groningen Growth and Development Centre, there has been a wave of statistical reforms in some of the countries in the ASD leading to significant revaluations of GDP. These reforms have provided a clearer picture of the size and structure of production of the countries involved (Sy, 2015). We update the ASD to reflect these statistical changes. Most importantly, following the methodology of ASD, we expand the ASD by constructing sectoral data for seven new African countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda and Uganda. This has resulted in an expanded database (from the 1960s to 2015) covering about 80% of GDP in sub-Saharan Africa.
E01|Competitiveness at the Country-Sector Level: New Measures Based on Global Value Chains|"We propose the so-called domestic ""embodied unit labor costs"" (EULC) at the country-sector level as a new cost-related basis for measures of international competitiveness. EULC take into account that a sector's labor costs constitute only a small share of its total cost which to a large extent consist of expenses for intermediate goods from other sectors. In line with a simple Leontief-type model, the proposed measure is constructed as a weighted average of unit labor costs of all domestic sectors contributing to the final goods of a specific sector. The contribution is expressed in value-added terms and takes global supply chains into account. We also show how EULC can be consistently calculated for sectoral aggregates such as the tradable goods sector. Based on EULC we propose the ""embodied real effective exchange rate"" (EREER) at the country-sector level as a new competitiveness indicator where the relevance of trading partners is quantified by an appropriate value-added measure. The chosen value-added concept replaces gross exports traditionally used as the weight basis in effective exchange rates. Using the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) we employ the proposed indicators to shed new light on changes in cost competitiveness at the sectoral level for Germany, and compare the empirical evidence with selected other euro area countries."
E01|Data, measurement and initiatives for inclusive digitalization and future of work|As the pace of digitalization and automation accelerates globally, and more disruptive innovations in machine learning, artificial intelligence and robotics are expected, new data sources and measurement tools are needed to complement existing valuable statistics and administrative data. This is necessary to better understand the impact of technological change on the labor market and the economy and better inform policy decisions for inclusive people centered growth. In accordance with G20 Roadmap for Digitalisation (2017), points 10, 5 and 7, the authors propose to: i) track technological developments globally in a multidisciplinary and coordinated fashion; ii) develop new methods of measurement for the digital economy; iii) harmonize occupational taxonomies and develop new sources of data and indicators at the international level; iv) Build International Collaborative Platforms for Digital Skills and the Digital Transformation of SMES.
E01|Zur Belastbarkeit von Forderungen nach expansiver Fiskalpolitik an der Nullzinsgrenze: Eine Kritik neukeynesianischer Modelle auf Basis einer Literaturanalyse|In der jüngeren Vergangenheit wurde immer wieder eine expansive Fiskalpolitik zur Wachstumsförderung auf Basis von neukeynesianischen Modellen gefordert. Dieser Modelltyp hat sich wirtschaftshistorisch aus einer Synthese von neoklassischen und keynesianischen Elementen entwickelt und spielt in der modernen Makroökonomie und damit in der Politikberatung eine wichtige Rolle. Zunächst werden die Grundstrukturen eines Standardmodells dargelegt. Danach werden mehrere einschlägige Studien vorgestellt. Darin kommt es an der Nullzinsgrenze zu einer tiefen Wirtschaftskrise, weil die Geldpolitik, die im Modell nur mit dem Zinsinstrument agieren kann, in ihrer Handlungsfähigkeit beschränkt ist. In dieser Situation erweist sich eine expansive Fiskalpolitik, die oberhalb der Nullzinsgrenze im Modell weitgehend wirkungslos ist, über große Fiskalmultiplikatoren als sehr effektiv zur Krisenbekämpfung.

E01|Revisionen der Volkswirtschaftlichen Gesamtrechnungen: Revisionspraxis des Statistischen Bundesamtes und ihre Auswirkungen auf Prognosen|Eine wesentliche Grundlage für makroökonomische Analysen sind die Volkswirtschaftlichen Gesamtrechnungen (VGR). Für Deutschland werden diese vom Statistischen Bundesamt vierteljährlich veröffentlicht. Die erste Veröffentlichung basiert noch auf unvollständigen Daten, so dass die Angaben noch mehrfach revidiert werden, bis etwa dreieinhalb Jahre nach Ende eines Jahres der endgültige Wert vorliegt. Überlagert werden diese laufenden Revisionen von sogenannten Generalrevisionen, mit denen systematische Änderungen in den VGR umgesetzt werden. Beobachten lassen sich nur die Revisionen insgesamt, während mit Blick auf die Arbeit der statistischen Ämter und den Gesetzgeber eher das Ausmaß der laufenden Revisionen von Interesse ist. Der vorliegende Beitrag isoliert mit Hilfe eines einfachen Ansatzes die laufenden Revisionen und untersucht deren Ausmaß sowie, ob sie Systematiken folgen. Dabei lassen sich für eine Reihe preisbereinigter Verwendungsaggregate der VGR wie auch für die Erwerbstätigkeit Systematiken wie Verzerrung, Autokorrelation der Revisionen und Korrelation von Ausmaß der der Revision mit der Zuwachsrate der betreffenden Größe finden. Dies weist auf Möglichkeiten hin, durch bessere Datennutzung die Revisionsanfälligkeit der VGR zu verringern. Dies ist auch mit Blick auf die Genauigkeit von Prognosen wünschenswert, denn die Arbeit zeigt am Beispiel der Gemeinschaftsdiagnose, dass die Fehler der im Herbst veröffentlichten Prognosen eng mit den Revisionen der Daten für das erste Halbjahr des betreffenden Jahres korrelieren.
E01|Cliometrics|"Cliometrics has been defined and summarized in numerous scholarly articles. They all pretty much start with the obvious, that cliometrics is the application of economic theory and quantitative techniques to study history; and then move on to the origin of the name, the joining of Clio (the muse of history), with metrics (""to measure,"" or ""the art of measurement""), allegedly coined by economist Stanley Reiter while collaborating with economic historians Lance Davis and Jonathan Hughes."
E01|Regional prices in early twentieth-century Spain: a country-product-dummy approach|Abstract This paper explores regional price variation in early twentieth-century Spain. Using consumer price information from the bulletins published by the Instituto de Reformas Sociales between 1910 and 1920, we build a dataset with a total of 40,581 quotes covering 22 items for each of the 49 provinces. We then estimate provincial price levels following a country-product-dummy (CPD) approach. Our findings suggest that spatial price variation existed across Spanish provinces. In line with the Balassa–Samuelson conjecture, consumer prices and productivity levels were somewhat related. Additionally, it is shown that prices rose in all provinces after the outbreak of World War I. Even more, it appears that this demand-shock brought about spatial asymmetries in price growth.
E01|Estimación del Consumo a partir de sus Componentes Principales en la Tabla Insumo-Producto|Una forma de entender el consumo privado es subdividir esta variable macroeconómica agregada en sus componentes y estudiar las partes. En este documento se estima el comportamiento de los componentes más importantes del consumo privado al cual se denomina componentes principales. Tomando como punto de inicio la información de la Tabla Insumo Producto para distintos años, se utiliza un conjunto de variables proxi para cada componente a partir de los cuales se obtiene una distribución del consumo por componente para cada año. Los componentes restantes forman parte de una serie denominada Otros, cuyo rol es de disciplinar los resultados mediante el registro de ciertas regularidades en su conducta. Esta metodología permite proyectar el consumo privado con un bajo error de proyección.
E01|Can GDP measurement be further improved? Data revision and reconciliation|Recent years have seen many attempts to combine expenditure-side estimates of U.S. real output (GDE) growth with income-side estimates (GDI) to improve estimates of real GDP growth. We show how to incorporate information from multiple releases of noisy data to provide more precise estimates while avoiding some of the identifying assumptions required in earlier work. This relies on a new insight: using multiple data releases allows us to distinguish news and noise measurement errors in situations where a single vintage does not. Our new measure, GDP++, fits the data better than GDP+, the GDP growth measure of Aruoba et al. (2016) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Historical decompositions show that GDE releases are more informative than GDI, while the use of multiple data releases is particularly important in the quarters leading up to the Great Recession.
E01|Series largas de algunos agregados economicos y demograficos regionales|En esta nota se describe brevemente la ultima actualizacion de RegData, una base de datos que recoge los principales agregados economicos y demograficos de las regiones espaÃ±olas durante las ultimas seis decadas. En su mayoria, las series comienzan en 1950 o 1955 y se extienden hasta 2017.
E01|GDP by Industry in Real Time: Are Revisions Well Behaved?|The monthly data for real gross domestic product (GDP) by industry are used extensively in real time both to ground the Bank of Canada’s monitoring of economic activity and in the Bank’s nowcasting tools, making these data one of the most important high-frequency time series for Canadian nowcasting. This note documents the series’ real-time properties using the reference period August 2007 to September 2017. It shows that revisions to headline GDP-by-industry growth are generally well behaved; that is, they have a zero mean and low variance and are not revised predictably. Therefore, the signal for overall growth from the first GDP-by-industry release can be received with a good deal of confidence. This analysis suggests, however, that while this result is true on average, there are times when revisions can be important. Two examples discussed are when the economy begins to contract or expand and when end-of-quarter revisions are made. Further, revisions to the industrial sectors are not as well behaved. Revisions to some sectors do not have a zero mean and are generally much larger and more volatile than those for headline growth. In addition, revisions for most sectors exhibit predictability. As a result, the monthly signal from the sector data should be considered more cautiously than should the headline growth series.
E01|Evaluating the macro-representativeness of a firm-level database: an application for the Spanish economy|The availability of a firm-level database that represents the productive sector of an economy at the aggregate level is a necessary condition to undertake both reliable policy analysis and economic research in multiple areas. In this paper, we document the construction of a new representative firm-level dataset for Spain using detailed micro-level information provided by firms to the Spanish Commercial Registry and the Bank of Spain. A comparison with National Accounts figures serves to illustrate that the new micro-dataset is able to replicate the growth rates of output, employment and wage bill of the private sector. Using official statistics from the National Institute of Statistics (INE), we show that the resulting dataset covers more than 80% of firms registered in the census over the years 2000-2013 and, more importantly, the resulting dataset replicates the firm size distribution of the Spanish non-financial market economy. The same representativeness analysis is done for the manufacturing sector indicating that this sector is particularly well-represented in the dataset.
E01|Monitoring the Spanish economy from a regional perspective: main elements of analysis|In highly decentralized countries the subnational dimension of economic developments acquires particular relevance, given the existence of potential spillover effects across jurisdictions or the existence of asymmetric impacts of national-wide macroeconomic shocks. At the same time, though, the analysis of sub-national macroeconomic and public finance short-term developments tend to be restricted in many countries due to data limitations. Against this backdrop, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the available data for monitoring macroeconomic and public finance developments at the regional level in Spain, and to present some examples of its practical use in real time. After a thoroughly review of the publicly available information, we identify two key informational gaps in this area of conjunctural analysis, namely: (i) the lack of homogeneous and official quarterly measures of aggregate regional economic activity (in particular, real GDP), and (ii) the limited sample size of time series pertaining to government budgetary developments at the regional level.
E01|Household wealth in Italy and in advanced countries|The paper studies the long-term evolution of household wealth in order to compare the changes in Italian financial wealth and real wealth with those of the most advanced countries. In Italy households’ real wealth is 5.5 times disposable income, while housing wealth is 4.6 times, and financial wealth is 3.8 times disposable income. Therefore total gross wealth is around 9.3 times disposable income. Given that household liabilities make up 80 per cent of disposable income, total net wealth is 8.5 times income. In France and Spain household non-financial wealth also exceeds that of financial assets, while the contrary holds in the United States and in Germany. In Italy the ratio of gross financial wealth to disposable income is in line with that in France, greater than in Spain and Germany, and smaller than in the USA, Japan, the UK, and Canada. With the exception of Germany and Japan, changes in financial assets are mainly due to price changes in financial instruments – holding gains or losses – rather than to financial transactions. In the last two decades the financial portfolio of Italian households has become more similar to the average portfolio of the advanced economies. Italian household debt is the lowest by international comparison.
E01|The Irish GDP in 2016. After the disaster comes a dilemma|The paper examines the disruption of statistics with the publication of the 2015 Ireland GDP at +26.3 per cent year on year. The figure was greeted by international disbelief. Ireland’s statistical authorities reacted with the publication, for the main aggregates, of modified data in parallel with the official one, much less affected by the bias on value added. The bias resulted from the relocation in Ireland of a huge amount of intellectual property capital, of the dimension of the GDP itself.To fix the link between statistical representation and economic fact means to depart from the legal form to let the substance prevail, i.e. depart from the description given by business reports and administrative data.
E01|Measurement of Economic Activity in the Main Beach Tourist Areas in Mexico through the Nightlights Photographed from Space|Based on satellite photos of night light from NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense, and using the methodology proposed by Henderson, Storeygard and Weil (2012), this paper measures the economic growth of the main 15 beach tourist areas in Mexico for the period from 1993 to 2017. This methodology opens a new series of opportunities to measure economic activity, by providing new tools for measurement at the regional level, regardless of administrative boundaries.
E01|Multinational Profit Shifting and Measures throughout Economic Accounts|Profit shifting to low-tax countries imposes challenges for the treatment of multinational enterprises in economic accounts. Using adjustments for profit shifting calculated in Guvenen et al. (2017) under an alternative measurement methodology, this paper empirically demonstrates how the effects of profit shifting cascade throughout a fully articulated set of economic accounts for the United States in 2014. We find a 1.5 percent and 3.5 percent increase in measured U.S. gross domestic product and operating surplus, respectively, and a 33.5 percent decrease in measured income receivable from the rest of world. As a result of offsetting effects, measured U.S. gross national saving decreases by 0.8 percent, and national borrowing increases by 6.9 percent. There are also potentially significant implications for analytic uses of the measures, including decreases for the labor share of income and the return on U.S. direct investment abroad and increases for the trade in services balance and the return on domestic non-financial business.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
E01|Income inequality in France, 1900–2014: Evidence from Distributional National Accounts (DINA)|This paper presents “Distributional National Accounts” (DINA) for France. That is, we combine national accounts, tax and survey data in a comprehensive and consistent manner to build homogenous annual series on the distribution of national income by percentiles over the 1900–2014 period, with detailed breakdown by age, gender and income categories over the 1970–2014 period. Our DINA-based estimates allow for a much richer analysis of the long-run pattern found in previous tax-based series, i.e. a long-run decline in income inequality, largely due to a sharp drop in the concentration of wealth and capital income following the 1914–1945 capital shocks. First, our new series deliver higher inequality levels than the usual tax-based series for the recent decades, because the latter miss a rising part of capital income. Growth incidence curves look dramatically different for the 1950–1983 and 1983–2014 sub-periods. We also show that gender inequality in labor income declined in recent decades, albeit fairly slowly among top labor incomes. E.g. female share among top 0.1% earners was only 12% in 2012 (vs. 7% in 1994 and 5% in 1970). Finally, we find that distributional changes can have large impact on comparisons of well-being across countries. E.g. average pretax income among bottom 50% adults is 20% larger in France than in the U.S., in spite of the fact that aggregate per adult national income is 30% smaller in France.
E01|Growth Facts with Intellectual Property Products: An Exploration of 31 OECD New National Accounts|We document a rise of intellectual property products (IPP) captured by up-to-date national accounts in 31 OECD countries. These countries gradually adopt the new system of national accounts (SNA08) that capitalizes IPP -which was previously treated as an intermediate expense in the pre-SNA93 accounting framework. We examine how the capitalization of IPP affects stylzed growth facts and the big ratios (Kaldor, 1957, Jones, 2016). We find that the capitalization of IPP generates (a) a decline of the accounting labor share, (b) an increase in the capital-to-output ratio across time, and (c) an increase in the rate of return to capital across time. The key accounting assumption behind the IPP capitalization implemented by national accounts is that the share of IPP rents that are attributed to capital, ?, is equal to one. That is, national accounts assume that IPP rents are entirely owed to capital. We question this accounting assumption and apply an alternative split of IPP rents between capital and labor based on the cost structure of R&D as in Koh et al. (2018). We find that this alternative split generates a secularly trendless labor share, a constant capital-to-output ratio, and a constant rate of return across time. We discuss the implications of these new measures of IPP capital -conditional on ?- for cross-country income per capita differences using standard development and growth accounting exercises.

E01|In search of fluctuations : Another look at China’s incredibly stable GDP growth|China’s official real GDP growth has held surprisingly stable in recent years. As national GDP figures influence both policy analysis and political decisions, the GDP growth rate of the massive Chinese economy has also great international implications. Taking the nominal GDP growth and price index data as given and experimenting with alternative deflators, this paper attempts to track missing fluctuations in real GDP growth in recent years. Based on the constructed growth series, real GDP growth decreased during 2015–2016 and picked up in 2017. Growth has been again decelerating this year. Furthermore, the constructed growth rate seems to be well below the recent official figures.
E01|Estimation of Long-term Housing Demand and Related Housing Construction Investment in North Korea (in Korean)|This paper estimates long-term housing demand and the related housing construction investment in North Korea, to ascertain whether the growth in housing construction investment, which is considered an important part of private economic activity in North Korea, will continue in the future. First, long-term housing demand is estimated based on the Mankiw-Weil model. We then calculate the demographics-driven aggregate housing demand in North Korea, by estimating individuals¡¯ demands for housing using age-based survey data on North Korean defectors, and applying it in view of the age structure of North Korea¡¯s population. According to these estimates, the pace of increase in demographics-driven housing demand shows a gradual slowdown, from an annual average of 0.6% to 0.9% between 2001 and 2020, to 0.3% between 2021 and 2030. This paper next forecasts housing demand and the scale of housing construction in North Korea based on the assumption that the country will pursue external openness on full scale from 2021, and that this will lead to considerable growth in income. If external openness leads to a declining mortality rate and increases in individual demand, then an additional 0.6%p (for the low growth scenario) to 1.8%p (for the high growth scenario) in the annual rate of growth in total housing demand is likely, compared to the baseline scenario. The related housing construction investment is anticipated to show additional increases of 12.3 million pyeong (1 pyeong ¡Ö 3.3§³) (low growth scenario) to 34.1 million pyeong (high growth scenario) in terms of area, and of 28 trillion won (low growth) to 77 trillion won (high growth) in terms of amount during the 10 years from 2021. This suggests that, if North Korea¡¯s efforts to open to the world reach full swing, housing demand is likely to grow significantly and more housing construction investment will be needed than is currently projected.
E01|Older and slower: The startup deficit’s lasting effects on aggregate productivity growth|Declining firm entry and the aging incumbent firms have meaningful implications for sluggish U.S. aggregate productivity growth. We provide a framework to characterize the contributions to industry productivity growth across the firm age distribution then apply it to firm-level Census data. Several findings emerge: the relationship between firm age and productivity growth is downward sloping and convex; the magnitudes are substantial but fade quickly; selection and reallocation predominantly drive higher productivity growth of young firms. Our results suggest a cumulative drag on aggregate productivity of 3.1% since 1980 and are expanded upon with an IV strategy and standard model of firm dynamics.
E01|International Value-Added Linkages in Development Accounting|We generalise the traditional development-accounting framework to an open economy setting. In addition to factor endowments and productivity, relative factor costs emerge as a source of real-income variation across countries. These are determined by bilateral trade frictions (which underpin the patterns of “international value-added linkages”) and the global distribution of factor endowments and final expenditures. We use information on endowments, trade balances and value-added trade to back out the relative factor costs of 40 major economies in a theory-consistent manner. This reduces the variation in “residual” TFP required to explain the observed per-capita income differences by more than one half.
E01|Double deflation: theory and practice|Real GDP measured from the output side, GDP(O), should equal real GDP measured from the expenditure side, GDP(E), just as corresponding two approaches to measuring GDP in current prices are necessarily equal. But this is only the case even in theory if real value added in each industry is measured by double deflation. We set out the theory of double deflation using a matrix algebra treatment based on the framework of the Supply and Use Tables. The context is the UKâ€™s national accounts which measures volume growth by chained Laspeyres indices and which currently use single not double deflation. Initially we use simplified assumptions about prices. Later we introduce more realistic assumptions. We analyse the conditions on prices under which real GDP(O) equals real GDP(E). We consider three alternative methods of implementing double deflation. The preferred method makes use of all the price indices which the Office for National Statistics currently collects: Producer Price Indices, Services Producer Price Indices, Consumer Price Indices, Export Price Indices and Import Price Indices. We implement a simplified version of double deflation, using the same data as in the latest vintage of the national accounts, and compare our estimates with the official ones. In this version the same price index is used for each product regardless of whether the product is an output or an input. We find that double-deflated industry growth rates are consistently lower than the official single-deflated ones and also considerably more variable year-to-year. We interpret this finding as reinforcing the case for careful selection of the set of deflators to use for double deflation.
E01|Neutral or factor saving innovations?|We present a theoretical argument to identify the conditions under which a firm prefers to invest in factor saving innovations rather than neutral innovations. We prove that incentives to invest in factor saving innovations positively depend on i) total factor productivity and ii) the scarcity of the factor.
E01|Real convergence in central, eastern and south-eastern Europe|This paper analyses real income convergence in central, eastern and south-eastern Europe (CESEE) to the most advanced EU economies between 2000 and 2016. The relevance of this topic stems both from the far-reaching implications of real income convergence for economic welfare and the importance of convergence for economic and monetary integration with, and within the European Union. The paper establishes stylised facts of convergence, analyses the drivers of economic growth and identifies factors that might explain the differences between fast- and slow-converging economies in the region. The results show that the most successful CESEE economies in terms of the pace of convergence share common characteristics such as, inter alia, a strong improvement in institutional quality and human capital, more outward-oriented economic policies, favourable demographic developments and the quick reallocation of labour from agriculture into other sectors. Looking ahead, accelerating and sustaining convergence in the region will require further efforts to enhance institutional quality and innovation, reinvigorate investment, and address the adverse impact of population ageing.

E01|Missing the wealthy in the HFCS: micro problems with macro implications|Macroeconomic aggregates on households’ wealth have a long tradition and are widely used to analyse and compare economies, yet they do not provide any information about the distribution of assets and liabilities within the population. The Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) constitutes a rich source of micro data that can be used to link macro aggregates with distributional information to compile Distributional National Accounts for wealth. Computing aggregates from this survey usually yields much lower amounts than what is reported by macroeconomic statistics. An important source of this gap may be the lack of the wealthiest households in the HFCS. This article combines a semi-parametric Pareto model estimated from survey data and observations from rich lists with a stratification approach making use of HFCS portfolio structures to quantify the impact of the missing wealthy households on instrument-specific gaps between micro and macro data. We analyse data for Austria and Germany, and find that adjusting for the missing wealthy pushes up inequality even further, increases instrument-specific aggregates, has large effects on equity, but explains less than ten percentage points of the micro-macro gap for most other instruments. Additionally, we document that some countries’ lack of an oversampling strategy for wealthy households limits the cross-country comparability of wealth inequality statistics. JEL Classification: D31, E01
E01|Is the Top Tail of the Wealth Distribution the Missing Link between the Household Finance and Consumption Survey and National Accounts?|The financial accounts of the household sector within the system of national accounts report the aggregate asset holdings and liabilities of all households within a country. In principle, when household wealth surveys are explicitly designed to be representative of all households, aggregating these microdata should correspond to the macro-aggregates. In practice, however, differences are large. We first discuss conceptual and generic differences between those two sources of data. Thereafter, we investigate missing top tail observation from wealth surveys as a source of discrepancy. By fitting a Pareto distribution to the upper tail, we provide an estimate of how much of the gap between the micro- and macrodata is caused by the underestimation of the top tail of the wealth distribution. Conceptual and generic differences, as well as missing top tail observations, explain part of the gap between financial accounts and survey aggregates.
E01|Wealth of the Nation: Scotland’s Productivity Challenge - Technical Appendix|This note provides technical background information on some contents of the report Wealth of the Nation: Scotland’s Productivity Challenge (Kelly et al.,2018). The report shows that Scotland’s productivity performance is only middling in the OECD: Scotland would need to close a productivity gap of 20% to reach the top quartile of most productive OECD countries. It also illustrates that this gap can be attributed to a relatively low capital stock and low Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in equal measure. In this note, we make transparent the data and assumptions underlying these calculations.

E01|Inflation Globally|The Phillips curve remains central to stabilization policy. Increasing financial linkages, international supply chains, and managed exchange rate policy have given core currencies an outsized influence on the domestic affairs of world economies. We exploit such influence as a source of exogenous variation to examine the effects of the recent financial crisis on the Phillips curve mechanism. Using a difference-in-differences approach, and comparing countries before and after the 2008 financial crisis sorted by whether they endured or escaped the crisis, we are able to assess the evolution of the Phillips curve globally.
E01|Oil, equities, and the zero lower bound|Since 2008, oil and equity returns have moved together much more than they did previously. In addition, we show that both oil and equity returns have become more responsive to macroeconomic news. Before 2008, there is little evidence that oil returns were responsive to macroeconomic news. We argue that these results are consistent with a new-Keynesian model that includes oil and incorporates the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. Our empirical findings lend support the model's implication that different rules apply at the zero lower bound.
E01|Accounting for Factorless Income|Comparing US gross domestic product to the sum of measured payments to labor and imputed rental payments to capital results in a large and volatile residual or “factorless” income. We analyze three common strategies of allocating and interpreting factorless income, specifically that it arises from economic profits (case Π), unmeasured capital (case K), or deviations of the rental rate of capital from standard measures based on bond returns (case R). We are skeptical of case Π because it reveals a tight negative relationship between real interest rates and economic profits, leads to large fluctuations in inferred factor-augmenting technologies, and results in profits that have risen since the early 1980s but that remain lower today than in the 1960s and 1970s. Case K shows how unmeasured capital plausibly accounts for all factorless income in recent decades, but its value in the 1960s would have to be more than half of the capital stock, which we find less plausible. We view case R as most promising as it leads to more stable factor shares and technology growth than the other cases, though we acknowledge that it requires an explanation for the pattern of deviations from common measures of the rental rate. Using a model with multiple sectors and types of capital, we show that our assessment of the drivers of changes in output, factor shares, and functional inequality depends critically on the interpretation of factorless income.

E01|Offshore Profit Shifting and Domestic Productivity Measurement|U.S. labor productivity growth has slowed considerably, falling from 2.2 percent per year in 2000â€“04 to 0.63 percent per year in 2004â€“07. This slowdown took place primarily in sectors that either produce or use information technology (IT) services. At about the same time, U.S. multinational enterprises (MNEs) were accumulating considerable overseas earnings that were not being repatriated to the United States, distorting the return to intangible investments made in the United States. In this paper we ask: To what extent is the mismeasurement of MNE production responsible for the measured slowdown in productivity growth? Our preliminary results show that adjusting for the overseas production shifting of U.S. MNEs has a significant impact on measured productivity, particularly in IT-related industries that are research-and-development intensive â€” the industries that Fernald (2014) finds most responsible for the aggregate productivity slowdown. In the R&D intensive industries, our adjustment adds 5.1 percentage points to cumulative labor productivity growth in 1973â€“2014, and in IT-related R&D intensive industries, the cumulative gain in labor productivity is 4.5 percentage points. Notably, most of our adjustment happens after 2004, the period in which unadjusted productivity slows down.
E01|Distributional National Accounts: Methods and Estimates for the United States|This article combines tax, survey, and national accounts data to estimate the distribution of national income in the United States since 1913. Our distributional national accounts capture 100% of national income, allowing us to compute growth rates for each quantile of the income distribution consistent with macroeconomic growth. We estimate the distribution of both pretax and posttax income, making it possible to provide a comprehensive view of how government redistribution affects inequality. Average pretax real national income per adult has increased 60% from 1980 to 2014, but we find that it has stagnated for the bottom 50% of the distribution at about $16,000 a year. The pretax income of the middle class—adults between the median and the 90th percentile—has grown 40% since 1980, faster than what tax and survey data suggest, due in particular to the rise of tax-exempt fringe benefits. Income has boomed at the top. The upsurge of top incomes was first a labor income phenomenon but has mostly been a capital income phenomenon since 2000. The government has offset only a small fraction of the increase in inequality. The reduction of the gender gap in earnings has mitigated the increase in inequality among adults, but the share of women falls steeply as one moves up the labor income distribution, and is only 11% in the top 0.1% in 2014.
E01|From Soviets to oligarchs: inequality and property in Russia 1905-2016|Abstract This paper combines national accounts, survey, wealth and fiscal data (including recently released tax data on high-income taxpayers) in order to provide consistent series on the accumulation and distribution of income and wealth in Russia from the Soviet period until the present day. We find that official survey-based measures vastly under-estimate the rise of inequality since 1990. According to our benchmark estimates, top income shares are now similar to (or higher than) the levels observed in the United States. We also find that inequality has increased substantially more in Russia than in China and other ex-communist countries in Eastern Europe. We relate this finding to the specific transition strategy followed in Russia. According to our benchmark estimates, the wealth held offshore by rich Russians is about three times larger than official net foreign reserves, and is comparable in magnitude to total household financial assets held in Russia.

E01|Croissance potentielle : la politique économique au royaume des aveugles ?|La crise a révélé les insuffisances graves de la théorie macroéconomique dominante et des conceptions de politique macroéconomique qu’elle inspire. Le cadre analytique dans lequel raisonnent la plupart des macroéconomistes, celui qui guide les institutions nationales, européennes et internationales dans leurs orientations, est intrinsèquement inapte à rendre compte des évolutions structurelles d’une économie financiarisée et en profonde mutation. Les concepts-clés qui en sont les fondements induisent des choix d’indicateurs fournissant des signaux erronés. Les grandeurs macroéconomiques standards sur lesquelles se fondent les politiques économiques se sont vidées de leur sens, mais constituent néanmoins toujours les piliers des diagnostics. Refonder la macroéconomie est une urgence ; mais les ébauches actuellement offertes ne sont pas à la hauteur des défis. POTENTIAL GROWTH: ECONOMIC POLICY IN THE KINGDOM OF THE BLIND The 2009 crisis has shed a crude light on the deep shortcomings of standard macroeconomic theory and of its representation of the workings of macroeconomic policy. The analytical framework in which most macroeconomists reason, the one that guides national, European, and international institutions’ orientations, is intrinsically unable to deliver insights on the structural evolutions of economies that are massively intertwined with finance and in perpetual technological change. The key concepts on which this framework is built lead to the choice of indicators that generate misleading signals. Standard macroeconomic aggregates guiding economic policies have been losing their meaning, but continue to be relied upon when forming a diagnosis on national economies. Rebuilding macroeconomic theory on new foundations is urgent; but the avenues that are being explored currently are far from providing adequate answers.
E01|Propriétés cycliques des transferts de fonds des migrants marocains|Le phénomène de transferts de fonds suscite un débat passionnant au sein de la classe politique, des chercheurs et des universitaires. Ceci est dû au fait qu’il touche à des aspects humains, économiques et financiers. Les transferts de fonds sont considérés comme étant une source de financement importante pour la majorité des pays en développement. Le Maroc n’échappe pas à cette logique. Il est, en effet, l’un des pays qui reçoit le plus de transferts de fonds dans le monde. L’objet de cet article est d’étudier les propriétés cycliques des transferts de fonds vers le Maroc. En utilisant des filtres économétriques adéquats et pertinents ainsi que des données trimestrielles nous arrivons à mettre en lumière des aspects empiriques importants des transferts de fonds. En effet, les transferts de fonds constituent un enjeu majeur pour l’économie marocaine, de même, jouer les rôles importants de stabilisateur et d’amortisseurs. Remittances raise a fascinating debate in the political class, researchers and academics. This is because they affect human, economic and financial aspects. In Morocco, remittances are considered an important source of funding. It is, indeed, one of the countries that receive the most remittances in the world. The aim of this paper is to study the cyclical properties of remittances to Morocco. Using appropriate data and relevant econometric filters we can highlight important empirical aspects of remittances. Indeed, remittances constitute a major challenge for the Moroccan economy as well, play important roles in stabilizing and as a shock absorber
E01|Economic convergence and exchange rate misalignments in the European Union|We investigate (i) the characteristics of real economic and price convergence, (ii) the relationship between economic growth (convergence) and real exchange rate (RER) misalignments within the European Union (EU) during the period 1995–2016. In addition to the relative external price level of GDP, we quantified an alternative indicator for the RER: the internal relative price of services to goods, as measured from the expenditure side of GDP. We interpreted RER-misalignments as deviations from levels consistent with levels of economic development among EU countries. Regarding real convergence, the “catching up” of the less developed member states to the more affluent ones within the EU was expressly rapid in terms of relative per capita growth measured at current PPPs; it was less impressive if measured at constant PPPs, and rather modest in terms of relative real GDP-growth. As for price levels and the relative price of services to goods, a rapid convergence could be observed until the international financial crisis, but this process halted in 2008. Using pooled OLS and dynamic panel techniques, we found that within the EU there is a negative relationship between the contemporaneous sign of RER-misalignment (based on both the external price level and internal relative prices) and economic growth: over- (under-) valuations are associated with lower (higher) growth. This is mainly due to developments in countries operating under fixed exchange rate regimes. Our results indicate that the level of development does not influence the strength of the growth-misalignment relationship within the EU. These results are robust to the applied panel estimation method. Regarding the external price level, we find that the positive relationship between undervaluation and growth diminishes with increasing size of undervaluation. The aggregate effect of misalignments is significantly negative on both export market shares and the ratio of gross fixed capital formation to GDP: both the competitiveness and the investment channel play an important role in the relationship between growth and RER misalignments. As an extension, we analyse the relationship between growth and the misalignment of wages from productivity levels; “wage-misalignments” are also negatively associated with economic growth. Although our study carries policy messages – in particular, mild real exchange rate undervaluations are positively, while overvaluations are negatively associated with growth and real economic convergence – the RER is an endogenous variable, which is not under direct policy control. Our results point to the importance of a growth strategy avoiding overvaluation on the one hand, and to the futility of aiming at excessive undervaluation, on the other.
E01|Capital Accumulation, Private Property and Rising Inequality in China, 1978-2015|This paper combines national accounts, survey, wealth and fiscal data (including recently released tax data on high-income taxpayers) in order to provide consistent series on the accumulation and distribution of income and wealth in China over the 1978-2015 period. We find that the aggregate national wealth-income ratio has increased from 350% in 1978 to 700% in 2015. This can be accounted for by a combination of high saving and investment rates and a gradual rise in relative asset prices, reflecting changes in the legal system of property. The share of public property in national wealth has declined from about 70% in 1978 to 30% in 2015, which is still a lot higher than in rich countries (close to 0% or negative). Next, we provide sharp upward revision of official inequality estimates. The top 10% income share rose from 27% to 41% of national income between 1978 and 2015, while the bottom 50% share dropped from 27% to 15%. China’s inequality levels used to be close to Nordic countries and are now approaching U.S. levels.
E01|Owner Occupied Housing in the CPI and Its Impact On Monetary Policy During Housing Booms and Busts| The treatment of owner-occupied housing (OOH) is probably the most important unresolved issue in infl ation measurement. The European Union has been grappling with this problem for over a decade. We argue for measuring OOH costs using a particular version of the user cost method. We then compare the impact of eight different treatments of OOH on the consumer price index (CPI), using quantile hedonic regression. The impact on the CPI is large, and the treatment of OOH emerges as an essential prerequisite to discussions over how an infl ation targeting central bank should respond to housing booms and busts.
E01|The network of inter-industry flows in a SAM framework|The networks of nominal flows between industries in a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) framework are studied. The flows of the SAM submatrices of production (or output of goods and services) and intermediate consumption, are identified, which are constructed from the supply and use tables of the National Accounts. From these flows, the inter-industry networks are induced. The structure of these networks are analysed, as well as, the underlying generation of income. An application to Portugal illustrates the approach.
E01|Competitiveness at the country-sector level: New measures based on global value chains|"We propose the so-called domestic ""embodied unit labor costs"" (EULC) at the country-sector level as a new cost-related basis for measures of international competitiveness. EULC take into account that a sector's labor costs constitute only a small share of its total cost which to a large extent consist of expenses for inter- mediate goods from other sectors. In line with a simple Leontief-type model, the proposed measure is constructed as a weighted average of unit labor costs of all do- mestic sectors contributing to the final goods of a specific sector. The contribution is expressed in value-added terms and takes global supply chains into account. We also show how EULC can be consistently calculated for sectoral aggregates such as the tradable goods sector. Based on EULC we propose the 'embodied real effec- tive exchange rate' (EREER) at the country-sector level as a new competitiveness indicator where the relevance of trading partners is quantified by an appropriate value-added measure. The chosen value-added concept replaces gross exports tra- ditionally used as the weight basis in effective exchange rates. Using the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) we employ the proposed indicators to shed new light on changes in cost competitiveness at the sectoral level for Germany, and compare the empirical evidence with selected other euro area countries."
E01|Do demographics prevent consumption aggregates from reflecting micro-level preferences?|Most simulated micro-founded macro models use solely consumer-demand aggregates in order to estimate preference parameters of a representative consumer, for use in policy evaluation. Focusing on dynamic models with time-separable preferences, we show that aggregation holds if, and only if, momentary utility functions fall in the Identical-Shape Harmonic Absolute-Risk Aversion (ISHARA) utility class, identifying which parameters of ISHARA utility functions are allowed to vary over time. Given this theoretical result, it should be easy to empirically reject the aggregation properties that the macroeconomic representative-consumer identification approach requires: it suffices to show that permanent incomes guaranteeing the same living standard across households of different size violate an affine relationship. In order to test the validity of this affine equation, we develop a vignette survey that produces appropriate data without demand-estimation restrictions imposed by models. Surprisingly, in six countries, this equation is not rejected, lending support to using consumer-demand aggregates.
E01|Global Value Chains and Vertical Specialization: The case of Portuguese Textiles and Shoes exports|This paper evaluates the growing participation of the Portuguese economy, and especially of the textiles, leather, and shoes industry, in the so-called Global Value Chains (GVCs).We use the 2016 edition of the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) to empirical assess the changes in the geography of imports and exports of the Portuguese textiles, leather and shoes industry as well as quantify the growing vertical specialization in this sector. We also measure value added, import and employment coefficients for the Portuguese economy and the Portuguese textiles, leather, and shoes sector. The results show that Portuguese textiles, leather, and shoes trade have been more concentrated in Spain, Italy, India and China and less concentrated in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. This sector is more relevant in the Portuguese economy than in any other Eurozone economy in terms of output, employment and value-added, and it has been recovering its relevance in the Portuguese economy since 2009.Textiles, leather, and shoes is the manufacturing industry with the higher potential to generate new jobs in Portugal. Despite the negative contribution of the financial crisis, vertical specialization of Portuguese textiles, leather, and shoes exports have been increasing ever since.
E01|Shining a Light on Purchasing Power Parities|Nighttime lights data are a measure of economic activity whose error is plausibly independent of the measurement errors of most conventional indicators. Therefore, we can use nighttime lights as an independent benchmark to assess existing measures of economic activity (Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin (2016)). We employ this insight to generate three findings in the study of PPP-adjusted estimates of GDP around the world between 1992 and 2010. First, we find that while market exchange rates described poor economies better than did PPP-adjusted estimates in the late 1990s (Dowrick and Akmal 2008; Almas 2012), this pattern has disappeared by the 2010s. Second, we also find that estimates of PPPs have been steadily improving from one price survey round to the next, including during the controversial 2005 and 2011 rounds. Third, we leverage this fact to assess whether it is optimal to measure relative prices as close as possible to the year of interest or to use the latest available relative price data and discard the rest, and provide a theoretical framework in which the latter may be optimal. Using data from the Penn World Tables, we find that, indeed, it is optimal to only use the latest price data, and hence, to revise existing PPP-adjusted estimates whenever a new price survey is released.
E01|Using Massive Online Choice Experiments to Measure Changes in Well-being|GDP and derived metrics (e.g., productivity) have been central to understanding economic progress and well-being. In principle, the change in consumer surplus (compensating expenditure) provides a superior, and more direct, measure of the change in well-being, especially for digital goods, but in practice, it has been difficult to measure. We explore the potential of massive online choice experiments to measure consumers’ willingness to accept compensation for losing access to various digital goods and thereby estimate the consumer surplus generated from these goods. We test the robustness of the approach and benchmark it against established methods, including incentive compatible choice experiments that require participants to give up Facebook for a certain period in exchange for compensation. The proposed choice experiments show convergent validity and are massively scalable. Our results indicate that digital goods have created large gains in well-being that are missed by conventional measures of GDP and productivity. By periodically querying a large, representative sample of goods and services, including those which are not priced in existing markets, changes in consumer surplus and other new measures of well-being derived from these online choice experiments have the potential for providing cost-effective supplements to existing national income and product accounts.
E01|Meaningful Information for Domestic Economies in the Light of Globalization – Will Additional Macroeconomic Indicators and Different Presentations Shed Light?|"Globalisation presents significant statistical challenges, particularly for small and open economies in terms of measuring macroeconomic level and growth indicators and communicating the results in a meaningful way. In the aftermath of the so-called “Irish case”, Eurostat with its partners in the European Statistical System is looking into how, within the existing accounting frameworks, additional indicators and presentations of the accounts that allow users to follow domestic and global developments could be conceived. The work takes account of recommendations which have been developed by a high level group in Ireland for improving insight into the Irish economy2. However it goes beyond that, as any new indicator or breakdown, particularly in a European context, should be comparable across countries and not be seen as a GDP or GNI ""a la carte"" for each country to choose from under specific circumstances. The paper presents the findings of the respective European work streams to date in terms of methodology, indicators, building new statistical infrastructural elements and new cooperation models between statistical compilers. It invites a critical review of the suggestions put forward."
E01|Seasonal Adjustment of NIPA data|In the 2018 comprehensive update of the national income and product accounts, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released not seasonally adjusted data, and modified its seasonal adjustment procedures. I find some indication of residual seasonality in the seasonally adjusted data as published before this update. The evidence for residual seasonality is weaker in the seasonally adjusted data after the update. I also directly seasonally adjusted the aggregate not seasonally adjusted data, and this entirely avoids residual seasonality. The average absolute difference between my seasonally adjusted real GDP data and the current official published version is 1.1 percentage points in quarter-over-quarter annualized growth rates.
E01|Eliminating the Pass-Through: Towards FDI Statistics that Better Capture the Financial and Economic Linkages between Countries|FDI plays a central role in managing global production networks, but FDI statistics also reflect other factors, including tax avoidance, that make it difficult to differentiate between FDI for “long-term” investments that serves as a source of growth and FDI that is purely financial and has little real economic impact as it merely passes through an economy. This latter FDI also obscures the ultimate sources and destinations of FDI. This paper addresses these challenges by developing a framework for consolidated FDI statistics based on the nationality of the MNE group that complements residency-based FDI statistics. While residency-based statistics are useful to identify where financial claims and liabilities are held, nationality-based statistics provide information on who makes the decisions, reaps the benefits, and bears the risk. Consolidated FDI statistics remove pass-through capital and are better for understanding ‘real’ financial integration between economies and for analysing the relationship between the financing of MNEs and their operations. While some countries produce separate FDI statistics for resident Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) to identify pass-through capital, we demonstrate that this only provides a partial view and that about one-quarter of the inward FDI positions in a selection of European countries reflects pass-through capital through non-SPEs.
E01|The Productivity J-Curve: How Intangibles Complement General Purpose Technologies|General purpose technologies (GPTs) such as AI enable and require significant complementary investments, including business process redesign, co-invention of new products and business models, and investments in human capital. These complementary investments are often intangible and poorly measured in the national accounts, even if they create valuable assets for the firm. We develop a model that shows how this leads to an underestimation of output and productivity in the early years of a new GPT, and how later, when the benefits of intangible investments are harvested, productivity will be overestimated. Our model generates a Productivity J-Curve that can explain the productivity slowdowns often accompanying the advent of GPTs, as well as the follow-on increase in productivity later. We use our model to assess how AI-related intangible capital is currently affecting measured total factor productivity (TFP) and output. We also conduct a historical analysis of the roles of intangibles tied to R&D, software, and computer hardware, finding substantial and ongoing effects of software in particular and hardware to a lesser extent.
E01|The Rise of Cloud Computing: Minding your Ps, Qs and Ks|Cloud computing—computing done on an off-site network of resources accessed through the Internet—is revolutionizing how computing services are used. However, because cloud is so new and it largely is an intermediate input to other industries, it is difficult to track in the U.S. statistical system. Moreover, there is a paucity of systematic information on the prices of cloud services. To begin filling this gap, this paper does three things. First, we define the different segments of cloud computing and document its explosive expansion. Second, we develop new hedonic prices indexes for cloud services based on quarterly data for compute, database, and storage services offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) from 2009 to 2016. These indexes fall rapidly over the sample period, with quickening (and double digit) rates of decline for all three products starting at the beginning of 2014. Finally, we highlight the puzzle of why investment in IT equipment in the NIPAs has been so weak while capital expenditures have exploded for IT equipment associated with cloud infrastructure. We suggest that cloud service providers are undertaking large amounts of own-account investment in IT equipment and that some of this investment may not be captured in GDP.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
E01|Factor Incomes in Global Value Chains: The Role of Intangibles|Recent studies document a decline in the share of labour and a simultaneous increase in the share of residual (‘factorless’) income in national GDP. We argue the need for study of factor incomes in cross-border production to complement country studies. We define a GVC production function that tracks the value added in each stage of production in any country-industry. We define a new residual as the difference between the value of the final good and the payments to all tangibles (capital and labour) in any stage. We focus on GVCs of manufactured goods and find the residual to be large. We interpret it as income for intangibles that are (mostly) not covered in current national accounts statistics. We document decreasing labour and increasing capital income shares over the period 2000-14. This is mainly due to increasing income for intangible assets, in particular in GVCs of durable goods. We provide evidence that suggests that the 2000s should be seen as an exceptional period in the global economy during which multinational firms benefitted from reduced labour costs through offshoring, while capitalising on existing firm-specific intangibles, such as brand names, at little marginal cost.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
E01|Imputing Away the Ladder: Implications of Changes in National Accounting Standards for Assessing Inter-country Inequalities|Over the last half century, a large literature has developed on both the nature and the drivers of uneven development. While different methodologies and theoretical approaches to the issue of convergence abound, the use of GDP growth as a measure of economic growth has, remarkably, gone unquestioned. This paper reviews the convergence debates to date, and examines what the changes to the System of National Accounts (SNA) - the international standard for constructing macroeconomic indicators such as GDP - imply for assessing economic convergence. The 1993 and 2008 revisions to the SNA include several major changes to how production is measured - including the reclassification of financial intermediation services, R&D, weapons systems and owner-occupied dwellings as productive activities - all areas in which developed countries have had an advantage in recent decades. We argue that these changes to the production boundary constitute a form of ‘kicking away the ladder,’ i.e. redefining the yardstick of development to fit the new strengths of developed economies. We analyze data series for a range of countries concurrently available under the 1968 SNA, 1993 SNA and 2008 SNA standards. The earlier measure shows a larger and faster convergence of most countries in ‘the Rest’ with those of ‘the West’. Going a step further, we build on Basu and Foley’s (2013) Measured Value-Added concept as a proxy of ‘Core GDP’. This indicator omits any sector for which value-added is imputed based on net incomes, in the absence of an independent measure of output. This allows us to examine more countries and a longer, more consistent time series than concurrent SNA data, but the conclusions are the same - developing countries have caught up more in Core-GDP terms than the contemporary imputation-heavy measure of GDP would suggest. These findings suggest that the current measure of GDP has become decoupled from core employment-generating activities, and is therefore a misleading measure of growth in an economy. Furthermore, it is inconsistent with the understanding the Sustainable Development Goals of inclusive and sustainable growth. Finally, the paper considers the political economy implications of the changes in GDP methodology, such as the justification of voting shares in international financial institutions, epistemological consequences, and domestic political economy considerations.
E01|A Data Map of Existing UK Data Sources Related to Regional Trade|Considering the political importance of devolution, and emerging economic issues in UKâ€™s trade policy arising from Brexit, thereâ€™s a pressing demand for data which can help understand internal trade flows within the UK. This paper is the first in a series which seeks to understand and evaluate the feasibility of producing robust interregional trade flows statistics for the UK.
E01|UK regional nowcasting using a mixed frequency vector autoregressive model|Data on Gross Value Added (GVA) are currently only available at the annual frequency for the UK regions and are released with significant delay. Regional policymakers would benefit from more frequent and timely data. The goal of this paper is to provide these. We use a mixed frequency Vector Autoregression (VAR) to provide, each quarter, nowcasts (i.e. forecasts of current GVA which is as yet unknown due to release delays) of annual GVA growth for the UK regions. The information we use to update our regional nowcasts comes from GVA growth for the UK as a whole as this is released in a more timely and frequent (quarterly) fashion. To improve our nowcasts we use entropic tilting methods to exploit the restriction that UK GVA growth is a weighted average of GVA growth for the UK regions. In this paper, we develop the econometric methodology and test it in the context of a real time nowcasting exercise.
E01|Can GDP measurement be further improved? Data revision and reconciliation|Recent years have seen many attempts to combine expenditure-side estimates of U.S. real output (GDE) growth with income-side estimates (GDI) to improve estimates of real GDP growth. We show how to incorporate information from multiple releases of noisy data to provide more precise estimates while avoiding some of the identifying assumptions required in earlier work. This relies on a new insight: using multiple data releases allows us to distinguish news and noise measurement errors in situations where a single vintage does not. Our new measure, GDP++, fits the data better than GDP+, the GDP growth measure of Aruoba et al. (2016) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadephia. Historical decompositions show that GDE releases are more informative than GDI, while the use of multiple data releases is particularly important in the quarters leading up to the Great Recession.
E01|The Digital Economy, New Products and Consumer Welfare|Benefits of the Digital Economy are evident in everyday life, but there are significant concerns that these benefits may not be appropriately reflected in official statistics. The measurement of the net benefits of new and disappearing products depends on what type of price index the statistical agency is using to deflate final demand aggregates. We examine this measurement problem when the agency uses any standard price index formula for its deflation of a value aggregate, such as GDP. We also apply the methodology to the problem of measuring the effects of product substitutions for disappearing items. Our exact expressions for biases inherent in different approaches provide a theoretical basis and framework for the emerging empirical literature on new goods and services, and for assessing the quality adjustment methodologies used in practice.
E01|Double Deflation: theory and practice|Real GDP measured from the output side, GDP(O), should equal real GDP measured from the expenditure side, GDP(E), just as corresponding two approaches to measuring GDP in current prices are necessarily equal. But this is only the case even in theory if real value added in each industry is measured by double deflation. We set out the theory of double deflation using a matrix algebra treatment based on the framework of the Supply and Use Tables. The context is the UK’s national accounts which measures volume growth by chained Laspeyres indices and which currently use single not double deflation. Initially we use simplified assumptions about prices. Later we introduce more realistic assumptions. We analyse the conditions on prices under which real GDP(O) equals real GDP(E). We consider three alternative methods of implementing double deflation. The preferred method makes use of all the price indices which the Office for National Statistics currently collects: Producer Price Indices, Services Producer Price Indices, Consumer Price Indices, Export Price Indices and Import Price Indices. We implement a simplified version of double deflation, using the same data as in the latest vintage of the national accounts, and compare our estimates with the official ones. In this version the same price index is used for each product regardless of whether the product is an output or an input. We find that double-deflated industry growth rates are consistently lower than the official single-deflated ones and also considerably more variable year-to-year. We interpret this finding as reinforcing the case for careful selection of the set of deflators to use for double deflation.
E01|Temporal disaggregation of overlapping noisy quarterly data using state space models: Estimation of monthly business sector output from Value Added Tax data in the UK|This paper derives monthly estimates of turnover for small and medium size businesses in the UK from rolling quarterly VAT-based turnover data. We develop a state space approach for filtering and temporally disaggregating the VAT figures, which are noisy and exhibit dynamic unobserved components. We notably derive multivariate and nonlinear methods to make use of indicator series and data in logarithms respectively. After illustrating our temporal disaggregation method and estimation strategy using an example industry, we estimate monthly seasonally adjusted figures for the seventy-five industries for which the data are available. We thus produce an aggregate series representing approximately a quarter of gross value added in the economy. We compare our estimates with those derived from the Monthly Business Survey and find that the VAT-based estimates show a different time profile and are less volatile. In addition to this empirical work our contribution to the literature on temporal disaggregation is twofold. First, we provide a discussion of the effect that noise in aggregate figures has on the estimation of disaggregated model components. Secondly, we illustrate a new temporal aggregation strategy suited for overlapping data. The technique we adopt is more parsimonious than the seminal method of Harvey and Pierse (1984) and can easily be generalised to nonoverlapping data.
E01|Cloud Computing and National Accounting|As the digitalisation of the economy progresses, one of the changes in business models affecting statistics including GDP and trade data is the adoption of cloud computing services in place of fixed investment in computer and communications hardware and the development of own-account software. This rapidly growing phenomenon involves the detachment of the physical location of data and computing processes from their creation, ownership and use, potentially introducing transactions across national borders. In this paper, we construct price indices for cloud services in the UK, showing significant price declines both before and after adjusting for quality in the past few years. We discuss the conceptualisation of a volume measure for cloud services. We discuss the implications of cloud use by businesses for the interpretation of measured business investment, GDP and productivity growth, noting in particular the limitations of measuring total factor productivity through growth accounting, and the importance of double deflation when there are significant changes in the price of intermediate goods such as cloud services. We discuss also the implications for the interpretation of international trade statistics. Finally, we set out the requirements for official statistical surveys to be able to track cloud computing in the future.
E01|Fan charts around GDP projections based on probit models of downturn risk|This paper describes a method for parameterising fan charts around GDP growth forecasts of the major OECD economies as well as the aggregate OECD. The degree of uncertainty – reflecting the overall spread of the fan chart – is based on past forecast errors, but the skew – reflecting whether risks are tilted to the downside – is derived from a probit model-based assessment of the probability of a future downturn. This approach is applied to each of the G7 countries separately, with combinations of variables found to be useful in predicting future downturns at different horizons up to 8 quarters: at short horizons of 2-4 quarters, a flattening or inverted yield curve slope, recent sharp falls in house prices, share prices or credit; at longer horizons of 6-8 quarters, sustained strong growth in house prices, share prices and credit; and at all horizons, a tight labour market and rapid growth in OECD-wide (or in some cases euro-wide) house prices, share prices or credit. The in-sample fit of the probit models appears reasonably good for all G7 countries. The predicted probabilities from the probit models provide a graduated assessment of downturn risk, which is reflected in the degree of skew in the fan chart. Fan charts computed on an out-of-sample basis around pre-crisis OECD forecasts published in June 2008 encompass the extreme outturns associated with the Global Financial Crisis for five of the G7 countries. A weakness of the approach is that, although it predicts a clear majority of past downturns, it will not predict atypical downturns. For example, in the current conjuncture, it is unlikely that current concerns about risks associated with Brexit, an escalation of trade tensions or spillovers from emerging markets would be picked up by the models. At the same time, a severe downturn triggered by such atypical events might be more severe if more typical risk factors are also high.
E01|Including unpaid household activities: An estimate of its impact on macro-economic indicators in the G7 economies and the way forward|The System of National Accounts, which provides information on important macroeconomic indicators such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), household disposable income and final consumption, typically excludes the value of unpaid household activities. Exceptions are made for the production of goods for own final consumption (e.g. subsistence farming), the services from owner-occupied dwellings, and the production from employment of paid domestic staff, but the output from unpaid domestic and personal services, such as the preparation of meals, taking care of children, cleaning, repairs, volunteering, etc., is all excluded. This report deals with the impact of including unpaid household activities on macro-economic aggregates for G7-countries. It builds upon earlier work by Ahmad and Koh (2011) and van de Ven and Zwijnenburg (2016). The report starts off with discussing the pros and cons of including unpaid household activities, or more specifically, the reasons why these activities are currently excluded from the macro-economic aggregates that can be derived from the framework of national accounts. It then discusses how estimates can be compiled using statistics from time use surveys and other available information. Here, also some of the complexities related to the approximate valuation of unpaid household activities are being addressed. Subsequently, results are presented for the level estimates of GDP as well as for economic growth when including the value of unpaid household activities for the G7 economies. The report concludes with a number of recommendations on the way forward, also touching upon some of the (potential) policy implications of the work on valuing unpaid household activities.
E01|How to deflate rigorously Economic Variables?|This brief technical note presents a judicious way to deflate rigorously economic variables by dissociating variations related to market fluctuations (or supply and demand) from monetary phenomenon driven by monetary policies.
E01|Business Cycles in Economics|The business cycles are generated by the oscillating macro-/micro-/nano- economic output variables in the economy of the scale and the scope in the amplitude/frequency/phase/time domains in the economics. The accurate forward looking assumptions on the business cycles oscillation dynamics can optimize the financial capital investing and/or borrowing by the economic agents in the capital markets. The book's main objective is to study the business cycles in the economy of the scale and the scope, formulating the Ledenyov unified business cycles theory in the Ledenyov classic and quantum econodynamics.
E01|Nivel de riqueza regional, bienestar y desarrollo<BR>[Regional wealth, well-being and development]|In this paper an analysis of the level of wealth of the Spanish regions is made, taking from the results of the Social Welfare Index carried out by the Valencian Institute of Economic Research (IVIE) and the BBVA Foundation. For this purpose, this indicator is compared with two other synthetic indicators of development and well-being. The results allow us to verify the differences in transformation of wealth into development between the different regions.
E01|Tracing value-added and double counting in sales of foreign affiliates and domestic-owned companies|In this paper, we propose a new accounting framework for the decomposition of value-added into domestic, foreign and double counting terms in domestic sales. In this framework, we show where the value-added double counting is derived from and give an explicit expression of domestic and foreign double counting terms based on the Inter-Country Input-Output (ICIO) tables’ Ghosh insight. We can distinguish domestic sales from exports and trace the value added and double counting in sales of foreign affiliates and domestic-owned enterprises. Based on this framework, we then calculate the value-added by foreign-owned and domestic-owned firms in exports and in domestic sales by using an Inter-Country Input-Output table split according to ownership. Preliminary results suggest that there is much more double counting in sales of foreign affiliates than in exports and that more value-added is created through exports than through sales of foreign affiliates in world GDP.

E01|Forecasting GDP: Do Revisions Matter?|"This paper investigates the informational content of regular revisions to real GDP growth and its components. We perform a real-time forecasting exercise for the advance estimate of real GDP growth using dynamic regression models that include GDP and GDP component revisions. Echoing other work in the literature, we find little evidence that including aggregate GDP growth revisions improves forecast accuracy relative to an AR(1) baseline model; however, when we include revisions to components of GDP (i.e. C, I, G, X, and M) we find improvements in forecast accuracy. Overall, nearly 68\% of all models that contain subsets of component revisions outperform our baseline model. The ""best"" component-augmented model forecasts roughly 0.2 percentage points better, and a large subset of models improve RMSFE by more than 5%. Finally, we use Bayesian model comparison to demonstrate that differences in forecast performance are unlikely to be the result of statistical noise. Our results imply that component revisions, in particular to consumption, contain important information for forecasting GDP growth."
E01|Unconditional Basic Income: Who gets it? Who pays for it? A social Accounting Approach to Distribution|Unconditional basic income is not a new topic in political economy, and it gains new momentum as more and more research is being devoted to it. The discussion focusses on the adequacy and effects such a policy measure may entail for a person and his socio-economic situation, usually. Object of investigation is the individual, and the corresponding theory is of micro-economic descent. In this paper, in contrast, we develop a method of how to assess feasibility and consequences of an unconditional basic income for a modern, open economy, on the macroeconomic level, using concepts and statistics of a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) as our main tool. A SAM-based approach can measure, and perhaps model, the impact on the economic activity of a country, and on its economic institutions of new policy measures such as introducing an unconditional basic income. The economic activity of a country is expressed in monetary flows as registered in the National Accounts. So their underlying principles and definitions are adopted. However, the habitual way of putting an economy into a sequence of institutional accounts connecting each institution’s income to the cost, - similar to business accounting - reveals only one, namely the inner-institutional half of the economic circuit. The other, outer half, namely, how the costs of one institution generate income for another one is better captured by the format of a Social Accounting Matrix. In the paper, the impact of an unconditional basic income is quantified, for macroeconomic aggregates of institutional sectors and socio-economic groups of households, taking the German and the Portuguese economies as examples. Purpose of the paper is not to argue for, or against, an unconditional basic income, but to offer a scientific tool with which to calculate and assess possibilities and consequences of the proposal, for a national economy as a whole.
E01|Development of a two-sector model with an extended energy sector and application to Portugal (1960-2014)|In basic economic growth models, energy is neglected as a production factor, and output is generated from capital and labor in a single-sector process, with most of growth attributed to an exogenous residual. However, alternative approaches argue for a multi-sector system in which the major contribution to growth comes from increased efficiency in the conversion of energy to more productive forms. In this work we develop a two-sector model for the economy, featuring an extended energy sector, including all primary-to-final (energy industries) and final-to-useful (end-use devices) exergy conversion processes. Exergy is a thermodynamics concept, accounting for the potential of energy to perform work. Empirical application of the model for a single country (Portugal) requires decomposition and reclassification of national accounts and energy balances, to match empirical data with the model’s variables. Obtained estimates for the price of useful exergy (an intermediate product) facilitate the construction of gross output measures for more accurate growth accounting. Evidence suggests that declining useful exergy prices act as an engine of growth, as previously suggested in the literature. Additionally, useful exergy and capital inputs to non-energy related production act as complements while capital productivity in useful exergy generation declines slightly in the past decade.
E01|What Remains of Cross-Country Convergence?|We examine the record of cross-country growth over the past 50 years and ask if developing countries have made progress on closing income gap between their per capita incomes and those in the advanced economies. We conclude that, as a group, they have not and then survey the literature on absolute convergence with particular emphasis on that from the last decade or so. That literature supports our conclusion of a lack of progress in closing the income gap between countries. We close with a brief examination of the recent literature on cross-individual distribution of income which finds that, despite the lack of progress on cross-country convergence, global inequality has tended to fall since 2000.
E01|A simple and accurate method to calculate domestic and foreign value-added in gross exports|In this paper, we propose a hypothetical extraction that provides a theoretically-funded measure of FVA in gross exports and we provide full expressions for a decomposition of gross exports into four terms: DVA, domestic double counting (DDC), FVA and foreign double counting (FDC). As in Los et al. (2016), the fact that we calculate a hypothetical GDP without the exports from a given country is the basis for validating the interpretation of the FVA term. Our DVA term is the same as Los et al. (2016).
E01|Population Growth and Economic Development in Bangladesh: Revisited Malthus|Bangladesh is the 2nd fastest growing country in the world in 2016 with 7.1% GDP growth. This study undertakes an econometric analysis to examine the relationship between population growth and economic development. This result indicates population growth adversely related to per capita GDP growth, which means rapid population growth is a real problem for the development of Bangladesh. Malthus’s prediction is that population increases so rapidly and outstrip the food supply due to the operation of the law of diminishing return, which is proven wrong because of technological improvement and agricultural advancement program, human capital development, and export skilled labor, promotes labor-intensive industries, encourage foreign investors, institution settings and political stability in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has reduced its population growth by about 67% between 1979 and 2017 using different preventive checks suggested by Malthus and Mill. Bangladesh has been suffering from environmental degradation, loss of arable land, loos of agricultural land biodiversity loss and deforestation. Bangladesh Economy is growing with improving living standard at the cost of environmental degradation.
E01|Los efectos de la crisis económica en Galicia a través de 25 cuadros<BR>[The effects of the economic crisis in Galicia through 25 graphs]|Eleven years have passed since the beginning of the economic crisis that began in 2008 when two consecutive quarters of negative quarter-on-quarter variation rates were experienced. Throughout these eleven years, three key moments can be highlighted, which are the ones taken as a general reference: the second quarter of 2008, when the economic crisis begins; the fourth quarter of 2013, when the Galician economy begins its economic recovery; and the third quarter of 2017, when the pre-crisis level is achieved in terms of real GDP. The purpose of this paper is to offer, in a synthetic way, an image of the effects of the economic crisis from the data collected in the following graphs and tables
E01|Labor share decline and intellectual property products capital|We study the behavior of the US labor share over the past 65 years. We find that intellectual property products (IPP) capital entirely accounts for the observed decline of the US labor share, which otherwise is secularly constant for structures and equipment capital. The decline of the labor share reflects that the US is undergoing a transition to a more IPP capital-intensive economy. This result has essential implications for the US macroeconomic model.
E01|Productivity and Misallocation in General Equilibrium|We provide a general non-parametric formula for aggregating microeconomic shocks in general equilibrium economies with distortions such as taxes, markups, frictions to resource reallocation, and nominal rigidities. We show that the macroeconomic impact of a shock can be boiled down into two components: its “pure” technology effect; and its effect on allocative efficiency arising from the associated reallocation of resources, which can be measured via changes in factor income shares. We also derive a formula showing how these two components are determined by structural microeconomic parameters such as elasticities of substitution, returns to scale, factor mobility, and network linkages. Overall, our results generalize those of Solow (1957) and Hulten (1978) to economies with distortions. To demonstrate their empirical relevance, we pursue different applications, focusing on markup distortions. For example, we operationalize our non-parametric results and show that improvements in allocative efficiency account for about 50% of measured TFP growth over the period 1997-2015. We also implement our structural results and conclude that eliminating markups would raise TFP by about 40%, increasing the economywide cost of monopoly distortions by two orders of magnitude compared to the famous 0.1% estimates of Harberger (1954).
E01|Inflation Rates Are Very Different When Housing Rents Are Accurately Measured|One of the largest components of official price indexes is housing services, which account for 16 percent to 41 percent of major price indexes in the United States (e.g., Consumer Price Index). This paper demonstrates that the current measure of housing rents does not accurately track the actual inflation rate of housing rents. We construct an alternative quality-adjusted measure of housing rents that is based on a monthly statistic of landlord net rental income. Compared with our modified inflation rate, the official rate was overestimated by 1.4 percent to 3.4 percent annually during the Great Recession but underestimated by 0.3 percent to 0.7 percent annually during the current expansionary period after the recession. We further demonstrate significant impacts of our improved measurement of inflation rates on the cost of living adjustment to Social Security and real gross domestic product. These impacts persist for a long term because the modified price indexes are integrated of order one whereas the official indexes are trend stationary.
E01|A Quantitative Assessment of Strategies to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals: An Application to Guatemala|The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty and protect the environment. The Government of Guatemala is prioritizing the SDGs it will focus on and defining lines of action to make progress towards achieving them. In this paper, we apply the Integrated Economic-Environmental Modelling platform for Guatemala (IEEM-GUA) to evaluate the economic, environmental and wealth impacts of strategies for achieving the SDGs. We evaluate specific lines of action to achieve the second SDG to achieve food security and promote sustainable agriculture, and; the sixth SDG to achieve water and sanitation coverage for all. We find that significant new investment in these areas would be required to meeting these SDGs and that the overall pace of economic growth is critical. IEEM applied to the SDGs lends transparency and structure to the prioritization and agenda setting process. It sheds light on the need for complementary policies to reconcile lines of action that can inadvertently move progress toward specific SDGs in opposite directions. Finally, an advantage of an integrated framework such as IEEM is its ability to highlight trade-offs, potential win-wins and inter-linkages between SDGs, where one line of action can make progress towards multiple SDGs simultaneously.
E01|Capital Openness and Income Inequality: Smooth Sailing or Troubled Waters?|The 2008 Financial Crisis and subsequent financial turbulence has triggered economists and policymakers to revisit the extent to which capital account liberalization is optimal for all countries at all levels of development. While that literature has largely concluded that capital account liberalization may have detrimental effects on growth and accentuate financial instability in emerging markets, relatively little literature has examined the impacts of capital account liberalization on inequality—a subject that has also been under intense study over the past decade as well. In this paper, we attempt to build upon and bridge these two literatures to examine the extent to which capital account liberalization is associated with income inequality. We confirm earlier studies that show there is such a relationship between increased capital account openness and increases in inequality, and that capital account regulations are associated with less inequality—at least for emerging market economies. We expand on these findings to learn that there are differential impacts of capital account liberalization on inequality during booms and busts, being financial development a key factor. During normal times, we find that there are positive impacts on income inequality, whereas during busts, capital account liberalization appears to exacerbate inequality, calling for active policies.
E01|Robots Are Us: Some Economics of Human Replacement|Will smart machines do to humans what the internal combustion engine did to horses – make them obsolete? If so, can putting people out of work or, at least, good work leave them unable to buy what smart machines produce? Our model’s answer is yes. Over time and under the right conditions, supply reduces demand, leaving everyone worse off in the long-run. Carefully crafted redistribution policies can prevent such immiserating growth. But blunt policies, such as limiting intellectual property rights or restricting labor supply, can make matters worse.
E01|Nowcashing: Using Daily Fiscal Data for Real-Time Macroeconomic Analysis|Traditionally, fiscal data for policy analysis are derived from official reports that, depending on the country, are published either monthly, quarterly or annually, often with significant time lags. However, innovations in digitalization of government payments and accounting systems mean that real-time daily fiscal data exist in many countries. In this paper, we argue that these data contain valuable, but underutilized and underexploited information. Possible uses include (i) realtime fiscal surveillance which allows for much more timely responses to emerging signs of fiscal stress, and (ii) nowcasting economic activity, which is especially useful in countries where higher frequency GDP statistics are unavailable.
E01|The Plutocratic Bias in the Indian CPI|The Laspeyres-type consumer price index (CPI) is traditionally used to measure the changes in cost-of-living over time. Studies indicate this CPI suffers from a plutocratic bias, attaching greater weightage to expenditure by rich compared to poor; while democratic CPI uses equal weights. The paper calculates the plutocratic bias for the new Indian CPI (launched in 2012), rural and urban CPI, and CPI of three Indian states from 2012-2015. It develops democratic CPI indexes for commodity groups: necessities, luxuries, housing and others; and separate indexes for three consumption brackets. The analysis has important implications for monetary policy and indexation of transfer payments.
E01|Analysis of Revisions in Indian GDP Data|This paper studies constant price growth estimates of Indiaâ€™s annual GDP data in order to understand the revision policy adopted by the Central Statistics Office. The use of high-frequency indicators to prepare initial estimates overstates the growth of the economy, although at the aggregate level the difference between initial estimates and final revisions is low. At the sectoral level the extent of revision for almost all sectors is large and the magnitude and direction of the revision is unpredictable. The Central Statistical Office must address issues in data quality and revisions by (i) adopting a comprehensive revision policy, (ii) supplying information and data on high frequency indicators and (iii) adopting revision metrics to assess the quality of estimates.
E01|Recent changes in measurement of India's GDP: Overall issues and some focus on agriculture|This paper discusses (a) changes in measurement in industry and services (b) changes made in agriculture sector and (c) major issues on the measurement of GDP in new series. There are long term or legacy issues in agriculture, industry and services. The paper examines 10 major issues on measurement of GDP in the new series. These are: (1) MCA 21 data problems; (2) separation of Quasi corporations from household sector; (3) effective labour input method; (4) high growth rate of GDP vs. ground realities; (5) GDP at market prices vs. GVA at basic prices vs. GDP at factor prices; (6) GDP production and GDP expenditure method; (7) single vs. double deflation; (8) price deflators WPI vs. CPI; (9) nominal growth vs. real growth; (10) reference point for growth: advance estimates, provisional estimates, first revised estimates and second revised estimates. In our view, although there are some gaps in the measurement of GDP the new series and the methodology adopted are based on 'best advice' from experts available in the country. The issues discussed in the paper will be useful for next base revision of National Accounts Statistics.
E01|Research, knowledge transfer and innovation: the effect of Italian universities’ efficiency on the local economic development 2006-2012|In this paper, we test whether there is a link between the performance of universities and the local economic development of the territory where they operate. The performance of academic institutions is measured through an efficiency concept, estimated by means of an innovative Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), and considering indicators of teaching, research and ‘third mission’ as outputs. A system generalized method-of-moments (Sys- GMM) dynamic panel estimator, instrumented with time lags and differences is estimated over the period from 2006 to 2012 to solve the potential endogeneity of the explanatory variables. Our findings reveal that the presence of efficient universities fosters local economic development, and that knowledge spillovers occur between areas through the geographical proximity to the efficient universities.
E01|Korean Flow-of-Funds and Policy Evaluation: Comparison between Monetary Stabilization Bonds and Korean Treasury Bonds|"This study evaluates the authorities' monetary policies on a ""from-whom-to-whom"" basis for Korean FOF tables and using the input–output analysis method. In order to compare the monetary policy of the central bank with that of the government, net induced investments (NII) are calculated and decomposed. The notable findings of this study are as follows. After the Asian financial crisis in 1997, negative investments by the financial sectors, induced by the central bank, increased drastically. The sign of total NII finally turned negative during the period of credit card distress. However, the global financial crisis in 2008 was a turning point, in which the NII of the financial sectors, and especially banks, switched to being positive. In contrast, net investments induced by the Korean government have shown a steady increase. In addition, other than in 2008, the effects of changes in the government portfolio have been positive and constant. In addition, the NII of a combination of financial instruments are used to analyze monetary or fiscal policy simulations. This method will provide useful indicators for policy authorities when needing to select optimal amounts and types of financial instruments for open-market operations."
E01|Financial Firm Production Of Inside Monetary And Credit Card Services: An Aggregation Theoretic Approach1|A monetary-production model of financial firms is employed to investigate supply-side monetary aggregation, augmented to include credit card transaction services. Financial firms are conceived to produce monetary and credit card transaction services as outputs through financial intermediation. While credit cards provide transactions services, credit cards have never been included into measures of the money supply. The reason is accounting conventions, which do not permit adding liabilities to assets. However, index number theory measures service flows and is based on microeconomic aggregation theory, not accounting. Barnett, Chauvet, Leiva-Leon, and Su (2016) have derived and applied the relevant aggregation theory applicable to measuring the demand for the joint services of money and credit cards. But because of the existence of required reserves and differences in taxation on the demand and supply side, there is a regulatory wedge between the demand and supply of monetary services. We derive theory needed to measure the supply of the joint services of credit cards and money, to estimate the output supply function, and to compute value added. The resulting model can be used to investigate the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Earlier results on the monetary policy transmission mechanism based on the correlation between simple sum inside money and final targets are not likely to approximate or even be relevant to results that can be acquired by empirical implementation of this model or its extensions. Our financialfirm value-added measure and its supply function are fundamentally different from prior measures of inside money, shadow banking output, or money supply functions. The data needed for empirical implementation of our theory are available online from the Center for Financial Stability (CFS) in New York City. We show that the now discredited conventional accounting-based measures of privately produced inside money can be replaced by our measures, based on microeconomic aggregation theory, to provide the information originally contemplated in the literature on monetary theory for over a century.
E01|Rainfall inequality, trust and civil conflict in Nigeria|Do changes in the distribution of rainfall between ethnic groups increase the risk of armed conflicts within Nigeria? In this paper, we exploit variation in rainfall during the growing season, to study how resource inequality between ethnic groups affects the risks of violent conflicts in Nigeria. Our main results show that a one standard deviation change in between-group rainfall inequality during the growing season increases civil conflicts prevalence in Nigeria by about seven percentage points. This relationship is driven, in part, by declining social capital. Specifically, we demonstrated that an unequal distribution of rainfall between ethnic groups reinforces citizens grievances over government performance and creates mistrust between predominantly farming communities and those engaged in nomadic herding. The analysis highlights the need to develop conflict-sensitive mitigation and adaptation strategies to reduce the adverse effects of climatic shock.
E01|Rainfall Inequality, Political Power, and Ethnic Conflict in Africa|Does higher resource inequality between ethnic groups lead to ethnic conflict? In this paper, we empirically investigate this question by constructing a new measure of inequality using rainfall on ethnic homelands during the plant-growing season. Our dataset covers the period 1982-2001 and includes 214 ethnicities, located across 42 African countries. The analysis at the country level shows that one standard-deviation increase in rainfall-based inequality between ethnic groups increases the risk of ethnic conflict by 16 percentage points (or 0.43 standard deviations). This relationship depends on the power relations between the ethnic groups. More specifically, the analysis at the ethnicity level shows that ethnic groups are more likely to engage in civil conflicts whenever they receive less rain than the leading group. This effect does not hold for ethnic groups that share some political power with the leading group and is strongest for groups that have recently lost power. Our findings are consistent with an increase in resource inequality leading to more ethnic conflicts by exacerbating grievances in groups with no political power.
E01|The Canadian productivity stagnation, 20022014|Total factor productivity (TFP) growth in Canada between 2002 and 2014 has been only 0.16% per year. This figure is substantially smaller than that of the United States, or that of Canada in the past. We perform multiple counterfactual exercises to show that this small TFP growth cannot be accounted for by several compositional effects or mismeasurements of factors of production. We identify two key sectors (mostly Mining and to a lesser extent Manufacturing) that drive all of the TFP growth difference with the United States. Despite the lack of TFP growth, Canada has experienced sustained income growth due to a prolonged period of appreciation of the terms of trade (while US terms of trade have deteriorated), making real income in the two countries grow at similar rates.
E01|The effects of quasi-random monetary experiments|The trilemma of international finance entails that fluctuations in interest rates for countries with fixed exchange rates that allow unfettered cross-border capital flows are mostly due to international arbitrage. Consequently, we can locate a valid source of exogenous variation to identify monetary policy effects with instrumental variable methods. Paired with conventional instruments based on central bank staff forecasts, and using historical data since 1870, we estimate local average treatment effects (LATE) of monetary policy interventions for different subpopulations. Using a novel control function approach we determine the robustness of our findings to possible spillovers via alternative trade-based channels. Our results reveal and rectify attenuation bias in previous estimates, are consistent with theory, and provide a good approximation to the ATE. The effects that we report are quantitatively important and state-dependent.
E01|Global Inequality Dynamics: New Findings from WID.world|This paper presents new findings on global inequality dynamics from the World Wealth and Income Database (WID.world), with particular emphasis on the contrast between the trends observed in the United States, China, France, and the United Kingdom. We observe rising top income and wealth shares in nearly all countries in recent decades. But the magnitude of the increase varies substantially, thereby suggesting that different country-specific policies and institutions matter considerably. Long-run wealth inequality dynamics appear to be highly unstable. We stress the need for more democratic transparency on income and wealth dynamics and better access to administrative and financial data.
E01|Rents, Technical Change, and Risk Premia Accounting for Secular Trends in Interest Rates, Returns on Capital, Earning Yields, and Factor Shares|The secular decline in safe interest rates since the early 1980s has been the subject of considerable attention. In this short paper, we argue that it is important to consider the evolution of safe real rates in conjunction with three other first-order macroeconomic stylized facts: the relative constancy of the real return to productive capital, the decline in the labor share, and the decline and subsequent stabilization of the earnings yield. Through the lens of a simple accounting framework, these four facts offer suggestive insights into the economic forces that might be at work.
E01|The Macroeconomic Impact of Microeconomic Shocks: Beyond Hulten's Theorem|We provide a nonlinear characterization of the macroeconomic impact of microeconomic productivity shocks in terms of reduced‐form nonparametric elasticities for efficient economies. We also show how microeconomic parameters are mapped to these reduced‐form general equilibrium elasticities. In this sense, we extend the foundational theorem of Hulten (1978) beyond the first order to capture nonlinearities. Key features ignored by first‐order approximations that play a crucial role are: structural microeconomic elasticities of substitution, network linkages, structural microeconomic returns to scale, and the extent of factor reallocation. In a business‐cycle calibration with sectoral shocks, nonlinearities magnify negative shocks and attenuate positive shocks, resulting in an aggregate output distribution that is asymmetric (negative skewness), fat‐tailed (excess kurtosis), and has a negative mean, even when shocks are symmetric and thin‐tailed. Average output losses due to short‐run sectoral shocks are an order of magnitude larger than the welfare cost of business cycles calculated by Lucas (1987). Nonlinearities can also cause shocks to critical sectors to have disproportionate macroeconomic effects, almost tripling the estimated impact of the 1970s oil shocks on world aggregate output. Finally, in a long‐run growth context, nonlinearities, which underpin Baumol's cost disease via the increase over time in the sales shares of low‐growth bottleneck sectors, account for a 20 percentage point reduction in aggregate TFP growth over the period 1948–2014 in the United States.
E01|What is the Price of Tea in China? Towards the Relative Cost of Living in Chinese and U.S. Cities|We examine the price and variety of products at the barcode level in cities within China and the United States. In both countries, there is a greater variety of products in larger cities. But in China, unlike the United States, the prices of products tend to be lower in larger cities. We attribute the lower prices to a pro-competitive effect, whereby large cities attract more firms which leads to lower markups and prices. Combining the effect of greater variety and lower prices, it follows that the cost of living for grocery-store products in China is lower in larger cities. We further compare the cost-of-living indexes for particular product categories between China and the United States. In product categories with a significant presence of U.S. brands in the Chinese market, the availability of additional Chinese brands leads to greater variety than in the United States, and therefore lower Chinese price indexes for that reason. In product categories with much less presence of U.S. brands in the Chinese market, however, the observed prices differences between the countries (usually lower prices in China) are partially or fully offset by the variety differences (less variety in China), so that the cost of living in China is not as low as the price differences suggest, especially in smaller cities.
E01|Underestimating the Real Growth of GDP, Personal Income, and Productivity|Economists have long recognized that changes in the quality of existing goods and services, along with the introduction of new goods and services, can raise grave difficulties in measuring changes in the real output of the economy. But despite the attention to this subject in the professional literature, there remains insufficient understanding of just how imperfect the existing official estimates actually are. After studying the methods used by the US government statistical agencies as well as the extensive previous academic literature on this subject, I have concluded that, despite the various improvements to statistical methods that have been made through the years, the official data understate the changes of real output and productivity. The official measures provide at best a lower bound on the true real growth rate with no indication of the size of the underestimation. In this essay, I briefly review why national income should not be considered a measure of well-being; describe what government statisticians actually do in their attempt to measure improvements in the quality of goods and services; consider the problem of new products and the various attempts by economists to take new products into account in measuring overall price and output changes; and discuss how the mismeasurement of real output and of prices might be taken into account in considering various questions of economic policy.
E01|Accounting for Growth in the Age of the Internet The Importance of Output-Saving Technical Change|We extend the conventional Solow growth accounting model to allow innovation to affect consumer welfare directly. Our model is based on Lancaster’s New Approach to Consumer Theory, in which there is a separate “consumption technology” that transforms the produced goods, measured at production cost, into utility. This technology can shift over time, allowing consumers to make more efficient use of each dollar of income. This is “output-saving” technical change, in contrast to the Solow TFP “resource-saving” technical change. One implication of our model is that living standards can rise at a greater rate than real GDP growth.
E01|Capital Accumulation, Private Property and Rising Inequality in China, 1978-2015|This paper combines national accounts, survey, wealth and fiscal data (including recently released tax data on high-income taxpayers) in order to provide consistent series on the accumulation and distribution of income and wealth in China over the 1978-2015 period. We find that the aggregate national wealth-income ratio has increased from 350% in 1978 to 700% in 2015. This can be accounted for by a combination of high saving and investment rates and a gradual rise in relative asset prices, reflecting changes in the legal system of property. The share of public property in national wealth has declined from about 70% in 1978 to 30% in 2015, which is still a lot higher than in rich countries (close to 0% or negative). Next, we provide sharp upward revision of official inequality estimates. The top 10% income share rose from 27% to 41% of national income between 1978 and 2015, while the bottom 50% share dropped from 27% to 15%. China's inequality levels used to be close to Nordic countries and are now approaching U.S. levels.
E01|Prices of high-tech products, mismeasurement, and the pace of innovation|Abstract Introduction Two recent papers have made compelling cases that mismeasurement of prices of high-tech products cannot explain the slow pace of labor productivity growth that has prevailed since the mid-2000s. Does that result indicate that mismeasurement of high-tech products has limited implications for patterns of economic growth? The answer in this paper is “no.”. Results We demonstrate that the understatement of price declines for high-tech products in official measures has a dramatic effect on the pattern of multifactor productivity (MFP) growth across sectors. In particular, we show that correcting this mismeasurement implies faster MFP growth in high-tech sectors and slower MFP advance outside the high-tech sector. If MFP growth is taken as a rough proxy for the pace of innovation, our results suggest that innovation in the tech sector has been more rapid than the rate that would be inferred from official statistics (and less rapid outside high-tech). Conclusion These results deepen the productivity puzzle. If the pace of innovation in high-tech sectors has been more rapid than indicated by official statistics, then it is perhaps even more puzzling that overall labor productivity growth has been so sluggish in recent years.
E01|Credit Growth and the Financial Crisis: A New Narrative|A broadly accepted explanation for the 2007-09 financial crisis emphasizes the growth in lending to subprime households during the preceding boom. According to this view, the resulting rise in insolvencies and foreclosures caused the financial crisis, leading to a decline in housing values and a broad contraction in credit. This paper studies the evolution of household borrowing and delinquency between 1999 and 2013, using a large administrative panel of credit file data. Our findings suggest an alternative narrative that challenges the large role of subprime credit. We show that credit growth between 2001 and 2007 is concentrated in the middle and high quartiles of the credit score distribution. Borrowing by individuals with low credit score is virtually constant for all debt categories during the boom. We also find that the rise in defaults during the financial crisis is concentrated in the middle and upper quartiles of the credit score distribution, and the fraction of defaults to the lowest quartile of of the credit score distribution sizably drops during the crisis. We discuss the broader implications of these findings for the role of housing collateral in the propagation of the crisis.
E01|Productivity and Misallocation in General Equilibrium|We provide a general non-parametric formula for aggregating microeconomic shocks in general equilibrium economies with distortions such as taxes, markups, frictions to resource reallocation, and nominal rigidities. We show that the macroeconomic impact of a shock can be boiled down into two components: its ``pure'' technology effect; and its effect on allocative efficiency arising from the associated reallocation of resources, which can be measured via changes in factor income shares. We also derive a formula showing how these two components are determined by structural microeconomic parameters such as elasticities of substitution, returns to scale, factor mobility, and network linkages. Overall, our results generalize those of Solow (1957) and Hulten (1978) to economies with distortions. To demonstrate their empirical relevance, we pursue different applications, focusing on markup distortions. For example, we operationalize our non-parametric results and show that improvements in allocative efficiency account for about 50% of measured TFP growth over the period 1997-2015. We also implement our structural results and conclude that eliminating markups would raise TFP by about 40%, increasing the economywide cost of monopoly distortions by two orders of magnitude compared to the famous 0.1% estimates of Harberger (1954).
E01|The profit rate and asset-price inflation in the Spanish economy|The measure of capital profitability in the Spanish economy is relevant because of both a process of capital accumulation since mid-nineties largely driven by asset-price inflation, as well as the deep economic crisis since late 2008. Therefore, in this article a comparative analysis is carried out using different databases and measures of the rate of profit, incorporating the financial sphere and addressing other different countries of the Eurozone. It shows the scope of the underlying valorization crisis in relation to previous decades and in terms of its fall experienced during the years not only of the housing boom, but also throughout the subsequent recession. In addition, this drop in profitability stands out in relation to other economies of the European periphery. Hence, this analysis puts the rate of profit at the center of the debate on the Great Recession in Spain, despite its absence in much of the economic literature, including heterodox approaches.
E01|Leveraged Growth: Endogenous Money and Speculative Credit in a Stock-flow Consistent Measure of Output|Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) as well as Stock-Flow Consistent (SFC) modelling have both had significant implications for economic theory in recent years. Neither, however, had any meaningful impact on the key measurement of output, Gross Domestic Product (GDP). While balance sheets have been nominally included in national accounting systems since 1968, main aggregates such as GDP are still blind to the creation and flow of credit (and hence debt). The financial sector is only presented in GDP as a provider of services, not as a producer of credit and thus money. Following Schumpeter's (and Bezemer's) functional differentiation of credit, this paper separates finance into two parts - credit to the productive sectors and credit for speculation (i.e. for purchasing financial assets and real-estate). The former grows at the same rate as GDP, while the latter grows faster, increasing aggregate leverage. A systemic leverage index is then constructed from flow-of-funds data for the US (1960-2015), and used to render real GDP stock-flow consistent. Debt-adjusted GDP is theoretically and methodologically more consistent than GDP, and also correlates better with aggregate employment. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of debt-adjusted output for the trend and volatility of growth, as well as some thoughts on the gap between measurement and theory in economics.
E01|Do-it-yourself digital: the production boundary and the productivity puzzle|Part of the debate about the ‘productivity puzzle’ concerns the potential mismeasurement of digital activities. Specific measurement adjustments explored in previous research appear not to make a quantitatively large difference to real GDP or productivity growth estimates. However, although these potential adjustments may be small individually, taken together they could be wide in scope and quantitatively significant. This paper sets out a taxonomy of the range of potential measurement artefacts arising from digital innovations. It also specifically considers digitally-enabled substitutions in activity across the production boundary. I argue that these, along with other substitutions occurring within the production boundary, go beyond the effects of digital considered in earlier research; and may be making a meaningful contribution to the productivity puzzle as measured on existing statistical definitions.
E01|The Mystery of TFP|The objective of this article is to critically examine explanations of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth. TFP growth is analysed at the sectoral and aggregate level, using data for 10 industry groups covering the market sectors of 18 countries over the period 1970-2007 drawn from the EU KLEMS dataset. In all countries resources have been shifting away from industries with high TFP growth towards industries with low TFP growth. Nevertheless structural change has favoured TFP growth in most countries. Errors in measuring capital or in measuring the elasticity of output with respect to capital are unlikely to substantially reduce the role of TFP in explaining growth. The article concludes that the mystery of TFP is likely to remain as long as measurement error persists.
E01|Expert Group on Disparities in a National Accounts Framework: Results from the 2015 Exercise|In 2011, an Expert Group was launched to carry out a feasibility study on the compilation of distributional measures of income, consumption and wealth across household groups consistent with national accounts data. This group developed a methodology on the basis of which first experimental results on income, consumption and savings according to income quintiles were compiled and published in 2013. In 2015, the expert group engaged in a second exercise focusing on a more recent year and taking into account a number of adjustments to the methodology used in the previous exercise. This paper describes the sources, methods and results of this second exercise.The results of the exercise show that in general all countries are able to comply with the methodology. Furthermore, countries have micro data available for most of the national accounts items and in case of lacking data, imputations lead to comparable results. However, the results also show that in some cases gaps between the micro aggregates and the national accounts totals are quite substantial, possibly affecting the overall distributional results. Furthermore, more information is needed on how countries link data across various data sources. The experimental results show that Mexico records the highest income and consumption disparities, followed by the United States and Portugal, and that Slovenia records the lowest. The paper also shows that breakdowns into other household groups, such as age group and labour market status reveal very interesting information.
E01|A forecasting performance comparison of dynamic factor models based on static and dynamic methods|We present a comparison of the forecasting performances of three Dynamic Factor Models on a large monthly data panel of macroeconomic and financial time series for the UE economy. The first model relies on static principal-component and was introduced by Stock and Watson in [1], [2]. The second is based on generalized principal components and it was introduced by Forni, Hallin, Lippi and Reichlin in [3], [4]. The last model has been recently proposed by Forni, Hallin, Lippi and Zaffaroni in [5], [6]. The data panel is split into two parts: the calibration sample, from February 1986 to December 2000, is used to select the most performing specification for each class of models in a in-sample environment, and the proper sample, from January 2001 to November 2015, is used to compare the performances of the selected models in an out-of-sample environment. The metholodogical approach is analogous to [7], but also the size of the rolling window is empirically estimated in the calibration process to achieve more robustness. We find that, on the proper sample, the last model is the most performing for the Inflation. However, mixed evidencies appear over the proper sample for the Industrial Production.
E01|Balance de la economía gallega en el año 2016<BR>[Balance of the Galician economy in the year 2016]|The Galician economy accelerated its dynamism throughout 2016, achieving an average growth of 3.1% with respect to the previous year, the highest since 2007. In contrast with what happened the previous year, Galicia and Spain approach to both internal and external demand. In the last year the Galician economy continued to reduce the differential with the evolution of GDP in the whole of the State, which is only of one tenth.
E01|Der ökonomische Fußabdruck der Privaten Krankenversicherung in Deutschland. Untersuchung der PKV als Finanzier von Gesundheitsleistungen<BR>[The economic footprint of private health insurance in Germany. Examining its role as healthcare financier]|There is now much evidence for the vital importance of the health economy, and it is receiving more attention from social and political spheres. This development is evidenced, not least, by the increased perception of the health economy as a key economic factor in Germany. Private health insurance (PKV) plays an important role in the health economy in three respects: as an economic actor, as a financer of healthcare services, and as a provider of capital. In a first step, an earlier study determined the economic footprint of the private health insurance sector as an economic actor. In doing so, the economic significance of private health insurance was measured on the basis of official national accounts categories for the first time. The starting point for this earlier study was a change of perspective so as to view the health economy – including private health insurance – not just as a cost factor, but also from the angle of economic growth and employment. From this basis, the second step presented here measures the economic importance of private health insurance in its role as a financer of healthcare services. Unlike in the first step, the private health insurance sector’s expenditure on benefits for its members forms the subject of the study, instead of the economic activity of the sector. This expenditure finances medication and services rendered to private patients by licensed doctors and hospitals, for example. The aim of this study is to calculate the resultant gross value added and employment. The comprehensive economic footprint approach is unique in that it incorporates the economic significance of intermediate inputs (indirect effects) and the spending of employee compensation (induced effects). This study augments this approach by examining the economic effects of the additional revenue raised from private patients. Additional revenue is the sum that the entire health system would lose if private patients were insured under the statutory scheme instead of privately. This issue is relevant seeing as there is currently some debate about introducing a universal system.
E01|Der ökonomische Fußabdruck der Gesundheitswirtschaft in Deutschland nach ESVG 2010<BR>[The Economic Footprint of the German Health Economy according to ESA 2010]|The National Health Account quantifies the economic contribution of the German health economy for national GVA, employment and international trade. Underlying methodology and concepts were developed in the course of several projects commissioned by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy. Due to a revision of statistical standards in the context of national accounts in 2014, results from earlier calculations are no longer comparable to recently calculated indicators. This paper hence pursues to indicate changes due to the new statistical standard of national accounts, ESA 2010, and present results from recent calculations. In addition, results from input-output analysis enable a more thorough analysis of the health economy and its interdependencies with the overall economy.
E01|An approach to the structural features of the socio-economic activity of a country based on a Social Accounting Matrix.Evidences and multiplier effects on distribution of income|A Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) is presented as a tool to study the socio-economic activity of a country. This activity involves the monetary or nominal flows that are measured by the National Accounts, as well as production (organized in factors, industries and goods and services) and institutions (organized in households, general government, non-financial and financial corporations, non-profit institutions serving households, and rest of the world). In order to contribute to the definition of a methodology that can contribute to improving the knowledge of the different aspects of this activity, the potentialities of a SAM for its reading and interpreting are explored, as well as for carrying out experiments regarding its functioning. Through a SAM-based approach, how to construct more or less complex networks of linkages of the above-mentioned flows is shown, from which structural features can be evidenced and the associated multiplier effects studied. Following an application to Portugal, it is shown that a numerical version of a SAM, enables an empirical description of the origin, use, and distribution of income, whereas, an algebraic version of a SAM allows one to carry out, for example, a deeper study of the multiplier effects associated with the institutional distribution of income. The crucial role of the factors of production accounts is identified in this study, namely when they establish the link between the generation and the distribution and use of income. In this process, the important role the complementary details that the Input-Output Matrix (IOM) can add is also identified. Thus, being the generation of income the result of the output of goods and services and the associated costs, on the one hand, an industry-by-industry IOM can add details regarding domestic and imported intermediate consumption by and between industries and, on the other hand, a product-by-product IOM can add details regarding the domestic and imported intermediate consumption of goods and services.
E01|China's household balance sheet: Accounting issues, wealth accumulation, and risk diagnosis|In this paper, we compile China's household balance sheet and apply this perspective to the analysis of household financial conditions. Specifically, we first address some technical issues on the balance sheet accounts, and detail the estimations of two important asset items, “dwellings” and “automobiles.” Next, through reading the sheets, we provide an international comparative analysis, and show: (1) China's households are still on their early stage of wealth accumulation, and this trend is associated with a changing structure in favour of financial assets. (2) Although being subject to relatively low insolvency and liquidity risks, the sector has experienced, generally contrary to major developed or emerging countries, a climbing leverage cycle since the global financial crisis. These findings imply that China's policymakers should, on the one hand, make further efforts to help households accumulate wealth with an improved structure in terms of liquidity and risk diversification, and on the other hand, need to pay high attention to the increasing household financial stress and the potential risk contagion.
E01|Methodology of the Multiregional Health Account for Germany - An Iterative Algorithm-Based Multiregionalization Approach of Supply and Use Tables with Emphasis on Health|The Multiregional Health Account is a methodological enhancement of the National Health Account for Germany. The latter represents an established and annually updated satellite account quantifying the economic contribution of the health economy in terms of gross value added, employment and interna-tional trade. Its methodological enhancement to a multiregional framework for the 16 federal states of Germany is represented by multiregional supply and use tables. This setting allows to compile a multire-gional health input-output table and subsequently to carry out input-output analysis. Hence, we are able to quantify the direct and indirect economic impacts of the health economy to analyze interdependencies between industries and federal states. For the purpose of compiling the Multiregional Health Account, we elaborate a new approach based on the SUT-RAS algorithm (Temurshoev & Timmer, 2011), which we adapt for the multiregional framework. We call it the MR-SUT-RAS algorithm. The methodology and its application in the context of the health economy is the subject of this contribution.
E01|Basic Results of the Multiregional Health Account for Germany - Validation of Indirect Effects of the Health Economy|The Multiregional Health Account is a methodological enhancement of the National Health Account and adds a subnational regional dimension to the latter. Both satellite accounts aim to quantify the contribution of the German health economy in terms of gross value added, employment and trade. Moreover, since they are based on supply and use tables and thus input-output tables of the national accounting system, both models allow input-output analysis for a more thorough evaluation of the national and multiregional health economy. The challenge addressed in this paper consists in questioning the reliability of the results from multiregional input-output analysis based on the Multiregional Health Account. This is necessary due to the circumstance that no official multiregional input-output tables are available for German federal states and we elaborated a new methodology to derive multiregional tables on our own. Hence, we conduct input-output analysis to evaluate the performance of the multiregional input-output table in modelling intra- and interregional interdependencies. We find that the model succeeds in reproducing certain regional characteristics.
E01|Basic Results of the Multiregional Health Account for Germany - Validation of Direct Effects of the Health Economy|The Multiregional Health Account is a satellite account focusing on the economic impact of the health economy in German federal states. It was developed as an enhancement of the existing National Health Account for Germany. In contrast to the subject of matter over here, the calculations of the National Health Account are based on available national supply and use tables. Since there are no according tables available for the German federal states, we developed a methodology, which allows to calculate supply and use tables at the subnational multiregional level. The present paper focusses on the results of the MRHA for the reason of a thorough validation procedure of the developed approach. We evaluate regional direct effects of the health economy by comparing derived characteristics with company data and evaluate the performance of the algorithm in a time series. We find that the elaborated approach shows reasonable results in both dimensions evaluated.
E01|Export Geographical Diversification and Economic Growth Among ASEAN Countries|The study investigated the relationship of export geographical diversification and economic growth among ASEAN countries for the period 1980-2014. With a sample of 5 countries- Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand- the study computed for the geographical diversification of countries using the Herfindahl index. Using time series analysis, with Vector Autoregressive (VAR) analysis and Granger causality tests, the relationship of the two variables among ASEAN countries were tested. The results showed a generally decreasing trend of HHI values of all 5 countries. Results of the analysis of the relationship showed a bidirectional relationship for Malaysia and a unidirectional relationship from export geographical diversification to economic growth in the case of Philippines. For countries Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand, results showed no causality which indicates that the variables are independent for these countries. Based on the results, the study recommendeds the followng: (1) formulation and implementation of appropriate strategies to improve export structure and improve economies for Malaysia and Philppines; and (2) diversification of export structure in terms of market destinations for Philippines to improve its economy.
E01|Labor productivity, capital accumulation, and aggregate efficiency across countries: Some stylized facts|This paper studies the cross-section dynamics of the proximate determinants of labor productivity: physical capital, human capital, and aggregate efficiency. Using a panel data set for 74 countries covering the 1950-2010 period, it first documents that labor productivity of the median country has been mostly stagnant, while cross-country differences have drastically increased. An evaluation of proximate sources points to a similar pattern of stagnation and increasing dispersion in both physical capital and aggregate efficiency. Human capital is the only variable where median progress and inequality reduction can be observed. Next, the paper shows how standard regression methods consistently overestimate the fraction of the variation in labor productivity that is explained by physical capital. The source of this upward bias appears is the unaccounted covariance between capital accumulation and aggregate efficiency. Taking this covariance into account, most of the variation in labor productivity turns out to be explained by differences in aggregate efficiency. Finally, the paper concludes arguing that allocative inefficiencies at the sectoral level, such as those predicted by dual-economy type models, are important for understanding the large and increasing differences in aggregate efficiency across countries.
E01|Decomposition of Value-Added in Gross Exports:Unresolved Issues and Possible Solutions|To better understand trade in the context of global value chains, it is important to have a full and explicit decomposition of value-added in gross exports. While the decomposition proposed by Koopman, Wang and Wei (2014) is a first step in this direction, there are still three outstanding issues that need to be further addressed: (1) the nature of double counting in gross exports; (2) the calculation of the foreign value-added net of any double counting; and (3) the decomposition of gross exports at the industry level (the industry where exports take place). In this paper, we propose a new accounting framework that addresses these different issues and clarifies the definition of exports in inter-country input-output (ICIO) tables. It contributes to the literature: (i) by refining the definition of double-counted value-added in gross exports; (ii) by providing new expressions for the foreign value-added and double-counted terms; and (iii) by indicating how the new framework can be used to decompose exports at the industry level.
E01|Gross Domestic Product – National Income of Romania 1862 – 2010. Secular statistical series and methodological foundations|Starting from the importance and need to investigate one of the most relevant issues regarding the structure and dynamics of the economic and social development of all countries in the world, the book focuses on Romania, from the perspective of certain synthetic indicators, aggregated at macroeconomic level, i.e. the Gross Domestic Product and the National Income, on long data series over the past 150 years, also taking into account the comparative international context, in terms of purchasing power parity. The Part One contains a synthesis, developed and completed, of GDP data for each year of the period 1862 – 2010 and also indicators resulting from the GDP, as Net Domestic Product, Net National Product and National Income. The historical research has adopted and applied, with maximum attention, criteria that substantiated the calculations, through rigorous techniques and methods of data aggregation, in order to remove certain errors that would lead to distorted results, focusing on the accuracy of evaluations, so that they would express, in the most genuine manner, the real dimension of the statistical indicators, allowing for a correct interpretation of the economic phenomena. The operations for compiling the indicators are accompanied by comments regarding the criteria and calculation methods, as well as by methodological explanations, so that the data would be able to be rebuilt in a better format, by the interested authors, should they have a more reliable and relevant statistical information about Romania. The Part Two of the book focuses on the international literature, dedicated to criticisms theoretical and methodological opinions regarding the GDP, as well as a comparative analysis of the GDP evolution in Romania, in various hypotheses, compared to other countries.
E01|An Evaluation of Effective Prosperity Measure: A Case of Wellbeing Index|Prosperity has been considered the most desirable real outcome of all human efforts however usually measured through gross domestic output of the economy that may not capable to comprehend it effectively. This paper evaluates wellbeing measured through some economic, social and institutional aspects considering the dynamic behavior of variables based on Legatum Prosperity Index (LPI), Maslow’s theory of human needs and Minsky financial instability hypothesis. Considering the data within the context of economic quality, business, education, health, financial security and environment, a comparative analysis has been made to judge the level of prosperity engrossed through LPI. Annual data related to Pakistan from 1960 to 20016 has been examined for about hundred variables after reducing them into 21 exogenous and four endogenous variables through index-transformation. Two Stage Least Squares (TSLS) regression technique to solve the simultaneous equations models prove relevant. The major findings reveal that LPI has successfully measure the wellbeing scenario in case of Pakistan, further it ascertains that social and institutional dimensions are vital complement for wellbeing in addition to economic dimension which cannot uniquely be relied upon for sustainable prosperity.
E01|Environmentální Kuznetsova křivka v podmínkách České republiky v období 1975-2012<BR>[Environmental Kuznets Curve: Application for the Czech Republic for the Time Period 1975-2012]|Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) has been widely recognized as a standard model of hypothetical relationship between economic development and environment quality. The article presents results of an empirical research on EKC for the air pollution selected indicators in the Czech Republic in 1975-2012.To deal with the issue of different macroeconomic indicators calculated in socialist economy and after its transition to a market economy, EKC modeling was done with consolidated data on national economic performance. The results suggest, contrary to a widespread opinion, that changes in trends (turning points) for some pollutants on EKC can be found already in the 1980s. It also can be concluded, based on results received for the period after the year 2000 that validity of EKC might be in question for some pollutants. Following research on EKC for other pollutants and countries, as well as an application of other methodological approaches, could contribute both to better understanding of EKC model, including economic and social (pre)conditions of its validity, and its theoretical context.

E01|How Do Hours Worked Vary with Income? Cross-Country Evidence and Implications|This paper builds a new internationally comparable database of hours worked to measure how hours vary with income across and within countries. We document that average hours worked per adult are substantially higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries. The pattern of decreasing hours with aggregate income holds for both men and women, for adults of all ages and education levels, and along both the extensive and intensive margin. Within countries, hours worked per worker are also decreasing in the individual wage for most countries, though in the richest countries, hours worked are flat or increasing in the wage. One implication of our findings is that aggregate productivity and welfare differences across countries are larger than currently thought.
E01|The Effect of Restructuring on Labor Reallocation and Productivity Growth: An Estimation for Korea|Productivity is considered one of the most important factors for economic growth. Total productivity grows through technological progress or reallocation of resources. This paper analyses their contribution to economic growth for total economy and by sectors. The main finding is that economy-wide increases but this is mainly due to internal technological improvements. On the one hand, inter-sector reallocation of labor negatively contributes to economic growth as employment moves to service sectors with low productivity. Further, when looking at the sectoral-level productivity growth, both internal and external restructuring make positive contributions to aggregate economic growth. However, internal technological progress and reallocation of employment appear to similarly contribute to the sectoral-level economic growth in the manufacturing sector, whereas internal restructuring makes a larger contribution to economic growth in the service sector. This suggests that there is more room for reallocation of resources to contribute to the productivity growth in service sectors. Therefore, the productivity growth of the service sector would foster economy-wide productivity and it can be achieved by the mitigation of misallocation of resources in service sectors.
