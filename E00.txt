E00|Nonlinear models in macroeconometrics|This article contains a short review of nonlinear models that are applied to modelling macroeconomic time series. Brief descriptions of relevant models, both univariate, dynamic single-equation, and vector autoregressive ones are presented. Their application is illuminated by a number of selected examples.
E00|Mr Phillips and the medium-run: temporal instability vs. frequency stability|The paper goes back to the original insight by Phillips and investigates the negative relationship between money wage inflation and the unemployment rate occurring at frequency bands that stretch beyond those of the business cycle. We use UK annual data for the period 1861-2015, and post- WWII quarterly data from 1960 to 2016. The two critical findings are that the wage Phillips Curve is predominantly a medium-run phenomenon, comprised in the 8-to16-year frequency band, and that the curve disappears beyond this range. Similar conclusions are reached using the post-WWII quarterly sample: at the aggregate level and at high frequencies the PC relationship is unstable over time, whereas in the frequency range between 32 to 64 quarters (our medium run timescale), this time dependency disappears.
E00|Potential Output in Canada: 2019 Reassessment|Potential output is expected to grow on average at 1.8 per cent over 2019–21 and at 1.9 per cent in 2022. While the contribution of trend labour input to potential output growth is expected to decrease between 2019 and 2022, the contribution of trend labour productivity is projected to increase. Relative to the April 2018 reassessment, the profile for potential output growth rates is similar, albeit revised slightly down in 2020 and 2021. Underlying this new profile are negative revisions to the business investment outlook relative to April 2018 that are mostly offset by stronger projections for population growth. Based on various alternative scenarios, the range for potential output growth estimates widens from 1.5 to 2.1 per cent in 2019 to 1.3 to 2.5 per cent in 2022.
E00|Production potentielle au Canada : réévaluation de 2019|La production potentielle devrait afficher une croissance moyenne de 1,8 % de 2019 à 2021 et de 1,9 % en 2022. Même si l’apport du facteur travail tendanciel à la croissance de la production potentielle devrait diminuer entre 2019 et 2022, celui de la productivité tendancielle du travail devrait augmenter. Le profil des taux de croissance de la production potentielle est similaire à celui établi lors de la réévaluation d’avril 2018, malgré une légère révision à la baisse pour 2020 et 2021. Ce nouveau profil tient compte d’un assombrissement des perspectives d’investissement des entreprises, en grande partie contrebalancé par des projections à la hausse pour ce qui est de la croissance démographique. Selon les divers scénarios étudiés, la fourchette des estimations de croissance de la production potentielle s’élargit, allant de 1,5 à 2,1 % en 2019 et de 1,3 à 2,5 % en 2022.
E00|On money, debt, trust and central banking|This essay examines in detail the properties of a well functioning monetary system - defined as money plus the mechanisms to execute payments - in both the short and long run, drawing on both theory and the lessons from history. It stresses the importance of trust and of the institutions needed to secure it. Ensuring price and financial stability is critical to nurturing and maintaining that trust. In the process, the essay addresses several related questions, such as the relationship between money and debt, the viability of cryptocurrencies as money, money neutrality, and the nexus between monetary and financial stability. While the present monetary system, with central banks and a prudential apparatus at its core, can and must be improved, it still provides the best basis to build on.
E00|Why Have Interest Rates Fallen far Below the Return on Capital|"Risk-free rates have been falling since the 1980s. The return on capital, defined here as the profits over the stock of capital, has not. We analyze these trends in a calibrated OLG model designed to encompass many of the ""usual suspects"" cited in the debate on secular stagnation. Declining labor force and productivity growth imply a limited decline in real interest rates and deleveraging cannot account for the joint decline in the risk free rate and increase in the risk premium. If we allow for a change in the (perceived) risk to productivity growth to fit the data, we find that the decline in the risk-free rate requires an increase in the borrowing capacity of the indebted agents in the model, consistent with the increase in the sum of public and private debt since the crisis but at odds with a deleveraging-based explanation put forth in Eggertsson and Krugman (2012)."
E00|The Central Bank Governor and Interest Rate Setting by Committee|This paper examines the role of central bank governors in monetary policy decisions taken by a committee. To carry out this analysis, we constructed a novel dataset of committee voting behaviour for six OECD countries for up to three decades. Using a range of Taylor-rule specifications, we show that a change in governor significantly affects the interest rate setting of the whole committee. We also observe systematic differences in the responsiveness to recent changes in the state of the economy based on the political party appointing the governor, with higher responsiveness under governors that are appointed by a left-wing political authority. In contrast, right wing appointed governors are more likely to consider expected economic developments in the future when deciding on the appropriate interest rate.
E00|A Risk-centric Model of Demand Recessions and Speculation|We theoretically analyze the interactions between asset prices, financial speculation, and macroeconomic outcomes when output is determined by aggregate demand. If the interest rate is constrained, a decline in risky asset valuations generates a demand recession. This reduces earnings and generates a negative feedback loop between asset prices and aggregate demand. In the recession phase, beliefs matter not only because they affect asset valuations but also because they determine the strength of the amplification mechanism. In the ex-ante boom phase, belief disagreements (or heterogeneous asset valuations) matter because they induce investors to speculate. This speculation exacerbates the crash by reducing high-valuation investors' wealth when the economy transitions to recession. Macroprudential policy that restricts speculation in the boom can Pareto improve welfare by increasing asset prices and aggregate demand in the recession.
E00|Prudential Monetary Policy|Should monetary policy have a prudential dimension? That is, should policymakers raise interest rates to rein in financial excesses during a boom? We theoretically investigate this issue using an aggregate demand model with asset price booms and financial speculation. In our model, monetary policy affects financial stability through its impact on asset prices. Our main result shows that, when macroprudential policy is imperfect, small doses of prudential monetary policy (PMP) can provide financial stability benefits that are equivalent to tightening leverage limits. PMP reduces asset prices during the boom, which softens the asset price crash when the economy transitions into a recession. This mitigates the recession because higher asset prices support leveraged, high-valuation investors' balance sheets. An alternative intuition is that PMP raises the interest rate to create room for monetary policy to react to negative asset price shocks. The policy is most effective when there is extensive speculation and leverage limits are neither too tight nor too slack.
E00|Financial crises: past and future|Abstract This article takes a selective global tour of some of the prominent economic and financial risks in advanced, emerging, and low-income developing economies. The primary emphasis is on near-term risks. The discussion covers areas where vulnerabilities have either already become manifest, or those where risks are mounting but have not yet sounded a glaring alarm. For the advanced economies, the topics cover aspects of the recent surge in collateralized lending obligations in the United States and Europe that are reminiscent of the pre-crisis boom in mortgage-backed securities as well as Italy’s unresolved debt overhang. On emerging markets (EMs) and developing economies, the themes cover the curious case of the missing defaults (2011–2018); global factors and EM turbulence; and China’s international lending to low-income countries and its consequences. A brief discussion of some persistent medium-to-long-term concerns about the rising levels of US public debt and the tensions that arise from internal economic objectives and the external pressures associated with the US dollar’s role as the world’s principal reserve currency completes the discussion.
E00|What do we know about changing economic activity of firms?|Identifiation of primary economic activity of firms is a prerequisite for compiling several macro aggregates. In this paper we take a statistical approach to understand the extent of changes in primary economic activity of firms over time and across different industries. We use the history of economic activity of over 46000 firms spread over 25 years from CMIE Prowess to identify the number of times firms change the nature of their business. Using the count of changes, we estimate Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models to gain predictability over changing economic activity across industry groups. We show that a Poisson model accurately characterizes the distribution of count of changes across industries and that firms with a long history are more likely to have changed their primary economic activity over the years. Findings show that classification can be a crucial problem in a large dataset like the MCA21 and can even lead to distortions in value addition estimates at the industry level.
E00|Mis-Specification in Phillips Curve Regressions: Quantifying Frequency Dependence in This Relationship While Allowing for Feedback|We use recently developed econometric tools to demonstrate that the Phillips curve unemployment rate–inflation rate relationship varies in an economically meaningful way across three phases of the business cycle. The first (“bust phase”) relationship is the one highlighted by Stock and Watson (2010): A sharp reduction in inflation occurs as the unemployment rate is rising rapidly. The second (“recovery phase”) relationship occurs as the unemployment rate subsequently begins to fall; during this phase, inflation is unrelated to any conventional unemployment gap. The final (“overheating phase”) relationship begins once the unemployment rate drops below its natural rate. We validate our findings in a forecasting exercise and find statistically significant episodic forecast improvement. Our analysis allows us to provide a unified explanation of many prominent findings in the literature.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
E00|Some International Evidence for Keynesian Economics Without the Phillips Curve|Farmer and Nicolò (2018) show that the Farmer Monetary (FM)-Model outperforms the threeequation New-Keynesian (NK)-model in post war U.S. data. In this paper, we compare the marginal data density of the FM-model with marginal data densities for determinate and indeterminate versions of the NK-model for three separate samples using U.S., U.K. and Canadian data. We estimate versions of both models that restrict the parameters of the private sector equations to be the same for all three countries. Our preferred specification is the constrained version of the FMmodel which has a marginal data density that is more than 30 log points higher than the NK alternative. Our findings also demonstrate that cross-country macroeconomic differences are well explained by the different shocks that hit each economy and by differences in the ways in which national central banks reacted to those shocks.
E00|A Macroprudential Theory of Foreign Reserve Accumulation|This paper proposes a theory of foreign reserves as macroprudential policy. We study an open economy model of financial crises, in which pecuniary externalities lead to over-borrowing, and show that by accumulating international reserves, the government can achieve the constrained-efficient allocation. The optimal reserve accumulation policy leans against the wind and significantly reduces the exposure to financial crises. The theory is consistent with the joint dynamics of private and official capital flows, both over time and in the cross section, and can quantitatively account for the recent upward trend in international reserves.
E00|Retrospectives: Lord Keynes and Mr. Say: A Proximity of Ideas|Since the publication of Keynes's General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, generations of economists have been led to believe that Say was Keynes's ultimate nemesis. By means of textual and contextual analysis, we show that Keynes and Say held similar views on several key issues, such as the possibility of aggregate-demand deficiency, the role of money in the economy, and government intervention. Our conclusion is that there are enough similarities to call into question the idea that Keynes's views were antithetical to Say's. The irony is that Keynes was not aware of these similarities. Our study sheds new light on the interpretation of Keynes's work and on his criticism of classical political economy. Moreover, it suggests that some policy implications of demand-side and supply-side frameworks overlap. Finally, the study underlines the importance of a thorough analysis of the primary sources to fully grasp the substance of Say's message.
E00|A Statistical Field Approach to Capital Accumulation|This paper presents a model of capital accumulation for a large number of heterogenous producer-consumers in an exchange space in which interactions depend on agents' positions. Each agent is described by his production, consumption, stock of capital, as well as the position he occupies in this abstract space. Each agent produces one differentiated good whose price is fixed by market clearing conditions. Production functions are Cobb-Douglas, and capital stocks follow the standard capital accumulation dynamic equation. Agents consume all goods but have a preference for goods produced by their closest neighbors. Agents in the exchange space are subject both to attractive and repulsive forces. Exchanges drive agents closer, but beyond a certain level of proximity, agents will tend to crowd out more distant agents. The present model uses a formalism based on statistical field theory developed earlier by the authors. This approach allows the analytical treatment of economic models with an arbitrary number of agents, while preserving the system's interactions and complexity at the individual level. Our results show that the dynamics of capital accumulation and agents' position in the exchange space are correlated. Interactions in the exchange space induce several phases of the system. A first phase appears when attractive forces are limited. In this phase, an initial central position in the exchange space favors capital accumulation in average and leads to a higher level of capital, while agents far from the center will experience a slower accumulation process. A high level of initial capital drives agents towards a central position, i.e. improve the terms of their exchanges: they experience a higher demand and higher prices for their product. As usual, high capital productivity favors capital accumulation, while higher rates of capital depreciation reduce capital stock. In a second phase, attractive forces are predominant. The previous results remain, but an additional threshold effect appears. Even though no restriction was imposed initially on the system, two types of agents emerge, depending on their initial stock of capital. One type of agents will remain above the capital threshold and occupy and benefit from a central position. The other type will remain below the threshold, will not be able to break it and will remain at the periphery of the exchange space. In this phase, capital distribution is less homogenous than in the first phase.
E00|Inequality and Stagnation by Policy Design|"This paper argues the mainstream economics profession is threatened by theories of the financial crisis and ensuing stagnation that attribute those events to the policies recommended and justified by the profession. Such theories are existentially threatening to the dominant point of view. Consequently, mainstream economists resist engaging them as doing so would legitimize those theories. That resistance has contributed to blocking the politics and policies needed to address stagnation, thereby contributing to a political vacuum which is being filled by odious forces. Those ugly political consequences are unintended, but they are still there and show the dangerous consequences of the death of pluralism in economics. The critique of mainstream economists is not about ""values"" or lack of ""change"": it is about academic practice that suppresses ideas which are existentially threatening."
E00|What's Wrong With Modern Money Theory (MMT): A Critical Primer|Recently, there has been a burst of interest in modern money theory (MMT). The essential claim of MMT is sovereign currency issuing governments do not need taxes or bonds to finance government spending and are financially unconstrained. MMT rests on a triad of arguments concerning: (i) the macroeconomics of money financed budget deficits, (ii) the employer of last resort or job guarantee program, and (iii) the history of money. This primer analyzes that triad and shows each element involves suspect economic arguments. That leads MMT to underestimate the economic costs and exaggerate the capabilities of money financed fiscal policy. MMT's analytic shortcomings render it poor economics. However, its simplistic printing press economics is proving a popular political polemic, countering the equally simplistic and wrong-headed household economics of neoliberal austerity polemic.
E00|Inequality and the Business Cycle: Evidence from U.S. survey data|We study the effects of macroeconomic shocks on several measures of economic inequality obtained from U.S. survey data. To identify aggregate supply, aggregate demand, and monetary policy shocks, we estimate structural vector autoregressions and impose sign and zero restrictions on impulse response functions. Our results show that the effects of the macroeconomic shocks on economic inequality depend on the type of shock as well as on the measure of inequality considered. Contractionary monetary policy shocks increase expenditure and consumption inequality, whereas income and earnings inequality are less affected. Adverse aggregate supply and aggregate demand shocks increase income and earnings inequality, but reduce expenditure and consumption inequality. Our results suggest that different channels dominate in the transmission of the shocks. The earnings heterogeneity channel is consistent with the inequality dynamics in the aftermath of monetary policy shocks, but it appears to be less crucial when the economy is hit by either aggregate supply or aggregate demand shocks. In the aftermath of aggregate supply and aggregate demand shocks, inflation and the real interest rate appear to drive inequality dynamics to a larger degree. Using variance decompositions, we also find that although the macroeconomic shocks account for large shares of the variation in the macroeconomic variables, their contributions to the dynamics of the inequality measures are limited.
E00|Hartz IV and the decline of German unemployment: A macroeconomic evaluation|This paper proposes a new approach to evaluate the macroeconomic effects of the Hartz IV reform in Germany, which reduced the generosity of long-term unemployment benefits. We use a model with different unemployment durations, where the reform initiates both a partial effect and an equilibrium effect. The relative importance of these two effects and the size of the partial effect are estimated based on the IAB Job Vacancy Survey. Our novel methodology provides a solution for the existing disagreement in the macroeconomic literature on the unemployment effects of Hartz IV. We find that Hartz IV was a major driver for the decline of Germany's unemployment and that partial and equilibrium effect where of equal importance. We thereby contribute to the literature on partial and equilibrium effects of unemployment benefit changes. In addition, we are the first to provide direct empirical evidence on labour selection, which can be interpreted as one dimension of recruiting intensity.
E00|The Knightian Uncertainty Hypothesis: Unforeseeable Change and Muthï¿½s Consistency Constraint in Modeling Aggregate Outcomes|This paper proposes the Knightian Uncertainty Hypothesis (KUH), a new approach to macroeconomics and finance theory. KUH rests on a novel mathematical framework that characterizes both measurable and Knightian uncertainty about economic outcomes. Relying on this framework and Muthï¿½s pathbreaking hypothesis, KUH represents participantsï¿½ forecasts to be consistent with both uncertainties. KUH thus enables models of aggregate outcomes that 1) are premised on market participantsï¿½ rationality, and 2) accord a role to both fundamental and psychological (and other non-fundamental) factors in driving outcomes. The paper also suggests how a KUH modelï¿½s quantitative predictions can be confronted with time-series data.

The policy is most effective when there is extensive speculation and leverage limits are neither too tight nor too slack. When shadow banks are present, PMP can still replicate the benefits of macroprudential policy, but PMP is less effective (like macroprudential policy) because shadow banks respond by increasing their leverage.

E00|Macroeconomics vs Modern Money Theory: Some unpleasant Keynesian arithmetic|The last decade has witnessed a significant revival of belief in the efficacy of fiscal policy and mainstream economics is now reverting to the standard positions of mid-1970s Keynesianism. On the coattails of that revival, increased attention is being given to the doctrine of Modern Money Theory (MMT) which makes exaggerated claims about the economic costs and capability of money-financed fiscal policy. MMT proponents are now asserting society can enjoy a range of large government spending programs for free via money financed deficits, which has made it very popular with progressive policy advocates. This paper examines MMT’s assertion and rejects the claim that the US can enjoy a massive permanent free program spree that does not cause inflation. As has long been known by Keynesians, in a static economy money financed deficits can be used to finance programs when the economy is away from the full employment - inflation boundary. However, that window will be temporary to the extent that those deficits drive the economy to full employment. Since the programs are permanent they have to be paid for with taxes or they will generate inflation. That is the economic logic behind the unpleasant Keynesian arithmetic.
E00|Effect of Foreign Direct Investment and Economic Growth in Nigeria|This study examined the influence of foreign direct investment and exchange rate on economic growth in Nigeria from 1971 to 2013. The study employed trend lines and percentage to analysis the influence of both FDI and exchange rate on the economic growth of the country. From the analysis, this study found that exchange rate exerts most influence on economic growth than FDI in Nigeria.
E00|New Essentials of Economic Theory I. Assumptions, Economic Space and Variables|This paper develops economic theory framework free from general equilibrium assumptions. We describe macroeconomics as system of economic agents under action of n risks. Economic and financial variables of agents, their expectations and transactions between agents define macroeconomic variables. Agents variables depend on transactions between agents and transactions are performed under agents expectations. Agents expectations are formed by economic variables, transactions, expectations of other agents, other factors that impact macroeconomic evolution. We use risk ratings of agents as their coordinates on economic space and approximate description of economic and financial variables, transactions and expectations of numerous separate agents by description of variables, transactions and expectations as density functions on economic space. We describe evolution of macroeconomic density functions of variables, transactions and expectations and their flows induced by motion of separate agents on economic space due to change of agents risk rating. We apply our model to description of business cycles, present models of wave propagation for disturbances of economic variables and transactions, model asset price fluctuations and argue hidden complexities of classical Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing.
E00|Macroeconomic Performance Indicators and Exchange Rate Misalignment in Nigeria|This study employed an econometric approach to assess the relationship between effective real exchange rate and selected macroeconomic variables in Nigeria from 1981to 2014. This study investigate the relationship between REER misalignment and economic growth as well as examine the short run and long run relationship between real effective exchange rates misalignment and macroeconomic performance. The study found evidence of a long run relationship between real effective exchange rate and macroeconomic variables with 46 percent speed of adjustment. Also, the positive relationship exists between effective exchange rate, openness and terms of trade indicated that the Nigerian economy is highly opened and this openness has made it highly vulnerable to external shocks and exchange rate policy changes. Likewise, the real gross domestic leads to the appreciation of naira. Hence, the government should stimulate the productive sector of the domestic economy
E00|New Essentials of Economic Theory I. Assumptions, Economic Space and Variables|This paper develops economic theory framework free from assumptions on market equilibrium, utility functions, rational expectations and etc. We describe macroeconomics as system of economic agents under action of n risks. Economic and financial variables of agents, their expectations and transactions between agents define macroeconomic variables. Agents variables depend on transactions between agents and transactions are performed under agents expectations. Agents expectations are formed by economic variables, transactions, expectations of other agents, by all factors that impact macroeconomic evolution. We describe evolution of macroeconomic variables, transactions and expectations by systems of economic partial differential equations. We develop asset pricing model as a result of equations on transactions and expectations and derive equations that describe price dynamics. To do this we use risk ratings of economic agents as their coordinates on economic space. We approximate description of economic and financial variables, transactions and expectations of numerous separate agents by description of variables, transactions and expectations as density functions on economic space. We take into account flows of economic variables, transactions and expectations induced by motion of separate agents on economic space due to change of agents risk ratings and describe macroeconomic impact of these economic flows. We apply our model to description of business cycles, describe models of wave propagation for disturbances of economic variables and transactions, model asset price fluctuations and argue hidden complexities of classical Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing.
E00|The Consumption Function: A New Perspective|The behaviour of aggregate consumption is conventionally understood from the perspective of the permanent income and life cycle hypotheses. Both of these hypotheses are deduced from the theory of constrained optimization as applied to a ‘representative agent’ that consumes and saves. An alternative way of understanding aggregate consumption expenditure is to see it as primarily a systemic outcome of the adoption of widely upheld rules (‘meso-rules’) that enable trading and contracting in a complex economic system. Such systems require order to function but they must also adapt and evolve. Correspondingly, aggregate consumption can be viewed as being determined by two contrasting historical processes: one involves an aggregation of pre-committed, rule-bound choices and the other open-ended aspirational choices of novel products. Both of these processes are influenced by economic incentives. This is the domain of neoclassical economic theory and it is found that such theorising can tell us a great deal once it is set in its proper historical context. Although a modern complex system perspective derived from the natural sciences is adopted, it is embedded in economic thinking. For example, connections are made to the insights and intuitions of Alfred Marshall, Joseph Schumpeter, Simon Kuznets, Friedrich Hayek and Maynard Keynes. What we understand from them, along with modern complex system analysis, is that, although it is individual decisions that are fundamental in any economic system, it cannot be the case that what we observe at the aggregate level just reflects the optimization decision of a representative agent. As Hayek observed, the role of individual is much more complex and important than this. Using half a century of data, the US consumption function is modelled successfully on the presumption that the economy is a complex system in which there has been the diffusion of a ‘culture of consumerism’ in the post-war era. This has involved the increasing adoption of a particular bundle of meso rules and this has resulted in a steadily increasing ratio of consumption to GDP that has been tending towards a limit. It was found that variables and perspectives drawn from neoclassical economic theory are important in explaining variations in the growth of aggregate consumption.
E00|Money Neutrality, Monetary Aggregates and Machine Learning|The issue of whether or not money affects real economic activity (money neutrality) has attracted significant empirical attention over the last five decades. If money is neutral even in the short-run, then monetary policy is ineffective and its role limited. If money matters, it will be able to forecast real economic activity. In this study, we test the traditional simple sum monetary aggregates that are commonly used by central banks all over the world and also the theoretically correct Divisia monetary aggregates proposed by the Barnett Critique (Chrystal and MacDonald, 1994; Belongia and Ireland, 2014), both in three levels of aggregation: M1, M2, and M3. We use them to directionally forecast the Eurocoin index: A monthly index that measures the growth rate of the euro area GDP. The data span from January 2001 to June 2018. The forecasting methodology we employ is support vector machines (SVM) from the area of machine learning. The empirical results show that: (a) The Divisia monetary aggregates outperform the simple sum ones and (b) both monetary aggregates can directionally forecast the Eurocoin index reaching the highest accuracy of 82.05% providing evidence against money neutrality even in the short term.
E00|Dollarization in Montenegro: evidence after two decades of experience|Montenegro has started transition process from centrally planned to market oriented economy in late nineties of the XX century. Being still part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, official currency was dinar in that period. Dinar, inherited currency from the Social Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, was not convertible currency (except for short period from 1990-1992), after which then actual monetary policy resulted in hyperinflation during 1992-1993. Afterword, although it was only legal tender until 1999, dinar was not used as currency in full capacity and in all transactions, but often replaced with Deutsche mark (DM), although unofficially. As result of such practice, in 1999, Montenegro introduced ?double currency? regime, officially allowing use of both, dinar and DM as legal tenders. In November 2000, dollarization regime has officially become implemented in Montenegro, introducing DM and later EURO (since January 2002) as only legal tender in Montenegro. Two decades later, we may summarize effects of such choice, and see whether decision to implement dollarization instead to issue national currency (perper was the one which was proposed) or remain using dinar was appropriate. We will make comparisons of selected indicators with Serbia, as it has decided to use dinar as national currency. Although there are many differences between Montenegrin and Serbian economy, both have many elements in common, which make reasonable to make comparisons. In addition, we did empirical analysis and analyzed economic performance of European countries that belongs to different monetary regimes, for period from 2000-2016.
E00|Transformed Perturbation Solutions for Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Models|This paper introduces a new solution method for Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models that produces non explosive paths. The proposed solution method is as fast as standard perturbation methods and can be easily implemented in existing software packages like Dynare as it is obtained directly as a transformation of existing perturbation solutions proposed by Judd and Guu (1997) and Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2004), among others. The transformed perturbation method shares the same advantageous function approximation properties as standard higher order perturbation methods and, in contrast to those methods, generates stable sample paths that are stationary, geometrically ergodic and absolutely regular. Additionally, moments are shown to be bounded. The method is an alternative to the pruning method as proposed in Kim et al. (2008). The advantages of our approach are that, unlike pruning, it does not need to sacrifice accuracy around the steady state by ignoring higher order effects and it delivers a policy function. Moreover, the newly proposed solution is always more accurate globally than standard perturbation methods. We demonstrate the superior accuracy of our method in a range of examples.
E00|An Analysis of the Importance of Both Destruction and Creation to Economic Growth|A growth model is studied in which the destruction (or exit) and creative (or research) decisions are decoupled. This approach emphasizes that different agents make these interrelated decisions. The growth rate equals the product of a measure of the destruction and creation rates. The determinants of income mobility, income inequality, the lifespan of a firm, and the growth rate are studied. The equilibrium can either yield too high or low a level of innovation, but the destruction rate may also be too high or low. A non-linear tax/subsidy scheme, which alters the innovation and exit decisions, can improve welfare.

E00|The Relationship Between Offshoring, Growth and Welfare|A dynamic model of offshoring is studied which permits the analysis of how offshoring can affect economic and welfare outcomes. Firm owners make location decisions based on the future returns from locating in either foreign or domestic markets, or ceasing operations altogether. It is shown that increased offshoring can raise growth and welfare in both the domestic and foreign economies. Imposing a tax on firms that relocate abroad can make firms delay this move, but at the cost of lowering both domestic and foreign welfare, as well as growth. A tax on domestic profits has an ambiguous impact on growth, while lowering domestic welfare. The effect that these policy or parameter changes have on domestic income inequality, and international wage inequality is also studied. In contrast to the view that the economic impact of outsourcing is equivalent to that of admitting more immigrants, the present model implies that these policies are nearly the opposite of each other. Immigration reduces growth, and lowers the welfare of both foreign and domestic agents.
E00|Macroeconomic Research, Present and Past|What is the state of macroeconomics? We answer this question by hand collecting information about the epistemological approaches, theoretical and empirical methods, and data sources used by macroeconomists in their research. During the past 40 years there has been an increasing reliance on mathematical theory, particularly DSGE models, with theory-based papers now occupying the majority of space in macro journals. This shift is mirrored by a decline in the use of empirical falsification methods testing theoretical predictions. Microeconometric techniques have displaced time series methods, and empirical papers increasingly rely on micro and proprietary data sources. We document a decline and subsequent resurgence of financial frictions appearing in macro theory. Finally, we find that topics outside of macroeconomics are studied in more than three fourths of macro field journal publications.
E00|Statistical identification in SVARs - Monte Carlo experiments and a comparative assessment of the role of economic uncertainties for the US business cycle|Structural vector autoregressive analysis aims to trace the contemporaneous linkages among (macroeconomic) variables back to underlying orthogonal structural shocks. In homoskedastic Gaussian models the identification of these linkages deserves external and typically notdata-based information. Statistical data characteristics (e.g, heteroskedasticity or non-Gaussian independent components) allow for unique identification. Studying distinct covariance changes and distributional frameworks, we compare alternative data-driven identification procedures and identification by means of sign restrictions. The application of sign restrictions results in estimation biases as a reflection of censored sampling from a space of covariance decompositions. Statistical identification schemes are robust under distinct data structures to some extent. The detection of independent components appears most flexible unless the underlying shocks are (close to) Gaussianity. For analyzing linkages among the US business cycle and distinct sources of uncertainty we benefit from simulation-based evidence to point at two most suitable identification schemes. We detect a unidirectional effect of financial uncertainty on real economic activity and mutual causality between macroeconomic uncertainty and business cycles.
E00|Hartz IV and the Decline of German Unemployment: A Macroeconomic Evaluation|This paper proposes a new approach to evaluate the macroeconomic effects of the Hartz IV reform in Germany, which reduced the generosity of long-term unemployment benefits. We use a model with different unemployment durations, where the reform initiates both a partial effect and an equilibrium effect. The relative importance of these two effects and the size of the partial effect are estimated based on the IAB Job Vacancy Survey. Our novel methodology provides a solution for the existing disagreement in the macroeconomic literature on the unemployment effects of Hartz IV. We find that Hartz IV was a major driver for the decline of Germany's unemployment and that partial and equilibrium effect where of equal importance. We thereby contribute to the literature on partial and equilibrium effects of unemployment benefit changes. In addition, we are the first to provide direct empirical evidence on labour selection, which can be interpreted as one dimension of recruiting intensity.
E00|The Monetary and Fiscal History of Venezuela 1960-2016|I document the salient features of monetary and fiscal outcomes for the Venezuelan economy during the 1960 to 2016 period. Using the consolidated government-budget accounting framework of Chapter 2, I assess the importance of fiscal balance, seigniorage, and growth in accounting for the evolution of debt ratios. I find that extraordinary transfers, mostly associated with unprofitable public enterprises, and not central-government primary deficits, account for the increase in financing needs in recent decades. Seigniorage has been a consistent source of financing of deficits and transfers, especially in the last decade, with increases in debt ratios being important in some periods.
E00|Household Saving, Financial Constraints, and the Current Account in China|In this paper, we present a model economy that can account for the changes in the current account balance in China since the early 2000s. Our results suggest that the increase in the household saving rate and tighter financial constraints facing the firms played equally important roles in the increase in the current account surplus until 2008. We argue that inadequate insurance through government programs for the elderly and the decline in family insurance due to the one-child policy led to the increase in the household saving rate especially after 2000 as more and more families with only one child entered the economy. The increase in the saving rate coupled with the financial frictions preventing the increased household saving from being invested in domestic firms resulted in large current account surpluses until 2008. Our results also indicate that the decline in the current account surplus since 2008 was likely to be due to the relaxation of financial constraints facing domestic firms, which was a result of the large-scale fiscal stimulus plan launched by the Chinese government after 2008. These findings imply that the planned increases in China’s public pension coverage are likely to reduce the future current account balances. On the other hand, if financial constraints are tightened back to the pre-stimulus levels; the current account surplus may rise again.
E00|The shifting natural wealth of nations: The role of market orientation|This paper explores the effect of market orientation on (known or available) natural resource wealth using a novel dataset of world-wide major hydrocarbon and mineral discoveries. Our empirical estimates based on a large panel of countries show that increased market orientation causes a significant increase in discoveries of natural resources. In a thought experiment where economies in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa remain closed, they would have only achieved one quarter of the actual increase in discoveries they have experienced since the early 1990s. Our results call into question the commonly held view that known or available natural resource endowments are exogenous.
E00|The Framework for Risk Identification and Assessment|Risk assessment models are an important component of the Bank’s analytical tool kit for assessing the resilience of the financial system. We describe the Framework for Risk Identification and Assessment (FRIDA), a suite of models developed at the Bank of Canada to quantify the impact of financial stability risks to the broader economy and a range of financial system participants (households, businesses and banks). These risks are tail-risk events that are rare and severe but plausible. FRIDA combines models that quantify the impact of risks on both aggregate macrofinancial variables and different types of financial system participants, thus allowing us to understand the channels through which severe shocks could be transmitted and amplified within the financial system. By including sectoral models, FRIDA can consider the rich institutional features and heterogeneity that characterize different parts of the financial system and capture the various channels through which they can be affected by shocks. Like any model, FRIDA faces model uncertainty. Consequently, results from FRIDA are used in combination with expert judgment to form an overall assessment of financial stability risks.
E00|Potential Output in Canada: 2018 Reassessment|This note summarizes the reassessment of potential output, conducted by the Bank of Canada for the April 2018 Monetary Policy Report. Overall, the profile for potential output growth is expected to remain flat at 1.8 per cent between 2018 and 2020 and 1.9 per cent in 2021. While population aging will continue to be a drag on potential output growth, this drag is expected to be offset by a pickup in trend labour productivity. This year’s profile represents a substantial revision relative to the April 2017 reassessment. This is mostly a result of the historical revisions to the levels of business investment and capital stock released in November 2017 by Statistics Canada, strong employment gains in 2017 and a slightly more optimistic outlook for investment over the projection horizon. An analysis of alternative scenarios suggests a range for potential output growth from ±0.3 percentage points in 2018 to ±0.6 percentage points in 2021.
E00|A risk-centric model of demand recessions and macroprudential policy|When investors are unwilling to hold the economy's risk, a decline in the interest rate increases the Sharpe ratio of the market and equilibrates the risk markets. If the interest rate is constrained from below, risk markets are instead equilibrated via a decline in asset prices. However, the latter drags down aggregate demand, which further drags prices down, and so on. If investors are pessimistic about the recovery, the economy becomes highly susceptible to downward spirals due to dynamic feedbacks between asset prices, aggregate demand, and potential growth. In this context, belief disagreements generate highly destabilizing speculation that motivates macroprudential policy.
E00|Payments, credit and asset prices|This paper studies a modern monetary economy: trade in both goods and securities relies on money provided by intermediaries. While money is valued for its liquidity, its creation requires costly leverage. In ation, security prices and the transmission of monetary policy then depend on the institutional details of the payment system. The price of a security is higher if it helps back inside money, and lower if more inside money is used to trade it. In ation can be low in security market busts if bank portfolios suffer, but also in booms if trading absorbs more money. The government has multiple policy tools: in addition to the return on outside money, it affects the mix of securities used to back inside money.
E00|The macroeconomic determinants of migration|We estimate a gravity model of the determinants of migration flows using pairwise data from around 160 origin countries to 35 advanced economy destinations over the period 1990–2013. When we interact the various explanatory variables with freedom of movement we find that the elasticities of migration with respect to macroeconomic variables are not constant across country pairs. Under freedom of movement, the response to macroeconomic variables is stronger, and the response to distance and historical migrant stocks is weaker. However, the elasticity with regard to linguistic and historical variables does remain constant. Alongside macro variables commonly used in the literature, we also find a significant role for expected GDP growth. Migration flows are higher to destinations with stronger expected GDP growth, and from origins with weaker expected GDP growth. In addition, greater labour market flexibility in destination countries is associated with higher inward migration.
E00|BREXIT: Key Analytical Issues and Insights from Revised Economic Forecasts|Summary This contribution takes a look at the forecasts of macroeconomic indicators from 2015, i.e. prior to the BREXIT referendum, and 2017. The revised indicators indeed show that BREXIT has a significant impact on output growth, inflation and foreign exchange dynamics, with lower projected GDP growth already visible in the short term. The findings support the analysis of the Treasury, amongst others, in their study of 2016. Key analytical issues are discussed here including the information deficit during the referendum campaign, but also the policy options and challenges facing the United Kingdom and EU27 as the UK attempts to reinforce output growth in the coming years. Zusammenfassung: Dieser Beitrag befasst sich mit den Prognosen der makroökonomischen Indikatoren aus dem Jahr 2015, d.h. vor dem BREXIT-Referendum und 2017. Die überarbeiteten Indikatoren zeigen, dass der BREXIT erhebliche Auswirkungen auf das Produktionswachstum, die Inflation und die Wechselkursdynamik hat und das projizierte BIP-Wachstum schon kurzfristig geringer sichtbar ist. Die Ergebnisse stützen die Analyse des Finanzministeriums, unter anderem, die in ihrer Studie von 2016. Hier werden wichtige analytische Fragen erörtert, darunter das Informationsdefizit während der Kampagne für das Referendum, aber auch die politischen Optionen und Herausforderungen, vor denen das Vereinigte Königreich und die EU27, zur Steigerung des Produktionswachstums in den kommenden Jahren, steht.
E00|Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy|Will the internet, robotics and artificial intelligence mean a 'jobless future'? A recent narrative says tomorrow's technology will fundamentally differ from cotton mills, steam engines, or washing machines. Automation will be less like post-WW2 demobilisation for soldiers, and more like the car for horses. Driverless vehicles will oust truckers and taxi drivers. Hyper-intelligent clouds will oust financial advisers, doctors, and journalists. We face more 'natural' or 'technological' unemployment than ever. Government, it is said, must enact a basic income, because so many jobs will vanish. Also, maybe robots should become 'electronic persons', the subjects of rights and duties, so they can be taxed. This narrative is endorsed by prominent tech-billionaires, but it is flawed. Everything depends on social policy. Instead of mass unemployment and a basic income, the law can achieve full employment and fair incomes. This article explains three views of the causes of unemployment: as 'natural', as stemming from irrationality or technology, or as caused by laws that let people restrict the supply of capital to the job market. Only the third view has any credible evidence to support it. After WW2, 42% of UK jobs were redundant (actually, not hypothetically) but social policy maintained full employment, and it can be done again. Unemployment is driven by inequality of wealth and of votes in the economy. Democratic governments should reprogramme the law: for full employment and universal fair incomes. The owners of the robots will not automate your job away, if we defend economic democracy.
E00|Testing a model of UK growth - a causal role for R&D subsidies|We show that a DSGE model in which subsidies to private sector R&D stimulate economic growth, following the predictions of semi-endogenous growth theory, can account for the joint behaviour of UK output and total factor productivity for 1981-2010. R&D subsidies are measured as government- funded R&D performed by the private sector as a proportion of total private sector R&D. We estimate and test the performance of the model using Indirect Inference, and also investigate the robustness of the results using a Monte Carlo exercise. Our f•ndings indicate that sharp cuts in R&D subsidies tend to have highly persistent growth e¤ects in the UK.
E00|Land Use Regulations, Migration and Rising House Price Dispersion in the U.S|This paper develops and solves a dynamic spatial equilibrium model of regional housing markets in which house prices are jointly determined with location-to-location migration flows. Agents optimize period-by-period and decide whether to remain where they are or migrate to a new location at the start of each period. The agent’s optimal location choice and the resultant migration process is shown to be Markovian with the transition probabilities across all location pairs given as non-linear functions of wage and housing cost differentials, which are time varying and endogenously determined. On the supply side, in each location the construction firms build new houses by combining land and residential structures; with housing supplies endogenously responding to migration flows. The model can be viewed as an example of a dynamic network where regional housing markets interact with each other via migration flows that function as a source of spatial spill-overs. It is shown that the deterministic version of the model has a unique equilibrium and a unique balanced growth path. We estimate the state-level supplies of new residential land from the model using housing market and urban land acreage data. These estimates are shown to be significantly negatively correlated with the Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index. The model can simultaneously account for the rise in house price dispersion and the interstate migration in the U.S.. Counterfactual simulations suggest that reducing either land supply differentials or migration costs could significantly lower house price dispersion.
E00|Why is there so much Inertia in Inflation and Output? A Behavioral Explanation|Serial correlation in macroeconomics is pervasive. Macroeconomic modellers find it impossible to model this feature without relying on serially correlated shocks. Using a behavioral macroeconomic model, I show that serial correlation in inflation and output can easily be explained in the context that agents do not have rational expectation. This important feature is missing in the standard New Keynesian rational expectations models. The rational expectation models need serially correlated exogenous shocks to account for the high serial correlation in inflation and output while the behavioral model produces serial correlation in these variables endogenously. I also show that inertia in the beliefs about the future is a strong force in producing the serial correlation in inflation and output.
E00|Bayesian Vector Autoregressions|This article reviews Bayesian inference methods for Vector Autoregression models, commonly used priors for economic and financial variables, and applications to structural analysis and forecasting.
E00|¿Hubo enfermedad holandesa en Colombia? La bonanza petrolera del siglo XXI y su efecto sobre el sector manufacturero colombiano|En este artículo se analizan los efectos de las exportaciones de petróleo sobre el desempeño del sector manufacturero colombiano durante los años 2001 a 2015. Para ello se construyó un panel de datos con la Encuesta Anual Manufacturera del DANE y se estimaron los efectos de las exportaciones petroleras sobre el valor agregado de los subsectores (o clases) industriales, teniendo en cuenta el grado de exportaciones e importaciones de cada clase industrial. Los resultados econométricos muestran que las clases manufactureras que más exportan, que son la gran minoría, se ven perjudicadas por una bonanza petrolera y sufrirían los efectos de una enfermedad holandesa tradicional. Sin embargo, la inmensa mayoría se beneficia dado que venden dentro de Colombia y se favorecerían por el efecto gasto que surge de una enfermedad holandesa. Asimismo, las clases que más compran en el exterior les conviene que aumenten las exportaciones de petróleo por cuenta de la apreciación de la tasa de cambio real. En pocas palabras, sí hubo enfermedad holandesa, pero sus efectos negativos fueron mínimos sobre el sector manufacturero.
E00|Dynamic Macroeconomics: A Didactic Numeric Model|Teaching Dynamic Macroeconomics at undergraduate courses relies exclusively on intuitive prose and graphics depicting behaviours and steady states of the main markets of the economy. But when the case of forward-looking agents and the macroeconomic implications of their actions are discussed, intuitions and graphical representations offered to students may lead to unsupported conclusions. This happens even if the teacher and students use the chapter upon a dynamic macroeconomic model of one of the most didactic and ordered texts ever published: Williamson (2014). In this paper we try to sustain this assertion.
E00|Inequality of opportunity, governance and individual beliefs|Inequality of opportunity is a failure of economies to fairly tie incentives to effort and investment, across the socio-economic spectrum. But the actual limitations on economic activity due to this failure may depend on if people believe the system is unfair, and how well governing institutions safeguard fair-play. In this paper, I study whether inequality of opportunity is correlated with beliefs about fairness, and whether good governance can be a substitute in belief formations for decreases in inequality of opportunity. I find a that people in countries with recent increases in inequality of opportunity are less likely to believe that success is due to fair processes. The relationship is strongest in countries with poor quality governance. In countries with high quality governance, people appear to be more tolerant of inequality of opportunity, as it is only weakly reflected in their beliefs about process fairness. Finally, increases in income inequality also reduce the likelihood people perceive success as fair, but this relationship is not mitigated by good governance.
E00|The Slope of the Term Structure and Recessions: The Pre-Fed Evidence, 1857-1913|This paper studies the information content of the slope of the term structure for recessions, using monthly US data spanning 1857-1913. We find that the term spread predicts future recessions up to about 12 months ahead, as does the current value of the recession dummy. We also find that stock prices are significant in the probit models we use to predict future recessions, but that business failures and growth in industrial production are generally insignificant. Overall, the results give broad support to the findings of Bordo and Haubrich (2004, 2008a, 2008b), who use quarterly data from 1875 to study the ability of the term structure to forecast real GNP growth.

E00|The Impact of Trade Conflict on Developing Asia|This paper analyzes the effects of the current trade conflict on developing Asia using the Asian Development Bank’s Multiregional Input–Output Table (MRIOT), allowing us to calculate the impact on individual countries and on sectors within countries. The analysis estimates the direct impact on all tariff-affected goods; uses input–output analysis to estimate indirect effects on gross domestic product (GDP), exports, and employment; and allows for redirection of trade toward other producers using the approach of Feenstra and Sasahara (2017). A full escalation of the bilateral United States (US)–People’s Republic of China (PRC) trade conflict would shave 1% off PRC GDP and 0.2% off US GDP. The rest of developing Asia could see small net gains thanks to trade redirection, particularly in the electronics sector. A trade war in autos and parts would hurt the European Union and Japan. The conflict has substantial negative effects on PRC and US employment, but only minor impacts on current account balances.
E00|The Fed's Asymmetric Forecast Errors|"I show that the probability that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System staff's forecasts (the ""Greenbooks'"") overpredicted quarterly real gross domestic product (GDP) growth depends on both the forecast horizon and also whether the forecasted quarter was above or below trend real GDP growth. For forecasted quarters that grew below trend, Greenbooks were much more likely to overpredict real GDP growth, with one-quarter ahead forecasts overpredicting real GDP growth more than 75% of the time, and this rate of overprediction was higher for further ahead forecasts. For forecasted quarters that grew above trend, Greenbooks were slightly more likely to underpredict real GDP growth, with one-quarter ahead forecasts underpredicting growth about 60% of the time. Unconditionally, on average, Greenbooks overpredicted real GDP growth."
E00|Employment Effects of Unconventional Monetary Policy : Evidence from QE|This paper investigates the effect of the Federal Reserve's unconventional monetary policy on employment via a bank lending channel. We find that banks with higher mortgage-backed securities holdings issued relatively more loans after the first and third rounds of quantitative easing (QE1 and QE3). While additional volume is concentrated in refinanced mortgages after QE1, increases are driven by newly originated home purchase mortgages and additional commercial and industrial lending after QE3. Using spatial variation, we show that regions with a high share of affected banks experienced stronger employment growth after both, QE1 and QE3. While the ability of households to refinance mortgages after QE1 spurred local demand, the resulting additional employment growth was relatively weak and confined to the non-tradable goods sector. In contrast, the increase in overall employment after QE3 is sizable and can be attributed to the supply of additional credit to firms. To s upport this finding, we use new confidential loan-level data to show that firms with stronger ties to affected banks increased employment and capital investment more after QE3. Altogether, our findings suggest that unconventional monetary policy can, similar to conventional monetary policy, affect real economic outcomes.
E00|The Horizontally S-Shaped Laffer Curve|In a neoclassical growth model with incomplete markets and heterogeneous, liquidity-constrained agents, the properties of the Laffer curve depend on whether debt or transfers are adjusted to balance the government budget constraint. The Laffer curve conditional on public debt is horizontally S-shaped. Two opposing forces explain this result. First, when government wealth increases, the fiscal burden declines, calling for lower tax rates. Second, because the interest rate decreases when government wealth increases, fiscal revenues may also decline, calling for higher taxes. For sufficiently negative government debt, the second force dominates, leading to the odd shape of the Laffer curve conditional on debt.
E00|Croissance potentielle : la politique économique au royaume des aveugles ?|La crise a révélé les insuffisances graves de la théorie macroéconomique dominante et des conceptions de politique macroéconomique qu’elle inspire. Le cadre analytique dans lequel raisonnent la plupart des macroéconomistes, celui qui guide les institutions nationales, européennes et internationales dans leurs orientations, est intrinsèquement inapte à rendre compte des évolutions structurelles d’une économie financiarisée et en profonde mutation. Les concepts-clés qui en sont les fondements induisent des choix d’indicateurs fournissant des signaux erronés. Les grandeurs macroéconomiques standards sur lesquelles se fondent les politiques économiques se sont vidées de leur sens, mais constituent néanmoins toujours les piliers des diagnostics. Refonder la macroéconomie est une urgence ; mais les ébauches actuellement offertes ne sont pas à la hauteur des défis. POTENTIAL GROWTH: ECONOMIC POLICY IN THE KINGDOM OF THE BLIND The 2009 crisis has shed a crude light on the deep shortcomings of standard macroeconomic theory and of its representation of the workings of macroeconomic policy. The analytical framework in which most macroeconomists reason, the one that guides national, European, and international institutions’ orientations, is intrinsically unable to deliver insights on the structural evolutions of economies that are massively intertwined with finance and in perpetual technological change. The key concepts on which this framework is built lead to the choice of indicators that generate misleading signals. Standard macroeconomic aggregates guiding economic policies have been losing their meaning, but continue to be relied upon when forming a diagnosis on national economies. Rebuilding macroeconomic theory on new foundations is urgent; but the avenues that are being explored currently are far from providing adequate answers.
E00|Recovering Keynesian Phillips curve theory|Economic theory is prone to hysteresis. Once an idea is adopted, it is difficult to change. In the 1970s, the economics profession abandoned the Keynesian Phillips curve and adopted Milton Friedman's natural rate of unemployment (NRU) hypothesis. The shift was facilitated by a series of lucky breaks. Despite much evidence against the NRU, and much evidence and theoretical argument supportive of the Keynesian Phillips curve, the NRU hypothesis remains ascendant. The hypothesis has had an enormous impact on macroeconomic theory and policy. 2018 is the fiftieth anniversary of Friedman's introduction of the NRU hypothesis. The anniversary offers an opportunity to challenge, rather than celebrate it.
E00|How do people interpret macroeconomic shocks? Evidence from U.S. survey data|We study the revision of survey expectations in response to macroeconomic shocks, which we identify in vector autoregressive models with sign restrictions. We find that survey respondents distinguish between movements along the Phillips curve and shifts of the Phillips curve, depending on the type of the shock that hits the economy. In addition, expectations about future interest rate dynamics are revised broadly in line with a Taylor rule. While the macroeconomic shocks account only for a small share of the forecast error variance of survey measures elicited from consumers, they are more relevant for the expectations of professional forecasters. This result is consistent with models of rational inattention.
E00|How do consumers interpret the macroeconomic effects of oil price fluctuations? Evidence from U.S. survey data|We use survey data to study how consumers assess the macroeconomic effects of structural oil market shocks on the U.S. economy using vector autoregressive models. To structurally decompose oil price changes, we impose sign restrictions on impulse responses. We find that the survey respondents' expectations are qualitatively in line with the actual developments in most cases. Nevertheless, survey respondents underestimate the adverse effects of oil market shocks in some cases. We also find that respondents expect the central bank to stabilize inflation as well as output and that expectations are consistent with a standard Taylor rule.
E00|New Risk Sharing Channels in OECD Countries: a Heterogeneous Panel VAR|We aim to improve upon the existing empirical literature on international risk sharing under three dimensions. First, we generalize dynamic multi-equation approaches to the estimation of risk sharing channels, by adopting a Heterogeneous Panel VAR model. Within this framework, the coefficients representing the extent of risk sharing achieved through the different mechanisms are allowed to vary across countries. Second, we introduce two new risk sharing channels â€“ namely, government consumption and the real exchange rate (that we further decompose into relative prices and the nominal exchange rate) â€“ which allow us to investigate the role of fiscal policy and international price adjustments in the absorption of macroeconomic shocks. Third, we establish a better link between the â€œchannelsâ€ empirical model and a theoretical formulation of the risk sharing condition which allows for PPP violations. Our empirical analysis, for a set of 21 OECD countries over 1960-2016, contributes to identifying the geographical structure and dynamics of risk sharing channels and to describing their evolution in the latest half-century. For the OECD sample as a whole, we confirm through 2016 the strong smoothing role played by credit markets and the small degree of risk sharing achieved through factor incomes. Interestingly, government consumption tends to have a dis-smoothing effect, due to its counter-cyclical movements. Another noteworthy result is the negative risk sharing effect of the real exchange rate, driven by the dis-smoothing role played by the movements of the nominal exchange rate, only partially offset by relative price adjustments. The evolution of these risk sharing mechanisms is diverse, but the most important channels â€“ namely credit markets and real exchange rate adjustments â€“ exhibit slightly positive trends for the first half of the period, negative trends afterwards, and a recovery in more recent years. Our results demonstrate that the extent of risk sharing is strikingly different across countries, especially if we take into account valuation effects through the real exchange rate. Even considering only traditional risk sharing channels, the country-specific magnitude of risk sharing on impact ranges from around 15% to over 80%. In addition, dynamics are also quite diverse across countries; for example, risk sharing through credit markets, while quite effective on impact, provokes dis-smoothing for about two thirds of the countries from the second year onwards. Our approach is of particular interest for policy makers, as it allows identifying the strengths and the weaknesses of the institutional and behavioral risk sharing mechanisms at work in different countries.
E00|Network-based macro fluctuations: Evidence from Lithuania|Do inter-sectoral linkages of intermediate products affect the spread of sectoral shocks at the aggregate level in Lithuania, a small and open economy? We answer this question by: i) constructing the domestic sector-by-sector direct requirements table using the Lithuanian interindustry transactions tables, and ii) applying Acemoglu et al. (2012)'s network-based methodology and Gabaix and Ibragimov (2011)'s modified log rank-log size regression to analyse the nature of inter-sectoral linkages. Our results indicate that the direct and indirect inter-sectoral linkages cause aggregate volatility to decay at a rate lower than square root of n - the rate predicted by the standard diversification argument. Furthermore, indirect linkages play an important role in the above-mentioned process, supporting the findings of Acemoglu et al. (2012). These results suggest that the inter-sectoral network of linkages represent a potential propagation mechanism for idiosyncratic shocks throughout the Lithuanian economy.
E00|Business Cycle Anatomy|We propose a new strategy for dissecting the macroeconomic time series, provide a template for the propagation mechanism that best describes the observed business cycles, and use its properties to appraise models of both the parsimonious and the medium-scale variety. Our findings support the existence of a main business-cycle driver but rule out the following candidates for this role: technology or other shocks that map to TFP movements; news about future productivity; and inflationary demand shocks of the textbook type. Prominent members of the DSGE literature also lack the propagation mechanism seen in our anatomy of the data. Models that aim at accommodating demand-driven cycles under flexible prices appear promising.
E00|Determining the Inflationary Effects of El Niño and La Niña in the Philippines|"This paper investigates whether climate ""shocks"" (or short-term but sharp changes in climatic conditions), El Niño and La Niña, have significant impacts on inflation in the country. Using regional panel data and information from PAGASA, this study finds that both of these weather shocks have significant effects on the general price level in the Philippines, along with interest rate, foreign exchange, and unemployment rate. Further, the results also indicate that long-term changes in climatic conditions, specifically average temperature and rainfall, do not have any significant impacts on prices. These findings are consistent with the literature that point to the fact that successful adaptation to long-term changes in climatic conditions negates any potential negative impacts to the economy. The study concludes that adaptation must be expanded not only to respond to long-term changes in climatic conditions, but also to short-term but intense changes in temperature and rainfall."
E00|Global Commodity Prices and Global Stock Volatility Shocks|This paper investigates the time-varying dynamics of global stock volatility, commodity prices, and domestic output and consumer prices. The main empirical findings of this paper are: (i) stock volatility and commodity price shocks impact each other and the economy in a gradual and endogenous adjustment process; (ii) the impact of a commodity price shock on global stock volatility is far greater during the global financial crisis than at other times; (iii) the effects of global stock volatility on the US output are amplified by the endogenous commodity price responses; (iv) in the long run, shocks to commodity prices (stock market volatility) account for 11.9% (6.6%) and 25.1% (11.6%) of the variation in US output and consumer prices; (v) the effects of global stock volatility shocks on the economy are heterogeneous across nations and relatively larger in the developed countries; (vi) developing/small economies are relatively more vulnerable upon commodity price shocks.
E00|The impact of exchange rate on exports in South Africa|The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of exchange rate on exports in South Africa between the periods 1994 to 2016 and to establish whether a statistically significant relationship exists between exports and exchange rate. The study incorporated real interest rate, investments and inflation as control variables. By applying the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach, this study empirically investigates the impact of real exchange rate on exports in South Africa. In testing for the unit root properties of the time series data, the variables were subjected to the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Philips Perron (PP) unit root tests. The results obtained reveal that exchange rate has a significant negative relationship with exports in South Africa.
E00|Does Indonesia’s macroeconomic work well towards the political year?|This paper utilizes the timeframe of 2014-2018 as the period with some of the global underperformed macroeconomic indicators. This paper found that in late 2016, Indonesia’s macroeconomic indicators started shown some improvements that keep real and monetary sector’s equilibrium to be stable. This paper observes the external balance of current account, exchange rate stability, inflation and interest rate as well as consumption patterns, saving-investment gap, fiscal discipline & fiscal sustainability. It analyses the government expenditure multiplier, real & monetary sector stability and institutional coordination between fiscal authority, monetary authority, and financial service authority. Real sector improvements which have been rolling since 2017 has significantly contributed to the recent Indonesia’s macroeconomic stability. Technically, if all on the track, this will sustain during the upcoming political year of 2019.
E00|Monetary policy in perspective of Umer Chapra|This research is a type of qualitative research with a study approach profound literature. The study discussed was the thought of M. Umer Chapra in the field of Islamic monetary policy. Chapra's extensive experience in teaching and research economic field as well as a good understanding of Islamic Shari'ah, bringing on the conclusion that Islam is only the most appropriate alternative system for creating the welfare of mankind. It was shown Chapra in the discussion about instruments in monetary policy, the urgency of changing the banking system and on finally realize the concept of Islamic-style welfare state.
E00|The Business Cycle Model Beyond General Equilibrium|This paper presents the business cycle model without using assumptions of general equilibrium. We use agent-based models, risk assessments and economic space as ground for modelling business cycles. All economic agents are at risk but not for all agents risk assessments are performed. We propose that for each agent risk assessment can be performed and suggest treat risk ratings x of agents as their coordinate x on economic space. Agents fill economic domain bounded by most secure and most risky agents. Economic processes, exogenous or endogenous shocks induce evolution of agent’s risk coordinates. We show how risk motions of agents on the bounded economic domain induce the business cycle. We derive the system of economic equations that describe macroeconomic evolution and the business cycle on economic space. As example, we study simple model that describe relations between macro Assets A(t,x) and Revenue-on-Assets B(t,x). To show how economic equations describe the business cycle we obtain from them the system of ordinary differential equations that describes business cycle time fluctuations of macroeconomic Assets A(t) and Revenue-on-Assets B(t).
E00|Economic Transactions Govern Business Cycles|This paper presents the business cycle model based on treatment of economic agents as simple units of macroeconomics. Agents (banks, corporations, households, etc.) have numerous economic and financial variables like Assets, Credits, Debts, Consumption, etc. Agents perform economic and financial transactions with other agents. All agents are at risk but not for all agents risk assessments are performed now. Let’s propose that risk assessment can be made for all agents and let’s use agents risk ratings x as their coordinates. Agents coordinates for n risks define n-dimensional economic space. Economic and financial transactions between agents describe evolution of their economic and financial variables. Aggregations of economic or financial variables of agents in a unit volume at point x determine macro variables as functions of x. Aggregations of transactions between agents in unit volumes at points x and y determine macro transactions as functions of x and y. Macro transactions describe rate of change of macro variables at points x and y. We derive economic equations that describe evolution of macro transactions. We show that business cycle fluctuations are consequence of these equations. We argue that business cycle fluctuations of particular macro variable can be treated as oscillations of “mean risk coordinates” of this economic variable. As example we study the business cycle determined by model interactions between transactions CL(t,x,y) that provide Loans from Creditors at point x to Borrowers at point y and transactions LR(t,x,y) that describe repayments from Borrowers at point y to Creditors at point x. Starting with economic equations we derive the system of ordinary differential equations that describe the business cycle fluctuations of macro Credits C(t) and macro Loan-Repayments LR(t) of the entire economics.
E00|The Knowledge-Diffusion Bottleneck in Economic Growth and Development|If learning and teaching were easy, the whole world would be developed and frontier knowledge would spread quickly. But learning is difficult and there is a finite capacity for teaching. The concept of a knowledge-diffusion ``bottleneck'' can be used to explain why there is a negative correlation between per-capita income growth rates and fertility rates, especially amongst countries that are in the early stages of industrialization. It can also explain why income distributions in rich countries have power-law tails (both upper and lower) and why income growth rates are independent of scale. A simple model of knowledge diffusion is calibrated to the observed paths of structural transformation in newly-industrializing countries. The resulting parameters are found to be consistent with the tail exponents seen in U.S. income data, suggesting a common mechanism of knowledge diffusion operating in developing countries and fully-developed countries.
E00|Рождение Макроэкономического Порядка Из Микроэкономического Хаоса<BR>[The birth of a macroeconomic order from microeconomic chaos]|В данной статье рассмотрена проблема самоорганизации экономических процессов в условиях совершенной конкуренции, основанной на взаимодействии индивидуальных и общественных экономических ценностей и рыночных цен. На основе диалектического анализа показано глубокое внутреннее единство проиозводства и потребления, спроса и предложения, полезности и затрат и др. категорий, которые обуславливают функциональную замкнутость и целостность экономической системы, как необходимое условие для понимания процесса формирования макроэкономического порядка из микроэкономического хаоса. На методологической основе диалектики дается новое понимание механизма саморегулирования рыночных процессов и экономической оптимизации. Предлагаемое теоретическое объяснение экономических процессов позволит создать более адекватные прикладные экономические модели и выработать эффективную экономическую политику. In this article, the problem of self-organization of economic processes in conditions of perfect competition, based on the interaction of individual and public economic values and market prices, is considered. On the basis of dialectical analysis, the deep internal unity of production and consumption, supply and demand, utility and costs, and other categories that determine the functional closeness and integrity of economic system as a necessary condition for to understand the formation process of a macroeconomic order from microeconomic chaos is shown. A new understanding of market processes' self-regulation mechanism and economic optimization on the methodological basis of dialectics is given. The proposed theoretical explanation of economic processes makes it possible to create more adequate applied economic models and develop an effective economic policy.
E00|Economic Transactions Govern Business Cycles|This paper presents the business cycle model without using assumptions of general equilibrium. All economic agents are at risk but not for all agents risk assessments are performed. We propose that risk assessment can be completed for all agents and suggest use agents risk ratings as their coordinates x. We show that macroeconomics as ABM is described on bounded economic domain of economic space. Transactions between agents describe evolution of their economic and financial variables. Aggregations of economic or financial variables of agents in a unit volume near point x determine macro variables as functions of x. Aggregations of transactions between agents in unit volumes near points x and y determine macro transactions as functions of x and y. Macro transactions describe change of macro variables near points x and y. We explain how evolution of macro transactions can be described by economic equations on economic space. We show that business cycle fluctuations are consequence of these equations. We treat the nature of the business cycle fluctuations of particular macro variable as oscillations of “mean risk” of this economic variable on bounded economic domain. As example we describe interactions between transactions CL(t,x,y) that provide Loans from Creditors at point x to Borrowers at point y and transactions LR(t,x,y) that describe repayments from Borrowers at point y to Creditors at point x. Starting with economic equations we derive the system of ordinary differential equations that describe the business cycle fluctuations of macro Credits C(t) and macro Loan-Repayments LR(t) of the entire economics.
E00|Expectations, Price Fluctuations and Lorenz Attractor|This paper describes expectations and Buy-Sell transactions of selected Stokes between economic agents and Exchange on economic space as ground for modeling trading volume and price fluctuations. We study simple model of mutual relations between transactions and expectations and derive economic equations that describe disturbances of price, trading volume and expectations. We obtain simple harmonic oscillations for price fluctuations. We show that our model economic equations can take form of Lorenz attractor. Our approximation of transactions and expectations and economic equations on disturbances of price, trading volume and expectations allows apply dynamical systems methods for modeling chaotic behavior of economic and financial systems.
E00|National Income and Malnutrition in Africa: a Rapid Assessment|This paper pursues a simple analysis of a static relationship between national income and income distribution, and obesity/overweight and undernutrition in African countries. From intuition, a relation between national income (GDP/Capita) and malnutrition is expected. Countries that have higher income are expected to have higher prevalence of obesity/overweight. Likewise, countries with higher income should have lower levels of undernutrition. This paper tests this hypothesis using macroeconomic data. The paper also analyses the role of income inequality, as measured by the GINI coefficient, as a potential driver of malnutrition. In this case, countries that have high levels of income inequality are expected to have coexistent high levels of both obesity and undernourishment. Results of this analysis show that there is a correlation between income and malnutrition. However, this relationship is weak, with a correlation coefficient of less than 50% for both undernourishment and overweight/obesity. However, the signs are as expected, even when running a simple regression of the variables. Higher national income has a positive relationship with obesity and negative relationship with undernourishment. From the regression, only the coefficient on undernourishment is significant at 5% confidence level. No significant relationship was found between income distribution and malnourishment, even on the extended logistic model. These finding are not realistically surprising. Higher income does not guarantee good nutrition, although poorer countries are expected to have high level of undernourishment. Also, there is a friction in the response of undernutrition to growth in GDP. Given the low-income elasticity of demand for food, higher income is not expected to be strongly linked to obesity. This could also be an explanation for the low response of malnutrition to income inequalities, although this latter relationship needs to be tested further with data sets of longer duration, in a time series approach. As such, it is important to lobby governments to mainstream food and nutrition security in other initiatives that increase national income, and to promote direct interventions that reduce the prevalence of undernourishment as part of meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This will ensure that high national income translates to reduction in malnutrition prevalence across countries.
E00|A Path Integral Approach to Business Cycle Models with Large Number of Agents|This paper presents an analytical treatment of economic systems with an arbitrary number of agents that keeps track of the systems' interactions and agents' complexity. This formalism does not seek to aggregate agents. It rather replaces the standard optimization approach by a probabilistic description of both the entire system and agents' behaviors. This is done in two distinct steps. A first step considers an interacting system involving an arbitrary number of agents, where each agent's utility function is subject to unpredictable shocks. In such a setting, individual optimization problems need not be resolved. Each agent is described by a time-dependent probability distribution centered around his utility optimum. The entire system of agents is thus defined by a composite probability depending on time, agents' interactions and forward-looking behaviors. This dynamic system is described by a path integral formalism in an abstract space - the space of the agents' actions - and is very similar to a statistical physics or quantum mechanics system. We show that this description, applied to the space of agents' actions, reduces to the usual optimization results in simple cases. Compared to a standard optimization, such a description markedly eases the treatment of systems with small number of agents. It becomes however useless for a large number of agents. In a second step therefore, we show that for a large number of agents, the previous description is equivalent to a more compact description in terms of field theory. This yields an analytical though approximate treatment of the system. This field theory does not model the aggregation of a microeconomic system in the usual sense. It rather describes an environment of a large number of interacting agents. From this description, various phases or equilibria may be retrieved, along with individual agents' behaviors and their interactions with the environment. For illustrative purposes, this paper studies a Business Cycle model with a large number of agents.
E00|Agricultural Productivity and Food Supply Stability in Sub-Saharan Africa: LSDV and SYS-GMM Approach|Food supply fluctuations remain a major challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In this regard, this study empirically examined the impact of agricultural productivity on food security stability in 37 selected countries in SSA from 1990 to 2016, using the pooled, least square dummy variable (LSDV), random and system generalized methods of moments (SYS-GMM) models. The study adopted per-capita food supply variability (PCFSV) as a measure of food security stability while agriculture value-added contribution to gross domestic product (AGVA) and crop production (CRPROD) were selected indicators of agricultural productivity. The LSDV and SYS-GMM model estimations revealed that agricultural productivity and the control factors contributed significantly, though with a mix of positive and negative effects, to food security stability in the selected countries in SSA during the period under review. The LSDV model showed that AGVA had no statistically significant positive effect on food security stability, however, this was corrected in the SYS-GMM model, but with a positive impact. The study concludes that stability in food security is achieved and sustained by improving agricultural productivity. Based on the findings, the study recommended that food security stability should be improved by enhancing agricultural productivity through ensuring effective implementation of pro-agriculture growth policies in SSA
E00|Economic and Financial Transactions Govern Business Cycles|Problem/Relevance - This paper presents new description of the business cycles that for decades remain as relevant and important economic problem. Research Objective/Questions - We propose that econometrics can provide sufficient data for assessments of risk ratings for almost all economic agents. We use risk ratings as coordinates of agents and show that the business cycles are consequences of collective change of risk coordinates of agents and their financial variables. Methodology - We aggregate similar financial variables of agents and define macro variables as functions on economic space. Economic and financial transactions between agents are the only tools that change their extensive variables. We aggregate similar transactions between agents with risk coordinates x and y and define macro transactions as functions of x and y. We derive economic equations that describe evolution of macro transactions and hence describe evolution of macro variables. Major Findings - As example we study simple model that describes interactions between Credits transactions from Creditors at x to Borrowers at y and Loan-Repayment transactions that describe refunds from Borrowers at y to Creditors at x. We show that collective motions of Creditors and Borrowers from safer to risky area and back on economic space induce frequencies of macroeconomic Credit cycles. Implications – Our model can improve forecasting of the business cycles and help increase economic sustainability and financial policy-making. That requires development of risk ratings methodologies and corporate accounting procedures that should correspond each other to enable risk assessments of economic agents
E00|Distortions and the Structure of the World Economy|We develop a model of the world economy as input-output relationships subject to distortions. We then propose a methodology to solve the identification problem, common to the literature on misallocation in input-output relationships, of separating sectoral TFPs from the sectoral distortions. Using both the input shares and the consumption shares within the CES production and CES consumption structure we derive simple closed-form sufficient statistics for the sectoral distortions and for the sectoral TFPs. We then derive a closed-form solution of the elasticities of each entry in the world input-output matrix to distortions. We compute a total of more than half a million internal distortions and TFPs and document significant heterogeneity of those across countries and sectors. We then calculate the whole matrix of about two million elasticities to distortions and TFPs of the input-output matrix of the world economy. We show that internal (within a given country) distortions significantly affect the structure of the economy of that country and have sizeable cross effects on the input-output matrix of other countries. We then find that the world GDP elasticity to changes in internal distortions is an order of magnitude larger than that of the external distortions.
E00|The Impact of Trade Conflict on Developing Asia|This paper analyzes the effects of the current trade conflict on developing Asia using the Asian Development Bankâ€™s Multiregional Inputâ€“Output Table (MRIOT), allowing us to calculate the impact on individual countries and on sectors within countries. The analysis estimates the direct impact on all tariff-affected goods; uses inputâ€“output analysis to estimate indirect effects on gross domestic product (GDP), exports, and employment; and allows for redirection of trade toward other producers using the approach of Feenstra and Sasahara (2017). A full escalation of the bilateral United States (US)â€“Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (PRC) trade conflict would shave 1% off PRC GDP and 0.2% off US GDP. The rest of developing Asia could see small net gains thanks to trade redirection, particularly in the electronics sector. A trade war in autos and parts would hurt the European Union and Japan. The conflict has substantial negative effects on PRC and US employment, but only minor impacts on current account balances.
E00|Relationship Between Financial Stability and Economic Growth in Turkey (2002-2017)|This study aims to analyze the relationship between financial stability and economic growth in Turkey as an emerging market. Financial stability, in general terms, is expressed as the resilience of the economy against the unexpected situations that may disrupt the multi-dimensional equilibrium in the financial system. Although a large number of studies have examined the effect of financial deepening on economic growth, there is a little evidence on the effect of financial stability or soundness on economic growth. A present study considering the 2002 ? 2017 period which covers the implementation of inflation targeting monetary policy regime analyses the short and long-run dynamics of financial stability ? economic growth relationship by using co-integration and ARDL techniques. Obtained results show that a steadily functioning financial system is a requirement for economic growth. In particular, financial leverage, capital adequacy, asset quality, and liquidity are important components of financial stability affecting the economic growth. Thus, formulating the efficient policies to support economic growth requires understanding the factors that affect financial stability.
E00|Why political risk matters for banking flows?|In this paper we rely on an extensive dataset on cross-border banking flows to understand the effect of political risk on international lending. Moreover, our paper is the first that analyses the effect of several factors of political risk in cross-border banking flows using a sample that is larger than that of previous studies, i.e. covering the period 1984 ? 2013. Moreover - and given the importance of the 9/11 attacks as a turning point both in the political atmosphere and on the global economy ? our paper sets out to investigate how the September 11, 2001 attacks shaped the importance of political risk as a determinant of cross-border banking flows.We find that political risk is an important consideration for foreign investors and that it is perceived differently in developed and non-developed countries. Moreover, we find that the 9/11/2001 attacks change the perception of political risk, and the factors of the aforementioned risk that drive international lending - both in developed and non-developed countries - also changed with the September 11, 2001 attacks.
E00|A Toolkit for Value Function Iteration|Abstract This article introduces a Toolkit for Value Function Iteration. The toolkit is implemented in Matlab and makes automatic use of the GPU and of parallel CPUs. Likely uses are Teaching, Testing Algorithms, Replication, and Research. I here provide a description of some of the main components and algorithms. I also describe the design philosophy underlying choices about how to structure the toolkit and which algorithms to use. Rather than provide simple examples, something best done online (links are given), I instead perform a replication of a classic paper from the real business cycle literature as a demonstration of the use of such a toolkit. The Toolkit, Documentation, Examples, Replications, and more can be found at vfitoolkit.com
E00|Towards a New Austrian Macroeconomics|Abstract Austrian macroeconomists of the interwar period saw the economy as a complex adaptive system, in which macroeconomic variables emerge from the interaction between millions of purposefully acting agents. Recent advances in computation technology allow us to build empirically salient synthetic economies in silico, and thereby formalize many Austrian insights. We present a workhorse model with firms on an input-output network. Macroeconomic variables evolve through the interaction between micro-economic decisions. We use the model to explain an effect of monetary shocks on the price distribution and provide a sketch of other potential applications.
E00|Countercyclical Endogenous Uncertainty Shocks, Efficiency Wages and Procyclical Precautionary Labor Productivity|This work introduces a new mechanism generating procyclical comovements of labor productivity, employment, through endogenous variations of workers’ effort, in a simple model with efficiency wages, near a locally indeterminate steady state. A current endogenous countercyclical uncertainty shock makes risk averse workers more willing to provide imperfectly monitored “precautionary effort” by increasing their expected utility gain of not shirking. If workers’ relative prudence is small and decreasing fast near the steady state, firms’ efficiency wage contracts generate significant endogenous procyclical variations of effort, employment and labor productivity, in particular when the capital-efficient labor elasticity of substitution is smaller than and close to 1.
E00|Pledgeability, Industry Liquidity, and Financing Cycles|Why are downturns following high valuations of firms long and severe? Why do firms choose high debt when they anticipate high valuations, and underperform subsequently? We propose a theory of financing cycles where the importance of creditors’ control rights over cash flows (“pledgeability”) varies with industry liquidity. Firms take on more debt when they anticipate higher future industry liquidity. However, both high anticipated liquidity and the resulting high debt limit their incentives to enhance pledgeability. This has prolonged adverse effects in a downturn. Higher anticipated liquidity can, in fact, reduce a firm’s current access to finance.
E00|Narrative Economics|"This address considers the epidemiology of narratives relevant to economic fluctuations. The human brain has always been highly tuned toward narratives, whether factual or not, to justify ongoing actions, even such basic actions as spending and investing. Stories motivate and connect activities to deeply felt values and needs. Narratives ""go viral"" and spread far, even worldwide, with economic impact. The 1920-1921 Depression, the Great Depression of the 1930s, the so-called Great Recession of 2007-2009, and the contentious political-economic situation of today are considered as the results of the popular narratives of their respective times. Though these narratives are deeply human phenomena that are difficult to study in a scientific manner, quantitative analysis may help us gain a better understanding of these epidemics in the future."
E00|Austerity in the Aftermath of the Great Recession|We examine austerity in advanced economies since the Great Recession. Austerity shocks are reductions in government purchases that exceed reduced-form forecasts. Austerity shocks are statistically associated with lower real GDP, lower inflation and higher net exports. We estimate a cross-sectional multiplier of roughly 2. A multi-country DSGE model calibrated to 29 advanced economies generates a multiplier consistent with the data. Counterfactuals suggest that eliminating austerity would have substantially reduced output losses in Europe. Austerity shocks were sufficiently contractionary that debt-to-GDP ratios in some European countries increased as a consequence of endogenous reductions in GDP and tax revenue.
E00|What Information Drives Asset Prices?|The market price-dividend ratio is highly correlated with several macroeconomic variables, particularly inflation and labor market variables, but not with aggregate consumption and GDP. We incorporate this observation in an exchange economy with learning about the economic regime from consumption history and a latent signal. The estimated model rationalizes the moments of consumption and dividend growth, market return, price-dividend ratio, and real and nominal term structures and the low predictive power of the price-dividend ratio for consumption and dividend growth while a nested model with learning from consumption history alone does not. The intuition is that the beliefs process has high persistence and low variance because beliefs depend on the signal. The model fit remains largely intact when we replace the latent signal with a combination of macroeconomic variables that heavily loads on inflation and labor market variables. The results highlight the informational role of macroeconomic variables and suggest that just one combination of macroeconomic variables, along with consumption, proxies well for investors’ relevant information set.
E00|Income and Wealth Distribution in Macroeconomics: A Continuous-Time Approach|We recast the Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett model of income and wealth distribution in continuous time. This workhorse model – as well as heterogeneous agent models more generally – then boils down to a system of partial differential equations, a fact we take advantage of to make two types of contributions. First, a number of new theoretical results: (i) an analytic characterization of the consumption and saving behavior of the poor, particularly their marginal propensities to consume; (ii) a closed-form solution for the wealth distribution in a special case with two income types; (iii) a proof that there is a unique stationary equilibrium if the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is weakly greater than one; (iv) characterization of “soft” borrowing constraints. Second, we develop a simple, efficient and portable algorithm for numerically solving for equilibria in a wide class of heterogeneous agent models, including – but not limited to – the Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett model.
E00|Uncertainty Shocks as Second-Moment News Shocks|This paper provides new empirical evidence on the relationship between aggregate uncertainty and the macroeconomy. We identify uncertainty shocks using methods from the literature on news shocks, following the observation that second-moment news is a shock to uncertainty. According to a wide range of VAR specifications, shocks to uncertainty have no significant effect on the economy, even though shocks to realized stock market volatility are contractionary. In other words, realized volatility, rather than uncertainty about the future, is associated with contractions. Furthermore, investors have historically paid large premia to hedge shocks to realized volatility, but the premia associated with shocks to uncertainty have not been statistically different from zero. We argue that these facts are consistent with the predictions of a simple model in which aggregate technology shocks are negatively skewed. So volatility matters, but it is the realization of volatility, rather than uncertainty about the future, that seems to be associated with declines.
E00|Analysis of Revisions in Indian GDP Data|This paper studies constant price growth estimates of Indiaâ€™s annual GDP data in order to understand the revision policy adopted by the Central Statistics Office. The use of high-frequency indicators to prepare initial estimates overstates the growth of the economy, although at the aggregate level the difference between initial estimates and final revisions is low. At the sectoral level the extent of revision for almost all sectors is large and the magnitude and direction of the revision is unpredictable. The Central Statistical Office must address issues in data quality and revisions by (i) adopting a comprehensive revision policy, (ii) supplying information and data on high frequency indicators and (iii) adopting revision metrics to assess the quality of estimates.
E00|Local Independence, Monotonicity, Incentive Compatibility and Axiomatic Characterization of Price-Money Message Mechanism|To characterize money in a static economic model, it is known to be important to consider the agentcommodity double-infinity settings, i.e., the overlapping-generations framework. There does not seem to exist abundant literature, however, treating the axiomatic characterization problems for such monetary Walras allocations under the social choice and/or mechanism design settings. We show that the monetary Walras allocation for the economy with double infinities is characterized by weak Paretooptimality, individual rationality and local independence or the monotonicity, or the incentive compatibility conditions of social choice correspondence among the allocation mechanisms with messages under the category theoretic approach in Sonnenschein (1974). We utilize Sonnenschein fs market extension axiom for swamped economies that is closely related to the replica stability axiom of Thomson (1988). We can see how these conditions characterize the price-money message mechanism universally among a wide class of mechanisms, and efficiently in the sense that it has the minimal message spaces (pricemoney dictionary theorems). Moreover, by using the category theoretic framework, we can obtain the up-to-isomorphism uniqueness for such a dictionary object (isomorphism theorems).
E00|Optimal Equilibrium State in Two-Sector Growth Model|The paper studies a two-sector growth model for two cases: with flexible technology and with fixed coefficients. Different states of economic equilibrium (steady states) are compared. We find that the price of investment goods with respect to the price of consumer goods should be changed if the equilibrium state has shifted. Therefore, the aggregate production function cannot be considered as a purely technical. We assume that the income distribution is determined by the direct proportionality between the profits and the investment. Then the resulting function of aggregate output is continuous and differentiable in the domain of definition, even if the technology is fixed. In the last case the function has diminishing returns of capital under Uzawa capital-intensity condition; the state of economic equilibrium is stable only when this condition is valid. We suggest that the optimal is an equilibrium state that maximizes the total profit. The model with fixed coefficients predicts the possible existence of such an optimum.
E00|Investment in capital markets|Investment in Capital Markets creates a strategic vision on the financial capital investment in the capital markets with the aim to get an increased return premium in the short and long time periods. The book is written with a main goal to explain the pros and cons of the financial capital investment in the capital markets, discussing the sophisticated investment concepts and techniques in the simple understandable readable general format language. We would like to highlight the three interesting facts about the book: 1. It is centered on the consideration of the modern investment products, the investment vehicles and the investment mediums for the financial capital investment in the capital markets; 2. It is focused on the financial risk calculation and mitigation techniques for the financial capital investment in the financial capital markets. 3. It is aimed to describe the quantum winning virtuous investment strategies creation and execution techniques during the financial capital investment in the capital markets. The investors, financiers, economists, financial analysts, financial traders, financial advisers, lawmakers, policy analysts, subject experts, professors, and students will certainly enjoy a breathtaking splendid learning journey with the explained new ideas, established concepts and outlined future prospects toward the financial capital investment in the capital markets with the aim to get an increased return premium in the short and long time periods.
E00|Инвестирование Денежных Средств В Условиях Экономического Кризиса В 2017 Году|In the conditions of the economic crisis, one of the most urgent aspects is the investment of funds. The choice of the most optimal directions for investing is rather complicated, since there are many alternative options. The purpose of this study is to determine the most profitable directions for investing money in 2017.
E00|Monitoring Performance of Maybank Berhad in the Presence of Risk|The main purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between risk and performance of commercial bank in Malaysia. This study aims to investigate the impact of bank-specific factors which include liquidity risk, operational risk, and credit risk (microeconomic factors) and gross domestic product (GDP) and inflation rate (macroeconomic factors) on the performance of Malaysian commercial bank over the period of 2011 to 2015. The bank performance is measured by Return on Assets (ROA). The results imply that ratios employed in this study have different effects on the performance of bank. In this study, the findings show that only GDP has positive relationship with ROA. Four factors namely liquidity risk, operational risk, credit risk, and inflation rate have negative relationship with the ROA.
E00|How Does Monetary Policy Affect Economic Vulnerability to Oil Price Shock as against US Economy Shock?|This paper investigates the role of the monetary policy in protecting the economy against the external shocks of US output and oil price during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. It also considers economic vulnerability caused by these external shocks after the crisis abated. The application of the structural vector auto regression model using monthly data from 2002:M1 to 2013:M4 for Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand shows that poor influence of monetary policies on monetary policy transmission channels (namely, interest rate, exchange rate, domestic credit, and stock price) in the pre-crisis period could not shield these economies from shocks of oil price and US output. The results of post-crisis period indicate a significant increase in the positive impact of monetary policy on channels of monetary transmission channels compared to the pre-crisis period. However, these economies continue to remain vulnerable to oil price shocks.
E00|A Path Integral Approach to Interacting Economic Systems with Multiple Heterogeneous Agents|This paper presents an analytical treatment of economic systems with an arbitrary number of agents that keeps track of the systems' interactions and agent's complexity. The formalism does not seek to aggregate agents: it rather replaces the standard optimization approach by a probabilistic description of the agents' behaviors and of the whole system. This is done in two distinct steps. A first step considers an interacting system involving an arbitrary number of agents, where each agent's utility function is subject to unpredictable shocks. In such a setting, individual optimization problems need not be resolved. Each agent is described by a time-dependent probability distribution centered around its utility optimum. The whole system of agents is thus defined by a composite probability depending on time, agents' interactions, relations of strategic dominations, agents' information sets and expectations. This setting allows for heterogeneous agents with different utility functions, strategic domination relations, heterogeneity of information, etc. This dynamic system is described by a path integral formalism in an abstract space – the space of the agents' actions –and is very similar to a statistical physics or quantum mechanics system. We show that this description, applied to the space of agents' actions, reduces to the usual optimization results in simple cases. Compared to the standard optimization, such a description markedly eases the treatment of a system with a small number of agents. It becomes however useless for a large number of agents. In a second step therefore, we show that, for a large number of agents, the previous description is equivalent to a more compact description in terms of field theory. This yields an analytical, although approximate, treatment of the system. This field theory does not model an aggregation of microeconomic systems in the usual sense, but rather describes an environment of a large number of interacting agents. From this description, various phases or equilibria may be retrieved, as well as the individual agents' behaviors, along with their interaction with the environment. This environment does not necessarily have a unique or stable equilibrium and allows to reconstruct aggregate quantities without reducing the system to mere relations between aggregates. For illustrative purposes, this paper studies several economic models with a large number of agents, some presenting various phases. These are models of consumer/producer agents facing binding constraints , business cycle models, and psycho-economic models of interacting and possibly strategic agents.
E00|Threshold Modeling for Inflation and GDP Growth|The study has evaluated the relationship between the inflation rate and GDP growth of Pakistan using the annual data of inflation rate and GDP growth since 1972 to 2016 for Pakistan. The paper has used the different techniques like; OLS, FMOLS, TAR and dummy method threshold model, to estimate the true relationship between the concerned variables based on the previous studies those gives mixed results. The study has concluded the positive relationship between the inflation rate and economic growth of Pakistan at 5.5% to 9% threshold level of inflation and confirmed the nonlinear relationship between them. And low and double figure inflation rate are considered to have adverse effect on the economic growth of the Pakistan. So to stimulate the stable economic growth of Pakistan we need to have medium rate of inflation.
E00|Shale and the US Economy: Three Counterfactuals|I use three different—and simple—counterfactuals to approximate the real GDP and employment effects of US oil and gas production from shale over the 2011 to 2015 period. Real GDP growth would have been 0.7 to 0.2 percentage points lower on average each year over that period without such increases; employment growth 0.5 to 0.1 percentage points lower.
E00|Internal and External Factors Explaining Chilean Economic Activity|The objective of this paper is to find which factors were the most important to explain the contraction of the economic activity in Chile during the last three years. The results show that: (1) the fall in the rate of growth of the economy is explained by external factors, like the end of the mining boom; (2) the subsequent and persistently low growth rates are explained by a combination of internal and external factors, where the internal factors were the most important.
E00|The impact of global uncertainty on the global economy, and large developed and developing economies|Global uncertainty shocks are associated with a sharp decline in global inflation, global growth and in the global interest rate. Over 1981 to 2014 global financial uncertainty forecasts 18.26% and 14.95% of the variation in global growth and global inflation respectively. Global uncertainty shocks have more protracted, statistically significant and substantial effects on global growth, inflation and interest rate than U.S. uncertainty shocks. U.S. uncertainty lags global uncertainty by one month. When controlling for domestic uncertainty, the decline in output following a rise in global uncertainty is statistically significant in each country, with the exception of the decline for China. The effects for the U.S. and for China are also relatively small. For most economies, a positive shock to global uncertainty has a depressing effect on prices and official interest rates. Exceptions are Brazil, Mexico and Russia, economies with large capital outflows during financial crises. Decomposition of global uncertainty shocks shows that global financial uncertainty shocks are more important than non-financial shocks.
E00|Do Workers’ Remittances Increase Terrorism? Evidence from South Asian Countries|This study investigates the influence of workers’ remittances on terrorism in 5 South Asian countries. The panel data comprised of 20 years from the period of 1994 to 2013 is used. The advanced econometric techniques i.e, CIPS unit root test, bootstrap cointegration, Pedroni co-integration, FMOLS, fixed effect model and heterogeneous panel causality technique have been applied. The results suggest that the workers’ remittances have a significant positive impact on the terrorism in South Asian countries. The results also indicate that the control variables, i.e., Inflation, unemployment, and population size also have a significant positive relationship with terrorism. The result of causality shows that unidirectional causality exists of remittance, population, and inflation with unemployment, however, bidirectional causality exists between unemployment and terrorism.The sample size is restricted to South Asian countries only so the result cannot be generalized to other countries. This study will help the policymakers of the region, to make necessary amendments in law so that remittance amount does not be accessible to the group to use in terrorist activities. On a larger perspective, only two studies have been carried out that examines the relationship between terrorism and remittance. One study is conducted in the sub-Saharan region by Elu and Price (2011), and the other one is conducted on panel data by Mascarenhas and Sandler (2014). No study to the best of our knowledge has been done in the South Asian context, so this study is conducted to analyze the impact of workers’ remittance on terrorism in South Asian countries.
E00|Threshold Modeling for Inflation and GDP Growth|The study has evaluated the relationship between the inflation rate and GDP growth of Pakistan using the annual data of inflation rate and GDP growth since 1972 to 2016 for Pakistan. The paper has used the different techniques like; OLS, FMOLS, TAR and dummy method threshold model, to estimate the true relationship between the concerned variables based on the previous studies those gives mixed results. The study has concluded the positive relationship between the inflation rate and economic growth of Pakistan at 5.5% to 9% threshold level of inflation and confirmed the nonlinear relationship between them. And low and double figure inflation rate are considered to have adverse effect on the economic growth of the Pakistan. So to stimulate the stable economic growth of Pakistan we need to have medium rate of inflation.
E00|Uncertainty Shocks as Second-Moment News Shocks|We provide evidence on the relationship between aggregate uncertainty and the macroeconomy. Identifying uncertainty shocks using methods from the news shocks literature, the analysis finds that innovations in realized stock market volatility are robustly followed by contractions, while shocks to forward-looking uncertainty have no significant effect on the economy. Moreover, investors have historically paid large premia to hedge shocks to realized but not implied volatility. A model in which fundamental shocks are skewed left can match those facts. Aggregate volatility matters, but it is the realization of volatility, rather than uncertainty about the future, that has been associated with declines.
E00|The Relationship Between Of Tax Competition And Tax Haven In The World And Turkey|The country, where the individuals and institutions benefit from public services paying less taxes outside the country, is called tax haven countries.These countries is used as part of economic activities and they are preferred as the center of financial affairs so the phenomenon of interstate competition become a current issue. International tax competition is a tax policy which implementing that economic activity that occurred in another country to take his own country putting a lower tax rate.When taken out the country known as a tax haven it is said that this countries are too small and some of them? name and location in the map are unknown.The purpose of the study is to find out the relationship between of tax competition and tax haven in the World and Turkey. In this direction, firstly on the conceptual framework tax competition and tax havens issues will be discussed. Secondly, the effects of the relationship between tax competition and tax havens on fiscal policy will be examined. Finally, studies conducted on the fight against tax competition and tax havens in the World and Turkey will be examined.
E00|A Test of Two Open-Economy Theories: Oil Price Rise and the Netherlands|Two major open-economy theories are the Keynesian and Monetarist theories. The goal of the study is to empirically discriminate between the two theories. Keynesian and monetarist views about the homeostatic mechanism are fundamentally different and provide a basis for constructing discriminatory empirical tests. The Keynesian theory holds that there is no, or only a very weak, homeostatic mechanism and, in the absence of government intervention, real income tends to remain below the level of full employment. In the monetary interpretation, the homeostatic mechanism is strong, and real income can be treated as though it were exogenous. This study examines the response of the Netherlands to the sharp increase in oil prices in late 1973. The experience of the Netherlands, as an oil-importing country, supports the Keynesian view.
E00|Inspecting the Mechanism: Leverage and the Great Recession in the Eurozone|We provide a comprehensive account of the dynamics of eurozone countries from 2000 to 2012. We analyze private leverage, fiscal policy, labor costs, and spreads, and we propose a model and an identification strategy to separate the impact of credit cycles, excessive government spending, and sudden stops. We then ask how periphery countries would have fared with different policies. We find that countries could have stabilized their employment if they had followed more conservative fiscal policies during the boom. Macroprudential policies and an early intervention by the central bank to prevent market segmentation and reduce fiscal austerity would also have significantly reduced the recession.
E00|Agent-Based Macroeconomics and Classical Political Economy: Some Italian Roots|Abstract In this work, we discuss how the rich academic milieu left by different Italian political economy traditions after WWII paved the way for the development of a new generation of macroeconomic agent-based models. The K + S (Dosi et al. in J Econ Dyn Control 34:1748–1767, 2010; Dosi et al. in J Evol Econ. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00191-016-0466-4 , 2016a), CATS (Delli Gatti et al. in J Econ Behav Organ 56:489–512, 2005; Delli Gatti et al. in Macroeconomics from the bottom-up. Springer, Berlin, 2011) and EURACE (Cincotti et al. in Econ Open Access Open Assess E J 4, 2010; Teglio et al. in Adv Complex Syst 15:1–27, 2012) families of agent-based models are at the frontier of an alternative macroeconomic research paradigm, which considers the economy as a complex evolving system. The three families of models are presented in detail and their empirical performance and policy exercises discussed.
E00|Croissance potentielle : la politique économique au royaume des aveugles ?|La crise a révélé les insuffisances graves de la théorie macroéconomique dominante et des conceptions de politique macroéconomique qu'elle inspire. Le cadre analytique dans lequel raisonnent la plupart des macroéconomistes, celui qui guide les institutions nationales, européennes et internationales dans leurs orientations, est intrinsèquement inapte à rendre compte des évolutions structurelles d'une économie financiarisée et en profonde mutation. Les concepts-clés qui en sont les fondements induisent des choix d'indicateurs fournissant des signaux erronés. Les grandeurs macroéconomiques standards sur lesquelles se fondent les politiques économiques se sont vidées de leur sens, mais constituent néanmoins toujours les piliers des diagnostics. Refonder la macroéconomie est une urgence ; mais les ébauches actuellement offertes ne sont pas à la hauteur des défis. POTENTIAL GROWTH: ECONOMIC POLICY IN THE KINGDOM OF THE BLIND The 2009 crisis has shed a crude light on the deep shortcomings of standard macroeconomic theory and of its representation of the workings of macroeconomic policy. The analytical framework in which most macroeconomists reason, the one that guides national, European, and international institutions' orientations, is intrinsically unable to deliver insights on the structural evolutions of economies that are massively intertwined with finance and in perpetual technological change. The key concepts on which this framework is built lead to the choice of indicators that generate misleading signals. Standard macroeconomic aggregates guiding economic policies have been losing their meaning, but continue to be relied upon when forming a diagnosis on national economies. Rebuilding macroeconomic theory on new foundations is urgent; but the avenues that are being explored currently are far from providing adequate answers.
E00|Public Debt and Growth : An Assessment of Key Findings on Causality and Thresholds|We provide a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between public debt and GDP growth in the postwar advanced economies. We use the timing of changes in public debt and growth to account for endogeneity, and find little evidence of a negative relationship. Semi-parametric estimates do not indicate any threshold effects. Finally, we reconcile our results with four recent, influential papers that found a substantial negative relationship, especially when public debt exceeds 90 percent of GDP. These earlier results appear to derive mostly from peculiar parametric specifications of nonlinearities, or use of small samples which amplify the influence of outliers.
E00|Aktuelle Entwicklungen und Trends in den Regionen Mittelost-/Südosteuropas und des Donauraums|Zusammenfassung Aktuelle Entwicklungen und Trends in den Regionen Mittelost-/Südosteuropas und des Donauraums Die Studie analysiert aktuelle Entwicklungen und Trends in den Ländern Zentral- und Osteuropas sowie Süd- und Südosteuropas und deren Implikationen für die österreichische Regionalpolitik. Das Ziel der Studie ist, einen Beitrag zur Evaluierung der gegenwärtigen Regionalpolitik innerhalb Österreichs wie auch der EU zu leisten. Dafür untersucht die Studie überblicksmäßig folgende Punkte a) aktuelle wirtschaftliche Trends in Österreich und den Ländern des Donauraums (inklusive Polen), b) die Verknüpfung Österreichs mit diesen Ländern hinsichtlich Außenhandel, Investitionen, Arbeitsmärkte, Transport und Tourismus und c) die österreichische Regionalpolitik im nationalen sowie im europäischen Kontext. Auf Basis der Analyseergebnisse ergeben sich Rückschlüsse und Empfehlungen für die Entwicklung von Politikinitiativen in Österreich und der EU. English Summary Current developments and trends in the regions of Central, East and Southeast Europe and the Danube region The study analyses recent trends and developments in the Central and East European (CEE) and Southeast European (SEE) countries and the implication for Austrian regional policy. The aim of the study is to contribute to the evaluation of current Austrian and European regional policy instruments as well as to the Austrian preparation of the post-2020 EU Cohesion policy. In an overview, the study analyses a) the main (economic) trends in Austria and the CEE/SEE countries; b) their trade, investment, labour market, transport and tourism relationships; and c) Austrian regional policy in the national and European context. The results of the analysis allow drawing conclusions and recommendations for developing policy initiatives in Austria and the EU.
E00|Clustering Macroeconomic Time Series|There is growing literature in macroeconomics, especially on business cycle synchronization, employing different methods of time series clustering. However, even as an unsupervised learning method, this technique requires making choices that are nontrivially influenced by the nature of the data involved. By extensively testing various possibilities, we arrive at a choice of a dissimilarity measure (compression-based dissimilarity measure, or CDM) which is particularly suitable for clustering macroeconomic variables. We check that the results are stable in time and consistent with the literature on core-periphery pattern of European business cycles. We also successfully apply our findings to the analysis of national economies, specifically to identifying their structural relations. To our knowledge, it is the first comprehensive analysis of the usefulness of the different dissimilarity measures for the macroeconomic research.
E00|Secular Stagnation: What the Debate is about?|In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the recovery in economic activity has been weak and much of the academic and policy discussions seek to explain this sluggish growth. This literature review presents how the secular stagnation hypothesis re-emerged in 2013 and evolved over time. It identifies its key tenets, its most contentious points and its most important critiques. Secular stagnation has different interpretations, which complicates the debate, and the objective of this paper is to clarify the demarcation lines between various theories and to show how some of them amalgamated over time. The secular stagnation hypothesis links weak growth to a decline in natural interest rates. Most observers agree that natural interest rates have indeed declined over the past decade and may be in negative territory. However, there are diverging views about the factors which led to negative interest rates and how lasting their impact is likely to be. The secular stagnation hypothesis points to various fundamental factors and suggests a long-term effect, while the global savings glut and debt super-cycle concepts assume only a temporary impact and anticipate that global economic growth and real interest rates will eventually rebound.
E00|April 2017 Annual Reassessment of Potential Output Growth in Canada|This note summarizes the Bank of Canada’s annual reassessment of potential output growth, conducted for the April 2017 Monetary Policy Report. Potential output growth is projected to increase from 1.3 per cent in 2017 to 1.6 per cent by 2020. The lower estimate for potential output growth in the near term (relative to the 2016 assessment) largely reflects distinctly weak business investment over 2015 and 2016, as well as reallocation costs associated with the adjustment to lower oil prices. However, potential output growth improves throughout the projection as investment is expected to pick up, with an increasing share in productivity-enhancing machinery and equipment. Population aging will act as a drag on potential output growth, with a small offset coming from higher levels of immigration. An analysis of alternative scenarios suggests a range of potential output growth from ±0.3 percentage points in 2017 to ±0.5 percentage points in 2020.
E00|Crowding out in a Dual Currency Regime? Digital versus Fiat Currency|In this paper, we analyse a dual currency regime with fiat currency and digital currency and investigate potential crowding-out effects of fiat currency or digital currency under the framework of the traditional monetary economic model. We find that crowding out only occurs under extreme assumptions, i.e. extremely high costs associated with the use (medium of exchange and store of value) of one currency and extremely low costs associated with the use of the other currency.
E00|The True Cost of BREXIT for the UK: A Research Note|The HM Treasury analysis (2016) of the long-term benefits of EU membership for the UK implicitly argues that the associated output loss of BREXIT is 10%, while Patrick Minford has argued that a 4% output increase could be expected. More recent analysis from Rabobank suggests an output loss of 18 % for the UK in the event of a ‘no-deal’ BREXIT. The subsequent rough estimate presented here shows that real national income is likely to fall by 16% in a no-deal BREXIT – where a 2% income gain from a possible US-UK transatlantic trade and investment partnership treaty and 1% gain resulting from zero tariffs on the import of agricultural products have been included. The cumulated income loss – based on a present value-analysis – is almost three times as large as the UK output decline during the Great Depression; however, the BREXIT-related output decline would be spread over a period of about 15 years. For the lower strata of society serious problems will emerge in such a setting; it is strange that the Remainers in the UK have almost no voice in terms of political party representation. As regards power in Brussels: based on Banzhaf values (game theory), the big countries in the EU will be the winners of BREXIT; even if Scotland joins later.
E00|The BREXIT Dynamics: British and EU27 Challenges after the EU Referendum|Summary: The BREXIT dynamics are considerable in a politico-economic perspective. The British referendum of June 23rd, 2016, was a disorderly one as the Cameron government did not include key information in the official government brochure sent to all households across the UK – a study by the Treasury had shown a 10 percent income decline as a consequence of a potential BREXIT, but in the 16-page information brochure distributed to all households/the electorate, this prognosis was not mentioned at all. EU immigration issues played a role not only under Cameron but also under the May government and in the UK government’s White Paper on exiting the EU, respectively. Key issues of BREXIT are related to the potential political instability in the EU. As regards the Global Britain approach of the May government, it is shown here that this is unlikely to work. EU27 reforms are quite important, without adequate reforms and much better leadership in Germany and other EU countries, there will be further disintegration in the EU.
E00|Is something really wrong with macroeconomics?|Many critiques of the state of macroeconomics are off target. Current macroeconomic research is not mindless DSGE modelling filled with ridiculous assumptions and oblivious of data. Rather, young macroeconomists are doing vibrant, varied, and exciting work, getting jobs, and being published. Macroeconomics informs economic policy only moderately, and not more than nor differently from other fields in economics. Monetary policy has benefitted significantly from this advice in keeping inflation under control and preventing a new Great Depression. Macroeconomic forecasts perform poorly in absolute terms and, given the size of the challenge, probably always will. But relative to the level of aggregation, the time horizon, and the amount of funding, macroeconomic forecasts are not so obviously worse than those in other fields. What is most wrong with macroeconomics today is perhaps that there is too little discussion of which models to teach and too little investment in graduate-level textbooks.
E00|Analyzing Structural Reforms Using a Behavioral Macroeconomic Model|We use a behavioral macroeconomic model to analyze how structural reforms affect the economy in the short and in the long run. We consider two types of structural reforms. The first one increases the flexibility of wages and prices; the second one raises potential output in the economy. We find that structural reforms that increase the flexibility of wages and prices can have profound effects on the dynamics of the business cycle. In addition, a structural reform program that raises potential output has a stronger long-term effect on output and tends to reduce the price level more in a flexible than in a rigid economy. Finally, we analyze how structural reforms change the tradeoffs between output and inflation variability. Our main finding here is that there is an optimal level of flexibility (produced by structural reforms).
E00|When Inequality Matters for Macro and Macro Matters for Inequality|We develop an efficient and easy to use computational method for solving a wide class of general equilibrium heterogeneous agent models with aggregate shocks together with an open source suite of codes that implement our algorithms in an easy to use toolbox. Our method extends standard linearization techniques and is designed to work in cases when inequality matters for the dynamics of macroeconomic aggregates. We present two applications that analyze a two asset incomplete markets model parameterized to match the distribution of income, wealth, and marginal propensities to consume. First, we show that our model is consistent with two key features of aggregate consumption dynamics that are difficult to match with representative agent models: (1) the sensitivity of aggregate consumption to predictable changes in aggregate income, and (2) the relative smoothness of aggregate consumption. Second, we extend the model to feature capital-skill complementarity and show how factor-specific productivity shocks shape dynamics of income and consumption inequality.

E00|Friedman's Presidential Address in the Evolution of Macroeconomic Thought|"Milton Friedman's presidential address, ""The Role of Monetary Policy,"" which was delivered 50 years ago in December 1967 and published in the March 1968 issue of the American Economic Review, is unusual in the outsized role it has played. What explains the huge influence of this work, merely 17 pages in length? One factor is that Friedman addresses an important topic. Another is that it is written in simple, clear prose, making it an ideal addition to the reading lists of many courses. But what distinguishes Friedman's address is that it invites readers to reorient their thinking in a fundamental way. It was an invitation that, after hearing the arguments, many readers chose to accept. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to view Friedman's 1967 AEA presidential address as marking a turning point in the history of macroeconomic research. Our goal here is to assess this contribution, with the benefit of a half-century of hindsight. We discuss where macroeconomics was before the address, what insights Friedman offered, where researchers and central bankers stand today on these issues, and (most speculatively) where we may be heading in the future."
E00|Israel’s Triumph over Inflation: The Long and Winding Road|The paper gives an economic-history perspective of the long struggle with inflation. It covers the early acceleration to three-digit levels, lasting 8 years; The stabilization program, based on political backing triggered sharp fall in inflationary expectation, and consequently to sharp inflation reduction to two-digit levels; The convergence to the advanced countries’ levels during the “great Moderation”; and Israel’s resistance to the deflation-depression forces that the 2008 crisis created. The emphasis is on the forces of globalization and the building of institutions, political, regulatory, financial, budget design, and monetary, which helped stabilize prices and output.
E00|How to Cope with Volatile Commodity Export Prices: Four Proposals|Countries where exports are relatively concentrated in oil, gas, minerals and agricultural commodities experience terms of trade that are highly volatile. This volatility is one of the possible explanations for the famous Natural Resource Curse.1 The aim in this keynote address is to offer four policy proposals to help countries manage commodity volatility and thereby help make sure that commodity wealth is a blessing rather than a curse. Two of the ideas fall in the area of microeconomic policy: specific financial contracts structured so as to hedge risk. Two of the ideas fall in the area of macroeconomic policy institutions: ways to make fiscal and monetary policy counter-cyclical rather than pro-cyclical.2 It is always hard to make policy proposals that are convincing and at the same time are original. I will try to strike a balance between being convincing and being original. Of the four ideas, two are tried and tested. Two have not been tried much. The question then becomes: why not? Let us first pause to ask: Don’t commodity-exporters already use financial markets to smooth trade fluctuations? If international financial markets worked well, countries facing temporary adverse trade shocks could borrow to finance current account deficits, and vice versa. But they don’t work that well. Capital flows to developing countries tend, if anything, to be pro-cyclical. The appropriate theory usually builds on the assumption that borrowing requires collateral, in the form of commodity export proceeds. The important point for policy-makers is that some careful thought is required to design institutions that can protect against the volatility. Many other policies and institutions for dealing with commodity volatility have been proposed and tried in various countries, some successful, some much less so. Many of the ideas that tend to work poorly can be described as seeking to suppress price volatility rather than manage it. I see them as akin to King Canute commanding the tide not to come in. I am thinking, for example, of price controls, commodity marketing boards, and controls on exports. Better to accept fluctuations in demand and supply as a fact of life, and to devise policies and institutions to equip the economy to cope with them. 1 Brueckner and Carneiro (2016), Blattman, Hwang, and Williamson (2007), Hausmann and Rigobon (2003), Mendoza (1997) and Poelhekke and van der Ploeg (2007). Terms of trade volatility hurts growth in the presence of investment irreversibilities and credit constraints (Aghion, Angeletos, Banerjee & Manova, 2010). Frankel (2012a) surveys the Natural Resource Curse. 2 E.g., Kaminsky, Reinhart and Végh {2005).
E00|Dynamic directed random matching|We develop a general and unified model in which a continuum of agents conduct directed random searches for counterparties. Our results provide the first probabilistic foundation for static and dynamic models of directed search (including the matching-function approach) that are common in search-based models of financial markets, monetary theory, and labor economics. The agents' types are shown to be independent discrete-time Markov processes that incorporate the effects of random mutation, random matching with match-induced type changes, and with the potential for enduring partnerships that may have randomly timed break-ups. The multi-period cross-sectional distribution of types is shown to be deterministic and is calculated using the exact law of large numbers.
E00|Does urbanization cause increasing energy demand in Pakistan? Empirical evidence from STIRPAT model|This paper reinvestigates the relationship between urbanization and energy consumption in case of Pakistan for the period of 1972Q1-2011Q4 by employing the STIRPAT (Stochastic Impact by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology) model. We have employed the ARDL bounds testing approach to cointegration in the presence of structural breaks stemming in the series to count for these missing elements in other studies. Finally, the VECM Granger causality approach has been applied to examine the causal relationship between the variables. Our results show that urbanization adds in energy consumption. Affluence (economic growth) increases energy demand. Technology has positive impact on energy consumption. An increase in transportation is positively linked with energy consumption. The causality analysis indicates the unidirectional causality running from urbanization to energy consumption.
E00|Quantitative wave model of macro-finance|This paper presents macro-finance as ensemble of economic agents and suggests use risk ratings of economic agents as their coordinates on economic space. Financial variables of separate economic agents are defined as functions of time and coordinates on economic space. Aggregations of financial variables of separate economic agents with coordinates near point x on economic space define macro-financial variables as function of x. Hydrodynamic-like equations describe evolution and mutual dependence between macro-financial variables. As example, for simple model of mutual dependence between macro-financial Demand on Investment and Interest Rate we derive hydrodynamic-like equations in a closed form. Perturbations of macro financial variables can generate waves those propagate on economic space and we derive wave equations. Macro financial waves can propagate on economic space with exponential growth of amplitudes and cause time fluctuations of finance variables that may model financial and business cycles. Variety of macro financial waves on economic space gives new look on internal dynamics of macro finance and reveals hidden complexity of macro financial modeling and forecasting.
E00|Banks, market organization, and macroeconomic performance: An agent-based computational analysis|This paper is an exploratory analysis of the role that banks play in supporting what Jevons called the “mechanism of exchange.” It considers a model economy in which exchange activities are facilitated and coordinated by a self-organizing network of entrepreneurial trading firms. Collectively, these firms play the part of the Walrasian auctioneer, matching buyers with sellers and helping the economy to reach prices at which peoples’ trading plans are mutually compatible. Banks affect macroeconomic performance in this economy because their lending activities facilitate the entry and influence the exit decisions of trading firms. Both entry and exit have ambiguous effects on performance, and we resort to computational analysis to understand how they are resolved. Our analysis draws an important distinction between normal and worst-case scenarios, with the economy experiencing systemic breakdowns in the latter. We show that banks can provide a “financial stabilizer” that more than counteracts the familiar financial accelerator, and that the stabilizing role of the banking system is particularly apparent in worst-case scenarios. In line with this result, we also find that under less restrictive lending standards banks are able to more effectively improve macroeconomic performance in the worst-case scenarios.
E00|Measuring uncertainty in the stock market|We propose a daily index of time-varying stock market uncertainty. The index is constructed after first removing the common variations in the series, based on recent advances in the literature that emphasize the difference between risk (expected variation) and uncertainty (unexpected variation). To this end, we draw on data from 25 portfolios sorted by size and book-to-market value. This strategy considerably reduces information requirements and modeling design costs, compared to previous proposals. We also compare our index with indicators of macro-uncertainty and estimate the impact of an uncertainty shock on the dynamics of macroeconomic variables.
E00|The contributions of warfare with revolutionary and Napoleonic France to the consolidation and progress of the British industrial revolution: revised version of working paper 150|This revised and reconfigured essay surveys a range of printed secondary sources going back to publications of the day (as well as includes research in primary sources) in order to revive a traditional and unresolved debate on economic connexions between the French and Industrial Revolutions. It argues that the costs flowing from the reallocation of labour, capital and technical knowledge to wage warfare from 1793-1815 have been overstated in relation to a range of benefits that accrued from: crowding out a potential invasion by Napoleon’s armies; improvements to the skills and discipline of the workforce; the integration of Ireland into a national market; the accelerated diffusion of technologies associated with coal and iron; the circumvention of diminishing returns to agriculture and above all from a victory that provided the economy with a more efficient State, Navy and Merchant Marine that, for a century, retained most of the gains from trade and servicing the international economy obtained at the expense of rivals during these long wars with France. My conclusion is that the costs and benefits (derived from participation in a global war from 1793 to 1815, that was integral to the era’s geopolitical and mercantilist international economic order) cannot be measured. But in the context and history of that order it is difficult to represent their outcome as anything other than positive and significant for the consolidation and progress of Britain’s famous transition to become Europe’s First Industrial Nation.
E00|Bhaduriâ€“Marglin meet Kaldorâ€“Marx: wages, productivity and investment|Higher real wages provide macroeconomic benefits in terms of increased demand if the economy is wage-led (as in most European economies) and of higher labour productivity growth and more rapid technological progress. Taking these benefits into account, we show that a wage-led economy becomes less strongly wage-led. The impact of higher real wage growth on employment growth becomes ambiguous. But for model parameter values which are realistic for the wage-led eurozone, higher real wages reduce employment growth. Contrariwise, real wage restraint in a weakly wage-led economy generates jobs â€“ as recent European experience underscores. This internal contradiction in wage-led economies can be overcome if a high wage regime is complemented by supportive fiscal and monetary policies.
E00|Common Factors, Trends, and Cycles in Large Datasets|This paper considers a non-stationary dynamic factor model for large datasets to disentangle long-run from short-run co-movements. We first propose a new Quasi Maximum Likelihood estimator of the model based on the Kalman Smoother and the Expectation Maximisation algorithm. The asymptotic properties of the estimator are discussed. Then, we show how to separate trends and cycles in the factors by mean of eigenanalysis of the estimated non-stationary factors. Finally, we employ our methodology on a panel of US quarterly macroeconomic indicators to estimate aggregate real output, or Gross Domestic Output, and the output gap.
E00|Réduire les divergences en zone euro en régulant les cycles financiers|La zone euro souffre de divergences économiques et financières entre ses membres. La politique monétaire ne peut pas y remédier, puisqu’elle est unique, donc calibrée et menée pour la moyenne de la zone. Elle peut même les accroître en agissant seule, sans autre levier de politique économique pour la compléter. Cela rend urgent un nouveau policy mix en zone euro, qui prenne en compte le fait que la zone est hétérogène et soumise à des cycles financiers peu synchrones. Rechercher la stabilité économique par la stabilité financière est possible dans le cadre de la politique macroprudentielle, dont l’action contracyclique peut-être calibrée par pays, tout en étant coordonnée au niveau de la zone par une institution déjà en place, le Conseil européen du risque systémique. La zone euro se trouverait ainsi dotée de l’instrument d’ajustement macro-conjoncturel qui lui fait tant défaut depuis ses débuts.
E00|A Path Integral Approach to Interacting Economic Systems with Multiple Heterogeneous Agents|This paper presents an analytical treatment of economic systems with an arbitrary number of agents that keeps track of the systems’ interactions and complexity. The formalism does not seek to aggregate agents: it rather replaces the standard optimization approach by a probabilistic description of the agent’s behavior. This is done in two distinct steps. A first step considers an interaction system involving an arbitrary number of agents, where each agent's utility function is subject to unpredictable shocks. In such a setting, individual optimization problems need not be resolved. Each agent is described by a time-dependent probability distribution centered around its utility optimum. The whole system of agents is thus defined by a composite probability depending on time, agents' interactions, relations of strategic dominations, agents' information sets and expectations. This setting allows for heterogeneous agents with different utility functions, strategic domination relations, heterogeneity of information, etc. This dynamic system is described by a path integral formalism in an abstract space -- the space of the agents' actions -- and is very similar to a statistical physics or quantum mechanics system. We show that this description, applied to the space of agents' actions, reduces to the usual optimization results in simple cases. Compared to the standard optimization, such a description markedly eases the treatment of a system with a small number of agents. It becomes however useless for a large number of agents. In a second step therefore, we show that, for a large number of agents, the previous description is equivalent to a more compact description in terms of field theory. This yields an analytical, although approximate, treatment of the system. This field theory does not model an aggregation of microeconomic systems in the usual sense, but rather describes an environment of a large number of interacting agents. From this description, various phases or equilibria may be retrieved, as well as the individual agents’ behaviors, along with their interaction with the environment. This environment does not necessarily have a unique or stable equilibrium and allows to reconstruct aggregate quantities without reducing the system to mere relations between aggregates. For illustrative purposes, this paper studies several economic models with a large number of agents, some presenting various phases. These are models of consumer/producer agents facing binding constraints, business cycle models, and psycho-economic models of interacting and possibly strategic agents.
E00|Mobile Phone Penetration, Mobile Banking and Inclusive Development in Africa|The study assesses the role of mobile phones and mobile banking in decreasing inequality in 52 African countries. The empirical procedure involves first, examining the income-redistributive effect of mobile phone penetration and then investigating the contribution of mobile banking services in this relationship. The findings suggest an equalizing income-redistributive effect of ‘mobile phone penetration’ and ‘mobile banking’, with a higher income-equalizing effect from mobile banking compared to mobile phone penetration. Poverty alleviation channels explaining this difference in inequality mitigating propensity are discussed.
E00|O Agronegócio Em Minas Gerais: Evolução Do Produto Interno Bruto Entre 2004 E 2015| This study presents an analysis of agribusiness Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. It was evaluated agribusiness GDP data between 2004 and 2015, considering the segments and components of production chains that make up the agribusiness of the state. It aims to highlight evidence of significant changes in the productive structure of the agribusiness in the period, highlighting the sector’s growth model and the main factors associated with its performance. It was found a strong relation between agribusiness and the total GDP of this state, and also the growing importance of agro-industrial segments in front of the primary production. It was emphasized the continued high share in front of traditional supply chains such as those related to coffee and milk that were modernized in recent decades and have remained competitive.
E00|Brief Discussion On Sustainable Tourism|"""Sustainability"" means property of a system, where the emphasis is on maintaining a particular state of the system in time (Vidrascu, 2015). Developing sustainable tourism is not just a concept discussed, supplemented or restated in conferences held on the subject, but imposes the need to protect natural resources, social and cultural rights which form the common heritage of mankind and meeting the needs and requirements of tourists and the local population, which led to the existence of associated forms of sustainable tourism.Objectives, principles, requirements of sustainable tourism development are common forms of tourism such as ecotourism and sustainable tourism. Through its practical forms, sustainable tourism development, reconcile conflicting interests and objectives, and encourages partnership and increased the number of intra-makers, operators and consumers. At the same time, it promotes the general interests of long-term disfavoring particular interest immediately.Indicators supporting sustainable tourism and tourism planning and monitoring processes are also important communication tools."
E00|Aspects of the impact of interest rate development on the probability of default|The acceptance of banking risks and their control is one of the key moments in banking activity. Success in banking management is possible only if the risks accepted by banks are reasonable, can be controlled and do not exceed the financial resources and their expertise. The occurrence of the interest rate risk is due to the holding a portfolio of assets and liabilities with fixed interest, different in terms of maturities and price and in terms of ownership of assets and liabilities with variable interest that adapts differently to interest rate fluctuations. The estimation of the probability of default is the first step to determine and assess risk. The major issues in the estimation of PD are generated by the limitation of the required information. This work captures the impact of interest rate on the PD at maturity of loans. The analysis covers the period January 2013 - December 2015 using data on interest rates in the interbank market, the type of loans granted and the number of people that recored outstanding loans.
E00|Pension Capital Investment in the Context of a Private Pension Fund|An analysis of the pension legislation has been performed, particularly in the field of restrictions on asset allocation into various funds, and a model for real investment profile has been proposed that secures minimal risk at the given profitability and satisfies legal requirements, as well as immunizes the sub-portfolio of risk-free securities from changes in the market interest rate. The numerical experiment has been carried out with and without regard to transaction expenses. It has been estimated that frequent renegotiation of the portfolio leads to a decrease in profits from investing as a result of transaction expenses.
E00|Did The Danube Delta Pensions Managed To Overcome The Economic Crisis?|In the knowledge economy and competitiveness, economic and financial analysis of a company in every industry generally, the hospitality industry in particular, is an indispensable tool, which aims radiography entire business of the company, to diagnose strengths and weaknesses but also identify opportunities and threats coming from the market.One of the most important indicators measuring the economic performance of a company is turnover. This indicator enables research dimension, held in place within the industry, market position, economic entity's ability to initiate effective and efficient. Thus, the turnover reflects the degree of health of the company. In this paper we analysed in terms of economic and financial representative guesthouse in the Danube Delta to see the actual situation of tourism in the area. The main purpose was to see if the pensions of Delta managed to overcome the economic crisis global and national.
E00|Romania’S Economy In Its Current Functionality|This paper is part of the specialists’ engagement to help deepen economic knowledge and empower people in their double function: that of shareholders and direct beneficiaries of the optimal functioning of the economy. We consider the undeniable reality that the economy is always a complex human activity, organically framed in our society. The research was conducted on the basis of four defining coordinates: understanding the economic phenomena as permanent social phenomena; the gradual tension between the limited economic resources and the unlimited human needs; the complex functioning mechanism of the economy; matching Romania’s economy functioning with the demands of the European integrated economic model. The conclusions of this paper can be used for elaborating and implementing various policies to improve the Romanians’ quality of life in the context of international integration.

E00|The impact of earthquakes on economic activity: evidence from Italy|Abstract Although earthquakes are large idiosyncratic shocks for affected regions, little is known of their impact on economic activity. Seismic events are rare, the data are crude (the Richter scale measures the magnitude, but says nothing of the associated damages), and counterfactuals are often entirely absent. Using a geophysical methodology devised to gauge seismic damages (the so-called Mercalli scale), we study the evolution of output and employment following seismic events in 95 Italian provinces from 1986 to 2011 for a total of 22 earthquakes. Our identification strategy relies on ideal counterfactuals: ex ante identical neighboring provinces that only differ ex post in terms of damages. We show that following an earthquake, the observed contraction of output and employment is generally small or even negligible. In some cases, the net effect on output and employment can be positive because the stimulus from the reconstruction activities more than compensate for the destruction of physical capital. Finally, we show that the effects on economic activity are nonpersistent, do not spill over from the epicentral region to the neighbors, and tend to be reabsorbed within 2 years from the event.
E00|Wealth and Income Inequalities ← → r > g|Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century posits the return r on capital to be larger than the economic growth rate g as a main driver of inequalities. This article points out the circumstances under which the reverse inference holds. We show that increasing inequality promotes increasing gap r-g, and vice-versa, because capital is a cumulative quantity that claims a finite fraction of the total output in the presence of fractional consumption of the return on capital. However economies do exist for which large inequalities tend to curb r-g, thus proving that r > g does not always lead to an endless inequality spiral.
E00|Unemployment Rate And The Internal Migration In Romania|This article analyzes the influence of the internal population migration phenomenon on unemployment in Romania. During the analyzed period, the years between 1991 and 2015, Romania has gone through important economic and social changes and the long-time economic crisis generated a high unemployment rate involving reduced chances of re-employing the unemployed. At the same time the internal migration rate from urban to urban area, respectively from urban to rural area shows the fact that in Romania the population living in cities is influenced by the professional status and they take risks easier than the ones that come from rural area. The conducted research has a high degree of novelty as it refers to internal migration that, besides the external one, may generate economic unbalances and this is the reason why we take into consideration that these analyzed aspects and tendencies be known and taken into consideration especially by the decision factors at socioeconomic level.
E00|Shifting Frontiers in Global Resource Wealth: The Role of Policies and Institutions|This paper explores the impact of increased market orientation and improved institutions on global resource wealth using a novel dataset of major hydrocarbon and mineral discoveries. Guided by the predictions of a two-region model, we employ an instrumental variable strategy to test whether increased market orientation boosts discoveries. Our results indicate that if Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa were to adopt the same quality of institutions as the United States, discoveries worldwide would increase by 25 percent. Our results support the primacy of institutions by calling into question the commonly held view that resource endowments are exogenous.
E00|Endogenous Procyclicality of Labor Productivity, Employment, Real Wages and Effort in Conditionally Heteroskedastic Sunspots Unemployment Business Cycles with Negishi-Solow Efficiency Wages|"This work introduces a new mechanism that is able to generate procyclical comovements of aggregate labor productivity, employment and real wages, through endogenous variations of workers' effort, in a simple model involving structural unemployment, efficiency wages, financial market imperfections and expectations driven conditionally heteroskedastic sunspots business cycles, near a locally indeterminate steady state. Owing to imperfect effort monitoring, workers' effort level equates their disutility of effort to their expected utility gain of not shirking, in terms of their earned real income, and of the resulting anticipated random consumption. A positive current (consumption) sunspot shock generates a countercyclical uncertainty shock, i.e. a drecrease of the anticipated sunspot volatility, and makes risk averse workers more willing to provide ""precautionary effort"" by increasing their expected utility gain of not shirking. If workers' relative prudence is small and decreasing fast near the steady state, profit maximizing firms' choice of efficiency wage contracts generates significant endogenous procyclical variations of effort and employment, in particular when the capital-efficient labor elasticity of substitution is smaller than 1."
E00|Push, Pull, and Population Size Effects in Structural Development: Long-run Trade-offs|The process of structural transformation from the farm to a nonfarm sector is accompanied by technological change in both sectors and massive population growth. We investigate the effects of increasing population size (the population effect) and sector-specific productivity (the push and pull effects), both factor-neutral and factor-biased, in a parsimonious general equilibrium model under general forms of utility and production functions. All three effects may co-exist and interact in important ways. Generalizing the agricultural sector production function to CES is crucial for the population growth effect. Our analysis highlights how the relative importance of the three effects changes as the country develops and production and consumption conditions become more flexible.
E00|How Inflation Affects Macroeconomic Performance: An Agent-Based Computational Investigation|We use an agent-based computational approach to show how inflation can worsen macroeconomic performance by disrupting the mechanism of exchange in a decentralized market economy. We find that, in our model economy, increasing the trend rate of inflation above 3 percent has a substantial deleterious effect, but lowering it below 3 percent has no significant macroeconomic consequences. Our finding remains qualitatively robust to changes in parameter values and to modifications to our model that partly address the Lucas critique. Finally, we contribute a novel explanation for why cross-country regressions may fail to detect a significant negative effect of trend inflation on output even when such an effect exists in reality.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
E00|The BEAR toolbox|The Bayesian Estimation, Analysis and Regression toolbox (BEAR) is a comprehensive (Bayesian) (Panel) VAR toolbox for forecasting and policy analysis. BEAR is a MATLAB based toolbox which is easy for non-technical users to understand, augment and adapt. In particular, BEAR includes a user-friendly graphical interface which allows the tool to be used by country desk economists. Furthermore, BEAR is well documented, both within the code as well as including a detailed theoretical and user's guide. BEAR includes state-of-the art applications such as sign and magnitude restrictions, conditional forecasts, Bayesian forecast evaluation measures, Bayesian Panel VAR using different prior distributions (for example hierarchical priors), etc. BEAR is specifically developed for transparently supplying a tool for state-of-the-art research and is planned to be further developed to always be at the frontier of economic research.

E00|The Linkages between Household Consumption and Household Debt Composition in Malaysia|This study intends to examine the relationship between household consumption and household debt composition in Malaysia. Specifically, this study employs the Toda-Yamamoto non-causality test since it is sui table for variables with different levels of integration. Results obtained in this study suggest that the direction of causality runs from consumption to debt. Moreover, the result of the cointegration test also supports that long run relationship exists between the two variables. It also supports the Life Cycle Model, which predicts that a household has been borrowing in order to finance their consumption and expenses. Therefore, this result indirectly suggests that the household has been depending on debt to finance their consumption and thus any negative shocks that occur in the economy can causes serious consequences on the economic performance of the country. Hence, any attempts by policymakers to control the mounting debt level should be focusing on restricting the supply of loans.
E00|Modelling the Determinants of Malaysian Household Debt|This paper explores the determinants of household debt composition in Malaysia. By utilizing the bound test and autoregressive distributed lag modelling approach, findings of this study reveals that in the long run period, a change in income level, housing price and population would have a positive impact on mortgage debt while rise in interest rates and cost of living would exert a negative influence. In addition, findings of this study supported that the household uses the debt as a substitute for income to finance the rising consumption because of a higher living cost. Findings of this study could provide some guidance to policymakers in controlling the mounting debt level and help in realizing the nation economic goals.
E00|China and the evolution of the world economy|China's rapid growth and its growth model have accelerated important existing structural trends in the world economy and made them decisive characteristics of the global economy. In particular, China has ensured that this will be the era of the global market economy; the super-industrial economy; the post-industrial economy; the ecologically constrained economy; the complex economy; the highly globalized economy; the innovation economy; an economy with a new moral consciousness about the global supply chain; and an economy with an emerging new monetary system.
E00|The stability of macroeconomic systems with Bayesian learners|We study abstract macroeconomic systems in which expectations play an important role. Consistent with the recent literature on recursive learning and expectations, we replace the agents in the economy with econometricians. Unlike the recursive learning literature, however, the econometricians in the analysis here are Bayesian learners. We are interested in the extent to which expectational stability remains the key concept in the Bayesian environment. We isolate conditions under which versions of expectational stability conditions govern the stability of these systems just as in the standard case of recursive learning. We conclude that Bayesian learning schemes, while they are more sophisticated, do not alter the essential expectational stability findings in the literature.
E00|Absence of safe assets and fiscal crisis|This paper develops a fiscal crisis model that explains a mechanism under which low interest rates can coexist with Japan's large outstanding debt. The key idea is that when there is a strong home bias in the asset portfolio of domestic bondholders, these investors turn out to have no access to any assets that hedge fiscal risk. This explains why domestic investors do not request a risk premium on government bonds. In this environment, the interest rate and the default probability are low, and the government can sustain its large debt even under adverse fiscal conditions. As the interest rate does not rise fully to reflect the risk premium, the low interest rate is not always a signal of sound fiscal conditions. The welfare implications of financial market reform are mixed. This reform can improve welfare so long as the government can sustain the debt, but at the same time, it makes it difficult to sustain the debt because the interest rate rises. Quantitative easing is effective in lowering the risk premium.
E00|Policies to overcome stagnation: the crisis, and the possible futures, of all things euro|This article argues that the Europe's continuing economic underperformance, particularly in the eurozone, is neither a function of insufficient information (policymakers do not know the right policies) nor ideology (policymakers are unable to recognize the right policies due to ideological priors). Rather, this article places the continuation of policies that cause stagnation in a longer historical context. Building upon the insights of Kalecki (1943) regarding the political limits of full employment policies, it is argued that the shift from a regime that generated inflation, low profitability, and a high degree of equality to one that generates deflation, high profitability, and inequality has hamstrung the ability of policymakers to respond positively to the situation at hand. This has generated structural pressures for political realignment across cases that compound the economic problems of stagnation while exacerbating tensions between different European â€˜Varieties of Capitalism.â€™ The result is a set of â€˜second-bestâ€™ strategies that lead to second-best outcomes in both politics and economics that further stress the already stressed economies and polities of Europe.
E00|Estimating nutrition-income elasticities in sub-Saharan Africa: implications on health|Purpose - – The purpose of this paper is to examine how the intakes of calories, proteins, and fats vary with income in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Design/methodology/approach - – Annual time series data for 43 countries covering 1975-2009 that yields a balanced panel was employed for analysis. Nutrient-income elasticities are estimated based on the aggregate Engel Curve framework, using a feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) technique that is robust to autocorrelation. Findings - – The estimated nutrient-income elasticities are small: a 10 percent increase in income will lead, respectively, to rises of about 0.73, 0.87, and 0.90 percent in calories, proteins, and fats intake; showing that policies that are aimed at eliminating malnutrition through only the growth of per capita income will have positive but limited impacts. The estimated aggregate Engel Curve and the non-parametric plots show that at higher income levels the relationship between income and nutrient intake is non-linear and diminished, suggesting a low likelihood for the manifestation of an obesity epidemic in SSA. Originality/value - – This is the very study that attempts to look at the nutrition-income elasticities at cross-country level in SSA.
E00|Oil price, exchange rate and the Indian macro economy|The general discussions on the Indian macro economy have centered on two things in the recent past: how will the economy be impacted by falling value (depreciation) of rupee and the effects of falling world oil prices. However the exact impact of a depreciation of rupee or fall in oil prices on different macroeconomic variables of the Indian economy is still open to debates. The paper investigates the dynamic relationship between movements in oil prices and exchange rates with macroeconomic variables like price, output, interest rate and money by using structural vector auto regression (SVAR) approach. Additionally, a comparative analysis is done to show how each of these structural shocks historically has affected price, output and exchange rate. The results are in favor of a strong link among these variables. Three results have important policy implications: first, the world price of oil has a great potential to impact India's output. Second, targeting depreciation of Indian rupee to expand output may not be an effective policy tool for the RBI. Third, variation in rupee's value can have medium to long term impact on world price of oil that the world should care about.
E00|RBC Methodology and the Development of Aggregate Economic Theory|This essay reviews the development of neoclassical growth theory, a unified theory of aggregate economic phenomena that was first used to study business cycles and aggregate labor supply. Subsequently, the theory has been used to understand asset pricing, growth miracles and disasters, monetary economics, capital accounts, aggregate public finance, economic development, and foreign direct investment.
E00|Dynamic Factor Models, Cointegration and Error Correction Mechanisms|The paper studies Non-Stationary Dynamic Factor Models such that: (1) the factors Ft are I(1) and singular, i.e. Ft has dimension r and is driven by a q-dimensional white noise, the common shocks, with q < r, and (2) the idiosyncratic components are I(1). We show that Ft is driven by r-c permanent shocks, where c is the cointegration rank of Ft, and q - (r - c) < c transitory shocks, thus the same result as in the non-singular case for the permanent shocks but not for the transitory shocks. Our main result is obtained by combining the classic Granger Representation Theorem with recent results by Anderson and Deistler on singular stochastic vectors: if (1 - L)Ft is singular and has rational spectral density then, for generic values of the parameters, Ft has an autoregressive representation with a finite-degree matrix polynomial fulfilling the restrictions of a Vector Error Correction Mechanism with c error terms. This result is the basis for consistent estimation of Non-Stationary Dynamic Factor Models. The relationship between cointegration of the factors and cointegration of the observable variables is also discussed.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
E00|Non-Stationary Dynamic Factor Models for Large Datasets|We study a Large-Dimensional Non-Stationary Dynamic Factor Model where (1) the factors Ft are I (1) and singular, that is Ft has dimension r and is driven by q dynamic shocks with q less than r, (2) the idiosyncratic components are either I (0) or I (1). Under these assumption the factors Ft are cointegrated and modeled by a singular Error Correction Model. We provide conditions for consistent estimation, as both the cross-sectional size n, and the time dimension T, go to infinity, of the factors, the loadings, the shocks, the ECM coefficients and therefore the Impulse Response Functions. Finally, the numerical properties of our estimator are explored by means of a MonteCarlo exercise and of a real-data application, in which we study the effects of monetary policy and supply shocks on the US economy.
E00|Forward Guidance and Macroeconomic Outcomes since the Financial Crisis|"This chapter studies the effects of FOMC forward guidance. We begin by using high-frequency identification and direct measures of FOMC private information to show that puzzling responses of private-sector forecasts to movements in federal funds futures rates on FOMC announcement days can be attributed entirely to Delphic forward guidance. However, a large fraction of futures rates' variability on announcement days remains unexplained, leaving open the possibility that the FOMC has successfully communicated Odyssean guidance. We then examine whether the FOMC used Odyssean guidance to improve macroeconomic outcomes since the financial crisis. To this end we usean estimated medium-scale New Keynesian model to perform a counterfactual experiment for the period 2009:Q1-2014:Q4, in which we assume the FOMC did not employ any Odyssean guidance and instead followed its reaction function from before the crisis as closely as possible while respecting the effective lower bound. We find that a purely rule-based policy would have delivered a shallower recession and kept inflation closer to target in the years immediately following the crisis than FOMC forward guidance did in practice. However, starting toward the end of 2011, after the Fed's introduction of ""calendar-based"" communications, the FOMC's Odyssean guidance appears to have boosted real activity and moved inflation closer to target. We show that our results do not reflect Del Negro, Giannoni, and Patterson's (2015) forward-guidance puzzle."

E00|Fiat Value in the Theory of Value|We explore monetary policy in a world without currency. In our world, money is a form of government debt that bears interest, which can be negative as well as positive. Services of money are a factor of production. We show that the national accounts must be revised in this world. Using our baseline economy, we determine the balanced growth paths for a set of money interest rate target policy regimes. Besides this interest rate, the only policy variable that differs across regimes is either the labor income tax rate or the inflation rate. We find that Friedman monetary satiation without deflation is possible. We also examine a set of inflation rate targeting regimes. Here, the only other policy variable that differs across policy regimes is the tax rate. There is a sequence of markets with outcome in each market being a Debreu valuation equilibrium, which determines the vector of assets and liabilities households take into the subsequent period. Evaluating a policy regime is an advanced exercise in public finance. Monetary satiation is not optimal even though money is costless to produce.
E00|Should the Neoclassical growth model include the saving flow in the Utility function?|Despite ‘joy of giving models’ have been extensively examined in the literature, the Ramsey growth model has never been explored under the assumption of a direct preference for bequeathing savings that are reinvested. This assumption implies a Utility function depending on both consumption and savings, which may also be motivated as one that captures a direct preference for thriftiness or wealth accumulation arguably involved. The resulting growth model generalizes those accounting for the capitalist spirit as Zou (1994), and shows that the restrictive standard one is perhaps not the actual optimized version of the Solow model. (JEL O41, E21, D91)
E00|What are production, work and consumption? Trans-historical re-conceptualisations|This paper argues for trans-historical reformulations of the basic economic concepts of production, work and consumption. The definition of the production boundary by System of National Accounts (SNA) is inconsistent from a scientific point of view. For example, while some non-market and illegal services are viewed as productive, others are not, and services and goods are treated differently. The definition proposed by feminist economics, the so-called third person criterion, is consistent, but in need for further development; furthermore, it is a definition of work and not of production. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether it is possible to formulate a non-eclectic set of logically consistent definitions that could be considered variations of a common underlying understanding across various theoretical traditions – mainly Classical, Neoclassical, Institutional, Marxist, Feminist and Keynesian Economics – of how humans consciously change external nature in order satisfy human needs. Important issues concern how to deal with violence, double counting of transaction costs, human capital formation, non-market activities and causation of final consumption. Production, work and consumption are defined as relations between events, the subject matter and the agent, and in the main definitions reduced to non-economic sentences. Even the utility concept is avoided. First-order logic is used, complemented with modal operators for some of the sentences. In this study, it is shown that production, work and consumption all share the common feature of intentional physical transformation of the intrinsic properties of the subject matter. The object transformed during the productive activity and work must at some point in time be external to the agent. For work, the purpose of transforming an external object must not lie in the transformation of the agent. A productive activity must potentially be able to cause the satisfaction of human needs, or final consumption, which is not a condition for work or required by the third-person criterion. Final consumption involves the transformation of the subject matter that is a final purpose for the consumer or serves as a purpose for transforming the consumer. Using a criterion applied by the institutional economist Cheung to identify transaction costs, this study defines social reproduction as an activity that would not occur in a Robinson Crusoe economy. Social reproduction occurs under an institutional setting. We can further differentiate between coercive and non-coercive social reproduction. In this study, eight different definitions of production are presented. The definition of agent external production is close to the third person criterion, but the possible causation of future final consumption is included as a condition for a productive activity. It is also related to the basic neoclassical model with its assumptions of no transaction costs. The definition of agent external non-coercive production entails that transformations of persons against their own will, whether legally or illegally performed, are unproductive activities. The definition of agent external non-social production entails that all socially reproductive activities are unproductive, and comes close to the distinction made by Classical and Marxist economists of productive and unproductive work. Humanity external production only includes the transformation of non-persons. The three definitions of time scale invariant production entails that human capital formation could be considered productive activities. Market production comes close to Keynesian theory and the present definition of SNA, with the difference that it excludes non-market goods production. The present study also opens for the possibility of unproductive work, for example failed production or professional murder, and productive final consumption that does not involve any work, for example hobby-hunting, play with children or research activity for own pleasure. Which definition of production is applied greatly affects the modelling and empirical application of growth theory and the analysis of the driving forces in economic history. For example, assume trade causes labour productivity outside of trade to increase four-fold due to specialisation, while the share of GDP in total working time increases from nil to half. With the same value added per productive hour and with total hours worked kept constant, the value added of agent external production then records a four-fold increase, while that of non-social production only a doubling. Similarly, during wars the SNA GDP often increases substantially, while the concept of agent external non-coercive production entails that all war expenses are treated as unproductive. Time frame invariant production grows faster than agent external production during expansions of the education system. Market production could serve important analytical purposes, for example to investigate the relation between money supply and inflation, but should be rid of inconsistencies such as the inclusion of non-market goods production.

E00|Deriving the new quantity equation: an approach for a closed and an open economy|Abstract This theoretical contribution shows a simple way in which the quantity equation can be derived as a long-term equilibrium solution for the case of a closed economy and an open economy, respectively. It is shown first for the case of a closed economy which parameters stand behind “velocity” and that indeed there are arguments why velocity should be constant over time – assuming a specific parameter set of the goods market. It is noteworthy that the quantity equation can be derived both in a demand-side context and in a long run supply-side approach. Moreover, a new derivation is presented for the case of an open economy and it is shown that trade as well as foreign direct investment should be expected to have an influence on the price level and the inflation rate, respectively. Finally, the analysis suggests that financial market activities should have an impact on the price level. I gratefully acknowledge technical support by Murat Ismail and David Hanrahan. Moreover I appreciate discussions with Jens Perret (Schumpeter School of Business and Economics) and Thomas Gries, University of Paderborn. The usual disclaimer applies.
E00|Mises and the moderns on the inessentiality of money in equilibrium|The challenge of rendering monetary exchange intelligible within a Walrasian general equilibrium framework is well known. Perhaps less well known is the difficulty of integrating monetary and exchange economies in decentralized conceptions of equilibrium, of which the evenly rotating economy of Ludwig von Mises (1949) is an early example. After reviewing the prospect for money in the evenly rotating economy, I survey the modern literature on frictions that make money useful for exchange. While exploring techniques commonly used to generate a useful role for money in this environment, I make a distinction between exchange frictions and epistemic frictions. Although theoretical efforts have largely focused on exchange frictions, recent experimental evidence suggests that epistemic frictions warrant further attention. I conclude that Mises should be seen as a pioneer in this literature, though recent advances demonstrate that the set of frictions capable of rendering money useful is much larger than he envisioned.

E00|The effect of obesity, alcohol misuse and smoking on employment and hours worked: evidence from the Icelandic economic collapse|Abstract In this study the relationship between obesity, alcohol misuse, smoking and changes in quantity of labor supplied during an economic meltdown are examined. The data used stem from a health and lifestyle panel survey carried out by the Public Health Institute of Iceland in 2007 and 2009. Probit analysis was used to assess if pre-crisis body weight, alcohol misuse or smoking were related to subsequent job-loss or a reduction in hours worked following the 2008 economic collapse in Iceland. Results indicated that body weight, alcohol misuse and smoking are related to reductions in quantity of labor supplied for females only. Female body mass index was positively related to the probability of a reduction in quantity of labor supplied, while alcohol misuse and smoking were negatively related to the probability of decreasing hours worked for females.
E00|Endogenous Procyclicality of Labor Productivity, Employment, Real Wages and Effort in Conditionally Heteroskedastic Sunspots Unemployment Business Cycles with Negishi-Solow Efficiency Wages|This work introduces a new mechanism that is able to generate procyclical comovements of aggregate labor productivity, employment and real wages, through endogenous variations of workers’ effort, in a simple model involving structural unemployment, efficiency wages, financial market imperfections and expectations driven conditionally heteroskedastic sunspots business cycles, near a locally indeterminate steady state. Owing to imperfect effort monitoring, workers’ effort level equates their disutility of effort to their expected utility gain of not shirking, in terms of their earned real income, and of the resulting anticipated random consumption. A positive current (consumption) sunspot shock generates a countercyclical uncertainty shock, i.e. a drecrease of the anticipated sunspot volatility, and makes risk averse workers more willing to provide ”precautionary effort” by increasing their expected utility gain of not shirking. If workers’ relative prudence is small and decreasing fast near the steady state, profit maximizing firms’ choice of efficiency wage contracts generates significant endogenous procyclical variations of effort and employment, in particular when the capital-efficient labor elasticity of substitution is smaller than 1.
E00|The Third International Conference in Economics EconWorld 2016|These are conference notes of the Third International Conference in Economics (EconWorld 2016-Barcelona). Information on the topics, impressions about the sessions and general remarks about the conference are included in this note. It was a successful academic event with broad international participation. The variety of the studies and the dynamic discussion periods were quite refreshing during the conference. Furthermore, the conference was a good occasion to get in touch with colleagues from other countries and to be reminded of several issues of economics in a compact way since conferences usually are limited to 2-3 days. Needless to say, it was a well-organized and satisfactory academic event.

E00|A Unified Theory of Monetary Dynamics|In the end, the only and eternal vocation of money is circulation. This circulation causes the contrary effect to income expansion, studied by the income velocity of circulation of money, by the income multiplier and by the bank money multiplier. These three issues are thought to belong to the same operation. Therefore, a unified money theory can be established.A dynamic economy finances investments with the savings existing in the system but, the economy is simultaneously growing in real and nominal terms. Such growth in circulating capital is only possible through the creation of money in the economic system. In general terms, the system tends to finance growth with the spontaneous creation of money. Classification JEL : E00.
E00|Property prices and the real sector: comovements in European markets|The paper establishes stylised facts about residential and commercial property prices focusing on 12 European markets over the sample 1984-2013. Using the measure of dynamic correlation and cohesion we look at the medium and long-term dynamics in the real estate markets. We investigate how do comovements within real estate cycles relate to comovements within cycles of real activity variables over time.
E00|The New Keynesian Transmission Mechanism: A Heterogenous-Agent Perspective|We argue that a 2-agent version of the standard New Keynesian model - where a 'worker' receives only labor income and a'capitalist' only profit ncome - offers insights about how income inequality affects the monetary transmission mechanism. Under rigid prices, monetary policy affects the distribution of consumption, but it has no effect on output as workers choose not to change their hours worked in response to wage movements. In the corresponding representativeagent model, in contrast, hours do rise after a monetary policy loosening due to a wealth effect on labor supply: profits fall, thus reducing the representative worker's income. If wages are rigid too, however, the monetary transmission mechanism is active and resembles that in the corresponding representative-agent model. Here, workers are not on their labor supply curve and hence respond passively to demand, and profits are procyclical.
E00|Macro-Finance|Macro-finance addresses the link between asset prices and economic fluctuations. Many models reflect the same rough idea: the market’s ability to bear risk is greater in good times, and less in bad times. Models achieve this similar result by quite different mechanisms. I contrast their strengths and weaknesses. I highlight directions for future research, including additional facts to be matched, and limitations of the models that should prod future theoretical work. I describe how macro-finance models can fundamentally alter macroeconomics, by putting time-varying risk premiums and risk-bearing capacity at the center of recessions rather than variation in the interest rate and intertemporal substitution.
E00|Accounting for Business Cycles|We elaborate on the business cycle accounting method proposed by Chari et al. (2006), clear up some misconceptions about the method, and then apply it to compare the Great Recession across OECD countries as well as to the recessions of the 1980s in these countries. We have four main findings. First, with the notable exception of the United States, Spain, Ireland, and Iceland, the Great Recession was driven primarily by the efficiency wedge. Second, in the Great Recession, the labor wedge plays a dominant role only in the United States, and the investment wedge plays a dominant role in Spain, Ireland, and Iceland. Third, in the recessions of the 1980s, the labor wedge played a dominant role only in France, the United Kingdom, and Belgium. Finally, overall in the Great Recession, the efficiency wedge played a more important role and the investment wedge played a less important role than they did in the recessions of the 1980s.
E00|Microeconomic Foundations for Macroeconomic Phenomena. A Problem of Ontological (In)Dependence [Fundaţii microeconomice ale fenomenelor macroeconomice. O problemă de (in)dependenţă ontologică]|This essay will outline the case for microfoundations, before presenting the limitations which undermine both the representative-agent model as a means of reduction and the individualist claim that microfoundations are necessary for explanation of economic aggregates. If microfoundations are justifiable in certain contexts, demanding them as a validator of macroeconomics is hardly defendable.
E00|Local Independence, Monotonicity and Axiomatic Characterization of Price-Money Message Mechanism|To characterize money in a static economic model, it is known to be important to consider the agent- commodity double-in nity settings, i.e., the overlapping-generations framework. There does not seem to exist any papers, however, treating the axiomatic characterization problems for such monetary Walras allocations under the social choice and/or mechanism design settings. We show that the monetary Walras allocation for the economy with double in nities is characterized by weak Pareto- optimality, individual rationality, local independence or the monotonicity conditions of social choice correspondence among the allocation mechanisms with messages under the category theoretic approach in Sonnenschein (1974). We utilize Sonnenschein's market extension axiom for swamped economies that is closely related to the replica stability axiom of Thomson (1988). We can see how these conditions characterize the price-money message mechanism universally among a wide class of mechanisms, and efficiently in the sense that it has the minimal message spaces (price-money dictionary theorems). Moreover, by using the category theoretic framework, we can obtain the up-to-isomorphism uniqueness for such a dictionary object (isomorphism theorems).
E00|The Difference GAP â€“ The Main Instrument Used in the Management of Banking Assets and Liabilities|The analysis of the difference GAP is the main instrument used to manage bank assets and liabilities, to administer the net interest from income and to protect it against interest rate risk and to manage cash flow in the short term. The information obtained from the analysis shall be used either to protect the net income from interest compared to the interest rate change by adjusting the sensitive assets / liabilities or to amend by means of the speculative operations the dimension of the difference GAP, while trying to increase the net income from interest. This is done by means of the speculative use of changes in interest rates which implies an interest rate forecast as close as possible to the market.
E00|Explaining the Euro crisis: Current account imbalances, credit booms and economic policy in different economic paradigms|The paper proposes a post-Keynesian analysis of the Eurozone crisis and contrasts interpretations inspired by New Keynesian, New Classical, and Marxist theories. The origin of the crisis is the emergence of a debt-driven and an export-driven growth model, which resulted in a rapid increase in private debt ratios and current account imbalances. The reason the crisis escalated in southern Europe, but not in other parts of the world, lies in the unique dysfunctional economic policy regime of the Euro area. European fiscal rules and the Troika impose fiscal austerity on countries in crisis and the separation of fiscal and monetary spaces has made countries vulnerable to sovereign debt crises and forced them to comply. We analyse the role different paradigms attribute to current account imbalances, fiscal policy and monetary policy. Remarkably, opposing views on the relative importance of cost and demand developments in explaining current account imbalances can be found in both heterodox and orthodox economics. Regarding the assessment of fiscal and monetary policy there is a clearer polarisation, with heterodox analysis regarding austerity as unhelpful and large parts of orthodox economics endorsing it. We conclude that there is a weak mapping between post-Keynesian, New Classical, New Keynesian and Marxist theories and different economic policy strategies for the Euro area, which we label Keynesian New Deal, European Orthodoxy, Moderate Reform and Progressive Exit respectively.
E00|Digital DNA of economy of scale and scope|The research article aims to create a general fundamental theory on the Digital DNA of the modern digital creative economy of the scale and scope. In the frames of our theory, we define the Digital DNA of the modern digital creative economy of the scale and scope, making the following theoretical assumptions: 1) Digital DNA exists in the modern digital creative economy of the scale and scope; 2) Digital DNA consists of a chain of the knowledge with all the information on the modern digital creative economy of the scale and scope; 3) the Digital DNA uniquely identifies and accurately characterizes the modern digital creative economy of the scale and scope in the time, scale, frequency domains; 4) the Digital DNA represents a genetic key, which may help us to better understand the generation of the discrete-time digital business cycles with the different amplitudes, frequencies, shapes and powers in the modern digital creative economy of the scale and scope in the time, scale, frequency domains. In this innovative advanced research, we investigate the following research problems: 1) the existing damaging mechanisms of the Digital DNA’s complex knowledge base structure in the modern digital creative economies of the scales and scopes in the time, scale, frequency domains; 2) the possible repairing mechanisms of the Digital DNA’s complex knowledge base structure in the modern digital creative economies of the scales and scopes in the time, scale, frequency domains; 3) the specific influences by the damaged/repaired Digital DNA on the discrete-time digital business cycles generation/propagation in the modern digital creative economies of the scales and scopes in the time, scale, frequency domains. In addition, the innovative advanced research aims: 1) to perform the computer modeling on the Digital DNA’s complex knowledge base structure in the modern digital creative economy of the scale and scope; 2) to decode the Digital DNA’s complex knowledge base structure in the modern digital creative economy of the scale and scope.
