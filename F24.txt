F24|Enhancing ICT for Quality Education in Sub-Saharan Africa|This research assesses the relevance of information and communication technology (ICT) in primary education quality in a panel of 49 Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) and Instrumental Quantile regressions (IQR). From the 2SLS: (i) mobile phone and internet penetration rates reduce poor quality education and enhancing internet penetration has a net negative effect of greater magnitude. From the IQR: (i) with the exception of the highest quantile for mobile phone penetration and top quantiles for internet penetration, ICT consistently has a negative effect on poor education quality with a non-monotonic pattern. (ii) Net negative effects are exclusively apparent in the median and top quantiles of internet-related regressions. It follows that enhancing internet penetration will benefit countries with above-median levels of poor education quality while enhancing internet penetration is not immediately relevant to reducing poor education quality in countries with below-median levels of poor education quality.
F24|Remittances, finance and industrialisation in Africa|The paper assesses how remittances directly and indirectly affect industrialisation using a panel of 49 African countries for the period 1980–2014. The indirect impact is assessed through financial development channels. The empirical evidence is based on three interactive and non-interactive simultaneity-robust estimation techniques, namely: (i) Instrumental Fixed Effects (FE) to control for the unobserved heterogeneity; (ii) Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) to control for persistence in industrialisation and (iii) Instrumental Quantile Regressions (QR) to account for initial levels of industrialisation. The non-interactive specification elucidates direct effects of remittances on industrialisation whereas interactive specifications explain indirect impacts. The findings broadly show that for certain initial levels of industrialisation, remittances can drive industrialisation through the financial development mechanism. Policy implications are discussed.

F24|Remittances, the Diffusion of Information and Industrialisation in Africa|This study examines the role of information and communication technology (ICT) on remittances for industrialisation in a panel of 49 African countries for the period 1980-2014. The empirical evidence is based on three simultaneity-robust estimation techniques, namely: (i) Instrumental Fixed Effects (FE) in order to control for the unobserved heterogeneity; (ii) Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) to account for persistence in industrialisation; and (iii) Instrumental Quantile Regressions (QR) to control for initial levels of industrialisation. Our best estimators are from FE and QR estimations because the GMM regression outputs largely fail post-estimation diagnostic tests. The following findings are established: (i) There are positive marginal effects from the interaction between remittances and ICT in the FE regressions whereas there are negative marginal impacts from the interaction between remittances and ICT; (ii) Interactions between remittances and mobile phone penetration are positive in the bottom and 90th quantiles whereas the interaction between internet penetration and remittances is positive in the bottom and top quantiles of the industrialisation distribution. Overall, the role of ICT in remittances for industrialisation is much more apparent when existing levels of industrialisation are accounted for. The findings contribute to the debates on the importance of external flows and information infrastructure in economic growth as well as the relevance of remittances in driving economic development in environments where institutions are weak. The value of the study to scholars and policy makers also builds on the fact that the potential for ICT and remittances in Africa can be leveraged to address development challenges on the continent such as the low level of industrialisation.
F24|Thresholds of External Flows for Inclusive Human Development in Sub-Saharan Africa|This research investigates the incidence of enhancing external flows on inclusive human development in a panel of 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. It complements the literature by examining the relevance of enhancing three types of external flows, namely: development assistance, foreign investment and remittances. Ordinary Least Squares, Tobit, Fixed effects, Generalised Method of Moments and Quantile regressions are used as empirical strategies. The following main results are apparent: (i) between 60 and 150 (% of GDP) is the threshold of foreign aid; (ii) 33.333 (% of GDP) is the foreign investment threshold and (iii) 25 (% of GDP) is the critical mass of remittances. At the established critical masses or thresholds, external flows start having positive effects on inclusive human development. Countries characterized by inclusive development levels that are low need more investment in foreign aid for inclusive human development compared to their counterparts characterized by inclusive human development levels that are high.
F24|Do remittances worsen export diversification?|"The paper explores the impact of workers' remittances on the level of export diversification. The hypothesis is that significant inflow of remittances causes overvaluation of real exchange rate, which in turn deteriorates diversity of export. The theoretical base is in line with the Dutch disease phenomenon. The paper uses annual cross-national panel data over 2000-2016 period and System GMM methodology. The evidence suggests that indeed large inflow of remittances is associated with less diversified export. The economic intuition behind is that remittance-caused real exchange rate appreciation unevenly suppresses export of goods: some goods ""suffer"" more than others do. In terms of the number of product-names, a percentage point increase in remittances to GDP sent home ""reduces"" variety of export by approximately five active lines. There are other interesting findings as well. An improvement of government effectiveness facilitates overall export diversification; terms of trade improvement and rise of real exchange rate volatility mostly increase export concentration rather than alter number of exported product-names."
F24|Migración internacional y determinantes de las remesas de trabajadores en Colombia|Esta investigación contribuye a la identificación, caracterización y modelación de los determinantes de las remesas de trabajadores en Colombia. Incluye una descripción de la evolución y características del flujo migratorio de colombianos hacia el exterior y de los receptores de éstas transferencias en el país. El análisis de los determinantes macroeconómicos de las remesas se realiza mediante la estimación de un modelo VEC, el cual considera, además de las remesas, el stock de migrantes colombianos en el exterior y algunos agregados macroeconómicos que permiten aproximar las variables de decisión del migrante para el envío de recursos a su país de origen. Los resultados del modelo muestran que las remesas se ven favorecidas por el desempeño del PIB de los países donde residen los migrantes, así como por el aumento de la emigración de nacionales hacia el exterior. A su vez, permiten concluir que estas transferencias son contracíclicas con respecto al PIB de Colombia. **** ABSTRACT: This paper is a contribution to the process of identifying, characterizing and modeling the determinants of workers' remittances for the case of Colombia. It also includes a description of the evolution of the migratory flow of Colombians abroad and of the remittances recipient’s households. Remittances determinants are explained by using a VEC model that includes, in addition to the remittances inflows, the stock of Colombian migrants abroad and some macroeconomic aggregates that are thought to approximate the variables that influence the migrant's decision to send money to their families. According to the econometric results, Colombian workers remittances inflows are determined by the performance of the GDP of the countries where the migrants live, as well as by the increase in the international emigration of Colombians. In addition, these transfers show a countercyclical behavior against the Colombian GDP.
F24|A Macroprudential Theory of Foreign Reserve Accumulation|This paper proposes a theory of foreign reserves as macroprudential policy. We study an open economy model of financial crises, in which pecuniary externalities lead to overborrowing, and show that by accumulating international reserves, the government can achieve the constrained-efficient allocation. The optimal reserve accumulation policy leans against the wind and significantly reduces the exposure to financial crises. The theory is consistent with the joint dynamics of private and official capital flows, both over time and in the cross section, and can quantitatively account for the recent upward trend in international reserves.

F24|The volatility effect of diaspora's location|Remittances can transmit volatility from host to home countries for some common patterns of diaspora's geographical distribution. In a migration portfolio model, the overall risk of volatility of any set of diaspora location is decomposed into a contagion and a concentration risks: a diaspora located in more volatile destinations induces a higher contagion risk, while a diaspora located in few destination countries increases the concentration risk. A series of estimations on a large panel of developing countries over 1995–2015 provide evidence for these two risks. Estimation of a structural model confirms that the geography of diaspora has an indirect impact on the origin country's aggregate instability through remittances.
F24|Volatility widens inequality. Could aid and remittances help?|Abstract We analyse the relationship between income volatility and inequality and the conditional role played by aid and remittances. Using a panel of 142 countries for the period 1973–2012, we confirm a well-established finding among the literature that income volatility has an adverse impact on inequality, and that the poorest people are the most exposed to these fluctuations. However, while aid and remittances do not seem to have a clear direct impact on inequality, we uncover robust evidence that suggests that aid helps dampen the negative effects of volatility on the distribution of income, while remittances do not.
F24|The macroeconomic effects of migrants' remittances in Moldova: a stockâ€“flow consistent model|Migrants' remittances are an essential source of income in many developing countries. In this article, we build a post-Keynesian stockâ€“flow consistent model adapted to Moldova, one of the top recipients of remittances. In addition to increasing household consumption, migrants' transfers have strong effects on economic growth in Moldova. However, remittances are very sensitive to the economic conditions in migrants' destination countries, especially since the 2008 global financial crisis. After including remittances in consumption behavior and lenders' risk, we run simulations to show how shocks in migrants' destination countries (that is, Europe and Russia) impact the Moldovan economy through fluctuations in remittances. First, the increasing instability of remittances explains a significant portion of the economic volatility experienced by Moldova. Second, the high level of imports implies a weak multiplier effect of remittances, leading to an unsustainable pattern of growth.
F24|Remittances and credit in developed and developing countries: A dynamic panel analysis|This article investigates the impact of remittances on credit in 30 developing (low and middle income) countries and 27 developed (high-income) countries during the period of 2000-2014. This paper differs from existing literature in two ways. First, we distinguish the impact of remittances on credit in both the short run and the long run. Second, we investigate whether remittances influence credit provided to households and credit provided to firms differently, thanks to a new dataset. Our results indicate that (i) remittances have a positive impact on credit in the long run but no impact in the short run; (ii) remittances have a stronger effect on household credit than on firm credit in developing countries; and, (iii) remittances stimulate credit provision through firm credit in developed countries.
F24|Emigration and Alcohol Consumption among Migrant Household Members Staying Behind: Evidence from Kyrgyzstan|Despite the growth of alcohol consumption and international migration in many developing countries, the links between the two remain underexplored. We study the relationship between emigration of household members, receiving remittances (migrant monetary transfers), and alcohol consumption of migrant household members staying behind in Kyrgyzstan, a poor post-socialist country that has recently witnessed both large-scale emigration and a rise in alcohol-related health problems. Using a large longitudinal survey, we find that, among the ethnic majority (Kyrgyz), an increase in migrant remittances is associated with a higher likelihood and frequency of consuming alcohol, as well as an increase in the consumption of beer. Among ethnic Russians, the emigration of family members who do not send remittances back home is associated with an increased likelihood and frequency of alcohol consumption. We discuss possible mechanisms through which emigration and remittances may affect the alcohol consumption of those staying behind, including the relaxation of budget constraints and psychological distress. Overall, our findings suggest that the emigration of household members contribute to a greater alcohol consumption among those staying behind, and highlight the role of remittances and cultural background in understanding the nuances in this relationship.
F24|To Europe or Not to Europe? Migration and Public Support for Joining the European Union in the Western Balkans|For decades, countries aspiring to join the European Union (EU) have been linked to it through migration. Yet little is known about how migration affects individual support for joining the EU in prospective member states. We explore the relationship between migration and support for EU accession in the Western Balkans. Using data from the Gallup Balkan Monitor survey, we find that prospective and return migrants, as well as people with relatives abroad, are more likely to vote favourably in a hypothetical EU referendum. At the same time, only people with relatives abroad are more likely to consider EU membership a good thing. Our results suggest that migration affects attitudes toward joining the EU principally through instrumental/utilitarian motives, with channels related to information and cosmopolitanism playing only a minor role. Overall, our study suggests that migration fosters support for joining a supranational organization in the migrants' countries of origin, which, in turn, is likely to affect political and institutional development of these countries.
F24|Estimating the Determinants of Remittances Originating from U.S. Households using CPS Data|The U.S. is the largest source country of remittances with an outflow of more than $70 billion estimated for 2016 (according to data from the World Bank). This paper is the first to use Current Population Survey (CPS) data to estimate the determinants of remittances originating from the United States for a diverse set of approximately 3,800 households with at least one foreign-born worker. We employ a gravity model examining the role of various push, pull, and distance factors. Most notably, higher household earnings push monetary transfers abroad: We estimate an average earnings elasticity in the range of 0.20-0.30. Remittances are more responsive to earnings in households with more adult women relative to men.
F24|Modeling and forecasting remittances in Bangladesh using the Box-Jenkins ARIMA methodology|This paper uses annual time series data on remittances into Bangladesh from 1976 to 2017, to model and forecast remittances using the Box – Jenkins ARIMA technique. Diagnostic tests indicate that REM is I (2). The study presents the ARIMA (2, 2, 0) model for predicting remittances in Bangladesh. The diagnostic tests further show that the presented parsimonious model is stable and acceptable for predicting remittances in Bangladesh. The results of the study apparently show that remittances inflows into Bangladesh are on a downwards trajectory. The paper suggests the need for strengthening Bangladesh’s emigration policy in order to improve remittances inflows into Bangladesh.
F24|Enhancing ICT for Quality Education in Sub-Saharan Africa|This research assesses the relevance of information and communication technology (ICT) in primary education quality in a panel of 49 Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) and Instrumental Quantile regressions (IQR). From the 2SLS: (i) mobile phone and internet penetration rates reduce poor quality education and enhancing internet penetration has a net negative effect of greater magnitude. From the IQR: (i) with the exception of the highest quantile for mobile phone penetration and top quantiles for internet penetration, ICT consistently has a negative effect on poor education quality with a non-monotonic pattern. (ii) Net negative effects are exclusively apparent in the median and top quantiles of internet-related regressions. It follows that enhancing internet penetration will benefit countries with above-median levels of poor education quality while enhancing internet penetration is not immediately relevant to reducing poor education quality in countries with below-median levels of poor education quality.
F24|The impact of remittancess on poverty : What relations in Sub-saharan Africa and latin America ?|This article examines the impact of international remittances on poverty in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America between 1996-2016. The results of our regressions show that international remittances have a positive effect in reducing poverty in Latin America but not significant in sub-Saharan Africa. This relationship between international remittances and poverty is significantly different between sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. This result implies that remittances play an important role in increasing household consumption and hence in reducing poverty. This supports our assertion that international remittances have more impact on poverty reduction in rich regions than in poor regions. This study shows that improvements in these attractiveness factors international remittances tend to decrease levels of poverty. It is also supported by the fact that in Sub-Saharan African countries, governments tend to invest in international remittances like other sources of external finance.
F24|"International migration and remittances in Nepal Revisiting some ""facts"", and role of economic diplomacy"|This paper presents cases where numbers and facts used in the discourse on international outmigration and remittances in Nepal mislead, identifies data gaps, and highlights avenues through which the nationâ€™s foreign affairs apparatus can contribute to maximizing the net benefits of international outmigration and remittances.

F24|Togo - 2017: domestic politics, foreign affairs and socio-economic development|ABSTRACT & RÉSUMÉ & ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: The demand for political alternance, initiated by institutional and electoral reforms, constituted the major contentious issue between the government and the challengers of the Gnassingbé regime throughout the year. Civil society organizations and representatives of the Christian church supported the demands of the opposition. The protest of the notorious divided opposition took a new momentum since August with the lead by a hitherto hardly known opposition party and its charismatic leader, Tikpi Atchadam. He organized huge demonstrations of all the 14 opposition parties in the second half of the year which put the government progressively under pressure. Foreign affairs were dominated by the impact of increased aid by the international donor community. Socio-economic development was marked by diminishing human development and economic freedom. ------------------------------------------------------------ RÉSUMÉ: La demande d'alternance politique, initiée par des réformes institutionnelles et électorales, constitue le principal contentieux entre le gouvernement et les challengers du régime Gnassingbé tout au long de l'année. Les organisations de la société civile et les représentants de l'église chrétienne ont soutenu les demandes de l'opposition. La protestation de l'opposition divisée notoire a pris un nouvel élan depuis le mois d'août avec à sa tête un parti d'opposition jusqu'alors méconnu et son leader charismatique, Tikpi Atchadam. Il a organisé d'énormes manifestations de l'ensemble des 14 partis d'opposition au cours de la seconde moitié de l'année, ce qui a mis le gouvernement sous pression. Les affaires étrangères ont été dominées par l'impact de l'aide accrue de la communauté internationale des donateurs. Le développement socio-économique a été marqué par la diminution du développement humain et de la liberté économique. ------------------------------------------------------------ ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Die Forderung nach politischer Alternanz, initiiert durch institutionelle und Wahlreformen, war das größte Streitthema zwischen der Regierung und den Herausforderern des Gnassingbé-Regimes während des ganzen Jahres. Zivilgesellschaftliche Organisationen und Vertreter der christlichen Kirche unterstützten die Forderungen der Opposition. Der Protest der zerstrittenen Opposition nahm ab August mit der Führung einer bisher kaum bekannten Oppositionspartei und ihres charismatischen Führers Tikpi Atchadam eine neue Dynamik an. Er organisierte in der zweiten Jahreshälfte große Demonstrationen aller 14 Oppositionsparteien, die die Regierung zunehmend unter Druck setzten. Auswärtige Angelegenheiten waren von den Auswirkungen der verstärkten Hilfe der internationalen Gebergemeinschaft geprägt. Die sozioökonomische Entwicklung war von abnehmender menschlicher Entwicklung und wirtschaftlicher Freiheit geprägt.
F24|Private Remittances Received and Household Consumption in Ghana (1980-2016): An ARDL Analysis with Structural Breaks|This study examined the short and long-run effects of private remittances on household consumption in Ghana from 1980 to 2016, controlling for structural breaks. Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) technique was used to investigate the relationship. Results showed that remittances positively impacted household consumption in Ghana in both the short and long-run howbeit, statistically insignificant. Hence, it was recommended, among other things that the government of Ghana collaborates with financial institutions to make remittance less expensive to encourage more remitting from the diaspora.
F24|Economic links between education and migration: An overview|Among the many factors governing migration, education plays a major role, though more in the long run than for short-term floods particularly of irregular migration. Concerning the long run effects, the direction of causation and the slope of the connection are debated in theory. Education not only determines the mobility of people, it also is positively correlated with rising incomes. Empirical evidence shows that for people in developing countries, who are at the low end of the income distribution, more education and rising income levels are push factors for emigration. However, beyond a certain threshold further rising incomes tend to retard migration. As a result, education exhibits an inverted-U shaped relationship with migration. Another remarkable fact is that, on average, people who migrate are better educated than non-migrants back home as well as indigenous people in the host country.
F24|A Re-examination of the Relationship between Foreign Capital Flows and Economic Growth in Nigeria|Abstract The study was carried out to re-examine the relationship between foreign capital flows and economic growth in Nigeria by collecting annual data over the period of 1986 to 2015 from various sources. The study employed a combination of stationary and nonstationary series. Similarly, irrespective of specifications, the study reported the absence of a long-run relationship between economic growth and its determinants in Nigeria. Furthermore, owing to absorptive capacity constraints (such as, infrastructural deficit, underdeveloped local financial market and negative and/or very weak positive spill-over effect on domestic investment), net FDI inflows exerted positive short-run influence on growth, while net portfolio flows and net foreign remittance had significant negative short-run effects on growth. Also, lower levels of net foreign aids and net external debt promote growth, while excessive levels of these flows dampen growth. All these imply that the relationship between foreign capital flows and economic growth in Nigeria is both linear and nonlinear. It is therefore recommended that policy makers in Nigeria encourage the inflow of capital that would be beneficial to the nation, in terms of stimulating domestic investment and economic growth. Putting measures in place to develop the nation’s financial sector is also suggested to attract and make efficient use of capital flows in the country.
F24|Remittances, ICT and Doing Business in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study examines how linkages between information and communication technology (ICT) and remittances affect the doing of business. The focus is on a panel of 49 sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments. While we establish some appealing results in terms of net negative effects on constraints to the doing of business (i.e. time to start a business and time to pay taxes), some positive net effects are also apparent (i.e. number of start-up procedures, time to build a warehouse and time to register a property). We also establish ICT penetration thresholds at which the unconditional effect of remittances can be changed from positive to negative, notably: (i) for the number of start-up procedures, an internet level of 9.00 penetration per 100 people is required while (ii) for the time to build a warehouse, a mobile phone penetration level of 32.33 penetration per 100 people is essential. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess linkages between ICT, remittances and doing business in Sub-Saharan Africa.
F24|The long-run and short-run effects of foreign direct investment, foreign aid and remittances on economic growth in African countries|This paper investigates the long-run and short-run effects of foreign direct investment (FDI), foreign aid and migrant remittances on economic growth in 36 African countries over the period 1980–2016. Empirical evidence is based on Pooled Mean Group (PMG) approach. The following findings are established. First, while there is a positive and significant long-run relationship between foreign direct investment and economic growth in Africa as a whole, the effect of remittances and foreign aid is insignificant. Second, in the short-run there is no evidence of any significant impact of FDI, remittances and foreign aid on economic growth. Third, results are still robust in the short-run when the panel is divided in three subsamples. However, in the long-run the effects of FDI, remittances and foreign aid on economic growth depend on the income level.
F24|Endogenous Migration in a Two-Country Model with Labor Market Frictions|We present a dynamic North-South model with search frictions and endogenous labor migration to study the long-run implications of labor factor mobility on labor market conditions and welfare. In the model, the high-TFP country (North) acts as the destination country for migration, while the low-TFP country (South) acts as the origin country. We prove that there always exists a unique steady-state equilibrium for the world economy, and find that a permanent increase in migration effort causes per capita income to rise in North and to fall in the South. However, our simulations also show the existence of a job displacement effect in the host country that makes domestic employment fall in the long-run. In an extension of the baseline model, we test the long-run effects of a pro-employment protectionist policy of the destination country consisting in imposing a distortionary tax on the domestic firms hiring migrant workers. Our analysis shows that a positive tax rate on foreign employment can increase natives welfare, but only at the expense of losses in national production and employment. These results are robust across different degrees of substitutability between migrant and native workers.
F24|Impact of Remittances on Economic Growth in Developing Countries: The Role of Openness|The paper examines the empirical relationship between remittances and economic growth for a sample of 62 developing countries over the time period 1990-2014. Remittances seem to promote growth only in the ?more open? countries. The study uses a variety of indicators of ?openness? to test the hypothesis that openness of a country increases the growth effects of remittances. The finding, remittances lead to higher growth in open countries, is robust regardless of how ?openness? is defined. Conversely, no significant effect of remittances on growth could be detected in the case of ?less open? countries. That is because remittances are in themselves not sufficient for growth. The extent of the benefit depends on domestic institutions and macroeconomic environment in the receiving country. Unlike the ?less open? countries, ?more open? countries have better institutions and better financial markets to take advantage of the remittances income and channelise them into profitable investments which, in turn, accelerates the rate of economic growth in these countries.
F24|Who remits and why? Evidence on internal migrant remittances from Vietnam and Thailand|The paper analyses determinants and motivations of internal migrant remittances based on a unique data set that combines a household survey from three provinces in Vietnam and Thailand with a migrant tracing survey that was conducted in Ho Chi Minh City and the Greater Bangkok area. Using the Heckman model, we find that human capital, stronger family ties and better living conditions positively influence the migrantâ€™s decision to remit. In terms of the amount remitted, migrants engaged in the service sector remit lower shares of their income and remittances decrease as the household wealth increases. Furthermore, we explore the behavioral side of remittances by constructing proxy groups that represent each strand of migrantâ€™s motivation for remitting. We examine the relationship of these proxy groups and remittances to conclude that exchange or loan repayment motive underpinned by altruism is the strongest motivation in our case.
F24|Behavior in reverse: reasons for return migration| Received research shows numerous motives for migration, but fewer reasons for return migration. This paper aims to correct this imbalance. Twelve reasons for return migration are presented and discussed briefly. The reasons listed are derived from research on migration conducted by the author in the course of the past three and a half decades. The purpose of the paper is to pull together the insights gained from that research so as to formulate a base for future inquiry, both analytical and empirical. In addition, just as research on motives for migration can help to establish the reasons for return migration, research on the latter can help to deepen understanding of the former. Moreover, in a great many circumstances and for a variety of reasons, countries that host migrants may want them to leave. In such circumstances, enacting policies that align with motives for return migration will be more efficient than devising measures that are independent of these motives.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F24|Remittances, ICT and Doing Business in Sub-Saharan Africa|Purpose – This study examines how linkages between information and communication technology (ICT) and remittances affect the doing of business. Design/methodology/approach – The focus is on a panel of 49 sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments. Findings – While we establish some appealing results in terms of net negative effects on constraints to the doing of business (i.e. time to start a business and time to pay taxes), some positive net effects are also apparent (i.e. number of start-up procedures, time to build a warehouse and time to register a property). We also establish ICT penetration thresholds at which the unconditional effect of remittances can be changed from positive to negative, notably: (i) for the number of start-up procedures, an internet level of 9.00 penetration per 100 people is required while (ii) for the time to build a warehouse, a mobile phone penetration level of 32.33 penetration per 100 people is essential. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed. Originality/value – To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess linkages between ICT, remittances and doing business in Sub-Saharan Africa.
F24|Firms' credit risk and the onshore transmission of the global financial cycle|We investigate the role of firms' credit risk in the onshore transmission of international bond market conditions. We show that reductions in the global price of risk, measured by the excess bond premium, encourage more international bond borrowing by smaller and younger firms. Due to informational asymmetries, these firms pay a higher credit spread. Thus their funding costs, and consequently their international borrowing, are more tightly linked to the global price of risk. The funds borrowed in response to favourable market conditions cause their balance sheets to deteriorate; over a three-year horizon, leverage increases, in support of capital expenditure, and cash holdings increase. Our results reveal a micro-level link between rising global risk appetite and the gradual build-up of domestic vulnerabilities.
F24|Social networks and the intention to migrate|Using a large individual-level survey spanning several years and more than 150 countries, we examine the importance of social networks in influencing individuals’ intention to migrate internationally and locally. We distinguish close social networks (composed of friends and family) abroad and at the current location, and broad social networks (composed of same-country residents with intention to migrate, either internationally or locally). We find that social networks abroad are the most important driving forces of international migration intentions, with close and broad networks jointly explaining about 37% of variation in the probability intentions. Social networks are found to be more important factors driving migration intentions than work-related aspects or wealth (wealth accounts for less than 3% of the variation). In addition, we find that having stronger close social networks at home has the opposite effect by reducing the likelihood of migration intentions, both internationally and locally.
F24|Global Migration in the 20th and 21st Centuries: the Unstoppable Force of Demography|This paper sheds light on the global migration patterns of the past 40 years, and produces migration projections for the 21st century, for two skill groups, and for all relevant pairs of countries. To do this, we build a simple model of the world economy, and we parameterize it to match the economic and socio-demographic characteristics of the world in the year 2010. We conduct a backcasting exercise which demonstrates that our model fits the past trends in international migration very well, and that historical trends were mostly governed by demographic changes. We then describe a set of migration projections for the 21st century. In line with backcasts, our world migration prospects and emigration rates from developing countries are mainly governed by socio-demographic changes: they are virtually insensitive to the technological environment. As far as OECD countries are concerned, we predict a highly robust increase in immigration pressures in general (from 12 in 2010 to 17-19% in 2050 and 25-28% in 2100), and in European immigration in particular (from 15% in 2010 to 23-25% in 2050 and 36-39% in 2100). Using development policies to curb these pressures requires triggering unprecedented economic takeoffs in migrants countries of origin. Increasing migration is therefore a likely phenomenon for the 21st century, and this raises societal and political challenges for most industrialized countries.
F24|The eﬀects of migration and pollution externality on cognitive skills in Caribbean economies: a Theoretical analysis|Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face speciﬁc social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities. This paper provides a simple overlapping generations model with migration and intergenerational transfers in an economy where production generates pollution. This pollution hampers the cognitive skills of the children and thus the eﬃciency of human capital accumulation in the economy. Therefore the model developped in this work introduces kea features of Caribbean SIDS in order to exacerbate the dynamics between demography – i.e. migration and human capital accumulation – and pollution. Results reveal that the usual gain from migration in terms of human capital was no longer possible because of the environmental externality. Indeed, in most of the cases, in presence of the environmental externality, per capita variables (utility, production and capital) are decreased by migration, while the aggregated production can be enhanced thanks to the demographic growth that occurs with migration. Moreover, it has been shown that the conditions to have a proﬁtable environmental tax depend on the pollution intensity of the economy. Finally, the interactions between the emigration rate and the form of intergenerational transfers – i.e. solidarity from the domestic area and/or from the diaspora – have an impact on the scale of the reduction of human capital due to migration. Thus, in this model a gain from an increase in the rate of emigration is still possible but only if migration is already very high.
F24|The effects of migration and remittances on development and capital in Caribbean Small Island Developing States|This paper puts forward a modified OLG framework for high migration countries such as Caribbean islands, to link economic growth and demographic features. Our theoretical model captures the potential effects of migration on the households' choices in terms of savings, fertility and education, and thus on the accumulation of human and physical capital. Through a numerical analysis we study specifically five countries. We find that households in Jamaica, Haiti and Dominican Republic invest more in education for future generations and increase their fertility rate. Thus due to migration, their economic growth is driven by accumulation of efficient units of labor. For Barbados or Trinidad and Tobago, the benefits from education are dwarfed respectively by a low migration premium or a low level of remittances. Their economic growth is therefore driven by a high accumulation of physical capital. Second, we introduce frictions on the capital market in order to account for the imperfections in the interest rate adjustments to the marginal productivity of capital. For the studied islands, physical capital accumulation on the one hand and economic growth on the other hand show trade-offs between short-run and long-run if the frictions are reduced.

F24|Migration, remittances and educational levels of household members left behind: Evidence from rural Morocco|In this paper, we empirically investigate the relationship between international migration and education attainment levels. We ask whether rural children who live in households that experience migration or/and receiving remittances are more likely to complete school at a given age than children who live in non-migrant households. Higher secondary and higher education levels are examined separately. Our results clearly show that children in remittance-receiving households complete significantly more years of schooling. In particular, remittances increase the probability of a male child completing high school. However, the evidence suggests that the international migration lowers deeply the chances of children completing higher education. Evidence also indicates the utmost importance of householdsâ€™ socio-economic status in determining to what extent the household mitigates the possible detrimental effects of migration on their childrenâ€™s educational outcomes.
F24|The effects of remittances on poverty and inequality: Evidence from rural southern Morocco|In this paper, we examine the effect of migrants’ remittances on poverty and inequality. The survey data were collected in Morocco, in the rural areas of the region Souss-Massa-Draa. By applying an original approach, we estimate the counterfactual income of remittance-recipient households corresponding to a hypothetical value of its average income calculated for a scenario without remittances; this is then compared with its current income. We find that the poverty rate and the vulnerability of non-poor households are significantly dropped due to remittances. Our findings also suggest that remittance inflows have increased income inequality compared to the no-migration counterfactual situation.
F24|The impact of migrant workers' remittances on the living standards of families in Morocco: A propensity score matching approach|This article attempts to assess empirically the impact of remittances on household expenditure and relative poverty in Morocco. We apply propensity score matching methods to the 2006/2007 Moroccan Living Standards Measurement Survey. We find that migrants’ remittances can improve living standards among Moroccan households and affect negatively the incidence of poverty. The results show a statistically significant and positive impact of hose remittances on recipient households’ expenditures. They are also significantly associated with a decline in the probability of being in poverty for rural households; it decreases by 11.3 percentage points. In comparison, this probability decreases by 3 points in urban area.
F24|Transferts de fonds, éducation et travail des enfants au Maroc. Une analyse par score de propension|Cet article explore les facteurs explicatifs de la disparité de la demande d’éducation et de l’offre de travail des enfants en considérant les ménages avec et sans migrants internationaux. Il s’agit, en particulier, de mettre en évidence le rôle des transferts de fonds des migrants dans l’éducation et dans le travail des enfants marocains, à l’aide d'une enquête effectuée dans la région de Souss-Massa-Draa (Sud du Maroc). Nous traitons le problème d’endogéinité potentiel des transferts des migrants en utilisant la méthode des variables instrumentales. Nos résultats montrent que ces flux financiers ont un effet positif sur la proportion d’enfants scolarisés au sein des ménages migrants. De plus, le nombre d’enfants, qui cumulent emploi et scolarité, vivant dans des ménages migrants est nettement moins élevé par rapport à celui des enfants des ménages sans migrants. Nos résultats montrent aussi l’effet positif des transferts sur la scolarité des enfants pauvres. Il semble également que l’activité partielle des enfants ou des adolescents pauvres baisse, de manière significative grâce aux transferts financiers des migrants. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of remittances on child labor and demand of education using survey data on the Souss-Massa-Draa region (South of Morocco). Based on an instrumental variables probit model, we find a positive and significant effect of remittances on the investments in education. Furthermore, the number of children living in migrant households who accumulate employment and schooling is clearly less raised compared with the children of the households of group of control (non migrant households). Moreover, our results show the positive effect of remittances on the schooling of the poor children. It also seems that the partial participation of poor children or teenagers in work declines more significantly through migrant remittances.
F24|Le retour des migrants marocains dans leur pays d'origine, quand ? Dans quelles circonstances ?|Le but de cet article est d’identifier les causes du retour des migrants marocains à leur pays. Pour cela, nous utilisons une base de données originale. Il s’agit d’une enquête réalisée en 2007 auprès de la communauté marocaine installée en France. L’enquête a été effectuée dans les principaux bureaux de poste de l’hexagone. Nous testons l’impact de chacune de nos variables explicatives sur la probabilité de retour à l’aide d’un modèle Probit. Les résultats montrent que le migrant type qui envisage retourner au pays est soit un jeune homme vivant seul (célibataire ou divorcé), n’ayant pas dépassé le niveau bac, appartenant à un ménage modeste (revenu entre1500 et 2000€), envoyant de l’argent régulièrement au Maroc pour sa famille et pour financer un projet, ayant accumulé de l’argent durant plusieurs années et enfin possédant une maison au Maroc (ou envisage de la construire). Soit un étudiant. This study aims to identify the causes of return migrations of Moroccan migrants to their home country, using an original database of migrants in France. The survey data were collected in the main post offices of Ile-de-France (metropolitan area) and Province. Using a probit model, the results show that migrants have a higher propensity to return to their home country if they are single (or divorced), young men who earn modest incomes (1500 –2000 €) and have attained less than the baccalaureate level of education. Other key factors are their decisions to send money regularly to their family living in Morocco and their accumulation of money in the host country from previous investments, as well as their status as a student.
F24|Great Expectations? Remittances and Asset Accumulation in Pakistan|This study examines asset accumulation patterns of the recipients of foreign and domestic remittances. Employing a number of matching techniques, we analyse stocks of consumer, productive, housing and financial assets among migrants' stayâ€ behind households in Pakistan. We find that asset accumulation among remittanceâ€ receiving households depends upon the nature and magnitude of remittances, the economic situation, and the geographical location of the recipient households. Foreign remittances lead to a substantial increase in household assets, while no significant change results from domestic remittances. We conclude that foreign remittances are considered as mainly transitory income and are used to generate precautionary savings in cash and kind. Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
F24|Remittances and Business Cycles: Comparison of South Asian Countries| South Asia is one of the world's principal remittance-receiving regions. This study examines the home and host business cycles of migrant remittance flows to the region. Employing the Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) technique, the remittance behaviour of the region's four main countries is compared. Remittances to India and Pakistan show a mainly acyclical behaviour with respect to the output of the four host regions, and a countercyclical behaviour with respect to home output. In contrast, remittances to the two smaller economies of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are found to be mainly procyclical. The study shows that the macroeconomic remittance behaviour varies with respect to the importance of remittance flows in the home economy. Moreover, remittance behaviour seems to respond more to home economy specificities than to those of the different regions that host the migrants from the developing countries.
F24|Emigration, remittances, and the subjective well-being of those staying behind|Abstract We offer the first global perspective on the well-being consequences of emigration for those staying behind using several subjective well-being measures (evaluations of best possible life, positive affect, stress, and depression). Using the Gallup World Poll data for 114 countries during 2009–2011, we find that having family members abroad is associated with greater evaluative well-being and positive affect, and receiving remittances is linked with further increases in evaluative well-being, especially in poorer contexts—both across and within countries. We also document that having household members abroad is linked with increased stress and depression, which are not offset by remittances. The out-migration of family members appears less traumatic in countries where migration is more common, indicating that people in such contexts might be able to cope better with separation. Overall, subjective well-being measures, which reflect both material and non-material aspects of life, furnish additional insights and a well-rounded picture of the consequences of emigration on migrant family members staying behind relative to standard outcomes employed in the literature, such as the left-behind’s consumption, income, or labor market outcomes.
F24|Will Skill-Based Immigration Policies Lead to Lower Remittances? An Analysis of the Relations between Education, Sponsorship, and Remittances|As more and more developed countries adopt policies that favor highly educated immigrants, the impact of such policies on developing countries remains unclear. Some researchers have argued that migrants who are more educated tend to bring their immediate family members to the host country, and thus, send less money to the source country in remittances. While there is numerous papers documenting association between education and remittance, whether that is related to sponsorship decision remains under-explored. Using individual level panel data from the New Immigrant Survey, we show that sponsoring family members leads to lower remittance. Furthermore, we show that college educated immigrants from high-income families are less likely to sponsor relatives, presumably because of relatively higher opportunity cost of migration of their relatives. Together, these two results suggest a positive association between education and remittances, which is indeed, what we find in the data. Our extended analysis shows that alternative explanations (such as higher income of more educated immigrants, or repaying implicit educational loans) cannot completely explain the positive association between education and remittances. Our results suggest that skill-based immigration policies are likely to result in more remittances.
F24|Hollowing Out the Middle? Remittances and Income Inequality in Nigeria|This paper investigates the impact of remittances on poverty and inequality in Nigeria. In contrast to the existing literature, our methodology of instrumental variable quantile regression (IVQR) explicitly demonstrates the differential marginal impact of remittances for households at different levels of the conditional expenditure distribution. Furthermore, in tracing this heterogeneous impact, we are able to address the effect of remittances on poverty and inequality simultaneously in a unified econometric model. Our results reveal a positive marginal impact of remittances at all but the very highest quantiles of the conditional distribution of household expenditure, with the impact being the greatest up to the 12th quantile. While this unambiguously supports the poverty alleviation role of remittances hypothesized in the literature, the distributional impact is more nuanced: The marginal effect of remittance is seen to follow an approximate U-shape over the household expenditure distribution until the 89th quantile, whereupon it drops sharply. As such, households lying between the 13th to the 35th quantile gain far less from receiving remittances than households outside of this range.
F24|Economic Resources, Financial Aid and Remittances|According to the World Bank, in 2017, an estimated 450 billion US dollars in remittances were sent to Low and Middle Income Countries. This means that the sum of remittances is more than three times larger than the sum of the world's total official aid to the same countries. The practice of sending remittances can be seen as one specific thing that migrants do as part of sustaining ties with their countries of origin. Remittances can be personal gifts, but are often sent in order to support family members and friends in their country of origin living under more difficult economic conditions. Remittances may also be a form of investment or repayments of loans. In this study we use data from the latest Swedish level of living survey LNU-UFB to study the factors influencing the propensity to remit. Using probit estimations, we find that the economic situation of the migrant, demographic variables and the migrants' ties to the home country are important. The propensity to remit also varies by country of origin. With an increasing number of migrants, the propensity to remit will have growing policy implications. It will have implications for Sweden as a donor country, raising issues of complementarity between remittances and official development aid. Migrants' propensity to remit will also be increasingly relevant for Sweden's integration policies, as the motives to remit might shape immigrants' decisions and priorities while settling in Sweden.
F24|The Impact of Government Spending on GDP in a Remitting Country|The literature on remittances is large and growing. However, its focus has mainly been on the effects of remittance inflows on the receiving economies. Little has been done on the sending economies. In this paper, we use data from Saudi Arabia, one of the top remitting countries in the world, to identify the impact of government spending on Saudi Arabia's real output considering the role of remittance outflows. The results suggest that remittance outflows have a weak effect, if at all, on government spending, which, in turn, has an insignificant impact on GDP. The paper discusses some policy implications.
F24|Migration, Remittances and Human Capital Investment in Kenya|This paper investigates the relationship between international migration, remittances and human capital investment in Kenya. We use household level data from the 2009 Kenya Migration Household Survey (produced by the Africa Migration Project) to test our hypothesis and uncover a positive and significant relationship between the amount of international remittances a household receives and the amount of expenditures allocated to education (for all levels of education). We consider various robustness checks and find that our results hold up to various specifications, including an instrumental variable approach.
F24|An Empirical Analysis of the Time Pattern of Remittances and Tongan Migrants in New Zealand|Altruistic motivation of sending remittances is a decentralised decision of the migrants. A phenomenon known in the literature as remittances decay hypothesis suggests that the pattern of remittances follows an inverted U shape. We examine whether remittances have declined based on the length of absence of Tongan migrants in New Zealand (NZ). Results from a survey analysis for 309 households indicate that at the early stages of migration remittances increase and it declines over the length of stay in NZ. The time period at which remittances reach the maximum point after which it starts to decline is about 17 years.
F24|Cabo Verde Transition Finance Country Pilot|A transition finance country pilot was initiated by the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) in partnership with the government of Cabo Verde. The study aims to capture the challenges facing Cabo Verde following graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) to Lower Middle Income Category (LMIC), including the shifting financing for sustainable development landscape, the mounting risk of debt distress and the economic and environmental vulnerabilities as a Small Island Developing States (SIDS). In line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA), the pilot study proposes a new “ABC” approach targeted to assess all available sources of financing (ODA, OOF, private investment, domestic resources, and remittances), identify emerging SDG financing gaps and promote better alignment of resources with national financing for sustainable development strategies.
F24|External Flows and Inclusive Human Development in Sub-Saharan Africa|The study assesses how external flows influence inclusive human development in a panel of 48 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Tobit regressions and Generalised Method of Moments. The findings from both estimation techniques reveal that remittances and FDI increase inclusive development whereas foreign aid has the opposite effect. The results suggest some positive and negative impacts of interest for further analysis. First, remittances are negatively associated with: (i) Middle income countries compared to Low income countries where the effect is not significant; (ii) French Civil law countries compared to English Common law countries where the effect is positive and (iii) Resource-rich countries compared to their Resource-poor counterparts where the effect is positive. Second, foreign aid is more negatively linked to Low income, French Civil law, Islam-dominated, Un-landlocked, Resource-rich and Politically-unstable countries. Third, FDI is positively associated with: (i) Low income, French Civil law and Landlocked countries compared to respectively Middle income, English Common law and Un-landlocked countries where the effect is insignificant and (ii) Politically-stable countries compared to their Politically-unstable counterparts where the effect is negative.
F24|External flows and inclusive human development in Sub-Saharan Africa| The study assesses how external flows influence inclusive human development in Sub-Saharan Africa. The findings reveal that remittances and FDI increase inclusive development whereas foreign aid has the opposite effect. There are three other strands of findings. First, remittances are negatively associated with: 1) middle income countries compared to low income countries where the effect is not significant; 2) French civil law countries compared to English common law countries where the effect is positive; 3) resource-rich countries compared to their resource-poor counterparts where the effect is positive. Second, foreign aid is more negatively linked to low income, French civil law, Islam-dominated, un-landlocked, resource-rich and politically-unstable countries. Third, FDI is positively associated with: 1) low income, French civil law and landlocked countries compared to respectively middle income, English common law and un-landlocked countries where the effect is insignificant; 2) politically-stable countries compared to their politically-unstable counterparts where the effect is negative.
F24|A mixture growth model for migrants' remittances: An application to the German Socio-Economic Panel|We propose a bivariate mixture growth model with concomitant variables to study the time profiles of international remittances sent by first-generation migrants in Germany from 1996 to 2012. The latent class approach allows us to identify homogeneous sub-groups of migrants associated with different trajectories for their remitting behavior, which can be interpreted in the light of the theoretical economic background. In addition, the latent class model combined with the concomitant variable approach allows us to uncover whether the assignment of migrants to a specific sub-group can be ascribed to their observable characteristics, namely their return intention, as conjectured by the theoretical models.
F24|Las transferencias públicas y privadas y su importancia en la pobreza|En este documento se estudia los efectos de las transferencias públicas y privadas en los indicadores de pobreza. La alta incidencia en términos del número de personas que reciben estas transferencias y de los montos de estas justifica este estudio. Se utiliza un método que permite estimar el ingreso de las personas sin estas trasferencias y posteriormente identificar el cambio en los indicadores de pobreza debido a la ausencia de estos recursos. Se encuentra que la tasa de pobreza promedio entre el 2015 y 2016 sería cinco puntos porcentuales mayor a los datos oficiales en ausencia de las transferencias, siendo la mayor contribución en este monto el de las transferencias privadas. Además, un porcentaje relevante de las transferencias privadas proviene de regiones vecinas, razón por la cual una proporción alta de la población en situación de pobreza se beneficia del crecimiento económico de otras regiones.
F24|Immigrant networks and remittances: Cheaper together?|We estimate the causal effects of immigrant networks on individuals’ remittance sending behavior for migrants from many different countries residing in Spain. Our methodology addresses typical issues that arise when estimating network effects: reverse causality, common unobserved factors, and self-selection. In particular, we instrument the size of networks by predicting the number of migrants in each location using the location’s accessibility by distinct methods of transportation and information about how migrants from each country initially arrived in Spain. Our findings show that immigrants from above-average remitting countries remit more if they live in larger networks. For a subset of countries that receive large remittance flows from Spain, we show that migrants in larger networks are less likely to use most expensive remittance channels, and that cost spreads between the most expensive and cheapest remittance service provider are lower for countries characterized by stronger networks. Our results suggest that network effects could boost policy efforts to lower remittance prices.
F24|Poverty, disasters and remittances: do remittances and past disasters influence households’ resilience?|Using a multi-topic household panel survey conducted in Burkina Faso by the “Institut national de la statistique et de la démographie” (INSD), in 2014, this paper assesses the impact of remittances on poverty in Burkina Faso. To do so, a poverty index is computed using household’s housing characteristics. Propensity score matching method is used as an empirical strategy, and results show that remittances have a negative impact on poverty. Another important result is that remittances have a higher impact on the resilience of households, when they have experienced disasters in the past. Therefore, when it comes to natural disasters, these inflows act as an important tool for populations to be more resilient.
F24|International Migration, Return Migration, and their Effects: A Comprehensive Review on the Romanian Case|Romanian migration is today one of the biggest, complex, and dynamic migration to Western Europe. This paper is a comprehensive review of the existing literature that aims at providing a full picture of this dynamic migratory process and discusses its far-reaching consequences. It first presents and characterizes the Romanian migration through the different phases during and after state socialism. The second part of the paper is dedicated to unfolding the socio-economic effects of the Romanian migration addressing the remitting behavior and its development over the past years. The issue of return migration is also addressed stressing that return is not much developed, however it has significant impacts through the emergence of returnees' entrepreneurship. Finally we address some of the consequences of the medical doctors' migration which is today considered one of the main migration challenges the country is facing.
F24|Remittances, Spending and Political Instability in Ukraine|"This paper analyzes remittances sent by Ukrainian emigrants to their country of origin. It explores the dependence on remittances of a household's spending on human capital, savings and donations, against the backdrop of the political situation in Ukraine in 2004. The paper also explores the effect of the political instability in Ukraine on how the households receiving remittances used them. The results of a Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (ULMS) are used to explore households' decision to spend on human capital development, save, or donate money; depending on their political views and future expectations. The main hypothesis tested is whether the individuals who supported and/or were involved with the Revolution (""pro-orange""), and who were optimistic about the future of Ukraine after the Orange Revolution, saved/donated more money than those who did not support the Revolution (""pro-blue-white""). In addition, the level of in uence of remittances received from relatives or friends outside Ukraine on decisions to save and donate money is analyzed. The results show that the political views of respondents do not have a significant effect on decisions to save and/or donate money. However respondents' political orientations do have a significant effect on the probability of receiving remittances those who voted for ""pro-orange"" have a lower probability of receiving remittances from outside the household."
F24|Remittances in Ukraine Using Household Data|This paper analyzes remittances sent by Ukrainian emigrants to their country of origin. It explores the main factors in uencing the probability of obtaining remittances from abroad as well as the amount of remittances. We investigate how theplanned future usage of remittances a ects the likelihood of receiving them. The results of a survey of households in Ukraine were used to investigate the main defining factors for obtaining financial in ows from abroad, in addition to exploring the expenditures financed by remittances. Although the results of our analysis show that few factors have a significant in uence on the probability of obtaining remittances and on their size, this topic warrants further investigation. The findings are important for policymakers as the Ukrainian government might design and implement policies that increase the development potential of remittances, while eliminating their negative side effects.
F24|Migración y desarrollo. Características de los hogares y uso de las remesas internas e internacionales en México|Este artículo analiza las principales características de los hogares que se asocian con la recepción de remesas internas e internacionales en México en el 2014, y compara distintos rubros del gasto de los hogares receptores de remesas internas, internacionales y los no receptores para dilucidar si existen diferencias entre ellos. Se analiza información de los hogares con datos de la Encuesta Nacional de Ingresos y Gastos de los Hogares (ENIGH). Se emplea un modelo de regresión logística binomial, para examinar los factores asociados a la recepción de remesas. Se encontraron diferencias en las características de los hogares receptores de remesas internas e internacionales, destacando variables como el sexo, el estado conyugal, la presencia de menores y adultos mayores dentro del hogar, entre otras. En relación con el gasto, se observó que los hogares destinan la mayoría de sus ingresos a cubrir sus necesidades básicas.
F24|Migration patterns and labor market outcomes in Tunisia|This article focuses on the external effects of emigration on non-migrants and particularly on the interactions with labor market outcomes in Tunisia before and after the revolution. Using the new Tunisia Labor Market Panel Survey (TLMPS) we conduct an in-depth analysis of the structure and dynamics of migration in Tunisia including the profile of migrants and their origin households, mainly in terms of skills and spatial composition. We also investigate transition matrices, employment status, income for current migrants and returnees and the evolution of remittances. Our analysis confirms the role of emigration as a security valve for the Tunisian labor market. Moreover, origin households of migrants have a significantly higher wealth index. Remittances play a significant role for the Tunisian economy and at the household level. Our analysis also tends to confirm the effects of remittances on labor supply of non migrants which can have a negative impact on Tunisia’s unemployment rate when a crisis in destination countries affects negatively the remittance rate.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F24|Do remittances improve political institutions? Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa|Do remittances represent a significant positive determinant of democratic institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa? In this paper, we estimate the effect that remittances have on democratic institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa over the period 1975–2014. Using a 5-year non-overlapping panel sample and controlling for country and time fixed effects, we find that remittances are positively associated with democratic institutions. Our baseline system-GMM estimates indicate that a one standard deviation increase in remittance flows improves democratic institutions by around 0.32 standard deviations. Furthermore, we find that remittances improve democratic institutions by increasing schooling and reducing poverty.
F24|International worker remittances and economic growth in a Real Business Cycle framework|In this article I augment the standard open economy Real Business Cycle (RBC) model with stochastic remittance shocks. The model was calibrated to match broad, stylized facts common across a large set of remittance recipient countries. The calibration exercise reveals that output does not respond as much to remittance shocks relative to technology shocks. The model predicts that temporary inflows of worker remittances positively affect GDP per capita while a permanent increase of remittances does not. Cross country econometric evidence is consistent with the theory: there is a significant and positive correlation between the temporary component of remittances and growth; and permanent component of remittances do not affect output growth.
F24|Migration patterns and labor market outcomes in Tunisia|This article focuses on the external effects of emigration on non-migrants and particularly on the interactions with labor market outcomes in Tunisia before and after the revolution. Using the new Tunisia Labor Market Panel Survey (TLMPS) we conduct an in-depth analysis of the structure and dynamics of migration in Tunisia including the profile of migrants and their origin households, mainly in terms of skills and spatial composition. We also investigate transition matrices, employment status, income for current migrants and returnees and the evolution of remittances. Our analysis confirms the role of emigration as a security valve for the Tunisian labor market. Moreover, origin households of migrants have a significantly higher wealth index. Remittances play a significant role for the Tunisian economy and at the household level. Our analysis also tends to confirm the effects of remittances on labor supply of non migrants which can have a negative impact on Tunisia’s unemployment rate when a crisis in destination countries affects negatively the remittance rate.

F24|Transferts de fonds des migrants vers les pays du Maghreb : quel impact sur le taux de change effectif réel ?|L’impact des transferts de fonds sur le taux de change effectif réel est analysé pour un panel de trois pays du Maghreb, la Tunisie, le Maroc et l’Algérie entre 1980 et 2015, à l’aide d’un modèle en panel dynamique autorégressif à retards échelonnés (ARDL) qui permet d’analyser aussi bien la relation de court et de long terme. Les résultats montrent, contrairement à ce qui est trouvé pour les pays d’Amérique latine, que l'afflux de capitaux sous forme de transferts de fonds par les migrants entraîne, non pas une appréciation, mais une très légère dépréciation du taux de change effectif réel. En conséquence, les envois de fonds par leur impact sur le taux de change n'ont pas d'incidence négative sur la compétitivité prix des trois pays du Maghreb. Cet effet est légèrement plus marqué en Algérie qu’en Tunisie ou au Maroc. L’usage des transferts par les familles récipiendaires, les caractéristiques contra cycliques des entrées de devise, via les transferts des migrants et la politique de change menée réduisent ce risque d’appréciation du change, nommé « syndrome hollandais ».
F24|Smooth operator: remittances and household consumption during fiscal shocks|With 250 million migrants globally, remittances are one of the major sources of income in many developing countries. While there is abundant evidence that remittances facilitate consumption smoothing, the literature has not considered whether this effect varies with the fiscal stance and during fiscal shocks. Our focus is therefore on whether the consumption-smoothing effect changes with fiscal policy phases and whether remittances and government support are substitutes or complements in stabilizing household consumption. We take a holistic approach to investigating this relationship combining cross-country and household-level analysis. We find that remittances help smooth consumption, and hence improve welfare, more during fiscal consolidation episodes, while this impact is insignificant during fiscal expansions. The results also indicate that the effect is more pronounced in countries with greater reliance on remittances.
F24|Immigration Policy and Remittance Behaviour|This paper analyses the impact of a change in Australia's immigration policy, introduced in the mid-1990s, on migrants' remittance behaviour. More precisely, we compare the remittance behaviour of two cohorts who entered Australia before and after the policy change, which consists of stricter entry requirements. Our empirical strategy uses conditional difference-in-differences in the presence of interactive fixed-effects. We first show that Bai's (2009) least squares estimator and conditional difference-in-differences are biased if used on their own. We then derive conditions that are required to obtain a consistent estimator using a combination of conditional difference-in-differences and Bai's (2009) least squares estimator. The results indicate that those who entered under more stringent conditions - the second cohort - have a higher probability to remit than those in the first cohort, though the policy change has no discernible effect on the level of remittances.
F24|Japan–Korea Trade Liberalization Revisited: The Role of Armington Elasticities|The elasticity of substitution between foreign and domestic products, i.e., Armington elasticity, is measured by way of two-state calibration according to the temporally distant observations of the market shares, and associated price changes. Along with the sector-wise multifactor CES elasticity estimated using the linked input-output tables, we integrate domestic production of the two countries (Japan and the Republic of Korea) with bilateral trades and construct a bilateral general equilibrium model. Thereupon, we perform an economic assessment of trade liberalization between the two countries.
F24|The Size and Effects of Emigration and Remittances in the Western Balkans. A Forecasting Based on a Delphi Process|This paper aims at forecasting the size and effects of remittances and emigration in Macedonia, Albania, Serbia, and Kosovo, using a qualitative forecasting method, a Delphi questionnaire. The authors examined consensus building within and between two groups of respondents: ten experts and twenty remittance receivers per country, in three subsequent rounds–two on the same group and a third cross-round. Consensual results suggest that remittances in the projected five-year period will increase in Macedonia and Serbia, and will reduce in Albania and Kosovo. With less consensus, the results forecast that emigration will decelerate, except in Serbia. Emigration effects for the society have been forecast as predominantly negative due to skilled labour emigration, while remittances were forecast to maintain their effect on poverty in Macedonia and Serbia, and weaken in Albania. Consensus has been reached, except in Macedonia, that remittances will support labour market activity.
F24|Bank de-risking impacts on finance and development. The case of Romania|The study aims to investigate the causes, external manifestations and impacts of de-risking phenomenon, increasingly rendered visible in the last years on international financial markets, under the circumstances of the post-crisis global economic developments. The paper reveals that this phenomenon is still little discussed and understood by academics and institutional organizations, consequently, being ignored any theoretical foundation or arguments for the possible guidance, between one or other direction, of policies, norms and regulatory practices in order to monitor and address the slippages with adverse effects. In the paper, the stage of actual knowledge of this phenomenon, as concerns the different forms in which comes out, the main causes and factors of influence, the adverse impact observed and possible counteracting measures is presented. The analysis of the extent to which Romania is affected by de-risking, more visible by reducting the number of clients and financial transactions, halving the non-performing loans of the banking system, having also an important social dimension, in the light of the low level of financial inclusion. The paper presents some reference points for decoding this phenomenon, proposing new directions for more in-depth scientific researches, focusing on the identification of specific solutions based on customized analysis, including for Romania’s case, considering the trade-off options, such as stability versus prudentiality in risk taking and risk management, profitability versus social responsibility under uncertainty conditions, banking system interests versus interests of regulatory and supervisory institutions, monetary policies versus government policy and strategies.
F24|A Small Open Economy DSGE Model with Workers’ Remittances|In this paper, we develop and estimate a small open economy Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model with an enriched specification, which enables us to include a variable of high significance for Pakistan viz. workers’ remittances. The results indicate that a positive shock to workers’ remittances help boost real growth via increased consumption and imported investment and helps ease-off the pressure on current account balance and thereby exchange rate. Too much dependence on workers’ remittances to help meet the trade deficits may potentially leave the economy in doldrums in case sizable negative shocks occur to the flow of foreign remittances. Therefore there is a need for structural reforms to help the economy out of the historical trade deficits, and decrease dependence on the workers’ remittances source to allow for a sustainable economic growth.

F24|Remittances and the real effective exchange rates in MENA countries: What is the long run impact?|The aim of this paper is to examine the effect of remittances on real effective exchange rate in MENA countries using an autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) model and three estimators, namely the Pooled Mean Group estimator, the Mean Group estimator and the dynamics common correlated effects estimator. We use data from 9 countries of MENA region for the 1980-2015 period. On the long-run, we find that migrants’ remittances towards the whole MENA countries negatively and significantly affect the real effective exchange rate. Indeed, the increase in remittances leads to a depreciation of the real exchange rate, meaning that remittances do not deteriorate the price competitiveness of the recipient countries in the long-run. Therefore, remittances do not cause the Dutch disease’s risk in MENA countries.
F24|Re-thinking Immigrant Investment Funds|The idea of selling membership into society is not new, but it has taken on new life with the recent proliferation globally of Immigrant Investor Programs (IIPs). These programs involve the sale of national membership privileges to wealthy foreigners. They are justified by attractive policy objectives: to stimulate economic development and attract engaged investormigrants. But they are often plagued by failures to achieve either of these two goals. This paper surveys the universe of IIPs, reviews their objectives, activities and performance, and explores how they might be improved. We develop a two-dimensional typology for distinguishing IIPs according to types of criteria they impose on program applicants: (i) wealth criteria and (ii) engagement criteria. We map out four distinct immigrant investor strategies that emerge out of these different IIP criteria: Aspiring Astronauts, Absent Oligarchs, Migrant Mayors and Pioneer Patrons. By analyzing which IIP criteria encourage which strategies, we highlight common mismatches between stated objectives and embedded incentives, helping to explain why many IIPs report poor economic and immigration policy outcomes. We also contemplate solutions. In particular, we observe that the success of an IIP depends upon the coming-together of expertise from two domains—migration policy and investment management—and we draw upon insights from successful Sovereign Development Funds (SDFs), which likewise must simultaneously achieve public policy and financial goals. We propose a set of principles to guide the emergence of a new type of SDF: Immigrant Investment Funds (IIFs). We also indicate how such vehicles might help address urgent issues around migration and refugees, for example by investing in refugee and migrant entrepreneurship and in the infrastructures needed to incorporate newcomers, thereby demonstrating the public value of immigration at a time when anti-immigrant rhetoric has become a serious irritant in world politics.
F24|Migration for Development: From Challenges to Opportunities|This contribution investigates the opportunities of migration for developing countries. The benefits of migration for sending countries are often undervalued. But migrants may foster trade, remittances, innovations, investments back home, and even return home at some time with better human capital. Functioning diasporas can lead to stable factors of development. Policies in receiving developed countries towards migrants can enhance the positive impact of migration for development. Among those are measures to support the early integration of migrants into the educational systems and in the labor markets, including jobs for asylees. Dual citizenships and circular migration contracts are possible instruments. Migration policy can be an effective development policy.

F24|Post electoral crisis and international remittances: Evidence from Côte d'Ivoire|This paper analyzes the determinants of international remittances received during the post electoral crisis in Côte d'Ivoire, using data collected 5 months after the end of the conflict. The author finds that the crisis has been a means of mobilizing social capital and demonstrating altruistic and insurance behaviors beyond the bounds of kinship. Transfers are mainly sent for consumption purpose, but amounts transferred for small investments and human capital are higher. Moreover, the propensity to transfer higher amounts decreases when emigration occurred after the November 2004 violent events. Altruism resists to time.

Using panel data, the results indicate that migrants send remittances to this region mostly for reasons of altruism, being of main impact the variables of the host country. Also, it concludes that remittances are determined by variables that directly affect the income of migrants.
F24|‘Smart development’. An essay on a new political economy of the environment|In this book, we present a first empirical reflection on ‘smart development’, its measurement and its possible ‘drivers’ and ‘bottlenecks’. We first provide cross-national data, how much ecological footprint is used in the nations of the world system to ‘deliver’ a given amount of democracy, economic growth, gender equality, human development, research and development, and social cohesion. To this end, we first developed UNDP-type performance indicators from current standard international comparative, cross-national social science data on these six main dimensions of development and on the combined performance on the six dimensions (a UNDP type ‘human development index plus’). We then show the non-linear standard OLS regression trade-offs between ecological footprints per capita and their square on these six components of development and the overall super-UNDP development performance index, derived from them. The residuals from these regressions are our new measures of smart development: a maximum of democracy, economic growth, gender equality, human development, research and development, social cohesion, and their combination with a minimum of ecological footprint. Our estimates underline the enormous importance of the positive effects of received worker remittances on smart development.
F24|Дознаке: Између Потрошње И Акумулације<BR>[Remittances: between consumption and accumulation]|This paper considers remittances as a source of (foreign) assets that Serbia has been using in the recent years, just like many other countries, predominantly underdeveloped ones. The volume and importance of these assets has been compared to other available sources (privatization revenues, foreign direct investments, foreign loans). In contrast to these other assets, remittances are characterized by stability. Therefore a decrease in the inflow of remittances should not be expected in the near future. This makes it possible to establish measures for a productive use of these assets through economic and development policies, which would fuel the economic development of Serbia. Since a mechanism which would enable a productive use of these assets hasn’t been set up so far, they have mostly been used for consumption. In the upcoming period it is necessary to establish mechanisms that would make it possible to transform the remittances into accumulation and in this way contribute to the recovery and development of the Serbian economy. У овом раду се разматрају дознаке као извор (иностраних) средстава који је и Србија, као и многе друге земље, пре свега земље у развоју, користила у претходним годинама. Указује се на величину и значај тих средстава, у односу на друге изворе који су земљи били на располагању (приходи од приватизације, стране директне инвестиције, инострани кредити). За разлику од тих других средстава, дознаке у основи карактерише стабилност, тако да и у наредном периоду треба очекивати даљи, углавном несмањен прилив по том основу. То у значајној мери омогућује економској и развојној политици да рачуна с приливом ових средстава и да адекватним мерама стимулише штедњу и инвестиције, што би омогућило покретање развоја. Пошто до сада није разрађен механизам који би омогућавао продуктивно коришћење средстава од дознака, оне су углавном коришћене за потрошњу, као уосталом и други поменути извори. У наредном периоду управо је потребно разрадити механизме који ће омогућити да дознаке постану извор акумулације и тако допринесу обнови и развоју привреде Србије.
F24|Risk sharing among economic sectors|We investigate risk sharing channels across different economic sectors to quantify to what extent they contribute offsetting idiosyncratic shocks. We examine the two most relevant channels of smoothing among OECD and EU countries: the international investment income and the savings channels. We find that the households' share in net foreign asset income has a significant role in risk sharing. This surprising result is strictly related to the accumulation of households' foreign asset holdings. On the contrary, governments' cross-border holdings produce a dis-smoothing effect and this might be imputable to the holding of EU countries' assets. This outcome is reversed for the new EU countries in the post Global Financial Crisis (GFC) period. With regard to the savings channel, we find that governments significantly contribute to risk sharing, and more significantly after the inception of the GFC. Moreover, the dividend smoothing theory reconciles with the risk-sharing findings since corporations (in particular non financial) significantly smooth shocks through their savings, however their contribution to risk sharing is weak in the post-GFC era.
F24|Remittances and Asset Accumulation of Household in Pakistan|Assets accumulated by household is important topic, it is investment by household to maximise their utility for present time and for future. It is stock investment which help the household to use these assets in tough time. How income receive to household from three sources i.e. labour income, internal remittances, and external remittances effect assets accumulation of household is the topic for investigation in this paper. This paper analyses the effect of remittances on aggregate household’s assets of Pakistan by using Probit model estimated through maximum likelihood method. Finding of this paper shows that external remittances positively and significantly affect assets accumulation of aggregate household of Pakistan. Results of the paper are closest to theoretical idea that remittances have significantly affect the asset accumulation of household.
F24|Macroeconomic Determinants of Migrants’ Remittances: Evidence from a Panel of Developing Countries|This work aims to assess the various macroeconomic determinants of migrants’ remittances for a panel of 22 developing countries highly dependent observed over the period 1990 to 2014. The results underline the importance of the origin country’s GDP, the host country’s GDP, inflation, financial development and institutional quality as major determinants of personal remittances. However, the migrant stock, the official exchange rate and the real interest rate in the country of origin do not have a significant influence on remittances received by the panel considered.
F24|Do Remittances Cause Dutch Disease in Resource Poor Countries of Central Asia?|Dutch disease or resource curse is an adverse effect of high dependence on exports of natural resources, such as oil and gas, or other inflows, such as remittances or foreign aid. Dutch disease is known to lead to appreciation of the real exchange rate, decline in tradable sectors (mostly industry and agriculture) and surge in non-tradable sectors (services). This means unfavourable development of an economy where retail trade or construction would grow, but production sectors would be atrophied. Such economies become vulnerable and may suffer if inflow of currency from natural resources or remittances dries out. This study tests whether large inflow of foreign currency coming to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan from labour migrants has caused Dutch disease as described by Corden (1984) and Corden and Neary (1982): appreciation of the real exchange rate, decline in tradable sectors and surge in non-tradable sectors. Furthermore, the paper takes one step further and looks at this phenomenon from the point of view of importing Dutch disease from resource-rich countries to resource-poor countries. Results show that symptoms of Dutch disease are present in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. There is an evidence of deindustrialisation, higher growth rates and larger share of service sector in GDP. In addition, high oil prices showed strong appreciation effect on local currencies of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan indicating the transfer of Dutch disease from resource-rich Russia.
F24|Remittances And Growth In Tunisia: A Daynamic Panel Analysis From A Sectoral Database|This paper uses a sectoral data set from Tunisia to analyze how the remittances affect the economic growth during over the period from 1987 to 2012. To achieve this objective we use a sectoral database of remittances allocated to investment, in contrast with the majority of studies which have used all the amount of remittances. We assume that using remittances allocated to investment can generate a direct and more significant effect on growth. Our empirical analysis is based on the dynamic panel approach (GMM method) and conducted on a sample of 3 economic sectors (Agriculture, industry and services). The findings of this paper suggest that remittances have significantly contributed to economic growth. In spite of the amount of remittances allocated to investment is smaller than the one allocated to consumption, remittances enhance the share of the sectoral value added in GDP in the economy. Indeed, 1% increase in remittances allocated to investment would increase the VA/GDP ratio by 1% to 4%. The study also finds that investment and Labor constitute the major contributors of the economic growth in Tunisia. However, the technical efficiency is negative. Further, in the Tunisian context characterized by a high unemployment rate and great regional disparities, remittances can play an important role. Therefore, some policy implications can be proposed such as for example an incentive policy to encourage migrants to remit more funds and to invest in productive fields. This can be achieved by reinforcing social networks, reviewing the current remittances fees, and ameliorating the affairs climate essentially at the regional level.
F24|Diaspora Remittance Inflow, Financial Development and the Industrialisation of Africa|The paper assesses how remittances directly and indirectly affect industrialisation in a panel of 49 African countries for the period 1980-2014. The indirect impact is assessed through financial development channels. The empirical evidence is based on three interactive and non-interactive simultaneity-robust estimation techniques, namely: (i) Instrumental Fixed Effects (FE) to control for the unobserved heterogeneity; (ii) Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) to control for persistence in industrialisation and (iii) Instrumental Quantile Regressions (QR) to account for initial levels of industrialisation. The non-interactive specification elucidates direct effects of remittances on industrialisation whereas interactive specifications explain indirect impacts. The findings broadly show that for certain initial levels of industrialisation, remittances can drive industrialisation through the financial development mechanism. Policy implications are discussed.
F24|China’s rural – urban migration: Who gains, who loses?|There is a price to pay for any and every country to develop. This price can be said to have been duly paid by migrant workers in China. The benefit of such price is the stamping out of extreme poverty by 94% from 1990 – 2015. This study is embodied by the Lewis Structural Change Model and looks at China’s population control programs – the restriction on internal labor mobility, its income inequality implication and economy development. The research reveals how the sacrifices of the migrant workers payoff in reforming the economic conditions in the rural areas; this points to the reasons why the rural income and development are highly dependent on migrant remittance and why China’s economy development would not have been possible without labor migration.
F24|Analysis of 'Dutch Disease Effects' on Asian Economies|This chapter addresses the issue of the Dutch Disease in relationship with capital inflows through exporting natural resources, accepting foreign aids and emigrant remittances. The analysis focuses on Asian economies that are expected to sustain their growth and adopts a vector auto-regression model with Granger causality and impulse response tests. The main findings are as follows. Firstly, from the perspective of natural-resource abundance in Asian economies, the Dutch Disease was identified for 1980-1995, but not for 1995-2014, probably because of their institutional improvements. Secondly, in the economies of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Vietnam, their accepted foreign aids have not caused the Dutch Disease and have rather promoted their economic growth, due to their aid contributions to infrastructure development. Thirdly, regarding the Dutch Disease effects of emigrant remittances, the disease was verified in Nepal but not in Bangladesh, due to their different demand structures and policy efforts.
F24|Migration of Bulgarian Population – Characteristics and Relations to the Regional Socio-Economic Disparities|The paper suggests a short overview of migration processes in Bulgaria since the start of its democratization and transition to market economy. The socio-demographic structure of both potential and return migrants is evaluated empirically using a large sample data for 2013 representative for Bulgarian population aged 18-65. On the basis of a ranking of Bulgarian regions and districts by an integral score of their socio-economic development (involving a set of development indicators) a range of regional disparities are revealed in respect of migration potential, return migration, and remittances allocation and utilization. The rich empirical evidence suggests that Bulgarian migration policies should emphasize substantially on the issues of regional disbalances in order to offset the evaluated distortions.
F24|The Bulgarian Community in Spain (Will the Bulgarians Return from Spain?)|"The article presents a selection of results from a representative sample survey among the Bulgarian population residing in Spain. The sample includes 506 individuals living in 25 different settlements in this country interviewed in 2011. The data provides various opportunities for deriving social, demographic, and economic status of Bulgarians residing in Spain. The transfer behavior of Bulgarians in this country is compared to the practices revealed by return migrants studied in the framework of a representative survey conducted in Bulgaria. The article suggests evidence about the degree of knowledge of Bulgarian language by the youngest generation as well as the frequency of contacts between the Bulgarian Diaspora and the relatives left behind. The question ""Will the Bulgarians return from Spain?"" is discussed as well."
F24|L'agence sociale compte! - Des entrepreneurs migrants africains et chinois comme acteurs de changement<BR>[Social Agency matters! - African and Chinese migrant entrepreneurs as agents of change]|"English Abstract: [Social Agency matters! - African and Chinese entrepreneurs as agents of change] - The book reviewed, edited by Laurence Marfaing and Karsten Giese, documents a research project, on-going since six years, at the German Institute of Global and Area Studies (GIGA-Hamburg) which combines African and Sinologist perspectives. The publication in French, can be seen as advantage and disadvantage at the same time. Considering the lack of French edited publications on this subject and the deplorable language-divide between Anglophone and Francophone Africa, the chapters (some of them translated from English) are certainly most welcomed by French speaking African readers and scholars alike. Thus, they gain the unique possibility to become familiar with the results of painstaking studies by spearheading researchers in this field of study. Some of the contributions are revised papers, originally presented at a workshop at Dakar organised by the editors in January 2013 within the framework of the program Point Sud, an International Centre for Research on Local Knowledge in Bamako (Mali). The introduction by the editors, written jointly with their research collaborator, Alena Thiel, develops the Leitmotiv of the book. It aptly captures the essence of the research findings presented in its title: ""From rejecting the other to mutual involvement of both parties in the dynamics of social change"". In fact, the relations of Chinese and African petty traders and their mutual perception have changed fundamentally since the xenophobe manifestations against 'the Chinese' in several African towns as well as mutual incomprehension of both in Chinese towns (mostly in the urban districts Xiaobei and Sanyuanli of Guangzhou) where migrant African entrepreneurs arrived in the early 2000s. Many, if not most of them did not come to stay in the host country permanently, but they acted rather as sojourner, exploring the terrain in search of profitable trade, that is, Chinese imports of cheap consumer goods to Africa. Their mutual economic interest was based not so much on the general impact of political and economic globalisation but more specifically on the development of Chinese industrial production that facilitated Africans access to the desired Western products at an affordable price. Thus, these entrepreneurial migrants, who incorporated globalisation from below in their very transnational economic practices, became themselves carriers of social and economic transformations in their respective host countries. The realm of these transformations covered a remarkable range, from specific access strategies to resources and social mobility, changing consumer behaviour, new norms and practices up to modifications of taste and ways of life. French Abstract: [L'agence sociale compte! - Les entrepreneurs africains et chinois en tant qu'agents du changement] - Le livre revu, édité par Laurence Marfaing et Karsten Giese, documente un projet de recherche en cours depuis six ans à l'Institut allemand des études mondiales et régionales (GIGA-Hambourg). Les cultures africaines et chinoises sont analysé simultanément d'un point de vue africain et sinologique. La publication en français peut être considéré comme un avantage et un inconvénient en même temps. Considérant le manque de publications éditées en français sur ce sujet et le fossé linguistique déplorable entre l'Afrique anglophone et l'Afrique francophone, les chapitres (certains d'entre eux traduits de l'anglais) sont certainement les bienvenus parmi les lecteurs et chercheurs africains francophones. Ainsi, ils ont la possibilité unique de se familiariser avec les résultats d'études minutieuses des chercheurs specialisés dans ce domaine d'étude. Certaines des contributions sont des documents révisés, initialement présentés lors d'un atelier organisé à Dakar par les éditeurs en janvier 2013 dans le cadre du programme Point Sud, un Centre international de recherche sur les savoirs locaux à Bamako (Mali). L'introduction par les rédacteurs, écrite conjointement avec leur collaborateur de recherche, Alena Thiel, développe le Leitmotiv du livre. Il capture judicieusement l'essence des résultats de recherche présentés dans son titre: «De reject de l'autre à l'implication mutuelle des deux parties dans la dynamique du changement social». En fait, les relations des petits commerçants chinois et africains et leur perception mutuelle ont changé fondamentalement depuis les manifestations xénophobes contre les «Chinois» dans plusieurs villes africaines ainsi que l'incompréhension mutuelle des deux groupes dans les villes chinoises (principalement dans les districts urbains Xiaobei et Sanyuanli de Guangzhou) où les entrepreneurs africains migrants sont arrivés au début des années 2000. Beaucoup, sinon la plupart d'entre eux ne sont pas restés dans le pays d'accueil en permanence, mais ils ont plutôt agi en tant que agents, explorant le terrain à la recherche de commerce rentable, c'est-à-dire des importations chinoises de biens de consommation bon marché. Leur intérêt économique mutuel ne reposait pas tant sur l'impact général de la mondialisation politique et économique que sur le développement de la production industrielle chinoise qui facilitait l'accès des Africains aux produits occidentaux désirés à un prix abordable. Ainsi, ces migrants entrepreneurs, qui ont intégré la mondialisation d'en bas dans leurs pratiques économiques très transnationales, sont devenus eux-mêmes porteurs de transformations sociales et économiques dans leurs pays d'accueil respectifs. Le domaine de ces transformations couvrait une gamme remarquable allant des stratégies d'accès spécifiques aux ressources et à la mobilité sociale, en passant par le changement du comportement des consommateurs, de nouvelles normes et pratiques jusqu'aux modifications du goût et des modes de vie. German Abstract: [Gesellschaftliches Handeln zählt! - Afrikanische und chinesische Unternehmer als Motor des Wandels] - Das rezensierte Buch, herausgegeben von Laurence Marfaing und Karsten Giese, dokumentiert ein seit sechs Jahren laufendes Forschungsprojekt am German Institute of Global and Area Studies (GIGA-Hamburg), das afrikanische und afrikanische Kulturen simultan analysiert, sowohl aus afrikanischer als auch sinologischer Perspektive. Die Publikation in Französisch, kann sowohl als Vorteil, als auch als Nachteil zugleich gesehen werden. In Anbetracht des Mangels an französischen Publikationen zu diesem Thema und der beklagenswerten Kluft zwischen dem anglophonen und dem frankophonen Afrika, sind die Kapitel (von denen einige aus dem Englischen übersetzt wurden) sicherlich bei französischsprachigen afrikanischen Lesern und Wissenschaftlern sehr willkommen. Dadurch erhalten sie die einzigartige Möglichkeit, sich mit den Ergebnissen der fundierten Studien von führenden Forschern auf diesem Gebiet vertraut zu machen. Einige der Beiträge sind überarbeitete und aktualisierte Studien, die ursprünglich im Rahmen eines im Januar 2013 organisierten Workshops in Dakar im Rahmen des Programms Point Sud, einem internationalen Zentrum für lokale Wissensforschung in Bamako (Mali), vorgestellt wurden. Die Einführung des Buches, von den Herausgebern gemeinsam mit ihrer Forschungskollegin Alena Thiel geschrieben, entwickelt das Leitmotiv des Buches. Es fasst treffend die Essenz der Forschungsergebnisse zusammen, die in seinem Titel dargestellt sind: ""Von der Ablehnung des Anderen zur gegenseitigen Beteiligung beider Parteien an der Dynamik des sozialen Wandels"". In der Tat haben sich die Beziehungen zwischen chinesischen und afrikanischen Kleinhändlern und ihre gegenseitige Wahrnehmung seit den fremdenfeindlichen Kundgebungen gegen ""die Chinesen"" in mehreren afrikanischen sowie chinesischen Städten (hauptsächlich in den Stadtbezirken Xiaobei und Sanyuanli von Guangzhou), wo afrikanische Unternehmer zu Beginn der 2000er Jahre eintrafen, grundlegend verändert. Viele, wenn nicht die meisten von ihnen, blieben nicht dauerhaft im Gastland, sondern sie agierten eher als Reisende, die das Terrain auf der Suche nach profitablem Handel erkundeten, d.h. nach chinesischen Importen billiger Konsumgüter nach Afrika. Ihr beiderseitiges wirtschaftliches Interesse basierte nicht so sehr auf den allgemeinen Auswirkungen der politischen und wirtschaftlichen Globalisierung, sondern insbesondere auf der Entwicklung der chinesischen Industrieproduktion, die den Afrikanern den Zugang zu den (nachgebauten) gewünschten westlichen Produkten zu einem erschwinglichen Preis erleichterte. So wurden diese unternehmerischen Migranten, die die Globalisierung von unten in ihre transnationalen Wirtschaftspraktiken einbrachten, selbst Träger von sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Transformationen in ihren jeweiligen Gastländern. Die Bandbreite dieser Transformationen reichte von spezifischen Zugangsstrategien über Ressourcen und soziale Mobilität, wechselndes Konsumverhalten, neue Normen und Praktiken bis hin zu Geschmacks- und Lebensmodifikationen."
F24|Toward Understanding Outbound GCC International Tourism: The Role of Expatriates and Institutional Quality|This paper employs the gravity model using panel data analysis techniques to explain the dynamics of tourism outflows from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to high-, middle-, and low-income countries. The results show that, among other known variables, immigrants living in the GCC region have rendered a positive advertising impact on outbound tourism destination decisions in GCC citizens. Apart from the immigrant effect, institutional quality in the destination country is a key determinant of outbound GCC tourism.
F24|What Mitigates Economic Growth Volatility in Morocco? : Remittances or FDI|The purpose of the paper is twofold. First, it seeks to meticulously analyze the volatility of economic growth and financial flows in the case of Morocco, i.e., remittances and Foreign Direct Investment. Second, it attempts to address the effects of these financial flows on the economic growth volatility. We provide strong evidence that remittances are less volatile than Foreign Direct Investment with respect to the duration, intensity and volatility clustering. Furthermore, remittances can mitigate the volatility of growth, while Foreign Direct Investment flows amplify it. Our results do not imply that financial flows should be privileged by Moroccan authorities. In fact, our results should encourage the government to implement proactive and favourable policies geared towards productive investment.
F24|Las Transferencias Monetarias y su Impacto en la Pobreza de la Región Tradicional en México|Based on the monetary approach, the poverty line method and static microsimulation, poverty is estimated and the impact of monetary transfers is evaluated. Poverty is greater in the region than in the country. Remittances have a greater impact on poverty in the region, whereas Oportunidades transfers have a greater impact at country level on food and capacity poverty types. Remittances benefited Zacatecas, Durango and Guanajuato the most, and Oportunidades transfers benefited Zacatecas, San Luis Potosí and Michoacán. The information is obtained from ENIGH provided by INEGI (2010, 2012).
F24|Do Remittances Hurt Domestic Prices? New Evidence from Low, Lower-Middle and Middle–Income Groups|We examine the remittances-inflation Nexus using System Generalized Method of Moments and bootstrap panel Granger causality approach. This study selected 58 countries from low, lower-middle and middle-income groups and tested the relationship using newly constructed remittances series. The outcome using the SGMM approach reveals that remittances have a negative and significant impact on inflation in low and lower-middle income countries, while positively influencing it in the middle-income group. Furthermore, remittances used for consumption and saving cause inflationary situation only in low and lower-middle income groups. The bootstrap panel Granger test results show that remittances have a strong impact on the prices of the lower-middle income countries. However, we find causality evidence only in one-fifth of the low and one-fourth of the middle-income countries. In general, the results are more country specific. The outcomes have significant policy implications for the researchers and decision-makers targeting the groups under study.
F24|Financial Development, Remittances and Economic Growth: Evidence Using a Dynamic Panel Estimation|This study examines how remittances can influence economic growth under different levels of financial development. Using a dynamic panel estimation of 33 top remittance-recipient developing countries from 1979 to 2011, the results suggest that financial development neither works as a substitute nor a complement for the remittanceâ€“growth nexus. While remittances are effective in promoting economic growth, the influence of financial variables is found to be insignificant. More developed financial systems may attract more remittances; however, the interaction effect of financial development and remittances is not growth enhancing. Promoting financial literacy, reducing the cost of sending remittances through banks and encouraging the overall use of formal financial institutions may induce a stronger remittanceâ€“growth nexus.

F24|International Migration, Remittances and Labour Force Participation of Left-behind Family Members: A Study of Kerala|The article examines the impact of international migration on the labour supply of male and female left-behind household members in both market and non-market work. In addition, we examine the labour supply behaviour of women whose husbands have migrated abroad. After controlling for potential endogeneity using the instrument variable (IV-probit) approach, estimates show that the supply of male and female left-behind members in market work decreases. While international migration results in the relocation of labour supply of male left-behind members from salary and casual wage workers to self-employed workers, it increases female left-behind membersâ€™ participation in household duties and reduces their participation in unpaid family work. The heterogeneity effect confirms that the impact of international migration is greater in rural than in urban areas. JEL Classification: F22, F24, J21, J24, J16, J61
F24|Remit for what? The Impact of Information Asymmetries in Transnational Households|The main purpose of this paper is to check whether information asymmetry may affect the allocation of a given budget between in-kind consumption-type goods and in-kind investment-type choices. In order to test the model, we use the results of a lab-in-the-field experiment where migrants engage in a dictator game and are asked to earmark a given budget between consumption and investment goods to be delivered to the most closely connected household (MCCH). Three different scenarios of information sharing with the MCCH on the choices made by the migrant are considered – private information, full information sharing and information sharing with a social excuse for investment goods. Empirical results confirm that under private information investment goods are preferred, whereas under full information sharing we observe a significant bias towards consumption goods (about 70 euros more out of a total budget value of 1000 euros, i.e. 7%). This behavior under different information sharing scenarios may be interpreted as evidence of self-interest motives to remit rather than pure altruism.
F24|Экономика Таджикистана в XXI веке – взгляд со стороны. The economy of Tadjikistan in the XXI century – a view from side|В работе изложены результаты сравнительного анализа отдельных макроэкономических показателей экономики Таджикистана в сопоставлении с данными по другим странам постсоветского пространства и особенно ближайших соседей. Объясняются причины высоких темпов роста производства и потребления в период 2001–2014 гг., специфика внутренних и внешних факторов этого роста, важнейшим среди которых стал экспорт рабочей силы из Таджикистана в Россию, причины крайне низких формальных душевых показателей ВВП и конечного потребления, главной из которых является отраслевая структура экономики республики. Показана некорректность использования формальных статистических показателей для сравнительной межстрановой оценки реальных уровней производства и потребления. The paper presents the results of a comparative analysis of certain macroeconomic indicators of Tadjikistan’s economy in comparison with other post-Soviet countries and especially the immediate neighbors. In the study we explained the reasons for the high growth rates of production and consumption in the period from 2001 to 2014. Considered are specifics of internal and external factors of the growth, the most important of which was the labor export from Tadjikistan to Russia, and the reasons for extremely low formal GDP per capita and final consumption with the sectoral structure of the republic’s economy being the key factor. The use of the formal statistical indicators for comparative cross-country estimation of the real levels of production and consumption are proved incorrect.
F24|The Impact of Natural Disasters on Remittances to Low- and Middle-Income Countries| In this paper, we offer novel empirical evidence on the impact of natural disasters on remittance flows towards low- and middle-income countries. We consider a panel of 98 countries over the period 1990–2010. Our findings show that remittances increase after a disaster, thus contributing ex post to the reconstruction process. At the same time, we find that remittances play a key role in terms of ex ante risk preparedness for those countries that experienced more disruptive events in the past. Finally, when taking into account the interaction with the level of development of the local financial sector, remittances seem to substitute for less efficient financial systems both in terms of ex post response to disasters and in terms of ex ante risk management strategy.
F24|Remittances and child labor in Bolivia|This article explores the effect of remittances on the prevalence and intensity of child labor in Bolivia. Using household survey data, we find that children in remittance-receiving households are less likely to be actively supplying labor, and the number of hours worked per week declines with the size of remittances received. The size of the impact varies between urban and rural households. Remittances to urban households have a larger impact on moving children completely out of the labor force, but a smaller increase in remittance size is needed for an equal reduction in number of hours worked in rural areas.

F24|Steady streams and sudden bursts: persistence patterns in remittance decisions|This paper is the first systematic attempt to investigate the factors affecting time persistence in individual remittance behaviour. By using micro-level longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), we apply a wide variety of discrete choice static and dynamic panel models to analyse the decision to remit. Our results provide evidence in favour of an intertemporal strategy. The persistence in remittance decisions is significantly influenced by “true state dependence”: migrants that remitted in the previous year have a significantly higher propensity to remit this year as well. We also show that remittance time patterns depend on both observable and unobservable individual socioeconomic characteristics, and in particular, that the household’s transnational composition plays an important role in determining remittance behaviour.

F24|Les Motivations Microéconomiques Des Transferts De Fonds Au Burkina Faso : La Culture Est-Elle Déterminante ?|Cet article analyse les déterminants des transferts de fonds des mi-grants burkinabè vivant en Côte d’Ivoire. Pour ce faire, nous avons effectué une enquête de terrain où les migrants interrogés ont été sélectionnés par la mé-thode « boule de neige ». A l’aide d’un modèle Tobit les résultats économé-triques montrent que les transferts de fonds des migrants burkinabè sont guidés par des motifs subjectifs et des traits culturels où dominent le sentiment d’attachement à leur pays, l’altruisme, l’entraide, l’esprit communautaire, la solidarité et le conformisme.
F24|Diaspora economics: new perspectives|Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new field and suggest a new research agenda. Design/methodology/approach - Combine ethnicity, migration and international relations into a new thinking. Provide a typology of diaspora and a thorough evaluation of its role and the roles of the home and host countries. Findings - Diaspora economics is more than a new word for migration economics. It opens a new strand to political economy. Diaspora is perceived to be a well-defined group of migrants and their offspring with a joined cultural identity and ongoing identification with the country or culture of origin. This implies the potential to undermine the nation-state. Diasporas can shape policies in the host countries. Originality/value - Provide a new understanding of global human relations.
F24|On the fungibility of public and private transfers: A mental accounting approach|A common assumption in economics is that money is fungible. In other words, spending patterns do not depend on the source of income, only on the total amount. The mental accounting theory, however, rejects this assumption by arguing that people compartmentalise their income into different mental accounts and decide on their consumption within each of these accounts. In this paper I hypothesise that households differently associate a private transfer coming from a migrant than a public transfer received from the government, and that this impacts the way transfers are spent. By analysing the first nationally representative longitudinal survey in South Africa, covering the years 2008, 2010 and 2012, I find evidence that public and private transfers are not spent in the same way.
F24|Can Remittances Buy Peace?|In this paper I study the effect of remittance flows on conflict incidence, onset, and duration in recipient countries. I improve on previous studies by controlling for unobserved country specifc effects, serial correlation, and the possible endogenous relationship between conflict and the tendency for a country to receive remittances. I found that remittance flows have a significant negative causal effect on the incidence and continuation of conflicts. There is no such effect for conflict onset. I also develop a theory which demonstrate that increases in remittance flows can alter the incentives of participating in a rebellion thereby encouraging a deescalation of hostilities and, consequently, a reduction in the number of battle-related deaths.
F24|Financial Linkages, Remittances, and Resource Dependence in East Asia|The purpose of this book is to empirically analyse the multifaceted nature of financial linkages in East Asia and to discuss the key policy challenges faced by the region's economies. Although the emphasis is placed on East Asia, some of the chapters cover a broader area of countries depending on the aim of the study. Particular areas of focus in these studies include: the evolution of cross-border financial linkages in East Asia; long-run economic consequences of remittance inflows and natural resource dependence; and policy priorities for the financial integration and management of resource-rich economies.

F24|Remittances and the Brain Drain: Evidence from Microdata for Sub-Saharan Africa| Based on unique microdata from five Sub-Saharan African countries that contain comprehensive information on both migrants and their households at the origin country, we investigate the effect of migrants’ education on their remittance behaviour. Our results reveal that migrants’ education has no impact on the likelihood of sending remittances, but a positive effect on the amount of money sent, conditional on remitting. The latter effect holds for internal migrants and migrants in non-OECD countries, while it vanishes for migrants in OECD destination countries once characteristics of the origin household are controlled for.

F24|The Macroeconomic Impact of Remittances: A Sending Country Perspective|Remittances are for a large number of developing countries the most important source of foreign funding. Destination countries of migration, however, fear a outflow of financial funds. Using data for Germany, we analyze the impact of remittances and migration on one of the major sending countries of remittances and the third biggest exporter in the world. For this purpose, we develop a dynamic open-economy general equilibrium model with altruistic households. By estimating the interrelation between household characteristics and remittances, we are able to derive altruism coefficients for different types of households. Households with a higher altruism coefficient derive higher utility from consumption by distant relatives and send more remittances. We endogenize remittances flows by applying these coefficients to our model. Remittance outflows have then a depreciating effect on the real exchange rate and provide incentives to reallocate resources from the non-tradable goods to the tradable goods sectors. In the case of Germany, this translates into a opposite Dutch disease phenomenon.
F24|Remittances and public finances: Evidence from oil-price shocks|We study the effect of inflowing remittances – a major source of capital for many countries – on tax revenues and tax policy. Instrumenting remittances with changes in the oil-price interacted with a country's distance to oil-producing countries, we find that remittances have a large positive effect on VAT revenues, but no effect on income-tax revenues. This suggests that remittances often escape the income tax but can be taxed via consumption. We further show that tax policy is responsive to shocks in incoming remittances; they lead to a decrease in VAT-rates and increase the likelihood for a VAT introduction. We find no evidence for effects of remittances on income-tax rates.

F24|The Economics of Temporary Migrations|Many migrations are temporary -- a fact that has often been ignored in the economic literature on migration. Such omission may be serious in that expected migration temporariness can impart a distinct dynamic element to immigrants' economic behavior, generating possible consequences for nonmigrants in both home and host countries. In this paper, we provide a thorough examination of the various aspects of temporary migrations that matter for the analysis of economic phenomena. We demonstrate the extent of temporary migrations in population movements. We show how temporariness can affect the various economic choices and how better data have improved both the measurement of nonpermanent migrations and the analyses of various aspects of migrant behavior. We propose a general theoretical framework for modeling temporary migration decisions, based on which we outline the various motives for temporariness while simultaneously reviewing related literature and available data sources. We discuss the possible consequences of migration temporariness for nonmigrants in both home and host countries. (JEL F22, F24, J11, J61, K37, O15)
F24|Diaspora Remittance Inflow, Financial Development and the Industrialisation of Africa|The paper assesses how remittances directly and indirectly affect industrialisation in a panel of 49 African countries for the period 1980-2014. The indirect impact is assessed through financial development channels. The empirical evidence is based on three interactive and non-interactive simultaneity-robust estimation techniques, namely: (i) Instrumental Fixed Effects (FE) to control for the unobserved heterogeneity; (ii) Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) to control for persistence in industrialisation and (iii) Instrumental Quantile Regressions (QR) to account for initial levels of industrialisation. The non-interactive specification elucidates direct effects of remittances on industrialisation whereas interactive specifications explain indirect impacts. The findings broadly show that for certain initial levels of industrialisation, remittances can drive industrialisation through the financial development mechanism. Policy implications are discussed.
F24|Migration and household decision on occupational choice and investment: Evidence from Bangladesh| We study the roles of migration and remittances along with other income sources on investment decisions in rural Bangladesh. We estimate households’ investment equations conditional on their participation in and income from alternative (farm and non-farm) activities in the context of household’s current endowments and existing market structures. Using a true household-level panel data from rural Bangladesh covering 2000, 2004, and 2008 with 1223 sample points, we estimate the effects of migration and remittances on household’s investment in own cultivated land, land rent out to other households, livestock and non-farm business capital. Results show that remittances decrease household own cultivated land and also decrease land rent out to other households. We explain this result by controlling households labor endowments, education status and existing market imperfections. Our results also show that female headed households overall invest less in self-employment activities when they receive remittances. We find that remittances have little investment effects in general which is expected result given the overall low productive investment rate of remittance receiving households in Bangladesh.
F24|State dependence and unobserved heterogeneity in a double hurdle model for remittances: evidence from immigrants to Germany|The empirical modelling of remitting behaviour has been the object of a considerable amount of micro-level literature. The increasing availability of panel datasets makes it possible to explore the persistence in transfer decisions as a result of intertemporal choices, that may be consistent with several motivations to remit. Building a dynamic model with panel data poses the additional problem of dealing properly with permanent unobserved heterogeneity; moreover, the specific censored nature of international transfers has to be accounted for as well. In this paper, we propose a dynamic, random-effects double hurdle model for remittances: we combine the Maximum Likelihood estimator of the traditional double hurdle model for cross-section data (Jones, 1989) with the approach put forward by Heckman (1981b) for dealing with state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity in a non-linear setting. Our empirical evidence based on the German SOEP dataset suggests that there is significant state dependence in remitting behaviour consistent with migrants. intertemporal allocation of savings; at the same time, transaction costs are likely to affect the steadiness of transfers over time.
F24|International Private Transfers and Optimal Tax Structure in Developing Economies|In this paper we examine the optimal tax structure for a developing economy with international inter-family transfers. Our analysis characterizes conditions to identify the main determinants of the design of both the commodity and income tax. We find that these determinants change depending on the signs and values of the direct and cross price elasticities. A benchmark result of the literature suggests that the aggregate level of consumption, the weighted tax burdens from consumption and the efficiency costs of commodity taxes are the main determinants of a commodity tax. Our analysis suggests additional determinants, such as the aggregate level of income, the socially weighted aggregate level of labor income and the weighted aggregate elasticity of the supply of labor and income. A similar conclusion is obtained for the determinants of the income tax. Our analysis also provides a rationale to limit the use of the commodity tax and to increase the size of the income tax on the tax structure of this economy.
F24|"Remittances of foreign workers in Italy: an estimation of invisible flows in the ""informal channel"""|This paper examines the determinants of outgoing remittances from Italy and presents a methodology for quantifying the share of remittances not sent via official intermediaries (money transfer operators, banks, post offices) but transferred through informal channels and hence not measured and not included in official data. The existence of invisible flows can be inferred from the positive and statistically significant empirical relation between distance of the recipient country and average per capita remittance, after controlling for all other relevant explanatory variables. Such a relation should be null or non-significant if flows were observed in their entirety. Exploiting this empirical relation and relying on the detailed geographical breakdown of the data collected by the Bank of Italy, our proposed methodology estimates the informal channel to account for between 10 and 30 per cent of total outflows, mostly directed to countries closer to Italy. Our analysis shows a reduction in the share of informal remittances on total outflows: over the ten-year observation period it has shrunk by about 20 per cent.
F24|Choques externos y remesas internacionales en las regiones de Colombia|Este documento estudia el efecto de choques externos sobre el ingreso de los hogares desde una perspectiva regional. Las medidas de choques externos ponderan el crecimiento económico de los países receptores por los flujos de migraciones de cada región. Los efectos se estiman con modelos de diferencias en diferencias en una muestra de encuestas de hogares que va de 2007 a 2015. Los resultados muestran que el buen desempeño económico en los países receptores se traduce en mayores ingresos en las regiones de alta migración, lo que se explica en gran medida por el aumento en las remesas. Las mayores ganancias se registran en los ingresos laborales de las familias no-receptoras de remesas, lo cual indica que las remesas generan importantes externalidades positivas. En otras medidas de calidad de vida, como afiliación en salud, asistencia escolar y trabajo infantil, los efectos estimados tienden a ser más pequeños y a variar por países.

F24|A Tacit Monetary Policy of the Gulf Countries: Is There a Remittances Channel?|The strong economic ties between the GCC economies and the U.S. are manifested in three ways: currency peg, coupling of monetary policy, and the adoption of the U.S. dollar as the trading currency for oil. This paper examines how these dynamics result in a misalignment of the U.S. monetary policy with the business cycles of the GCC economies. The study shows how the staggering amount of remittances outflow of the GCC economies plays a stabilizing role as a tacit monetary policy tool. Incorporating remittances in the money demand equation results in a more robust model than otherwise. We further find that the effect of the Federal Funds rate on money demand in these countries diminishes in significance during the period of oil boom between 2002 and 2009. However, the transmission effect of the recession periods in the U.S. into the demand for money in the GCC countries is not statistically significant.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F24|The Effects of Remittances on Output per Worker in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Production Function Approach|This paper uses a production function to examine the channels through which remittances affect output per worker in 31 Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries from 1980-2010. We find that remittances directly increase output per worker if complemented with education. The indirect effects vary with the economic characteristics of the recipient nations: while remittances have increased human capital among the low-income nations, among the upper-middle-income nations, they have mostly increased total factor productivity, but are still inversely related to factor inputs among the lower-middle-income nations of SSA. Finally, remittances are more effective when institutional risk is reducing.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F24|Monetary Remittance - Romania Case Study|There is vast literature regarding the grounds of remittance. The best known and most often quoted article on the theme belongs to Lucas and Stark, who divided the grounds pursuant to which people remit money, into altruistic and personal grounds. At microeconomic level, the main beneficiaries of remittance are the remitters themselves and their close ones and, at macroeconomic level, the benefits are substantiated in the increase of domestic consumption, poverty decrease, recovery from macroeconomic shock or imbalance, support of the payment balance. The behavior of migrants who remit money to their country of origin is influenced by factors such as gender, age, educational level, civil status, family position, period of stay in the foreign country and the opportunities therein. The are about 3 million Romanians working abroad and remittance represents an economic advantage for the country, as it stimulates consumption and investments and improves society’s welfare. Remittance stands for an essential source of external funding for developing countries. During 2003 – 2013, Romanians abroad sent home over 54 billion Euro and the peak of the amounts sent by Romanian workers was reached in 2008 (7,765 billion Euro). Following economic crisis, remittance was drastically decreased by almost a half during the following year.
F24|How does the Flow of Remittances Affect the Trade Balance of the Middle East and North Africa?|Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) economies have had the highest degree of dependency on received remittances worldwide over the last three decades. The region has also had the highest non-oil external trade balance deficit among developing countries. We examine the role of remittances in the trade balance of 11 labor-abundant MENA countries. Our panel regression analysis shows that the inflow of remittances has had an increasing effect on trade deficits by triggering import-led consumption expenditures. The results are robust after controlling for other drivers of trade deficit and fixed effects.
F24|The Long-Run Effects of Labor Migration on Human Capital Formation in Communities of Origin|We provide new evidence of one channel through which circular labor migration has long-run effects on origin communities: by raising completed human capital of the next generation. We estimate the net effects of migration from Malawi to South African mines using newly digitized census and administrative data on access to mine jobs, a difference-in-differences strategy, and two opposite-signed and plausibly exogenous shocks to the option to migrate. Twenty years after these shocks, human capital is 4.8-6.9 percent higher among cohorts who were eligible for schooling in communities with the easiest access to migrant jobs.
F24|Remittances in Mexico and their unobserved components|The present study aims to determine the common trends and the permanent and transitory components of remittances received by Mexican households. This is done by estimating a small Dynamic Factor Model (DFM), using the approach first proposed by Gonzalo and Granger (1995), determining the number of common trends subject to the cointegration results. The study also shows the similarities between this small DFM with respect to large DFM, which are widely used in the econometric literature. The results indicate the presence of one cointegration relationship. Consequently, there are four common trends. These common factors are negatively dominated by Mexico's economic activity and positively by the U.S. industrial production. The effects of the exchange rate and the U.S. unemployment rate are positive, but less relevant. This economic scenario leads to remittances exceeding its permanent component
F24|Remigration intentions and migrants' behavior|Using a unique French dataset, we analyze the relationship between remigration intentions and several immigrants' behaviors in the host and origin countries addressing the potential endogeneity of remigration intentions. We also investigate the potential trade-off and complementarities between various immigrants' investment behaviors. We find that temporary migrants are more likely to invest in the country of origin but less likely to invest in the host country. Moreover, our results suggest a trade-off between immigrants' investment in the home and in the host country.
F24|Does Poverty Influence Prevalence of Child Labor in Developing Countries?|The present article examined the impact of poverty on child labor prevalence across 42 developing countries based on system-generalize method of moment technique. The main result on the linkage between child labor prevalence and poverty deviated from the popular beliefs in majority of the existing literature that poverty caused child labor prevalence. The finding indicated that poverty is negatively related to child labor prevalence, in the sense that the higher the poverty the lower the child labor prevalence in the sample countries investigated, this finding therefore reconfirmed the wealth paradox of Bhalotra and Heady (2003).
F24|Do remittances improve income inequality? An instrumental variable quantile analysis of the Kenyan case|The impact of remittances on income inequality constitutes a keenly debated topic in the development literature. Yet, a consensus still has not evolved on the issue. This paper explores the argument that the adverse distributional impact of remittances obtained by a number of studies could partially be due to the failure to control for existing differentials in the ability to migrate. We test the impact of remittances on household expenditures using data from the Kenyan Migration Household Survey and employing an instrumental variable quantile regression model to control for the unequal access to migration of rich and poor households. Our results indicate that while remittances increase household expenditure at all levels of the expenditure distribution, the impact is unambiguously greatest for poorer households. Hence, remittances, in and of themselves, improve both poverty and the distribution of income. This suggests that if remittances are to provide an impetus to development, recipient economies need to alleviate the credit constraints that restrict access to migration for the poor and the ability to send money home once the access bar has been overcome.
F24|On interactions between remittance outflows and Saudi Arabian macroeconomy: New evidence from wavelets|The effect of workers' remittance outflows on macroeconomic variables of host countries is a controversial issue. The purpose of this paper is to study lead/lag interactions between workers' remittance outflows and macroeconomic leading variables in Saudi Arabia for 1980–2013 within a time–frequency framework. To this end, we perform three wavelet variants, namely, the wavelet power spectrum, the cross-spectrum wavelet, and the coherence wavelet. We show that remittance outflows are strongly associated with the main Saudi aggregates and that their relationships change across time scale and frequency bands. In the short- and mid-term, real output growth and government expenditures guide remittance outflows. More specifically, government expenditures positively affect remittance shares to real outputs. In addition, the wavelet analysis reveals a positive causality link from the active population to remittances over low-frequency bands. These outcomes have several prominent implications and point to practical recommendations in terms of monetary policy coordination and financial stability.
F24|Two-sided altruism and signaling|When donors and recipients care about each other–two-sided altruism–asymmetry of information about the donor’s income or about the donor’s altruism leads naturally to a signaling game. The desire to signal income or altruism puts upward pressure on transfers.
F24|The internationalisation of the RMB: New starts, jumps and tipping points|We investigate the process of currency internationalisation of the Chinese Renminbi (RMB). Aggregated cross-border data provided by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) allows better measurement of the role played by a currency in trade and settlement. RMB transactions are significant and increasing but remain concentrated in key financial centres. Analysis using an asset pricing framework shows that the footprint of Chinese corporations in international markets has at times been significant, with the size of these transactions prompting many to reassess the likely pace of RMB internationalisation and its usage as an alternate vehicle currency.
F24|Remittances, entrepreneurship, and employment dynamics over the business cycle|We incorporate remittances and micro-entrepreneurship (self-employment) into a small open economy business cycle model with capital and labor market frictions. Countercyclical remittances moderate the decline of households' consumption during recessions. These remittances also are used to finance the start-up costs of microenterprises that bolster households' income during economic downturns. We show that the positive income effect from countercyclical remittances also leads to a decrease in salaried labor supply, which generates offsetting upward pressure on wages during recessions and adversely affects the recovery of the economy. Consistent with the microeconomic evidence, the behavior of remittances decisively affects labor force participation and the composition of employment between non-salaried and salaried employment over the business cycle. The model delivers labor market and aggregate cyclical dynamics that are consistent with the Mexican data, including a highly volatile and countercyclical unemployment rate.
F24|The effects of remittances on support for democracy in Africa: Are remittances a curse or a blessing?|We examine the effect of remittances on the legitimacy of democracy in Africa, testing whether remittance recipients are less likely to support democracy than non-recipients. We hypothesize that the effect of remittances on support for democracy varies across classes (i.e., groups or subtypes) of individuals sharing similar but unobserved background characteristics. Using the Afrobarometer surveys, we try to find out whether the respondents fall into different hidden classes in such a way that the effect of remittances on the degree of support for democracy depends on the class. Our results support that remittances may be a curse for the degree of endorsement and support for democracy, depending on the class of individuals that we consider. The analysis of the probability of being in the remittance curse class indicates that the perception of national priorities plays an important role. People who attest that freedom and rights are the main national priorities have a lower probability of belonging to the remittances curse class than individuals who choose national priorities that are oriented towards the economic conditions of their country.
F24|Macroeconomic effects of foreign aid and remittances: Implications for aid effectiveness studies|In this paper we quantify the impact of wealth transfers such as remittances and foreign aid using a DSGE-RBC model. We calibrate and simulate the model using data from 85 recipient countries. We show that positive wealth transfer shocks have a lagged positive response on output provided that persistence is sufficiently low, but these effects are small in comparison to other aggregate shocks. In fact, our calibration and simulation results suggest that wealth transfer shocks would need to be around nine times as large in order to produce the GDP volatility created by productivity shocks. The policy implications of our work primarily consist in providing guidance for research that tries to empirically estimate the aid–growth relationship.
F24|Remittances over the Business Cycle: Theory and Evidence|This paper examines the behavior of remittances over the business cycle and their potential to act as a stabilizer during periods of high business cycle volatility. Four main findings are reported. First, in theory, the cyclical behavior of remittances depends on the motives to remit. Second, remittances are less volatile than other foreign currency flows but do not appear to systemically co-move with business cycle fluctuations. Third, remittances are relatively stable even during episodes of sharp business cycle volatility, such as those associated with sudden stops and financial crises. Finally, remittances can help support consumption stability over the business cycle.
F24|Cash on Trial|Over millennia, mankind has used hard cash in various forms ranging from shells to gold coins and paper. More recently, cash has become unpopular in political circles, as it effectively restricts states’ power to tax (explicitly or via negative interest rates) or to survey and potentially control their citizens. Several states have enacted restrictions to the use of hard cash. Above all, a strong new competitor to cash has arisen in the form of various electronic means of payment. Are we heading towards a society in which ‘coined freedom’ (Dostojewski) will cease to exist? Under this provocative ‘motto’ SUERF organised a combined evening event (in German at the University of Zurich) and one-day conference (in English at the theatre ‘Millers’ in Zurich) to take stock of the arguments brought forward in the current debate on the pros and cons and, more generally, the future of cash.
F24|Linking remittances with financial development and institutions: a study from selected MENA countries|This paper seeks to examine the effect of remittances on economic growth in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries. Using unbalanced panel data covering a sample of 12 MENA countries over the period 1984-2012, we studied the hypothesis that the effect of remittances on economic growth varies depending on the level of financial development and institutional environment in recipient countries. We use GMM estimation in which we address the endogeneity of remittances. Our results reveal a complementary relationship among financial development and remittances to ensure economic growth. The estimations also show that remittances promote growth in countries with a developed financial system and a strong institutional environment.

F24|What's different about monetary policy transmission in remittance-dependent countries?|Despite welfare and poverty-reducing benefits for recipient households, remittance inflows have been shown to entail macroeconomic challenges; producing Dutch Disease-type effects, reducing the quality of institutions, delaying fiscal adjustment, and having an indeterminate effect on long-run growth. This paper explores an additional challenge, for monetary policy. Although remittances expand bank balance sheets, providing a stable flow of interest-insensitive funding, they tend to increase banks' holdings of liquid assets. This both reduces the need for an interbank market and severs the link between policy rate and banks’ marginal cost of funds, thus shutting down a major transmission channel. We develop a stylized model based on asymmetric information and a lack of transparent borrowers and undertake econometric analysis providing evidence that increased remittance inflows are associated with weaker transmission. As independent monetary policy becomes impaired, this result is consistent with earlier findings that recipient countries tend to favor fixed exchange rate regimes.
F24|Return Plans and Migrants' Behavior|This paper studies how return migration intentions affect immigrants' behavior. Using a unique French data set, we analyze the relationship between return plans and several immigrants' behaviors in the host and origin countries addressing the potential endogeneity between return plans and different investment decisions. We also investigate the potential trade-off and complementarities between various immigrants' investment behaviors. We find that temporary migrants are more likely to remit and invest in the country of origin, but less likely to invest in the host country. Moreover, our results show that there is no trade-off between immigrants' investment in the home and in the host country. In turn, we find substantial heterogeneity in behavior across migrants of different origins.
F24|Remittances and Informal Work|This paper studies the effects of remittances on informal employment in the migrants' countries of origin, looking both at the remittance-receiving and non-migrant households. Using data from the Social Exclusion Survey, conducted in six transition economies in 2009, I find that receiving remittances increases the likelihood of working informally. At the regional level, high prevalence of remittances is associated with a higher likelihood of informal work among non-migrant households. Migration and remittances may thus be contributing to informal employment in migration-sending countries.
F24|International migration, return migration, and their effects. A comprehensive review on the Romanian case|Romanian migration is today one of the biggest, complex, and dynamic migration to Western Europe. This paper is a comprehensive review of the existing literature that aims at providing a full picture of this dynamic migratory process and discusses its far-reaching consequences. It first presents and characterizes the Romanian migration through the different phases during and after state socialism. The second part of the paper is dedicated to unfolding the socio-economic effects of the Romanian migration addressing the remitting behavior and its development over the past years. The issue of return migration is also addressed stressing that return is not much developed, however it has significant impacts through the emergence of returnees’ entrepreneurship. Finally we address some of the consequences of the medical doctors’ migration which is today considered one of the main migration challenges the country is facing.
F24|Feminization of migration and trends in remittances|Migrants’ remittances to developing countries have increased in recent decades, partly due to reduced transactions costs and improved living conditions in host countries. The feminization of international migration represents yet another explanation. Despite the difficulties female migrants encounter in the labor market, their total remittances may be higher and more resilient than those of male migrants, owing to these women’s stronger links to family members left behind and self-insurance motives. Policymakers need to understand how this new and significant upward trend in female migration could affect the economic and social development of home countries.
F24|Does institutional quality in developing countries affect remittances?|There is some empirical evidence showing that remittances, on average, were about 0.5 percent of GDP in countries with a corruption index higher than the median level, compared to 1.9 percent in countries with a level of corruption lower than the median. It is also arguable, that an improvement in economic institutions would facilitate economic freedom and in turn, reduce the costs of transactions associated with remittances in recipient countries. The quality of institutions in developing countries therefore, could be an important determinant of remittances, which are now considered an essential source of external finance in these countries. Thus, this paper explores the role of institutions in driving the flow of remittances to developing countries. The study uses a sample of 90 countries, and data from the World development Indicators (WDI) and Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) indicators databases. The paper estimates both static and dynamic representations of a reduced form model for the determinants of remittances. The static panel models are estimated using the fixed effects estimator, whereas the dynamic models, represented by autoregressive-distributed lag models, are estimated using a generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. The results show that an improvement in the quality of institutions in charge of the conduct of monetary policy has a positive impact on remittances, and that this impact increases with the quality of such institutions. The estimates also show that an improvement in the operations of institutions of government leads to an increase in the inflow of remittances, which suggests that a decrease in direct government control or participation in the private sector has positive impact on remittances. Sound monetary policy and an effective government are critical to economic freedom, and these results seem to suggest that migrants tend to send remittances in order take advantage of macroeconomic environments that are favorable to better economic performance. Furthermore, the findings provide evidence, albeit a weak one, which suggests that an improvement in the legal system and property rights may be associated with an increase in remittances, but that the effect is lower for countries with an index value greater than the median level. Ergo, to the extent that remittances have become an important source of external finance, policies promoting sound and accountable local institutions should be a priority for policy makers in developing countries.
F24|Do remittances help smooth consumption during health shocks?: Evidence from Jamaica|Remittances represent about 15 percent of Jamaica’s GDP; being the 16th country worldwide in terms of economic significance of remittances. Therefore, assessing to what extent and through what mechanisms remittances are useful for development is highly relevant. Accordingly, we identify whether remittances facilitate consumption smoothing during health shocks in Jamaica. In addition, we investigate whether remittances are subject to moral hazard by receivers, how the informal insurance provided by remittances interacts with formal health insurance, and whether there are differential effects by gender of the household head. Disentangling causality between remittances and household income or consumption is problematic as a result of reverse causation. Therefore, identifying whether remittances serve as a social insurance mechanism toward consumption smoothing would require the existence of an exogenous and unexpected shock suffered by nonreceivers and receivers. In this article, we exploit health shocks (accidents and illnesses) suffered by household members to identify the relevance of remittances as social insurance toward consumption smoothing. After showing that these shocks are as good as randomly assigned, we assess the relevance and significance of remittances as a social insurance mechanism in Jamaica. Our main findings show that health shocks adversely affect total household expenditures by an average of 19 percent. However, remittances totally offset these adverse effects, indicating that in light of idiosyncratic shocks, remittances serve as a social insurance mechanism that offers full protection. We also find that moral hazard concerns are low given that remittances are not used to smooth consumption of presumably undesirable goods for senders such as alcohol. Furthermore, we find that remittances are not relevant as an insurance mechanism against health shocks when private health insurance is present. By contrast, remittances constitute a powerful form of insurance in the absence of private health insurance. In terms of policymaking, our findings identify a particularly vulnerable population: persons without private health insurance who do not receive remittances. Therefore, developing mechanisms to identify this population could serve for targeting complementary safety nets towards this particularly vulnerable group.
F24|Does globalization create a ‘level playing field’ through outsourcing and brain drain in the global economy?|Rapid globalization driven by the development needs of transition economies, economic reform in developing countries, and unprecedented productivity growth owing to lower unit labor cost, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) revolution, and international movement of labor has posed a challenge for maintaining a sustainable economic growth worldwide. Using qualitative analysis based on data from various secondary sources, we note that both outsourcing and brain drain have intensified over the years as more and more countries are now embracing globalization as a strategy for higher economic growth and development. While the benefits of globalization can differ across countries, it seems that outsourcing and brain drain can bring into play some offsetting forces that are likely to bridge the gap between advanced and developing countries by creating a ‘level playing field’ in the global economy. While the developing and emerging economies are losing skilled labor through ‘brain drain’ to the advanced nations, they are gaining remittance earnings from those nations. At the same time, outsourcing from the advanced countries has created new employment and other opportunities in developing and emerging markets. Although the final impact of outsourcing is debatable, it is very likely that companies will intensify such activities in future due to strong evidences in support of significant cost savings. The outflow of skilled manpower, popularly called brain drain, from developing countries is also likely to increase due to growing demand for ‘replacement migration’ from advanced countries. Increasing job gains from outsourcing and the associated benefits on the economies of developing countries are likely to cancel out the perceived negative impact of brain drain, argued in this paper. The implication is that developed countries should ideally target the relatively poorer countries in their plan for outsourcing, because they are still deprived of the benefits of job creation, though these countries are losing their high-skilled manpower through brain drain.
F24|The Cyclicality Of Remittances In Sub-Saharan Africa|This paper investigates the cyclicality of remittances to make inferences about whether they are sent for altruistic or self-interest reasons. The results show that remittances are procyclical, and therefore, do not support the general altruistic motive for sending remittances to sub-Saharan Africa. The results also do not lend credence to the portfolio choice hypothesis. Thus, the findings suggest that remittances to the sub-region may be driven by some other self-interest motives or family arrangements. These results, however, do not diminish the fact that remittances remain an important source of external finance to the sub-region, as evidenced in the literature.
F24|Do Foreign Aid And Remittance Inflows Hurt Competitiveness Of Exports Of Pacific Island Countries? An Empirical Study Of Fiji|Foreign aid and remittance inflows have been playing major roles in the economic growth and development of Pacific island countries (PICs). However, the relationship between these international capital inflows and export competitiveness of PICs has not been adequately studied. It is generally held that such capital transfers tend to hurt exports, a phenomenon known as Dutch disease. The objective of this paper is to examine the validity of the Dutch disease hypothesis in PICs with a case study of Fiji. Employing the bounds testing procedure, this empirical study reveals that inflows of both foreign aid and remittances have been contributing to the appreciation of Fiji¡¯s currency. The study establishes the validity of the Dutch disease hypothesis as far as Fiji is concerned.

Second, remittances are less volatile than other foreign currency flows but do not appear to systemically co-move with business cycle fluctuations. Third, remittances are relatively stable even during episodes of sharp business cycle volatility, such as those associated with sudden stops and financial crises. Finally, remittances can help support consumption stability over the business cycle.
F24|Analysing the Effect of Remittances on Rural Household in Pakistan|Rural households are more vulnerable to uncertain situations, for these uncertainty they diversify not only their resources but their income. Income receive to households is in three formats i.e. labour income, internal remittance income and external remittance income. Rural households invest for uncertain situation in future, rural households invest in assets in good time and this investment help them to tackle future uncertainty. Current paper investigates by using the data of PSLM that how remittances effect accumulation of assets, because remittances are utilise as transitory income. Results also explains that external remittances significantly affect the assets accumulation of rural households.
F24|Impact of Remittance on Consumption and Savings Behavior in Rural Areas of Bangladesh|This study measures the impact of remittance on consumption and savings behavior though surveying rural households in Bangladesh. It uses hypothesis testing to compare consumption and savings behavior and path model analysis to trace out the impact of remittance on household level consumption and savings behavior in rural areas of Bangladesh. The remittance receiver households receive US$ 358 monthly remittance on an average. The average monthly food expenditure, aggregate expenditure and savings of a remittance receiver household are about US $28, $32 and $10 higher than that of a non-receiver household. The path model analysis findings indicate that remittance has a statistically significant positive impact on attributing food and aggregate consumption expenditure in addition to savings. Therefore, this study concludes that remittance plays an important role in attributing consumption and savings behavior in the selected rural areas of the south-west region of Bangladesh. However, further study addressing randomness in the sample selection process with wider sample and study area coverage might enhance the robustness of the study findings.
F24|Remittance Behaviour of Chinese and Indian Immigrants in Canada|Using the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants in Canada (LSIC) dataset, we explore the differences in remittance behaviour of Chinese and Indian immigrants in Canada in relation to their socio-economic characteristics. We apply logistic regressions on the likelihood to remit, and instrumental variable regressions to estimate the amount remitted. We find that age, income, level of education, and personal investment in the home country are important determinants of the remittance behaviour of Chinese immigrants in Canada. Marital status, having family members, and involvement with ethnic organizations in the host country are the major drivers of remittances sent by Indian immigrants in Canada. By analyzing the remittance behaviour of Canadian immigrants from two major sources, this study sheds light on potential motivations to remit which contribute to policy formulation in both home and host countries.
F24|Remittances impact on youth labour supply: evidence from Kyrgyzstan|This research aims to investigate the impact of remittances from international migration on leftbehind youth occupational choice. Labour supply choice of youth is grouped as employee, family contributing worker, own-account worker and unemployment. Labour supply is analysed both at the extensive margin – participation of youth labour across these occupational choices, and at the intensive margins – working hours within each occupational choices. The analysis use “Life in Kyrgyz Republic” survey cross-sectional data for 2011. To overcome endogeneity concerns instrumental variable approach is used. Given the multinomial dependent variable and discrete endogenous variable “conditional mixed process” estimation technique is applied. Empirical results show that remittances impact on left-behind youth in Kyrgyzstan is mainly reflected as labour substitution effect. Unlike findings of some previous studies, we did not find any strong evidence of remittance-dependency behavior of left behind youth. However, increase of likelihood for youth as family contributing worker does not necessarily imply increase of productivity of labour force. There is no sufficient evidence of the fact that return from migration as the job creating activities and efficient utilization of remittances for own-account works exist. Moreover, female youth are more inclined to family contributing works both at the extensive and intensive margins. Results are robust to inclusion of other variables on individual characteristics. Given these empirical evidences, priority for the youth employment policy should be a channeling remittances into productive use. Moreover, educational programs with the emphasis on female youth and special programs on youth entrepreneurship and access to financial resources will be important for youth self-employment activities.
F24|Migration, remittances, labour market and human capital in Senegal|This study investigates how migration and remittances affect labour market participation in Senegal. Further, it examines the effect of remittances on human capital development. The results reveal that migration and remittances reduce labour market participation of household members with migrants. More importantly, we find that the labour market participation depends negatively on the level of remittances, which supports the reservation wage theory. We also find that remittances increase expenditures on human capital development, as approximated by education and health spending. These findings hold true across specifications and econometric estimation procedures.
F24|Simulation of a voucher policy for improving the social condition of individual remittance receivers in Macedonia|Macedonia receives at least 4% of GDP as cash remittances per year while a third of the population faces poverty. The study has two objectives: first, to investigate if and to what extent remittances improve individual social indicators; and ii) to devise and ex-ante simulate the effects of Remittances’ Voucher policy for transforming their potentially sheltering role into a formal mechanism for social protection. To that end, we rely on the DotM 2008 Remittances’ Survey and a conditional mixed process estimator. We devise the Remittances’ Voucher providing each remittance receiver who obtains the money through financial institution the right to a health protection equal to the average health expenditure if he/she sets 6% of the remitted money on a pension account. We find that remittances have a significant effect onto consumption and, hence, contribute to reducing poverty. This finding lends support to the claim that remittances serve an informal social protection in the country. We also find that the Remittances’ Voucher policy may play a crucially positive impact on remittance receivers, as it improves poverty and the health condition, especially for females, rural dwellers and Macedonian recipients of remittances. The bold recommendation is for the government to introduce this policy into the array of social policies as means of framing remittances into more formal social protection.
F24|Domestic or foreign currency? Remittances and the composition of deposits and loans|This paper investigates the effects of remittance receipts on the currency composition of deposits and loans in the home-country banking system. For this objective, we first develop a simple model that links remittance flows to the decisions of households and firms with regard to the optimal share of deposits and loans, respectively, held in the form of foreign currency. We, then, examine empirically the relevance of the theoretical predictions for fourteen Central and Eastern European countries over the last two decades. Both the theoretical and empirical findings underpin the importance of remittances for the currency composition of bank's balance sheets, pointing to a mismatch between deposits and loans: remittances raise the share of foreign currency loans whilst they reduce the share of foreign currency deposits.
F24|Macroeconomic Determinants of Migrantsâ€™ Remittances: Evidence from a Panel of Developing Countries|This work aims to assess the various macroeconomic determinants of migrantsâ€™ remittances for a panel of 22 developing countries highly dependent observed over the period 1990 to 2014. The results underline the importance of the origin countryâ€™s GDP, the host countryâ€™s GDP, inflation, financial development and institutional quality as major determinants of personal remittances. However, the migrant stock, the official exchange rate and the real interest rate in the country of origin do not have a significant influence on remittances received by the panel considered.
F24|International financial flows, domestic banks, and the economic development of the periphery: Italy, 1861-1913|This paper analyses the impact of different sources of financing (foreign capital, migrants’ remittances, and domestic banks intermediation) on economic development in Italy between 1861 and WWI. Existing literature has analysed the role of these channels of financial intermediation separately, while this paper for the first time considers them in conjunction. Using IRF from a Cholesky identification structure of a VAR model and relying on an original dataset that combines the most recent series of several financial and economic aggregates, this paper shows that both international capital and domestic saving had a significant impact on investment, while remittances did not. Foreign capital was invested directly, but also via domestic banks, in particular the “German-style” universal banks. Finally, foreign and domestic capital had different attitudes towards the types of investment (construction vs. plant, machinery and transport equipment) and industries they financed. Combined together, these results shed a new light on the process of economic development of Italy and, more generally, of peripheral economies in the age of the international gold standard.
F24|The supplier network of exporters : Connecting the dots|The capability of domestic firms to compete on foreign markets is an important indicator of a country’s economic strength and a target of many economic policies. We know that only a small share of producers sells on foreign markets and that these firms perform in many aspects differently from their purely domestic counterparts. Recent research, however, highlighted that many exporters are just trade intermediaries that do not produce the exported good and, importantly, the capability to export is supported by availability of cheap and high-quality inputs. This suggests that in order to understand an economy’s involvement in international trade and the characteristics of firms that produce for foreign markets we need to look beyond the firms that own a good when it crosses the border and acknowledge that many firms are engaged in international trade indirectly. This paper fills the gap by offering the first glimpse of the domestic supplier network that underpins exports production. To this purpose we use a new and unique dataset of yearly transactions between all domestic firms in the Belgian economy and augment it with data on firms’ characteristics and their international transactions. We show that the current picture of firms in international trade indeed misses an important share of firms. While we confirm that direct exporters are the best performing firms, we also show that they are supported by suppliers that are very good performers themselves. In fact, we find evidence of a performance premium that is increasing in the proximity to foreign demand.
F24|The skills of Polish emigrants: Evidence from PIAAC|Based on the OECD data from the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) this paper sheds light on the skills of migrants. In line with earlier research the data show that migrants from Poland are more likely to have a tertiary degree than peers at home, but they often work in elementary professions abroad that do not match these high qualifications. This may well be at least partly a language issue, as migrants from Poland resemble migrants from other low-income countries in that their numeracy and literacy skills in the language of their host country is markedly lower than the average across all PIAAC participants, migrants or not. This gap is smaller, though, when looking only at migrants who report having been tested in a language that they use often and master well. The data reveal an interesting difference with migrants from higher-income countries, as their test results do not differ from the average, although they face the same language issues as other migrants. The reason may well be that only migrants from low-income countries can hope to earn higher wages abroad even if they work in low-skill professions, while migrants from higher-income countries need to master the language of their host country to do well. In fact, Polish migrants earn higher wages than their peers who stayed at home, even though they are particularly often overqualified. Les compétences des émigrants polonais : résultats de l'enquête PIAAC Sur la base des données de l’Évaluation des compétences des adultes (PIAAC) ce papier illustre les compétences des migrants. Conforme à des recherches antérieurs, les données montrent que les migrants de la Pologne ont plus souvent un diplôme de l’enseignement supérieure que leurs pairs qui sont restés dans leur pays, mais souvent ils travaillent dans des professions élémentaires qui ne requièrent pas un tel niveau de qualifications. Ceci pourrait être dû, pour le moins en partie, à des problèmes linguistiques, dans la mesure où les migrants polonais ont, dans les langues des pays d’accueil, des compétences en littératie et numératie qui sont bien plus basses que pour la moyenne de tous les participants au test PIAAC, migrants ou non, ce qui les rapproches des migrants d’autres pays à bas revenus. Cependant, cette différence est plus petite quand on considère uniquement les migrants qui affirment avoir été testé dans une langue qu’ils utilisent souvent et qu’ils maitrisent bien. Les données révèlent une différence intéressante avec les migrants des pays à hauts revenus, dont les résultats dans les tests de littératie et numératie ne sont pas différents de la moyenne, même s’ils sont confrontés aux mêmes difficultés de langage que d’autres migrants. Ceci pourrait être dû au fait que seul les migrants des pays à bas revenus peuvent espérer de gagner mieux à l’étranger que dans leur pays, même s’ils travaillent dans des professions peu qualifiés, alors que les migrants des pays à haut revenus doivent maîtriser la langue de leur pays d’accueil pour avoir un meilleur niveau de vie que dans leur pays d’origine. Au fait, les migrants polonais gagnent des salaires plus élevés que leurs pairs qui sont restés en Pologne, même s’ils sont souvent surqualifiés.
F24|Do migrants send remittances as a way of self-insurance?|How do risk preferences affect migrant remittance behaviour? Examination of this relationship has only begun to be explored. Using a tailored representative survey of 1,354 immigrants in the Greater Dublin Area, Ireland, we find a positive and significant relationship between risk aversion and migrant remittances. Risk-averse individuals are more likely to send remittances home and are, on average, likely to remit a higher amount, after controlling for a broad range of individual and group characteristics. The evidence we obtain, that more remittances are sent by risk-averse immigrants who face higher wage risks and to individuals with more financial resources, is consistent with self-insurance although we cannot, with our data, rule out other exchange motives.
F24|Channeling Remittances to Education: A Field Experiment among Migrants from El Salvador|"We implement a randomized experiment offering Salvadoran migrants matching funds for educational remittances, which are channeled directly to a beneficiary student in El Salvador chosen by the migrant. The matches lead to increased educational expenditures, higher private school attendance, and lower labor supply of youths in El Salvador households connected to migrant study participants. We find substantial ""crowd-in"" of educational investments: for each $1 received by beneficiaries, educational expenditures increase by $3.72. We find no shifting of expenditures away from other students, and no effect on remittances. (JEL F24, I21, I22, J13, O15, O19)"
F24|Rural Labor Outmigration and Gender Dimension in an Assessment of Farm Technical Efficiency: A Case Study in Selected Rice Villages in the Philippines|Several studies have shown that labor outmigration is one of the livelihood strategies of poor farming households. However, no studies have shown its effect on rice crop production including a gender dimension on technical efficiency in rice farming. This paper attempts to improve the understanding of the relationship between male and female labor migration and farm technical efficiency in selected rice-based farming villages in the Philippines. Using cross-section data from 670 farm households in the Luzon area in the Philippines, results indicate that the type of migration, experience of the migrant, and frequency of home visits enhance farm technical efficiency; however, sex of the migrant increases inefficiencies. The average technical efficiency is 0.74. This implies that, in the short run, there is scope for increasing rice productivity by about 26 percent by conducting formal and informal trainings among the adult household members and providing them access to technical knowledge on the use of improved rice varieties and associated crop and resource management practices.

F24|A Global View Of Cross-Border Migration| This paper evaluates the global welfare impact of observed levels of migration using a quantitative multi-sector model of the world economy calibrated to aggregate and firm-level data. Our framework features cross-country labor productivity differences, international trade, remittances, and a heterogeneous workforce. We compare welfare under the observed levels of migration to a no-migration counterfactual. In the long run, natives in countries that received a lot of migration—such as Canada or Australia—are better off due to greater product variety available in consumption and as intermediate inputs. In the short run, the impact of migration on average welfare in these countries is close to zero, while the skilled and unskilled natives tend to experience welfare changes of opposite signs. The remaining natives in countries with large emigration flows—such as Jamaica or El Salvador—are also better off due to migration, but for a different reason: remittances. The welfare impact of observed levels of migration is substantial, at about 5% to 10% for the main receiving countries and about 10% in countries with large incoming remittances.
F24|Foreign Transfers, Manufacturing Growth and the Dutch Disease Revisited|In a well-known study Rajan and Subramanian (2011) argue that aid causes a ‘Dutch Disease’ effect in aid-recipient countries. This study successfully replicates the first part of their findings and then uses a new, extended data set, different estimation methods, and another measure of aid to analyze the robustness of their results. In addition the study explores the effect of remittance flows on the relative growth of manufacturing sectors. In general, findings from the new, extended data set do not provide sufficient evidence to support the ‘Dutch Disease’ argument. In the case of international remittance flows, the findings indicate a positive remittance-manufacturing-growth relation, particularly in fixed effects models.
F24|Wider Boundaries: The Welfare State and International Remittances|Recent theoretical work shows that precautionary savings increase in response to an increase in first-order risk. In addition, it is known that the welfare state, being an insurance or consumption-smoothing mechanism, reduces the negative welfare effect of future income uncertainty. We build a model of remittances and savings under income uncertainty and show that an immigrant will increase his remittances in response to a first-order risk decrease in future income. Using changes in the size and generosity of the welfare state as a measure of changes in future income risk, we empirically test the prediction of our model using panel data of bilateral remittances. Our theoretical prediction is supported by the data: there is a positive relationship between a more generous welfare state in host countries and international remittances (i.e., transfers beyond the borders of the welfare state) by immigrants. The boundaries of the welfare state are wider than previously thought.
F24|Remittances and incentive to migrate: An epidemic approach of migration|This paper focuses on feedback mechanisms of remittances on the size of the migrant population. We argue that low remittances contribute to relax recipients’ credit constraints and foster further emigration. On the other hand, high remittances may deter migration if they make further emigration unnecessary. Thus, remittances can be considered as a contaminating factor in an epidemic model of migration. This model allows us to characterize a rich set of situations in order to appraise the impact of different policies on the total number of migrants. For instance, we show the mechanisms through which a policy aiming at making migrants successful in the host country may finally lower migration.
F24|The ambiguous role of remittances in West African countries facing climate variability|We investigate the consequences of remittances inflows on macroeconomic performance of West African countries over the 1985 - 2007 period. We take into account the exposition of those countries to climate variability by estimating a PCHVAR model which allows heterogeneity between countries’ responses to rainfall shocks. Our results show that the impact of remittances on macroeconomic performances is highly sensitive to those shocks. In particular, when drought conditions prevail, remittances do not longer exert any short-term spillover effects on growth and may increase a situation of economic dependence, by spurring agricultural imports.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F24|Migration and Employment Interactions in a Crisis Context: the case of Tunisia|This article analyses how a crisis impacts labor markets in origin countries through migration channels. For this purpose, we develop a novel dynamic general equilibrium model with a focus on the interlinkages be- tween migration, the labor market and education. The main innovation of the paper is the retrospective modeling in general equilibrium of the impact of an economic crisis to isolate the impact of migration on local unemployment. The impact of the crisis on education decision is captured through endogenous returns to education. The simultaneity of the crisis in Tunisia and its partners worsened the labour market situation mainly through the increase in labour supply. The main result is that migration is indeed one of the main determinants of the unemployment increase and that remittances have a higher impact than the variation of emigration flows. The low skilled bear the highest costs in terms of unemployment and wage decline. _________________________________ Cet article s’intéresse à la manière dont une crise affecte le marché du travail des pays d’origine, à travers la migration. A cet effet, nous développons un modèle d’équilibre général dynamique mettant l’accent sur les interactions entre migration, marché du travail et éducation. La principale innovation de l’article est la modélisation rétrospective en équilibre général de l’impact d’une crise économique, en isolant l’effet de la migration sur le chômage local. L’impact de la crise sur l’accumulation de capital humain est capté via l’endogénéisation des rendements de l’éducation. La simultanéité de la crise en Tunisie et dans les pays partenaires a aggravé la situation sur marché du travail tunisien, principalement à travers l’augmentation de l’offre de travail. Le principal résultat est que la migration est en effet l’un des principaux déterminants de l’augmentation du chômage et que les transferts de fonds ont un impact plus important que la variation des flux d’émigrants. En outre, les travaille<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F24|Modeling and Measuring Information Asymmetry in the Context of Senegalese Migrants' Remittances|Much optimism has been invested in the developmental role of migrants’ remittances as altruism and frequent interactions should facilitate investments by migrants in their countries of origin. But geographical dispersion can foster strategic behavior. We develop a model of transfers from the Senegalese diaspora based on socio– anthropological evidence of remittances earmarked by migrants for investments or expenditures by their households of origin, especially durable assets. The model allows for information asymmetry and monitoring by the migrant. It shows that it may be optimal for recipients to behave strategically and we may observe systematic discrepancies between recipients’ and senders’ reports of the goods to be financed by transfers. Novel matched data enable us to test and find support for the model’s predictions.
F24|Latin American Remittances Dependence On External Shocks|Remittances have become an important and reliable source of funds for many developing countries, particularly Latin American countries. The inflow of remittances has been shown to improve consumption levels, health care access, educational attainment, and the implementation of entrepreneurial initiatives, affecting the economic prospects of the receiving countries. However, economic conditions in the host-countries have proven to be influential in immigrants’ earnings and their ability to send money to their families back home. This article measures the impact that economic fluctuations in the U.S. and Spain have in the amount of remittances received by 5 Latin American countries, showing that migrant workers tend to send more funds home when the state of the economy in which they reside improves. Our results also show that shocks to specific sectors of the host country produce a differential effect on the remittances flowing to different countries, both in terms of magnitude and sometimes direction.
F24|Cyclical Properties of Workers’ Remittances: Evidence from Bosnia and Herzegovina|Workers’ remittances are proven to positively influence the receiving economies and to help the receivers of remittances to cope with currency constraints and unemployment in the receiving country. Remittances can also improve the capability of the receiving economies to mitigate the negative effects of economic downturns and crisis by having counter-cyclical relationship in accordance to the GDP of receiving countries. This is the general opinion, but the latest reports say that they could behave in pro-cyclical manner. In the light of these facts, this article investigates the nature of co-movement of cyclical components, thus investigating cyclicality, between remittance inflow and output or GDP of B&H. This article also investigates cyclical properties of Official Development Assistance and Foreign Direct Investment inflow between Bosnian output in order to determine whether one of other two external financial flows could be used as a mitigating tool of negative aspect of economic downturn in B&H.
F24|Fiscal Deficits and Economic Growth in Nigeria: A Chow Test Approach|The recent criticism of poor fiscal performance levelled against the democratic regimes in Nigeria has resulted in questions being asked as to the soundness of the acclaim which heralded its advent. Such questions generally focus on the growth impacts of the deficits incurring during this regimes. In view of this, this study examined the relative impact of fiscal deficits (FSD) on economic growth in Nigeria during the military and democratic regimes. The study employed Chow endogenous break test, unit root and cointegration tests. The results derived from the Chow test analysis reveal that there is a difference between the growth-impact of FSD in the two regimes. In particular, the study found that FSDs had a significant growthimpact during the military regime, while it has not had a significant impact on economic growth during the democratic regime. On the other hand, the study’s results indicated that the interest rate did not have a significant growth-impact during both regimes, while the gross fixed capital formation had a significant growth impact during both regimes in view of the findings, the study recommended the strengthening of the country’s budgetary institutions so as to ensure the de-politicization of the budgetary process. Furthermore, the study recommended the reduction in the current lending rate so as to ensure increased access to investment funds by domestic entrepreneurs.
