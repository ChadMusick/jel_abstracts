L19|The Ownership of Data|We study the effects of property rights over the use of data on market outcomes. For this, we consider a model in which a monopolistic firm offers a service to a set of heterogeneous users. Usage generates valuable data but data extraction entails a privacy cost to users. We show that both the firm and users prefer the users (the firm) to own the rights for low (high) values of data. We further discuss the robustness of our results by allowing more contracting possibilities to the data owner. We show that the main trade-off between the two ownership regimes is robust to these extensions.
L19|Location choices of Swedish independent schools – How does allowing for private provision affect the geography of the education market?|This paper studies the location decisions of Swedish start-up independent schools. It makes use of the great expansion of independent schools following a reform implemented in 1992 to test what local market characteristics are correlated with independent school entry. The results suggest that independent schools are more likely to choose locations with a higher share of students with high-educated parents; a higher student population density; and a lower share of students with Swedish-born parents. There is also some evidence that independent schools are less likely to locate in municipalities with a left-wing political majority. These results are robust to various alternative and flexible definitions of local school markets, which were employed in order to alleviate the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem. For some of the included variables, the definition of the local market however had a large impact on the results, suggesting that the issue of how to define regions in spatial analyses can be important.

L19|How Do Firms Utilize the Deferred Patent Examination System? Evidence from Korea|This paper investigates firm behaviors on examination request under the deferred patent examination system in Korea. We examine firm decisions on whether and when to request patent examinations when they face both uncertainty about inven- tion¡¯s value and market competition. We find that the examination request in Korea has an interesting bi-polar distribution, and both uncertainty about an invention¡¯s value and market competition have significant impacts on firm¡¯s decision for exam- ination request. Applicants tend to utilize option value of waiting when uncertainty is high, but market competition attenuates the option value: the higher the com- petition, the less likely applicants are to delay or forego examination. Our study extends the empirical literature on deferred examination system but also provides a more comprehensive understanding on the irreversible investment decision under both uncertainty and competition.
L19|Relationship between dimensions of Brand Equity and 4Ps of Marketing Mix - Place, Product, Promotion, & Price: Coca Cola - Consumer Based Qualitative Survey|The relationship between dimensions of brand equity (brand association, brand awareness, perceived quality, and customer's loyalty) and 4Ps of marketing mix (product, place, price, and promotion) are examined in this paper. Cross sectional research design while following inductive approach I have explore the relationship between research variables from consumer's perspective. Total 129 participants took part in this survey. Respondents were identified and approached through convenience sampling technique. Survey questionnaire contained 16 total questions (4 demographic and 12 attitudinal and behavioural) questions with matrix based 5-Points LIKERT SCALE. Questionnaire was self designed and administered personally. Findings showed that there is significant relationship between dimensions of brand equity and 4Ps of marketing mix. The most significant dimension in terms of Coca Cola is brand association and least effective dimension has been customer's loyalty. Furthermore, most effective marketing mix tools for Coca Cola has been its product and pricing strategies while least effective has been promotional strategies. It is also found that despite being brand image with high dependability and reliability image, there is low customer's loyalty towards Coca Cola. The paper is significant because it explores the relationship from consumer's perspective. Further, it examines the association between all dimensions of brand equity and considered marketing mix feature from qualitative perspective. The limitations of research are discussed at the end of research paper.
L19|Management by Humor: A Path to a Performative Field?|At the crossroads of cultures and languages, the meaningfulness of humor is often construed subjectively such as at workplace (Merritt, 2013). Because how humor is understood often varies across organizational cultures, so does its meaning as well as its intensity (Avolio et al., 1999; Davies, 2009). It gives rise to a question of whether it could be used as an effective management tool. Weather does this difference in understanding humor have any effect on employees? performance? And, how does leader-subordinate working relationship evolve under humor use? The proposed paper examines the connection between humor use and performative influence, drawing on the theoretical construct given in ?Towards a progressive understanding of performativity in critical management studies? by Christopher Wickert and Stephan Schaefer (20014). They define Performative Effects as ?the stimulants for language in order to induce incremental, rather than radical, changes in managerial behavior?. Therefore, humor is not always so favorably viewed at workplace by all employees who could misunderstand a joke of their seniors without any fault of their own; who thus could start suspecting ulterior, sinister motives of their seniors; and who could then resultantly get oversensitive and cautious, especially when seeing how their colleagues are targeted and made a butt of joke by their seniors (see Shamir, 1995).
L19|Endogenous Firm Location with a Decreasing Density of Consumers|This note will use the Hotelling?s line model with a non-uniform distribution of consumers. Instead, a linear, decreasing density is employed to represent a decreasing population density as distance from a metropolitan area is increased along some transportation artery. Entry is sequential, and the number of firms is assumed endogenous after an initial firm is located, making the entrants consider the possibility of later firms. Entrants into this market have neither maximum nor minimum differentiation. Earlier entrants generally locate closer to the population center with the possible exception of the equilibrium location closest to the densest point on the line. The differentiation increases as the firms are farther from the population center.
L19|Indonesian Business Environment - VOC Model and Local Culture|Our presentation focuses on the structure of Indonesian political economy and how local form of capitalism is underpinned by social relations and culture. Specifically, in our research, we: i) analyze Indonesian business environment through the Varieties of Capitalism (henceforth VOC) model as developed by Hall and Soskice, ii) look into the reform and dynamic changes of Indonesian business environment following 1997 crisis in East Asia through the lens of VOC model, and iii) examine how Indonesian form of capitalism is underpinned by local culture by the use of GLOBE Project and Hofstede dimensions of culture. Our findings suggest that the case of Indonesia can be presented as a special type of a coordinated market economy driven by local culture with some aspects of liberal market economy, which are, to a large extent, imported from the outside. Our research also shows that the influence of international business environment and globalization combined with post-1997-crisis reform push Indonesian economy further towards modes of coordination more typical for liberal market economies, causing tensions among various actors of local political economy. Considering limited body of literature on the topic, the main contributions of our research is twofold. First, to study Indonesian form of capitalism, we apply a VOC model and connect local form of capitalism with socio-cultural characteristics of the country. Second, we apply VOC model to look at the interplay between domestic forces shaping local political economy and the influence of international environment and globalization largely reflecting (neo)liberal view of economic and business relations.
L19|Local Competitiveness and Labour Market Returns in a Transition Economy: Evidence from Vietnam|This paper examines the relationship between the quality of provincial governance and labour market returns in Vietnam. We find that better provincial governance has a positive effect on labour market wages for wage-earning workers. The finding is consistent across estimators, even after controlling for worker characteristics, geographic regions, urban context, economic sector and industry type. A better competitive environment for business attracts more firms to enter the market, which in turn creates greater demand for labour. Subsequently, higher demand for labour pushes up wages. Our unique contribution is that we considered the influence of provincial governance on the business environment and labour market returns.
L19|Unternehmensnachfolgen in Deutschland 2018 bis 2022|Wegen fehlender amtlicher Statistiken schätzt das IfM Bonn seit Mitte der 1990er Jahre die Anzahl der Unternehmen in Deutschland, die vor der Übergabe stehen. Die vorliegende Schätzung für den Zeitraum 2018 bis 2022 kommt zum Ergebnis, dass etwa 150.000 Unter-nehmen mit rund 2,4 Mio. Beschäftigten zur Übergabe anstehen. Eine zusätzlich durchge-führte Approximation des Nachfolgegeschehens auf Basis der Gewerbeanzeigenstatistik belegt, dass die aktuelle Schätzung des IfM Bonn die Zahl der tatsächlich erfolgten Unter-nehmensübertragungen relativ gut abbildet. Wie letztlich die Nachfolge geregelt werden wird (familienintern, unternehmensintern oder -extern), ist wegen fehlender amtlicher Statistiken ebenfalls schwer vorherzusagen. Unsere Analysen lassen jedoch die Vermutung zu, dass gut die Hälfte der vor der Nachfolgefrage stehenden Familienunternehmen ihr Unternehmen innerhalb der Familie weitergibt. Etwa 18 % der Familienunternehmen werden von Mitarbei-tern übernommen und die restlichen 29 % werden an Externe verkauft.
L19|Are you the right partner? R&D agreement as a screening device| This paper focuses on the strategic use of firms' R&D agreements to overcome R&D inefficiencies under asymmetric information and research spillovers. We introduce a duopoly game where initially one firm is not fully informed on its rival's R&D productivity. We show that, without R&D agreements, the usual underinvestment problem can be exacerbated by the presence of asymmetric information. However, the R&D agreement can be used strategically as a screening device to assess the true type of the firm with private information, hence solving the inefficiencies generated by asymmetric information. According to the model, firms are more likely to pursuit R&D agreements in presence of similar productivity and less when their productivity gap is high. This is consistent with the empirical findings highlighting the importance of firms' similarities for R&D collaborations.
L19|Can Community Driven Care be integrated in the European Welfare System? Institutional Challenges and Historical Lessons|Parallel to the formal (health) care organizations in Europe, private or public, a number of community driven care projects have emerged. They may supplement the formal organizations by reducing costs or provide care to groups that for some reason do not have access to the formal sector. Drawing on Ostromian theory of commons, and on the previous theory and research on open software development (which share some of the characteristics of “open care”) we use cases of historical cases of community driven care to examine the prospects for such project to help remedy the cost crisis in the care sector. We explore under which institutional settings “open care” is likely to emerge and when open care projects have potential to scale. It is found that open care is more likely to emerge and prosper when they build on existing organizational structures; where the participants do not need to create new hierarchies or governance structures and where they share common values. The paper may serve policy makers aiming to design institutions or regulation, that facilitate, or at least not impede, the emergence of community based care.
L19|Contribution Of High-Level Structures For Management Integration, Aportes De La Estructura De Alto Nivel En La Gestion Integrada|"This article presents the results of a study analyzing the contributions of the high-level structure proposed by the International Organization for Standardization ISO. The goal is to meet the requirements on quality management and management of health and safety working in private sector organizations. To do this, the scientific literature was consulted. This search was performed using the key terms ""integrated management"", ""integration of management systems"" and ""High-level structure. Additionally, an iterative search of the publications of the two main authors took place. Further, the current legal regulations in Colombia were analyzed on applicable management companies analyzed. The texts that met the criteria were retrieved and analyzed following the methodology of critical reading on the proposal for Alvarado 2012. They were subsequently contrasted with Annex SL directives of ISO / IEC. We concluded that highlevel structure facilitates the integrated quality management and safety and health at work and optimizes resources to achieve the objectives organizational"
L19|Firm market valuation and intellectual property assets|This paper investigates the relationship between the innovative activity of the top corporate R&D investors worldwide and their valuation on the financial markets. The empirical analysis is based on a sample of more than 1,500 top publicly listed Multinational Corporations (MNCs) performing a considerable share of the business investment in R&D worldwide. The main dataset covers their intellectual properties, patents and trademarks, filed between 2005 and 2012. The paper extends upon the recent literature on the links between IP assets and the firms’ financial valuation. It assesses the potential premium resulting from the interactive use of different IPRs. More importantly, it differentiates the extent to which IPRs confer a market premium to companies with respect to their industrial competitors from the extent to which within-company variations hold the key to a market premium. Finally confirming the relevance of corporate mixes of IP assets, important industrial specificities are found in the premiums granted to both individual and two-ways strategies.
L19|Regional Competition in US Banking – Trends and Determinants|Competition in the US banking industry as measured by the Lerner Index has on average increased substantially during the last decade. At the same time, regional differences in competition on the state level have decreased considerably. Based on a dynamic panel framework we find that these developments are mainly driven by industry specific factors such as the costs to income ratio. The empirical evidence indicates that inefficiency and the Lerner index are significant negatively correlated. Macroeconomic conditions appear to have supported these trends in competition, however, to a somewhat lesser extent.
L19|Mexico's industrial sector companies: A measurement of intellectual capital and its impact on financial performance|Currently knowledge is considered an essential resource to contribute to the creation and generation of competitive advantage in organizations. The human factor as an intangible resource of a company has become a main value generator, and even though both knowledge management and intellectual capital are intangibles that can be measured in the financial reports of companies, their position as main value generators is not reflected in financial information. In Mexico, industrial sector companies need to promote the creation of intellectual added value based on its own abilities, which reside on their intellectual capital. The value added intellectual coefficient (VAIC™), with its components, is a tool that contributes to achieving this goal, and helps to identify the positive impact on key factors such as financial profitability, market capitalization and level of share value.
L19|Multiple-Quality Cournot Oligopoly and the Role of Market Size|We model an oligopoly where firms can choose the quality level of their products by incurring set-up costs that generally depend on quality level. If the set-up cost is independent of product quality, firms may choose to supply both types of quality.We focus on the long run equilibrium where free entry and exit ensure that the profit for each type of firm is zero. Using this framework, we study the implications of an increase in the market size. We show that for the existence of an equilibrium where some firms specialize in the low quality product it is necessary that the set-up cost for the lower quality product, adjusted for quality level, is lower than that for the higher quality product. In the case where the unit variable costs are zero, or they are proportional to quality level (so that unit variable costs, adjusted for quality, are the same), we show that an increase in the market size leads to (i) an increase in the fraction of firms that specialize in the high quality products, (ii) the market shares (both in value terms and in terms of volume of output) of high quality producers increases, and (iii) the prices of both types of product decrease. In the case where higher quality requires higher set-up cost (per unit of quality) but lower unit variable cost (per unit of quality), subject to certain bounds on the difference in unit variable costs, we obtain the result that an increase in the market size decreases the number of low quality firms, increases the number of high quality firms, and decreases the prices of both products. In the special case where the set up cost is independent of quality level, we find that all firms will produce both type of quality levels. In this case, an increase in the market size will reduce the value shares of low quality products, but will leave their volume share unchanged; and the market expansion induces a fall in the relative price of the low quality product, and in the prices of both products in terms of the numeraire good. We carry out an empirical test of a version of the model, where set-up costs now refer to set-up costs to establish an export market, and they vary according to the quality of product that the firm exports to that market. We show that the data supported the hypothesis that the average qualities of the product are higher for bigger export markets.

L19|Are consumers forward looking? Evidence from used iPhones| This study examines the impact of planned obsolescence – the introduction of new models to make existing models obsolete – on secondary markets for mobile phones. Using data of over 320,000 used iPhones listings on Thailand’s largest online marketplace, we document that iPhone prices decrease with age, around 2.8–3.2% for each passing month. We find no evidence that the price decline accelerates after launches of new models (i.e. obsolescence), lending support to the view that consumer in durable goods markets are rational and forward looking.
L19|"""The Quality Of The Ecosystem Of Start-Up Companies In Poland As A Factor Of Their Internationalization In The Global Network Economy Environment - Research Project. Goals, Assumptions And Researc Methods ?"|"The aim of the presentation is to submit and put into discussion the research project ""The quality of the ecosystem of start-up companies in Poland as a factor of their internationalization in the global network economy environment? (later on termed ?Project?). The title issue will be put in the perspective of the experience of highly developed countries. The Project is aimed at comprehensive, thorough analysis of the actual state and economic conditions for the internationalization of Polish startups as well as potential future perspectives for their international expansion with special importance attached to the quality of so called ?ecosystems? in Poland as a factor of this expansion. Second, the analysis undertaken in the Project places the title issue, i.e. the internationalization of startups, in a broader context of the ?network economy? (also called ?knowledge based economy? or ?digital economy? and refers to the concept of ?born globals?. The comparative perspective for the studies of the subject issue is the characteristics of the startups, their business environment and particularly the tendencies and dynamics of startups foreign expansion observed in other European countries, boasting good performance and best indicators as to the internationalization of those firms, like among others Germany, the Netherlands, France, Great Britain, Italy and Spain. As supplementary research the Project intention is to present the relevant characteristics of the leading world startup centers (i.e. their ecosystems) in highly developed countries, mainly from the United States, Canada and Israel. Taking up ?internationalization? as the center of the project is valuable not only for scientific and cognitive purposes but also from the point of view of the current priorities of Poland?s economic policy. This project combines, both theoretically and empirically, the research fields of the widely understood quality of state ?ecosystem? as the environment for startup development and work, as well as the conditions of the global economy. The presentation on the Conference will be concentrated mainly on the scientific problem aimed to be solved by the proposed Project, Project's research hypotheses and the proposed methodology. Important argument for the innovative character of the Project is that its empirical part embraces various analytical methods used in micro- and macroeconomics. It applies behavioral methods used in sociological and psychological analyses in economics, such us: variance analysis, multifactorial variance analysis, i.e. ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA and Principal Component Analysis. These will be used along with quantitative methods such as regression (widely-used"
L19|Economic burden of toxicities associated with treating metastatic melanoma in eight countries|Abstract Background Information on costs of managing adverse events (AEs) associated with current treatments in metastatic melanoma is limited. This study estimates costs of AEs in eight countries: Australia (AU), Canada (CA), France (FR), Germany (GE), Italy (IT), the Netherlands (NL), Spain (ES), and the UK. Methods A literature search was conducted to identify grade 3/4 AEs from product label, published trials, conference abstracts, and treatment guidelines. Resource utilization for the management of each type of AE was determined via interviews with 5 melanoma clinicians in each country. Outpatient and inpatient costs were estimated for each type of AE using country-specific tariffs or government/published sources. Results In outpatient settings, the most costly AEs per incident included cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) (€1063, £720; NL/UK), anemia (€1443, €1329, €1285; ES/IT/FR), peripheral neuropathy (€1289; ES), and immune-related diarrhea (AUS$1,121; AU). In inpatient settings, the most costly AEs per hospitalization included hypophysitis (€10,265; €5316; CAN$9735; AUS$7231: ES/FR/CA/AU), dyspnea (€9077; GE), elevated liver enzymes (€6913, CAN$8030, AUS$6594; FR/CA/AU), CSCC (CAN$8934; CA), peripheral neuropathy (€6977, €4144, CAN$9472; NL/ES/CA), and diarrhea (£4284, €4113; UK/ES). Conclusions Costs of managing AEs can be significant, and thus effective treatments with lower rates of severe AEs would be valuable.
L19|Caracterización industrial regional de Uruguay|"This working paper presents the main results of the project ""Mapping at Municipal level of the industries of more than 5 employees in Uruguay"". We geographically referenced industrial plants throughout the country, complementing it with socio-demographic and economic information, thus offering an overview of the different territorial profiles where industrial production is located in Uruguay. The industrial characterization was carried out in several territorial scales: department (province), locality and municipality. The analysis at the subdepartmental level is deepened especially in the departments with greater industrial development. The results are descriptive and meet the objective of making available new information that allows quantifying the participation of different regions and territories in national industrial activity. The analysis reveals important structural differences between regions and territories, opening up possibilities for reflecting on a research agenda on the development of the industry from a regional perspective. This is a significant contribution to understand the current state of the distribution of industry in national territory and the different regional production profiles."
L19|Bridging conflicting innovation spheres of tourism innovation: the role of diplomacy|In service sectors such as tourism production and consumption are tied to places. In these places different actors base their production on a set of shared resources. Such localized systems can be characterized by different service practices, disagreements among actors, lack of trust, and competition which may inhibit networked and open innovation. Tourist destinations are examples of such localized systems. In this paper we present two extreme cases of tourist destinations in which collaborative innovation processes were established in spite of fierce disagreements between actors. We argue that in tourist destinations actors belong to conflicting innovation spheres but can be brought together in innovation processes when a diplomat enable compromises and when innovation spheres change from personalized to more generalized forms of activity during interaction. The findings are relevant not only for tourism but also for other sectors characterized by localized systems. JEL Codes: L83, L14, L19, O30, Z00
L19|A demand-driven innovation insight in the banking industry|There are two major types of financial innovations: one which is profit-seeking and supply-driven; another which is mostly demand-driven, outward-looking and socially oriented. We illustrate this twofold perspective analyzing the behavior of the banking industry during the period of the subprime mortgage crisis. More precisely, we examine how the financial statements of different types of banks are linked to innovation theories. From this analysis it emerges that, unlike mainstream banking, only the so-called ethical banks can be said to be putting into effect a demand-driven type of financial innovation in their banking practice. It is also argued that this involves a distinct business model. The last part of the paper explores briefly to what extent this demand-driven innovation approach to banking makes sense in the context of the post-financial crisis. JEL Codes: G21, L19, L2, G32
L19|Academic Publication Uncertainty and Publishing Behavior: A Game-Theoretic Perspective|This paper incorporates publication uncertainty in a game between researchers and journal editors and examines its effects on quantity and quality of published research. A stylized differential Stackelberg game between journal editors and academic authors is considered, where authors seek to maximize satisfaction from publications, while journal editors try to enhance reputations of their journals. Publication probability depends on the number of academic journals. Results show that greater journal competition, generally leading to reduced publication uncertainty, would increase author payoffs by increasing citations and publications. However, it is not clear whether the quality of published research is enhanced. Thus, changes in competition in publishing markets have the potential to exacerbate the quantity-quantity trade offs in research markets.
L19|Competition in Swedish passenger railway : entry in an open-access market|The Swedish market for passenger railway services has been open to competition since the year 2010. Although minor entries have been made since this date, the incumbent SJ only faced substantial competition when MTR Express entered the Stockholm-Gothenburg line in March 2015. Using unique Sweden ticket price data from operators' websites, this paper investigates what effects this entry has had on market prices. The results show that the incumbent's prices decreased by 12.8 percent on average between March 2015 and June 2016. The price level of the competitor is well below the average price that was offered on the railway market in the pre-entry period. Further, the largest price reduction, in percentage terms, was found on tickets booked 10 days before the departure date. Finally, the decrease in the average price of the incumbent seems to be an ongoing process, and a further drop in price would not be unexpected.
L19|Landscape of standard essential patents : The case of East Asian countries|Technical standards in the mobile communications industry have been developed from national to regional and from regional to global. In the current era, global standards in the industry have enabled the formation of a single global market. However, because standard essential patents (SEPs) are territorial given the nature of the patent system, they can function as an opportunity or a threat depending on whether or not they are protected in countries of interest. This paper investigates how W-CDMA and LTE SEPs owned by East Asian countries are globally distributed. From the analysis, the current study discovers East Asian SEP owners’ strategies, future opportunities, and threats in their international businesses.
L19|Temptation in Markets with no Commitment: Give-aways, Scare-aways and Reversals|I study a two period model where the buyer suffers from self-control problems and his level of temptation is private information. I derive the optimal behaviour of a seller that offers her product to a buyer. In period 1, the latter decides whether or not to “enter the store” based on the prices posted by the seller. In period 2 he decides how much of the product to buy, if any. Differently from the existing literature, I assume that the seller cannot commit to the prices posted in period 1. I show how, under this framework, the presence of tempted consumers and symmetric information can explain the existence of free vouchers offered by the seller to the consumer in exchange for entering the store. In contrast with classical contract theory, I show that the relatively untempted consumer (the “low type”) can be better off when information about his type is private than when the seller is fully informed. Moreover, the presence of self-control may induce the seller to exclude the relatively strongly tempted consumer (the “high type”) from the market.
L19|Evolution And Development Strategies Regarding Sme Sector In Romania And The Republic Of Moldova|The small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are at the top of European strategies and policies, a key factor for growth, employment and economic performance. The economic and financial crisis of 2008 has affected the SME sector in Romania and the Republic of Moldova, whose development was different from that of most European countries. Therefore, it requires a sustained effort to overcome these gaps and realistic development strategies of the SME sector in Romania and Moldova, proposed by the specialized agencies of the two countries. Following a process of critical analysis and interpretation of national and international databases, we investigated the small and medium enterprises sector in Romania and Moldova in order to identify solutions to support the SME sector in the two countries
L19|Negative Advertising and Political Competition|Why is negative advertising such a prominent feature of competition in the US political market? We hypothesize that two-candidate races provide stronger incentives for going negative relative to non-duopoly contests: when the number of competitors is greater than two, airing negative ads creates positive externalities for opponents that are not the object of the attack. To investigate the empirical relevance of the fewness of competitors in explaining the volume of negative advertising, we exploit variation in the number of entrants running for US non-presidential primaries from 2000 through 2008. Duopolies are over twice as likely to air a negative ad when compared to non-duopolies, and the tendency for negative advertising decreases in the number of competitors. The estimates are robust to various specification checks and the inclusion of potential confounding factors at the race, candidate, and advertisement levels. (JEL D72, D79, L10, L19)
L19|Imperative Strategic Planning as Improvement of the Decision Making of Organization|Imperative strategic planning in organizations regarded as a tool for organizationsâ€™ growth and profitability, strategic innovation, organizational and customer-oriented changes. This article attempts to explain the imperative strategic plan collective by patterns of thinking. The importance of strategic, long-term policy and imperative strategic plan collective is very clear to planners. Imperative strategic managers like to follow a similar and routine imperative strategic behavioral pattern. Imperative strategic plan collective, normally taken, as a part of imperative strategic planning, therefore also tends to run in cycles of around last years. Implementing tailored organization can give a competitive advantage and help foster goodwill toward imperative strategic planning approach. Studies on corporate organizational imperative strategic have possessed an increasing growth. This paper proposes a learning organization expectations method that considers tailored organization s information. In todayâ€™s tailored organization al environment, there are usually several products and services to fulfill certain functions.
L19|Financial and Corporate Structure in South Africa|Concentration in the South African financial sector has its origins in three main influences that are all historical (i) the legacy of domination by a small number of large imperial banks, (ii) the struggle between English and Afrikaner capital and (iii) the statutory legislation that framed the operation of banks. In this paper we describe the part played by these three historical influences in the formation and development of the corporate sector in South Africa. One recurrent theme throughout the history is the relative position of the foreign bank and domestic bank in the local market place. We take up this theme and argue that the scale and extent of foreign bank operations in South Africa is far greater than estimates provided by the local authorities. We have found that the main vehicle in deepening the concentration of the sector has been the merger. In later sections of the paper we lay out how the amalgamation by absorption approach to expansion that has been a constant feature of the country’s business life comes together with a merger frenzy in the late 1980’s and 1990s that succeeds in further deepening concentration within banking, finance and industry. Last, we end with an analysis of industry structure by Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) capitalisation between 1994 and 2011.
L19|Structure, Conduct and Performance Analysis of Indian Commercial Banks|The market structure, conducts and performance of the Indian banking sector have changed since the introduction of banking sector reforms. Slower economic growth, coupled with asset quality problems in recent years, has taken a toll on the overall health of the Indian banking sector. Higher statutory capital requirement under Basel III has posed another major challenge to the Indian banks. The purpose of the study is to examine the impact of structural changes and conduct of Indian commercial banks on their profitability in the paradigm of structureâ€“conductâ€“performance (SCP) framework. Market concentration, bank-specific/macroeconomic variables have been considered as important determinants of the profitability. The regression results find a negative relationship between profitability and market concentration and reject SCP hypotheses. The study found that capitalization, credit risk, leverage and ownership structure are the most important determinants of the profitability of Indian banks. The study also found that financial crisis had no significant impact on the profitability of Indian banks. JEL Classification: C4, G21, G28, L19
L19|Born Globals in Interactive Branding Environment: A case of the BonAlive|Interactive Branding (I-Branding) environment consists of business network environments in which companies cooperate with each other through mutual interactions that are based on three dimensions: internal, external and mutual branding dimension. I-Branding as an activity is therefore presented as a business strategy through which a company is positioning itself in a local and foreign network of business relationships. Internationalization provides a new lens for this process, in which different networks of large distances are all interconnected through interactions of three branding dimensions. Born global companies are small companies with early and rapid internationalization, which are successfully implementing their strategies and fighting for a favourable position in foreign networks. In order to discover challenges and opportunities of becoming successful so rapidly, a family owned company in the pharmaceutical industry is followed over the years. Based on case findings, the paper suggests managerial implications for start-ups and born global companies, together with some direction for a future theoretical and empirical research.
L19|Management And Marketing Sciences? Reaction To The Networked World|The purpose of the exploratory study is to compare the perspectives of management and marketing sciences on networks and reveal out why and how firms become connected and interdependent, and how the relationships affect their ability to compete according to these perspectives. For this purpose, network theory has been taken as a common ground. The management theories which form the network theory and relationship marketing have been discussed. In this paper, the difference between the perception of management and marketing sciences on networks have been expressed in terms of the components of ARA Model. It is possible to notice that some issues have been reverted under different components. This paper aims to put emphasize on that the two arm in arm sciences are in the opposite edges and explain why by presenting the attitude of two different sciences to networks through a model which explains the network theory. It is hoped that this paper helps decision takers to be enlightened if they act as a manager or marketer.
L19|Designing Dynamic Research Tournaments|This paper considers the optimal design of dynamic research tournaments when the buyer can set time-dependent prizes. We derive the buyer-optimal tournament and show that it entails an increasing prize schedule. Remarkably, this allows the buyer to implement a global stopping rule. In particular, the optimal tournament attains the first-best. More generally, we show that global stopping rules can be implemented robustly and compare them to individual stopping rules which have been analyzed in the existing literature. We conclude by discussing policy implications of our findings and highlight that global stopping rules combine the best aspects of innovation races and fixed prize tournaments.
L19|Designing dynamic research contests|This paper studies the optimal design of dynamic research contests. We introduce interim transfers, which are paid in every period while the contest is ongoing, to an otherwise standard setting. We show that a contest where: (i) the principal can stop the contest in any period, (ii) a constant interim transfer is paid to agents in each period while the contest is ongoing, and (iii) a final prize is paid once the principal stops the contest, is optimal for the principal and implements the first-best.
L19|Matrix Model for Choosing Green Marketing Sustainable Strategic Alternatives|Green marketing examines the symbiotic role played by marketing in ensuring sustainable business, exploring issues concerning the environment and the way strategic decisions can influence it. At present, the environmental issues concern more and more the competitive approach any organization can implement. Based on this approach, organizations can gain competitive advantage by managing environmental variables and by developing and implementing green marketing strategies. Considering the importance and impact of green marketing, by using theoretical concepts and defining a set of research directions, the paper and the research conducted were focused on creating a matrix model for choosing the optimal green marketing strategy, oriented towards competitive advantage. The model is based on the correlation that can be established among the generic strategies of competitive advantage, the variables of extended marketing mix (7Ps) and the green marketing strategy matrix. There are also analyzed the implications that may be generated within a company by the adoption of a green marketing strategy and its role in promoting the environmental benefits of products.
L19|Deconstructing the collective process of environmental innovation: a case study of Poitou-Charentes companies|This paper attempts to give explanations of environmental collaborations, as few works have focused empirically on this topic, given the lack of precise data. We aim to explain what, why, where, and with whom firms collaborate (or not)? We used more than 300 data on environmental innovations (EI) collected through semi-directive interviews and analyzed them with a mixed method. In line with the work of De Marchi (2012), we tested the specificity of EI in comparison with innovation in general. First, a probit model reveals the importance of the type of EI in the probability of collaborating when a company produces an EI. Next, statistics and verbatim transcripts emphasize the relevance of private companies as partners to EI and the frequent requirement for technical support during collaborations. These last two results nonetheless depend on the type of EI achieved. Partners are selected mainly for their geographical proximity and the trust granted to them, whereas costs and competences appear to be secondary criteria of choice. Lastly, we observe that partners are mainly located within the region irrespective of the type of EI. JEL Codes: L19, O31, Q55
L19|Estimación del precio marginal del sistema eléctrico colombiano: una mirada desde la organización industrial|Construimos un modelo de Cournot para simular el comportamiento estratégico de las empresas generadoras líderes del mercado eléctrico colombiano. Usamos las cantidades estimadas con este modelo para construir dos variables de organización industrial: el índice de demanda residual y el índice de Herfindahl e Hirschman (HHI). Con ellas estimamos modelos vectoriales autorregresivos (VAR) que permitan estimar el precio en bolsa (PMS) y hacer análisis impulso-respuesta. Los resultados muestran que la capacidad de almacenamiento de las empresas hidráulicas permite un mayor comportamiento estratégico que las térmicas en periodos de demanda baja, mientras que las térmicas son más estratégicas en periodos de demanda alta. Además los choques sobre los cambios en la demanda residual y en la concentración del mercado se reflejan en un comportamiento fluctuante sobre el crecimiento del PMS, lo que se puede interpretar como una reacción de la estrategia de las empresas ante un cambio en las circunstancias del mercado.
L19|Drivers of cost reduction in solar photovoltaics|Using a new dataset of costs, output, sales, technical characteristics, and capital expenditures of firms in the solar industry during 2005–2012, this paper investigates the factors that have contributed to the decline in the cost of producing solar panels. While previous studies have attributed learning-by-doing and economies of scale as important drivers of cost reduction, these do not have any significant effect on cost once four other factors are taken into account, namely, (i) reduction in the cost of a principal raw material, (ii) increasing presence of solar panel manufacturers from China, (iii) technological innovations, and (iv) increase in investment at the industry level. These findings suggest that the upstream industries that supply the solar panel industry with raw materials and capital equipment have been important contributors to the reduction in the production cost of solar panels.
L19|The role of critical mass in establishing a successful network market: An experimental investigationAuthor-Name: Ruffle, Bradley J|A network market is a market in which the benefit each consumer derives from a good is an increasing function of the number of consumers who own the same or similar goods. A major obstacle that plagues the introduction of a network good is the ability to reach critical mass, namely, the minimum number of buyers required to render purchase worthwhile. This can be likened to a coordination game with multiple Pareto-ranked equilibria. Through a series of experiments, we study consumers' ability to coordinate on purchasing the network good. Our results highlight the central importance of the size of the critical mass. Neither an improved reward-risk ratio through lower prices nor previous success at a lower critical mass facilitates the establishment of a network market when the critical mass is sufficiently high.
L19|Revisiting profit persistence and the stock market in Japan|This paper tests the classical hypothesis of inter-industry profit rate's proclivity to gravitate towards the economy's average profit rate. In so doing, individual as well as panel unit root tests have been applied on a dataset consisting of 52 Japanese manufacturing industries spanning the period 1974–2008. The evidence generated is rather mixed in a sense that the inter-industry profit rates tendency to gravitate towards the economy's average rate of profit depends on the idiosyncratic characteristics of each industry. However, the rate of profit of regulating capitals, as this is reflected in the incremental rate of profit, displays gravitational behaviour around the economy-wide incremental rate of profit, the movement of which is found to be linked to the rate of return in the stock market. These results lend support to those who contend that the classical theory of competition is an area where further research is warranted.

L19|An Approach to the Analysis of Strategic Development Trend in the Electricity Production Regarding the Energy Sector Framework: The Ukrainian and Spanish Cases|This paper aims to analyse the Strategic Development Trend in production of electricity both in Ukraine and Spain. Modern approaches and innovations in energy production are identified in these two countries. Energy market establishment has been analysed retrospectively and comparative approach in analytical research of energy sectors of Ukraine and Spain has been used along with SPACE-matrix analysis. By implementing this methodology, we work out the main factors related to the relevant energy issues and the graphic SPACE-matrix model has been carried out. Finally we draw conclusions.
L19|Efficiency, Concentration and Competition in the Turkish Banking Sector|The collusion hypothesis in the Structure-Conduct-Performance (SCP) approach assumes a negative relationship between concentration and competition. The efficient structure hypothesis asserts a positive relationship between efficiency and competition. Both of these traditional approaches to industrial economics imply that markets cannot be simultaneously concentrated and competitive. Recently, the new empirical industrial economics (NEIO) approach proved that competition may exist in markets even when concentration is high. Although the links among competition, concentration and efficiency have been established by these approaches at a theoretical level, the direction of causality among these variables remains as an empirical question to be addressed. Thus, this study aims to empirically explore the direction of the relationship among concentration, efficiency and competition employing the Panzar and Rosse (1987) model and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methods to the Turkish banking sector over the period of 1990-2011. Contrary to the predictions of the SCP approach, the findings of this study reveal that the level of efficiency increases in the sector as long as the level of competition increases in the market.
L19|Hidden climate change related risks for the private sector|Climate change related risks impact and challenge the private sector in many different ways. This also applies to risk drivers like a companies’ reputation and a changing consumer behavior. Since significant risk drivers for companies differ just as much as companies themselves, a sector specific guideline to evaluate possible climate change related risk drivers is indispensable. Further, a sector specific analysis on these risk drivers can foster cross sectoral cooperation, innovation and learning processes with regard to climate change related risks.
L19|The Structural Power of Enterprises: Beyond the Notion of Market Power|The purpose of this paper is the conceptualisation of the notion of enterprises’ structural power. It allows to draw the attention to the process of diversification of enterprises and building of complex and multidimensional ownership structures as possible sources of the increase in the companies’ power and the possibility of its use and abuse in order to limit the competition and perform better on the market. The concept of structural power is a part of the scientific discussion on the sources and possibilities of using enterprises’ market power, and fits into the current research on one of the fundamental problems of economic theory: how to protect competition internationally and, therefore, determine the limit when the natural and desirable behaviour of enterprises aimed at increasing their international competitiveness begins to distort competition and adversely affect economic development. The analysis shows that the potential influence on other market participants may arise not only from the firm’s position on the relevant market and other factors related to its specificity, but also from the various types of linkages between firms.
L19|When Online Engagement Gets in the Way of Offline Sales - A Natural Experiment| The paper studies the effect of online engagement on a brand’s website on offline sales, for a product not available via the online channel. We propose a modelling framework for the online-to-offline funnel, and study the effect of online engagement on purchase decisions. The model highlights both substitution and complementarity between online and offline engagement and sales. We then exploit a natural experiment setting to study the effect of the introduction of a new interactive website by a leading automobile brand on dealership contact and sales. We find evidence for substitution between online and offline engagement, as offline engagement and sales declined following launch of the new website
L19|A Model of Innovation and Sustainability: the Regional Business Ecosystem|The paper focuses on the importance of the region in the development of a business ecosystem, with focus on territorial capital an innovation. The approach stems from the need for a more focus, more flexible regional policy towards building a sustainable, efficient business ecosystem.

L19|Resilience or Flexibilityâ€“ A Theoretical Approach on Romanian Development Regions|The paper describes a theoretical contextualization of flexibility, sustainability, durability and resilience, in the context of the sustainable development goals. The main purpose is to identify the theoretical handles that may be used in the creation of a flexibility indicator. Thus, research questions related to the theoretical differentiation between durable and sustainable, flexible and resilient are answered. Further on, the paper describes the situation of the Romanian regions in terms of development indicators, based on Eurostat data, as a premise for further research on the possibility of their leapfrogging. This work was financially supported through the project â€œRoutes of academic excellence in doctoral and post-doctoral research- REACHâ€ co-financed through the European Social Fund, by Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, contract no POSDRU/59/1.5/S/137926.
L19|The conditions for development of e-commerce in Poland|The aim of the paper is the presentation of the e-commerce sector in Poland. It is a dynamically developing sector which mainly consists of microenterprises. The authors pay attention to the most important problems connected with the development of e-stores in Poland. These are, most of all, the low average values of shopping carts and a small number of clients. The reason of this situation is, among others, inefficient use of the contemporary IT tools, e.g. social media are treated by e-commerce as another carrier of advertising. There is no knowledge or understanding that it is a tool enabling the development of more advanced marketing activities. The data from the reports presented in the paper indicate some trends in the behavior of Internet users, which are favorable for e-commerce. On their basis, there can be expected an increase in the amount and frequency of online shopping. However, for this to happen, it is necessary to introduce changes in the functioning of Polish e-commerce. Most of all, there is required sales optimization. In the paper, there will be presented the most important elements of the marketing strategy and basic tools of sales optimization.
L19|Capability vs Competency: A Case of Vishpala Prosthetics|To understand a business, its operations or its competitiveness, it is important to understand the competition and factors of production. These factors help in evaluating the profitability of a firm, its growth prospects and eventual long-term survival. Further, to ensure survival (sustainability) of the firm, it is essential to ascertain the plausible source of competitive advantage, such as core competency. The firm faces with the choice to either build all such required competencies in-house or to somehow acquire them from outside. This paper takes the case of Vishpala Prosthetics and tests the issues of competency in the practical perspective of strategy implementation.The paper converges the two diverging perceptions of the firm, capability versus competency, by analyzing the resource that is valuable to the firm through the five tests as suggested by Collis & Montgomery (2008), viz. the test of inimitability, the test of durability, the test of appropriability, the test of substitutability and the test of competitive superiority. With this, the argument between capability versus competency is explained in the perspective of strategy implementation with the help of the case on the firm.
L19|Location Proximity and Productivity Spillovers: The Case of Korean Manufacturing Plants|Knowledge spillovers have been recognized as an important source of innovation and economic growth in both industry and firm-level data. A firm may reap benefits by locating near other firms in the same geographical region. In this paper, we examine how physical proximity influences a firm's future productivity and its survival possibility. Our results indicate that a firm located in a region with a higher median total factor productivity (TFP) gains higher productivity from other firms in the same region. One possible explanation is that such a firm has more opportunity to access superior external knowledge and to produce more new ideas. Our results also indicate these productivity-enhancing characteristics do not seem to be industry-specific. Finally, we find that high productivity firms are the only significant sources of knowledge spillovers, suggesting that firms benefit most from combining their internal knowledge with the external knowledge of neighboring firms with high TFP on average. © 2015 The Earth Institute at Columbia University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology

L19|Motives For Food Choice Among Serbian Consumers| People’s motives for food choice depend on a number of very complex economic, social and individual factors. A Food Choice Questionnaire (FCQ), an instrument that measures the importance of factors underlying food choice, was used to reveal the Serbian consumers’ food choice motives by survey of 450 respondents of different age groups. A conﬁrmatory factor analysis was conducted on the motive items, using 11 factors. Previous research shows that the nutrition in Serbia is not balanced enough, and therefore the analysis of motives for food choice is considered a useful tool for the planning of more efficient public policies and interventions aimed at influencing healthier eating habits. Hence the results can be useful for researchers as well as for public institutions which deal with creating the strategy of public health or businessmen who produce and sell food products, because knowing consumer behaviour is necessary for product success on the market.
L19|Synergy evaluation in economic clusters|The aim of this work is to specify, accept or reject a priori assumption of a positive synergy in economic cluster development, to propose à quantitative assessment of synergy and à description of the interaction process among enterprises in the cluster. There are presented arguments in support of the assumption that the cluster can be considered as an economic system. The synergy effects are summarized and described as superadditive and subadditive functions of expenses and revenues. The interaction process among enterprises in the cluster is described by a thermodynamic approach to the costs analysis of the economic systems development and an introduced condition for positive synergy realization. As a quantitative measure of synergy effect is used the concept of entropy. The proposed experimental solution demonstrates the application of presented approach, its possible analytical interpretations and predictability potential for positive or negative synergy realization.
L19|Regulating Rates of Return Do Gravitate in US Manufacturing!| In this paper we test for the gravitation of regulating return rates, namely those return rates yielded by capital goods incorporating the best methods of production. We define them within a vintage capital model taking into consideration capacity utilization, capital depreciation and wages of workers using past capital vintages. We consider two data sets regarding US manufacturing activities and we find that gravitation does take place. Our results are contrasted with those of the previous literature. Research and policy implications are discussed.

En él se presenta una revisión que deja por sentados los posibles caminos a seguir, los cuales contribuyen a la perdurabilidad de las organizaciones.
L19|Factores que influyen en el desarrollo exportador de las pymes en Colombia|El propósito de este artículo es identificar los factores que influyen en el desarrollo exportador de las pequeñas y medianas empresas (pymes) con internacionalización temprana en Colombia. Por medio del uso de la información incluida en el Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) en su reporte para Colombia en 2010, se toman las pymes que inician su proceso de internacionalización en sus primeros años de creación, y con un modelo de ecuaciones estructurales se comprueba que variables como características del emprendedor, factores internos, características del sector y del entorno, innovación y recursos y capacidades de la pyme determinan el proceso de internacionalización temprana de las pymes en Colombia.
L19|La modélisation du risque en immobilier d'entreprise|The real estate asset class is tangible, heterogeneous and illiquid. It gives a specific investment universe that needs to be understood by investors, because the uncertainties created by this universe compose the risk of real estate investment. We suggest modelling risks across a sum of risk unit appraisal, on one hand, in constructing portfolio analysis, and on the other hand, through the office market risk premium modelling. Our doctoral study proposes to adapt financial theorems to risk modelling in the main European office markets. Our thesis will be written in Englishand its body will be articulated around three axes whereby those will be illustrated under the form of article.
L19|Konzept einer Stakeholderkommunikation in Unternehmenskrisen am Beispiel von zivilgesellschaftlichen Bewegungen bei Industrie- und Infrastrukturprojekten<BR>[A Concept of Stakeholder Communication Within Company Crises Exemplified by Civil Movements During Industrial and Infrastructure Projects]|The following article focuses the communication between project sponsors and civil society in large-scale projects, mainly in terms of industry and infrastructure. First, the actors of civil society and public are discussed within the context of social theory by Jürgen Habermas. In this context, social structures have a high influence on civil society. Changes like globalization, individualization and particularly the rise of internet shape the environment of civil actions. Second, a theoretical discussion on communication enters center stage. This is necessary in order to fulfil the article’s objective to make recommendations for a communication concept for project sponsors. It bases on Grunig and Hunt’s four PR model as well as on the PR concept of understanding by Burkart und Probst, which both underline the importance of consensus, two-way communication and understanding-seeking. The final concept bases on the mentioned theoretical backgrounds, on practical cases as well as on additional expert information. It contains objectives, a strategy and measures for project sponsors to communicate successfully by providing plenty of information, by including stakeholders in discussion and finally even by making decision.
L19|L’impact des LBO sur la défaillance des entreprises Le cas des cibles françaises (2000-2010)|(VF)Cet article étudie l’incidence des opérations de leveraged buyout (LBO) sur la défaillance des entreprises cibles françaises. Selon la théorie de l’agence, l’augmentation du risque de défaillance, induit par la hausse du niveau d’endettement, doit être compensée par le renforcement du contrôle et l’amélioration de la gouvernance. L’étude empirique est construite sur un modèle d’appariement par score de propension à partir d’un échantillon de 626 opérations de LBO dont 55 ont fait l’objet d’une défaillance financière entre 2000 et 2010. Les résultats montrent que le taux de défaillance des entreprises cibles reprises en LBO est significativement plus élevé que celui des entreprises appariées. Par ailleurs, le taux de défaillance est positivement corrélé avec le niveau d’endettement post-acquisition et le niveau de la rentabilité économique (ROCE) avant et après le rachat en LBO.(VA)This article investigates whether leveraged buy-out (LBO) transactions increase or decrease the risk of financial distress of French companies. According to agency theory, the increase of the bankruptcy risk, induced by rising debt levels, should be offset by the introduction of new governance mechanisms that improve business performance and ultimately reduce the risk of failure. The empirical study is based on a propensity score matching model which focuses on a sample of 626 LBOs with 55 operations that have experienced financial distress between 2000 and 2010 in France. The results show that the failure rate is significantly higher in the sample than the matched firms in the model. Moreover, the rate of bankruptcy is positively correlated with the post-acquisition debt level and the economic return before and after the buyout.

L19|Patent strength and optimal two-part tariff licensing with a potential rival|We investigate a two-part tariff licensing contract that enables an incumbent innovator to license the technology for a new product to a potential rival, who may alternatively develop a compatible technology for an imperfectly substitutable product. We identify the optimal two-part tariff licensing contract based on the development cost incurred by the rival, the market parameter, and the substitution coefficient.
L19|The unique equilibrium in a model of sales with costly advertising|We demonstrate that the Varian (1980) model of sales has a unique Nash equilibrium when firms incur costly advertising to compete for informed consumers. The equilibrium is symmetric. In particular, with costly advertising, the asymmetric equilibria highlighted by Baye et al. (1992) do not arise.
L19|Assessment of initial emission allowance allocation methods in the Korean electricity market|Korea will introduce an emission trading policy from 2015. The rules for the initial allocation of emission allowances have not been decided yet. This paper assesses the effect of various initial emission allowance allocation methods of the Korean electricity market. This study employs the mixed complementarity problem, which is able to incorporate operation, investment, and emission trade decisions in the deregulated electricity market in order to provide more realistic results. In particular, the allocation rules to existing plants and new entrants are modeled separately in this study. The model quantifies the impacts of different allocation rules on emissions, capacity mix, emission allowance prices, electricity prices, and social welfare. We examine typical allocation rules such as auction to all power plants, best available technology (BAT) benchmark to all power plants, fuel-specific benchmark to existing power plants along with BAT benchmark to new entrants, and fuel-specific benchmark to all power plants. We find that giving free allocations to new power plants prompts more new investment and this raises overall social welfare even though the direct cost of achieving the emission reduction target rises. While the auction is the most powerful policy to reduce emissions in the electricity sector, giving away permits to all power plants based on a fuel-specific benchmark encourages investment, increases output, and leads to a greater level of welfare from an imperfectly competitive industry.
L19|Territorial Capital and Innovative Entrepreneurial Ecosystems – A Theoretical Approach|The paper focuses on the concepts of territorial capital and entrepreneurial ecosystem, as pillars for development and growth. The main elements considered are the definitions of the two concepts, alongside the description of their components and mechanisms, as they appear in literature. The critical approach is related to the construct of growth as derived from both the ecosystem and the territorial capital. This work has been supported by SNF and UEFISCDI within the Romanian-Swiss Joint Research Project IZERZ0 _142306 / 1.
L19|Conditions For Sustainability Of The Organization’s Competitive Advantage|In the article there are compared and generalized the opinions of various authors on the complex of conditions, which must be met by the sources of competitive advantage for the latter to be sustainable. Research is founded on the views of the resource approach, according to which not all resources possess the same potential to be sources of sustainable competitive advantage. The requirement for the resource to be difficult to imitate affirms itself as a key condition for the sustainability of the advantage. There are also mentioned examples of resources that are difficult to imitate, for which various studies (including the author’s) prove a positive connection with the achieved advantage of the organization in the long run.
L19|Wahrnehmung des Klimawandels in deutschen Großunternehmen: Erkenntnisse aus dem Carbon Disclosure Project|Um den Klimawandel zu begrenzen, sind Anstrengungen auf globaler Ebene notwendig. Um sich an die Folgen des Klimawandels anzupassen, sind jedoch auch individuelle Strategien zur Risikovorsorge effektiv. Allerdings stehen frühzeitigen Anpassungsaktivitäten entgegen, dass die möglichen Klimafolgen häufig nicht wahrgenommen werden oder außerhalb der unternehmerischen Planungshorizonte liegen. Für die größten deutschen Unternehmen sind Risiken und Chancen infolge von Klimaveränderungen zunehmend präsent. In den kleinen und mittelständischen Unternehmen ist dies gegenwärtig weniger der Fall.
L19|Hospital Market Concentration and Discrimination of Patients|In this paper we investigate the existence of a two-tier medical system in the German acute care hospital sector using data from a survey of 483 German hospitals. The focus of our analysis lies on the impact of hospital concentration on the probability of discrimination of patients with different health insurances in regard to the access to medical services. Accounting for a possible endogeneity of market structure, we find that hospitals in highly concentrated markets are less likely to pursue any differentiation among prospective patients with different health insurances. We ascribe this finding to competitive pressure in less concentrated markets. Hospitals in competitive markets are more obliged to steal business from rival hospitals by privileging profitable patients than hospitals in highly concentrated markets.
L19|LBO, structure de propriété familiale et fonds d’investissement Quel impact sur l’évaluation et la performance des cibles post-LBO? - Family ownership, private equity funds and financial performance Is there a family equity premium in LBO transactions?|(VF)Cet article explore l’influence de la propriété familiale sur l’évaluation et la performance des entreprises post-LBO. L’étude porte sur 123 opérations de LBO effectuées sur des cibles françaises ayant fait l’objet d’une prise de participation majoritaire entre 2003 et 2007. L’analyse univariée montre que la performance s’accroît après un LBO quelle que soit la nature de la propriété. En revanche, la performance financière est plus élevée et le niveau des frais financiers plus faible pour les entreprises familiales. L’analyse multivariée indique que la valorisation de la cible est positivement corrélée au critère familial et à la présence majoritaire d’un fonds de private equity. Enfin, la performance financière est positivement corrélée au critère familial alors que la performance économique brute est significativement liée à la présence d’un fonds de private equity. (VA)This article explores the family ownership and the role of Private Equity fund on valuation and financial performance of a target after the completion of a LBO. The study is based on 123 transactions completed on French targets between 2003 and 2007 with a majority stake. Univariate analysis shows that financial performance increases after a LBO for the whole sample. Nevertheless, the ROE is higher and the level of financial expenses is lower for family firms. OLS regressions results show that the target valuation is positively correlated with the family criteria and the presence of a PE. The financial performance is also positively correlated with the family criteria whereas the gross economic performance is significantly linked with the presence of a PE fund.
L19|A model of competition in the solar panel industry|We develop a model of competition in the solar panel industry. Solar firms manufacture panels that are differentiated both vertically and horizontally, and compete by setting quantities. The equilibrium of the model is consistent with a set of stylized facts that we document, including variation in prices, markups and market shares across firms. We calibrate the model using a new dataset data on prices, costs and shipments of leading solar companies, as well as solar sales in four leading markets.

L19|Setting an institutional and regulatory framework for trading platforms: Is there a case for a new trading venue under MiFID?|Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework for the legal classification of trading venues in financial markets. Currently, there is no clear definition of when a trading platform should be classified as multilateral or bilateral. This paper builds a theoretical framework that will allow regulators to define the border (with its regulatory implications) between multilateral and bilateral trading venues. Design/methodology/approach - The approach used for this paper focuses on looking at the different trading models available in financial markets and analyzing their key features in order to bring up recurrent aspects that have helped to build the theoretical framework. Findings - Multilateral trading facilities would not only be systems bringing together multiple interests from third parties, but those systems bringing together multiple interests with “no discretion” ( Originality/value - The value of the paper is in its ability to provide a theoretical framework to something that has not been assessed in these terms previously. Today, only the SEC is trying, for the first time, to have a definition of when a RFQ model can be defined “multilateral”. This topic has been rarely discussed before in financial regulation, while it is extensively discussed in market microstructure (but on the market structure implications, rather than its regulatory and policy implications).
L19|Market power and double-dipping in nutrient trading markets|Heavy loads of nutrients, i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus, cause severe damages in many waters in the world. This paper develops a model for nutrient trading markets for a sea damaged by both nitrogen and phosphorus and faces a dominant polluter of one or both nutrients. The existence of abatement measures with simultaneous impacts on both nutrients raises the need for double-dipping in both markets. It is shown that double-dipping decreases overall abatement costs for reaching predetermined targets, and reduces efficiency losses of market power, in particular when the same agent exercises market power in both markets. An empirical application to the intergovernmental agreement on reducing nutrient loads to the eutrophied Baltic Sea in North-East Europe demonstrates cost savings of approximately 25% from introduction of double-dipping, and that efficiency losses from market power of one dominant country, Poland, can be reduced by 10%.
L19|Logistics Management Methodology For The Improvement Of Small Businesses, Metodologia De Gestion Logistica Para El Mejoramiento De Pequenas Empresas|Small businesses generally lack financial resources to pay for a logistics consulting. This implies that management of processes within the organization becomes a problem for the employer or an opportunity for improvement. This paper presents a methodology of support to improve logistics operations of small businesses. The first step proposed is to make a diagnosis from a basis of indicators of procurement, warehousing, transportation, distribution, customer service, reverse logistics, social responsibility and logistics costs. Further tools are designed for each of the above areas that improve internal logistics problems of companies. According to the diagnostic results, the company should decide which of these tools meet their needs to find an improvement. The first results of this implementation are disclosed hereby.

L19|The Antitrust Analysis of Multi-Sided Platform Businesses|This Chapter provides a survey of the economics literature on multi-sided platforms with particular focus on competition policy issues, including market definition, mergers, monopolization, and coordinated behavior. It provides a survey of the general industrial organization theory of multi-sided platforms and then considers various issues concerning the application of antitrust analysis to multi-sided platform businesses. It shows that it is not possible to know whether standard economic models, often relied on for antitrust analysis, apply to multi-sided platforms without explicitly considering the existence of multiple customer groups with interdependent demand. It summarizes many theoretical and empirical papers that demonstrate that a number of results for single-sided firms, which are the focus of much of the applied antitrust economics literature, do not apply directly to multi-sided platforms.
L19|Information Lost (Apologies to Milton)|Vast amounts of information result from business and consumer search, communication, and transactions. All this information can enhance market efficiency and consumer surplus as firms tailor products to buyers. But, there is increased risk of information loss. What issues should be on the Digital Agenda with regard to information loss, and what data are available to inform and generate incentives for consumer, business, and policy interactions in the information marketplace? This paper reviews the situation and points out where we need more thought and more data. Topics include: (1) Frameworks for analysis: How should we model the information marketplace, particularly with regard to the benefits and costs of information aggregation and protection? (2) Quantification and data: What is the evidence on the prevalence and nature of information loss, and what are the costs of information loss, and to whom? (3) Market and Policy Response: What do we know about the efficacy of market vs. other approaches to incentivize market participants to avoid loss or remediate after information loss? Throughout, of particular interest is the international dimension of the information marketplace. What issues arise when countries differ in their attitudes and policies toward the information marketplace?
L19|Optimal Patent Term and Cross-Industry Measures of Patent Term Sensitivity|Patents are monopolies granted to inventors in order to promote innovation, but they have a limited term because they also impose social costs. There is little empirical research on what constitutes an optimal patent term, or whether patent term should vary across industry categories. We take a first step in studying these issues by examining cross-industry differences in patent term sensitivity. We take advantage of a change in law - the passage of the TRIPS agreement in 1994 - that caused patent term to be measured from the date a patent application was filed rather than the date the patent was granted, thereby reducing patent term by the amount of time an application was pending before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Using a new dataset, we determine what portion of this delay is attributable to the applicant for 307,597 issued patents filed in 1994-1996. This shows, for the first time, how patent applicants in different industries sped up their prosecution behavior in response to the change in law, which gives us a measure of industry sensitivity to patent term change. We predict, via a formal model, that patent applicants in industries with higher profits toward the end of patent term are the applicants most likely to speed up patent prosecution after TRIPS. Our results show that pharmaceuticals patentees sped up patent prosecution significantly, which accords with prior theory on the primacy of patents in this industry. We find, however, that software patentees also significantly sped up prosecution, which is unexpected given prior theory suggesting patents are less important in spurring software development. Additionally, our paper exploits another, separate aspect of the legal change that gave some firms longer patent term extensions vis a vis others. We perform an event study and find that firms receiving longer extensions tended to have higher market returns. We obtain similar results using a new empirical technique known as regression kink design, which addresses potential selection issues. Finally, we test for and find a high degree of correlation between our two new measures of patent term sensitivity. This high correlation helps validate our formal model, suggesting that patentees in industries most likely to receive higher profits toward the end of patent term were the ones most sensitive to the change in patent term rules.
L19|Inter-Industry Strategic R&D and Supplier-Demander Relationships| This paper investigates if the R&D of an industry changes due to the R&D of an industry's suppliers and/or demanders. Using an annual industry-level panel of manufacturing R&D in the United States, I find that regressing the R&D of an industry on the lagged values of another industry's R&D suggests R&D comovement between industries with a strong supplier-demander relationship. Variance decompositions indicate that the R&D of an industry has high forecasting power over the R&D variance of another industry if the two industries share a strong supplier-demander relationship. © 2013 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

L19|Competition for a better future? Effects of competition on child care quality|Little is known about how competition affects child care centersâ€™ quality. This paper examines the impact of competition on the quality of Dutch child care centers. The results show that high density of child care centers in an area improves scores in quality assessment measures. The positive relationship persists when either the density of primary schools or births in the area are used to instrument the density of child care centers. The effects of competition are exclusive to child care centers that operate in a private market. Despite concerns about the parentsâ€™ ability to distinguish between low and high quality child care, market competition in the Dutch child care sector appears to improve quality.
L19|Cutting from the future? Impact of a subsidy reduction on child care quality in the Netherlands|High quality child care has been consistently linked with child development and future life outcomes. We examine how process quality in child care centers is influenced by the reduction of child care subsidies. The analysis is based on a 2012 reduction in subsidies for Dutch parents. Exploiting the different types of funding for child care centers in the Netherlands, we provide linear and non-linear difference-in-difference estimates of the effects subsidy cuts have on child care quality. The results show that the subsidy reduction had a negative effect on quality, and the effects are especially strong for higher quality centers.

L19|Analyse des stratégies de développement des assureurs dans la banque : une approche par la théorie des ressources|(VF)Les assureurs qui affirment ne pas vouloir se diversifier dans les métiers de la banque se raréfient ; la majorité des grands assureurs européens se sont lancés dans la banque, et de nouvelles expériences sont en train d’être menées. Ce travail est l’un des premiers à se focaliser sur la question de la diversification des assureurs en banque. Il propose, à travers une recherche réalisée au sein de quatre assureurs européens, d’étudier les différentes facettes de la stratégie de diversification vers les métiers de banque. L’objectif est de comprendre pourquoi les assureurs ne réussissent par leurs développements en banque, de la même façon que les banquiers ont réussi leur modèle de bancassurance. Les résultats obtenus ont permis d’identifier les sources actuelles de synergies entre les métiers des assureurs et celui de la banque, ainsi que les freins et blocages à l’exploitation réelle de ces sources de synergies.(VA)Many European insurers have been engaging during the last years in banking activities, following the same reasons as the banks when they entered the bancassurance market. No study, however, treated the business diversification in the specific case of insurer-banks. The effort of our study is based principally upon carrying out cases studies. We are trying to explain why insurers have not been performing as well as bankers in a banking/ insurance industry. We discuss sources of business relatedness in the financial services and sources of value creation associated with these types of relatedness. We focus on the actual links between insurer’s core business and banking activities, and will examine factors that have a significant impact on the success or failure of this strategy.
L19|Power marketer pricing behavior in the California Power Exchange|Various studies have examined whether market power abuses by independent electricity generators contributed to the demise of the California Power Exchange (PX). However, the behavior of wholesale power marketers has generally been overlooked. To fill this gap, our paper focuses on the pricing behavior of five major power marketers in the California PX during 2000: Duke Energy Trading & Marketing, Reliant Energy Services, Dynegy Power Marketing, Enron Power Marketing, and Williams Energy Marketing & Trading. Our unique data set, collected by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during an investigation of energy market pricing manipulation, allows us to assess the level of market power using the conduct parameter pricing model. The estimated conduct parameter allows us to determine power marketer pricing behavior is competitive, Cournot, or collusive. Our results indicate that Duke Energy and Reliant were exercising market power when pricing the wholesale electricity they sold in the California PX during 2000. No statistical evidence was uncovered to show that the smaller marketers – Dynegy, Williams and, Enron – were setting prices at a level higher than those consistent with a competitive market.
L19|Agent-based analysis of the impact of the imbalance pricing mechanism on market behavior in electricity balancing markets|The imbalance pricing mechanism is an important design variable within European-type electricity balancing markets that determines the incentives given to so-called Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) to balance their electricity production and consumption portfolio. To analyze the impact of alternative imbalance pricing mechanisms on balancing market performance, an agent-based model has been built, in which the BRPs are the agents that decide autonomously in each round on their balancing strategy based on results in past rounds. Six alternative mechanisms are analyzed. It is concluded that aiming for a small long position is generally the preferable BRP strategy. Different imbalance pricing mechanisms lead to comparable system imbalances, but single pricing results in the lowest imbalance costs for the BRPs and for the market as a whole.
L19|Corporate philanthropy: Insights from the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake in China|We explore the equity market impact of board announcements of corporate donations made in response to the May 12th 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China. Our event study uses a sample of board announcements of corporate donations from Chinese A-share listed companies. We find that donor companies providing products and/or services directly to end-consumers tend to enjoy higher abnormal stock returns, thereby documenting a link between corporate social responsibility and corporate financial performance at least for some corporate citizens. In light of the empirical results, the study suggests that corporate philanthropic involvement should be treated as a differentiated type of marketing tool to obtain social reputation and publicity, as well as a relationship cultivation mechanism with local government authorities.

L19|Rabbit meat consumption in Kenya|A survey was undertaken in 7 counties in Kenya covering a total of 300 rabbit farmers. Another 100 non rabbit keeping farmers was similarly interviewed for comparison purposes. Questions on the survey instrument sought to identify consumption patterns of rabbit meat among the sample farmers. Results were subjected to chi square test for association in an attempt to identify characteristics of respondents that might be pointers to rabbit meat consumption. Education, the number of rabbits kept—as well as whether the farmers actually kept rabbits were strong pointers towards making a particular farmer also a consumer of rabbit meat. Income (in this study, expenditure was used as a proxy for incomes) and the region of residence were marginally associated with rabbit meat consumption. Only 38 percent of non-rabbit farmers consumed rabbit meat compared to 82 percent for those who kept rabbits. The frequency of rabbit meat consumption was found to be very low, even for rabbit keepers with 46 percent of this group doing so at most, once every 12 months compared to 73 percent for non-rabbit farmers.
L19|Determinants of firm competitiveness: case of the Turkish textile and apparel industry|This article explores determinants of competitiveness in the booming Turkish textile and apparel industry. Using focus groups, nationwide survey data and explanatory factor analysis we identify 27 competitiveness items grouped into eight constructs. According to Turkish managers, the competitiveness of textile and apparel firm is heavily determined by the product differentiation, efforts across foreign markets, and availability of government’s incentive and support programs. In contrast to existing studies, we find little evidence that firm networking in different forms such as close relationship politicians and state employees, clustering, and participating in the industry associations have a large effect on firm competitiveness.

We adopt various econometric approaches. The results are then nested in a meta-analytic framework together with those of the past literature. Various kinds of limitations to capital mobility can hamper the tendential equalization of return rates. Focusing on those arising from different innovation capabilities across industries can pave the way to collaboration between evolutionary and radical political economics.

L19|"The Adoption/Adaptation Of The ""Supply Chain"" Concept In Romanian"|There are several terms used in Romanian for the English term supply chain. We have counted eleven. It has been adopted in several ways and it is perceived (adapted) in several ways in Romania. There are several causes which have determined this fact: the English terminology inconsistence regarding supply chain has been translated into other languages, professionals roots determine the usage (logistics professionals use it for logistics, strategic logistics use it in general etc.), the lack of Romanian discussions regarding the new professional terminology at general level and supply chain and logistics in particular. We expose the different ways by which supply chain is reflected in Romanian, we discuss the causes which have generated this total confusion and then we suggest a proper term for supply chain in Romanian, considering the real meaning of the term and the strategies adopted by other countries regarding supply chain adoption. In conclusion, we propose a general adoption and adaptation for the term in Romanian.
L19|From Controlled to Loose Co-Production: Benefits Distribution Between Firms and Consumers|Literature on innovation and recent marketing contributions stressed the involvement of consumers in the co-production of value, by emphasizing either the role of a single consumer or the community in such process. Few studies coupled the two interrelated dimensions and analyzed their impacts on customersÕ behavior and firm marketing strategies, specifically in terms of benefits achieved. The paper aims at filling this theoretical gap by distinguishing between individual and social co-production, where different levels of consumer engagement can be identified with diverse value sharing outcomes. We argue that not all customers are interested in being involved in the co-production concerning all their consumption activities. Depending on their commitment to participate (centrality of the consumption activity for the customer) and the co-production nature (individual vs. social) four alternative options of co-production emerge, with distinctive managerial features.

Therefore, achieving environmental compliance involves several interconnected factors that come into play during the execution of complex projects, which makes the strategic process of pollution control suitable for being approached by using tools, techniques and managerial frameworks which are specific to project management.
L19|Developing Ecologic Spin-Offs: Strategic Option for Achieving Performance in Energy Industries|The paper aims to emphasize the usefulness of applying an emergent concept in the economic literature (the ecologic spin-off) as main instrument for restructuring the national energy industry, under the circumstances of the increasing pressures provided both by the national and international environment, focused either upon the greenhouse gas emissions reduction or upon the active promotion of energy efficiency principles. The article highlights the fact that the mere existence of an energy market, assumed to operate similar to capital markets, where are supposed to be traded green certificates, may prove inefficient unless rigorous mechanisms for guiding the transition from the classic organization structure of the energy industry towards a new, modern and competitive organization model are being developed. In this context, the ecologic spinoffs may prove to be a main strategic option for ensuring the development of a competitive and efficient energy industry, very similar to the energy industries operating within most of the European Union member countries.
L19|The Effect of UI Regulation on the Electricity Market|We studied a scenario where two electricity generators compete with each other in the presence of forward market. We find that if generators are restricted to sell a fraction less than half of their total supply in the spot market, then the price of electricity falls and supply increases. Generators have to sell more in the forward market to sell electricity in the spot market; hence, they have less incentive to restrict the supply in the forward market to sell electricity at higher price in the spot market.
L19|Further econometric evidence on the gravitation and convergence of industrial rates of return on regulating capital| The hypotheses of sectoral return rates on regulating capital either gravitating around or converging toward a common value is tested on data for various OECD countries by adopting two panel varying coefficient approaches. The null hypotheses receive some empirical support, which turns out to be stronger once focusing on manufacturing industries only. The paper offers a meta-analytic framework to assess the results obtained in the present contribution as well as in the past literature. Finally, implications for economic policies and future theoretical and empirical research are discussed.

L19|Crisis Inversion Strategies – Theory or Reality in Romania of 2009?|The world crisis has begun showing its effects in Romania in October 2008. Still, the immaturity of Romanian authorities in the political and economic fields, as well as the enthusiasm of economic development led to an unconscious state of mind regarding the crisis. Therefore, Romanian companies have not started preparing for the crisis until they began feeling its effects. Also, a large number of Romanian managers are not familiar with crisis inversion strategies and accept crisis as an invincible necessity. Still, in other economies we can find examples of managers who fight for saving their companies and even try gaining competitive advantage based on the crisis. We have tried to find out if Romanian managers belong to the second type. ainly, the study focuses on strategies adopted by Romanian companies in order to counterbalance or, at least, ensure their survival during the world crisis.
L19|Analysis Of Audit Market And Audit Firms Activity In Lithuania|The paper presents an analysis of the Lithuanian audit market, its nature andconcentrations, audit services amounts and distribution, and audit firms activities and their incomebased on the results of empirical research. Lithuanian Chamber of Auditors (LCA) maintains thefunctions of accumulation, summarizing and dissemination information on Lithuanian auditors andaudit firms. LCA information is therefore, a rich source of data for researching and studying thedevelopment of the Lithuanian audit market. The summary of LCA membership lists was used toaddress the issue of the Lithuanian audit market concentration. Authors of the paper present thefollowing major attitudes: concentration due to the subject of audit activity, historical grow anddevelopment of audit firms, auditors and position held by auditors; regional concentration due tolegal forms of audit firms; concentration due to audit services, income from audit services as perlegal form of audit clients, time spent on audits, strategies used in audit firms. All these criteriapresent scheme of the audit market concentrations that provides us with information about how thestructures, legal forms and strategies of audit firm are changing and main reasons for this change.
L19|Coordination and Critical Mass in a Network Market: An Experimental Investigation|A network market is a market in which the benefit each consumer derives from a good is an increasing function of the number of consumers who own the same or similar goods. A major obstacle that plagues the introduction of a network good is the ability to reach critical mass, namely, the minimum number of buyers required to render purchase worthwhile. This can be likened to a coordination game with multiple Pareto-ranked equilibria. We introduce an experimental paradigm to study consumers' ability to coordinate on purchasing the network good. Our results highlight the central importance of the level of the critical mass.

L19|Efficient public-private partnerships|This paper presents a model to assess the efficiency of the capital structure in public-private partnerships (PPP). A main argument supporting the PPP approach to investment projects is the transfer of managerial skills and know-how from the private partner to the investment vehicle. The paper shows how different managerial skills and knowledge transfer schemes determine an optimal shareholding structure of the PPP. Under the assumption of lower capital cost of the public partner and lower development outlays when the investment is carried out by a private investor, an optimal capital structure is achieved with both the public and the private parties as shareholders, i.e. a mixed public-private capital structure makes it possible to internalize the financial advantage of the public sector and the managerial advantage of the private sector.
L19|China. Un enfoque estratégico cultural|After a brief historic, economic and cultural contextualization of China as a country of special interest for foreigner investors (Section 1) and a brief presentation of the importance of cultural factors in Business Management, especially in international and global companies (Section 2), the results of a new research will be presented. This research has been done using a panel of more than 50 experts and focuses in the key factors affecting international expansion of firms as well as in which markets represent a higher level of a priory difficulty when trying to approach them (Section 3). Later on, starting from the Multi-Agent model proposed by Giovanni M. Gavetti and Massimo Warglien, which is based in the neural networks Hopfield model, a generalization towards a Multi-Cultural model will be done. The introduction of the Cultural Intelligibility Coefficient (CIC) will be the key to get a wider set of conclusions from the mathematical model (Section 4). Nothing of this will be totally complete without a practical application. The justification of the importance of a proper cultural planning and management, and the maximization of the CIC as an effective way to get a sustainable competitive advantage will complete the goal of the article (Section 5).

L19|Does the debt tax shield distort ownership efficiency?|The tax laws of most developed countries are debt biased since firms can deduct interest on debt but not on equity. This bias is known to distort investment decisions. However, less is known about how the debt tax shield affects the ownership of assets when bidders differ financial expertise and thus in optimal use of leverage. We show that the debt tax shield need not always distort ownership efficiency. Assets end up with the socially preferred owner when differences in financial and productive expertise between bidders is small and better financial expertise reduces expected bankruptcy costs.
L19|Organizational Learning In The Mipymes, Aprendizaje Organizacional En Las Mipymes|This descriptive research analyzes the relationship between organizational learning and new levels of competence and innovation. The data analysis used the Hernfindahl concentration ratio, Ren Model and regression analysis. The study analyzes development degree and diversification of electronics industry Mipymes in Mexico. The results suggest that different markets are better for the companies involved. Competence and innovation have a strong relation with organizational learning. The study is limited to economic analysis in the electronics industry.
L19|Trade liberalization in vertically related markets|This paper looks into the desirability of trade liberalization for manufacturers, retailers and consumers. The analysis compares the move from the autarky situation to either one of free trade that entails a change in the distribution system or not. We also examine whether the interests of manufacturers and retailers about the preferred distribution system coincide, provided trade opens. We find that market integration is beneficial to all agents only under certain conditions on the degree of market asymmetry and the degree of product differentiation. Interestingly, if integration entails a change in the distribution system, the conflict between manufacturers and retailers strengthens since only retailers prefer free trade when markets are not too asymmetric and when interbrand competition is sufficiently strong. Furthermore, consumers can be harmed by trade and, in a setting without exclusivities, one country may experience a welfare decrease. Finally, the analysis of the strategic choice concerning exclusivity clauses uncovers that retailers and manufacturers never agree about their preference for endogenous distribution systems.

L19|Leadership in Opposition to Facilitating Change for the Romanian Organizations|One of the most important roles of the Organizational Change expert is based upon his or her expertise in the process of change itself. The Organizational Change expert must be able to coach and educate senior managers in how the process of change takes place in Romanian organizations. Change is a process that follows a relatively predictable pattern. Unfortunately, many managers have never been educated about the change process. It should come as no surprise that leading change without knowledge of the change process itself typically leads to failure of the change effort. This lack of senior management understanding of the change process itself creates one of the most important roles for the Organizational Change’s expert — Change Process Advisor/Educator. The Organizational Change expert should be prepared to advise/educate senior managers on how to effectively lead change. Management change is not the regulation of the Organizational Change expert. Management change is the responsibility of the company's senior management. The Organizational Change expert should serve senior managers as an advisor/educator and coach.
L19|Dynamic Model for Evaluation the Economical-Ecological Equilibrium for an Investment Project|Evolving of models for realizing an economical-ecological balance for accepting or rejecting investment projects should be increasingly from practical viewpoint, implying a more elaborate theoretical approach and scientific fundamented. Even if we have pertain to an economical approach and aim a level of updated real net income fairly high for each accepted project, the model also includes ecological component monetary tackled, but fundamented from welfare viewpoint. Proposed model proves practical utility and has the ability to generate individual and social welfare.
L19|Necessity Or Challenge - Information Security For Small And Medium Enterprises|Due to the inadequate mamagement of information security expectations and various unexpected information technology incidents, small and medium enterprises that lose data or have to cope with a lack of data over a certain period of time may lose business commissions or customers. A solution to this problem may be the regulated administration of information security, which may lower the amount of risks. Enterprises in this sector generally have not enough human, material and information technology resources to perform tasks of this sort. The controversy seems to be an irresoluble one; the authors attempt to provide help to initiate a solution to the issue that remains above the ‘still acceptable’ level. The paper surveys several professional sources as well as standards, recommendations, and methodologies applicable in the field. The authors of this paper consciously strive to differentiate between information technology security and information security.
L19|Determinants of Banking Competitiveness at the Level of Resources, Skills and Abilities: An Empirical Study|Considering the deep transformations that the banking sector has been experiencing in recent years at a competitive level, this research focuses on identifying the determinants of competitiveness and the variables affecting the same, regarding the level of resources, capabilities and competencies of the local branches. This study focuses in particular on the analysis of the determinants of competitiveness of a specific type of company (agency) in a particular sector (Commercial banking). The research studied all the 40 bank branches of the financial institution Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD) located in the districts of Castelo Branco and Guarda (Portugal). Given the results of the study, it was possible to assess the perception of internal employees in relation to the critical determinants of competitiveness. It was further observed that the competitiveness of banks differs according to the evaluation of performance, with the planning of activities of human resources with the system of incentives and with the motivation of their managers. As to possible differences in perception between the various commercial managements involved, there were no significant differences on the factors of competitiveness.
L19|Competition, Efficiency And Stability In Albanian Banking System|Competition policy in the banking sector is complicated by the necessity of maintaining financial stability. Greater competition may be good for (static) efficiency, but bad for financial stability. The issues regarding banking competition and its effects are of particular interest in transition countries, as bank credit there is by far the largest source of external finance for companies. This paper investigates the interrelationships among bank competition, efficiency and stability in Albania banking system and it compare with other transition countries. Initially had an increase in banking competition where the level of efficiency also has been growing and stability indicators have been generally good, but further intensifying competition has been associated with increased fragility of the banking system and reduced the level of efficiency. In the case of Albania the margin net interest as an efficiency indicator reacts negatively against the increase of non-performing loans degree. So, their levels and dynamics should be constantly supervised by policy-makers, assessing their implications and preparing the necessary measures.
L19|On the gravitation and convergence of industry profit rates in Denmark, Finland, Italy and the US|The hypotheses of profit rates gravitating around or converging towards a common value is tested using Danish, Finnish, Italian and US data. Both hypotheses are rejected for all the countries considered. This is interpreted as the result of limitations to capital mobility and of persistent differentials in the innovative performance of industries.
L19|On the gravitation and convergence of industry incremental rates of return in OECD countries|The hypotheses of sectoral incremental rates of returns gravitating around or converging towards a common value are tested on data for various OECD countries relying on an econometric method able to account for residual autocorrelation and cross-sector correlation. Our null hypotheses receive only a mixed empirical support. This is interpreted as the result of limitations to capital mobility and of persistent differentials in the innovative performance of industries.

L19|Competitive advantage and the new higher education regime|"The new university model leads against the right to education and teaching freedom. It is not a matter of theoretical working model, based upon technical argumentations, but an ideological model, leading for upper social classes' interests (great investors' ones). University business not being profitable to those interests must be destroyed. In order to do that, we successfully got divided and tend to believe that teaching method is the problem. But, this is just a decoy; the real problem is all public service destruction, when it is aimed to favor popular classes. In an unperceived way, we contribute to this destruction, by blaming ones the others to be ""converging"" or ""withdrawn"", depending on the case."
L19|Il porto moderno: confronto tra Genova e Rotterdam tra possibilità di sviluppo e vincoli fisici|The port system is today one of the main pillars of transportations and trade. Italy is located at the centre of the Mediterranean See and of Europe, therefore the development of modern and competitive ports is of great importance for the country. The harbour of Genoa is a natural candidate to become one of the most important ports in the world. This positioning would constitute a factor of competitiveness and development for both the city of Genoa and the country as a whole. This paper analyzes first the determinants of success of a modern port and offers a comparison between the Ligurian port and that of Rotterdam. This comparison highlights the strengths and weaknesses of Genoa’s harbour with respect to Rotterdam’s. By means of a simulation, this paper shows the possible consequences of an enlargement of the Ligurian port.

L19|Externalidades de red y su influencia en lapercepción de mercado|Hoy en día los negocios están experimentando una nueva dinámica de expansión acompañada de una estrategia que conlleva un mayor posicionamiento ya sea de concepto, marca, producto o una combinación de éstos. Por medio de un modelo de localización y el uso de un juego en dos etapas, medimos ante diversos escenarios de competencia las externalidades generadas por los efectos de la presencia de una red de sucursales o puntos de venta, tanto para los consumidores como para las empresas, partiendo del hecho de que ambos buscan maximizar sus respectivas utilidades. Los resultados del modelo revelan que la cobertura del mercado sí tiene un efecto en variables como calidad percibida del producto, precio, y al mismo tiempo estas situaciones afectan el nivel de competencia ante la presencia de empresas rivales. / Nowadays, businesses have experienced a new dynamic of expansion together with the need of a positioning strategy that has to do with either the concept, the brand, the product or a combination of them. By using a location model and a two stage game we measure in several different competition scenarios the externalities generated by the effects of the presence of a network of branches or selling points, for both the consumers and the firms, taking into account that both look for the maximization of their utilities and profits respectively. The results from the model show that market coverage has an effect over variables such as perceived quality, price, utility and profits. And at the same time these situations affect the level of competition under the presence of rival firms.
L19|China and India - a Note on the Influence of Hierarchy vs. Polyarchy on Economic Growth|"This note tries to apply two versions of Sah and Stiglitz's ""The Architecture of Economic Systems: Hierarchies and Polyarchies"" model (SandS) to highlight some important differences between the development paths of India, the largest democracy, and China, the largest of the few remaining communist ruled economies. It argues that the original SandS model is applicable to private organisations but not to governments, to which a revised model is applied. It is the reliability of the government's decisions and the ability of the investor to rely on them that the modified SandS model tries to capture. As a communist country, China is as centralized as a huge polity of its size can be. A decision of the central authorities, a contract or promise confirmed by Beijing, can be relied upon. This provides a degree of security to the investor that his contract will be honoured and she will not be dispossessed. In the Indian federation the investor has to assure herself that all authorities involved agree to support her project, because any agency that has any say may be able to derail it. These differences are accounted for by the adjusted Sah and Stiglitz model. These differences affect not only the total quantity of investments but also their composition. Clearly, no claim is made or implied that the models introduced below provide the explanation for the differences in the development paths of these two Asian giants in the past few decades. They merely add a new perspective to the economic systems dimension of the development process."
L19|Naehe zum Kerngeschaeft als Kriterium fuer Portfolioentscheidungen|Das Portfoliomanagement gehoert zu den zentralen Aufgaben des Strategischen Managements von Unternehmen. Zur Unterstuetzung von Portfolioentscheidungen wurden zahlreiche Konzepte entwickelt, die sich allgemein in strategisch-marktorientierte und wertorientierte Ansaetze unterscheiden lassen. Diese Ansaetze haben gemein, dass die Portfolioaktivitaeten eines Unternehmens nur fuer sich alleine bewertet werden – die Beziehungen zwischen den Aktivitaeten bleiben jedoch weitestgehend unberuecksichtigt. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird mit Hilfe des Konstrukts Naehe zum Kerngeschaeft ein zusaetzliches Kriterium fuer Portfolioentscheidungen geschaffen werden. Dabei werden drei Teilziele verfolgt: die Explikation des Begriffs Naehe zum Kerngeschaeft im Kontext von Portfolioentscheidungen, die Entwicklung einer Methode zur Messung der Naehe zum Kerngeschaeft und die Erprobung dieser Methode an einem Anwendungsbeispiel. Im Kern wird eine Methode entwickelt mit deren Hilfe die Ressourcen basierten Beziehungen zwischen den Geschaeftsfeldern gemessen werden koennen. In ihrem Mittelpunkt steht das zentrale Konzept, welches die Berechnung eines aggregierten Naehemasses ueber fuenf Ressourcendimensionen ermoeglicht. Entlang dieser Ressourcendimensionen werden die Beziehungen zwischen Geschaeftsfeldern ueber Stellvertretermerkmale ermittelt. Im Ergebnis zeigt sich, dass die Ergebnisse der Naehemessung im Rahmen von Portfolioentscheidungen als Kriterium anwendbar sind.
L19|The importance of the strategic management process in the knowledge-based economy|In the modern economy, competitiveness means information and know-how rather than capital and physical assets. Therefore, the key process for any competitive organization is to strategically use their information resources and knowledge assets by remembering and applying experience. An organization’s ability to compete on the market is increasingly seen as depending on the skills and knowledge of its managers and employees, regarded as intelectual capital, and put to good use while formulating, implementing and adjusting strategies. In the current business environment, knowledge evolves rapidly and the useful life span of the organizational skills is decreasing, which means the survival and competitiveness of an organization is linked to its ability to learn and include its findings in their strategic management process.

Since Cascio’s (1993) article “Downsizing: What do we know? What have we learned?”, the research has burgeoned across several countries. This paper examines what we have learned during the many years of scholarly enquiry. As such, the article is based upon an analysis of the downsizing literature and represents a summation of secondary sources. The research also provides an update on the latest downsizing developments.
L19|The Implications Of The Business Ethics’ Aspects As Constitutive Part|The reflection capacity of values in the taking decisions process, to govern the way that these values and decisions affect the various groups of partners and to establish the way that the managers can use these observations in the company’s daily conditions, represents the named business ethics. The absence of an ethical behaviour in business goes to corruption, falsifies the legal boosts, undermines the institutions legitimacy, leads to the reduction of the foreign investments and assistance from abroad and, not the least, disheartens the consumers with negative causes to the entrepreneurial culture and the business environment. The importance of observing and implementing ethical principles makes possible the elaboration of plans and anticipations for long term concerning not only the company’s activity result but also with the expand of the foreign environment’s relations. The relation between the ethics and the market economy hinge on the political structure, the territorial administration, the structure and objectives of the organizations, culture and legality of affaires. The ethical principles and the implementation of a demeanour code represent constitutive part in elaboration of a strategy at the organization level. The ethical code is a formal statement which constitutes a guide for taking decisions and for the actions from an organization. The demeanour code efficiency is being illustrated when it’s closely connected to the specific features of the competitive environment, efficiency devolved from decreasing situations of conflicts of interest, reduction corruption, fraud, clients’ and purveyors’ suspicion. The present paper proposes to approach the aspects that aim at the implementation or adhesion to ethical principles and values as part of the organization integrated at the strategy level, as well as the benefits that can be obtained by the enterprise from this perspective.

Despite knowledge spillovers, the leading innovator sometimes discloses to signal commitment to the project, and so potentially inducing a rival's exit. Surprisingly, when development costs are low the leading innovator does not need to disclose to induce the same strategic deterrence effect as that which arises from disclosure.

Dix ans de recherche en contrôle|(VF)Que s’est-il publié depuis dix ans en contrôle de gestion en France et qu’avons-nous appris de ces recherches? Ce sont les questions auxquelles cet article cherche à répondre en examinant la production scientifique publiée dans les revues Finance Contrôle Stratégie et Comptabilité Contrôle Audit. La prévalence ou l’absence de certains thèmes, la montée et la baisse des différentes problématiques sont systématiquement analysées et les conclusions des différents articles publiés sont succinctement présentées. Cette production scientifique est brièvement mise en relation avec la production anglo-saxonne et un retour historique sur le bilan fait à l’occasion des vingt ans de l’AFC est proposé en conclusion.(VA)What has been published in management control and management accounting in France for the last ten years and what have we learned from it? In this paper we try to answer these questions by examining the scientific production published in the two major French academic journals of the field: Finance Contrôle Stratégie and Comptabilité Contrôle Audit. The relative importance or lack of some themes as well as their increase, decrease or resurgence are systematically analyzed. The French scientific production is briefly compared to the one featuring in overseas journals, and a comparison of our conclusions with those of the 1999 twentieth anniversary issue of the AFC is then drawn.
L19|Méthodes de recherche en contrôle de gestion:une approche critique|(VF)Dans la recherche en contrôle de gestion, le débat méthodologique s’organise souvent autour d’alternatives binaires peu pertinentes. Dans leur majorité, les travaux s’appuient sur une épistémologie réaliste de l’observation sans biais. Les deux dimensions clés du débat méthodologique sont (1) la référence épistémologique retenue (épistémologie de la vérité et de l’observation versus épistémologie de la signification et de l’enquête collective), (2) la définition de l’objet de recherche (formes du contrôle ou pratiques organisationnelles). Une approche en termes d’enquête dialogique, qui exige d’importants efforts d’accès aux pratiques et d’échanges dialogiques au sein des communautés adéquates, est la clé d’une recherche développementale ouverte sur la société.(VA)In management control research, methodological discussions are often based on binary alternatives of little relevance. Most of the research work refers to the realist epistemology of unbiased observation. The methodological discussion has two key dimensions: (1) what epistemic framework is selected (epistemology of truth and observation, versus epistemology of meaning and collective inquiry), (2) what is the object under research (forms of control or organizational practices). A dialogical inquiry approach would require substantial efforts to access practices and to develop dialogical exchanges within the adequate communities. But it would also allow for some developmental research, open to social is-sues.
L19|Quelles perspectives pour la recherche en contrôle de gestion?|(VF)Cet article montre en quoi le contrôle de gestion est une construction complexe qui intègre son propre processus d’équilibration. Le modèle classique sert de base à toutes les constructions d’aujourd’hui, malgré les risques qu’il comprend. L’importance future de l’immatériel suggère des pistes nouvelles:prise en compte des liens avec les parties prenantes comme base à la création de valeur et intégration d’une nouvelle diversité des ressources rares, au-delà des ressources financières.(VA)This article shows why management control systems are complex devices where tools and processes interact in an equilibrating manner. The classical model is now widely implemented, in spite of the risks included. But the specific stakes raised by intangible assets suggest new tracks for future research:the challenge will be to analyze management control systems accounting for stakeholder relationships as a basis for value creation and for important non-financial resources of a new kind.
L19|50 ans de recherche en stratégie:normalisation ou pluralisme épistémologique ?|(VF)L’objet de ce travail consiste à interroger, d’un point de vue épistémologique et méthodologique, la constitution et l’état actuel du management stratégique. La mise en perspective historique de ces 50 années de recherche fait apparaître des projets de connaissance différents avant que ne s’affirme un projet es-sentiellement explicatif. Celui-ci peine à prendre pleinement en considération les grandes transformations intervenues ces quinze dernières années. Le rapprochement de la recherche et de l’action invite à une ouverture épistémologique.(VA)This paper is the result of a reflexive inquiry into the constitution and the state of the art of strategic management research. The genesis of the field is characterized by different epistemological stages; the « normal science » paradigm which has been well established over these last 15 years is currently challenged by the great transformations of financial capitalism and by the dynamics of globalization. The quest for actionable knowledge suggests the need of different epistemological approaches.
L19|Refaire de la stratégie?|(VF)La recherche en stratégie, dont la vitalité, l’éclectisme des référentiels théoriques et la variété des questions traitées sont manifestes, a contribué à faire du management stratégique un champ académique bien institutionnalisé et reconnu.Le caractère foisonnant de ce champ peut être considéré comme une richesse et un signe d’ouverture. Mais cela ne va pas sans certaines dérives académiques et sans une forte dépendance vis-à-vis d’autres disciplines, qui jouent au détriment d’une image claire et de la formulation d’un projet fondamental.Pour nous, ce projet doit s’attacher aux fondements et aux modalités de construction et de déploiement de l’action collective que les choix stratégiques et organisationnels des entreprises (et, plus largement, des organisations) expriment, et aux enjeux essentiels, économiques, sociaux et sociétaux, qui leur sont associés.S’inscrire dans cette perspective, c’est en un sens revenir aux questions fondamentales de la stratégie.(VA)Strategy research features its vitality, the variety of its theoretical foundations, and the diversity of the questions studied. It has largely contributed to make strategic management a well institutionalized and recognized academic discipline.The abounding nature of this field can be considered as a wealth and a mark of openness. But it frequently comes at the expense of academic drift, strong dependence on other disciplines, and a lack of a clear image and some formulation of a fundamental project.Such a project should consider the foundations and the modalities of the construction and deployment of collective action which are expressed by the strategic and organizational choices of firms (and organizations in general). It should also account for the essential economic, social and societal stakes which are associated with them.To join this perspective, is, in a sense, a return to the fundamental questions of strategy.
L19|Une revue, des règles, un rôle dans le champ du management stratégique|(VF)Après avoir présenté la définition à partir de laquelle peut être appréciée la contribution de FCS au management stratégique, cet article se structure autour de deux préoccupations qui ont trait à la dynamique de production des connaissances dans le champ. La première s’inscrit dans le plan défini par les dimensions empirique et analytique. Elle concerne le risque que l’obsession de la nouveauté théorique fait courir au processus de connaissance. La seconde préoccupation touche au contenu thématique de la recherche en management stratégique. Constitué de couples, comme celui que forment organisation et stratégie, cet axe thématique, que l’on peut concevoir comme orthogonal aux dimensions empirique et analytique est le lieu où s’invente le management stratégique, où des oppositions se nouent et où se pose la question de leur éventuel dépassement.(VA)After having presented the definition of strategic management from which the contribution of FCS can be recognized, the article moves on to examine two issues closely related to the dynamics of knowledge production in this domain. The first issue is found within the space defined by the empirical and analytical dimensions and concerns the risks for the knowledge process brought about by an obsession with theoretical novelty. The second issue concerns the thematic content of strategic management research. This content can be viewed as structured along various dimensions, each of them being composed of a thematic couple, such as the one that associates organization and strategy. This thematic space, which can be thought of as orthogonal to the space defined by empirical and analytical dimensions, is where strategic management is invented, where oppositions emerge, and where the question of their synthesis can be raised.
L19|À la recherche du lien perdu entre caractéristiques des dirigeants et performance de la firme : gouvernance et latitude managériale|Upper Echelons Theory and financial governance theory both postulate that CEOs have a determining influence on the performance with, however, a very significant difference concerning the influence of managerial discretion. For the first one, managerial discretion has a potentially positive influence on performance by enabling the managers' cognitive capacities to affect it, for the second one, a negative influence, insofar as it can lead to decisions conflicting with shareholders' interests. The objective of this article is, on the one hand, to compare the contents and the role of the managerial discretion concept within these two theoretical frameworks, on the other hand, to propose, in the light of the cognitive and behavioral developments of corporate governance theory, a meta model based on an integrative approach of managerial discretion in order to offer a better understanding of the link between CEOs characteristics, corporate governance systems and performance.
L19|À la recherche du lien perdu entre caractéristiques des dirigeants et performance de la firme : gouvernance et latitude managériale|(VF)La théorie des échelons supérieurs de Hambrick et Mason et la théorie de la gouvernance financière postulent toutes deux que les dirigeants ont une influence déterminante sur la performance avec, cependant, une différence très importante concernant l’influence de la latitude managériale. Pour la première, la latitude managériale a une influence potentiellement positive sur la performance en permettant aux capacités cognitives des dirigeants de s’exprimer, pour la seconde, une influence négative, dans la mesure où elle peut conduire à des décisions contraires aux intérêts des actionnaires. L’objectif de cet article est, d’une part, de comparer le contenu et le rôle de la notion de latitude managériale dans ces deux cadres théoriques, d’autre part, de proposer à la lumière des développements cognitifs et comportementaux de la théorie de la gouvernance, un méta modèle qui permettrait de proposer une approche intégratrice de la latitude à même d’offrir une meilleure compréhension du lien entre caractéristiques du dirigeant, système de gouvernance et performance de la firme.

L19|The Impact of Firm’s R&D Strategy on Profit and Productivity|This paper investigates how a firm’s R&D strategy influences the firm performance as measured by productivity and profitability. A formal production model is introduced to define and interpret alternative ways of measuring the impact of R&D. Studying 1,767 randomly selected firms from the Swedish manufacturing sector, the main findings are: (i) firms which apply persistent R&D perform better than firms with occasional as well as no R&D, (ii) occasional R&D is associated with lower performance than no R&D, and (iii) in quantile regressions the positive effect from R&D persistency is lacking for low productivity firms (lowest quartile) indicating a non-linear response. Moreover, the analysis recognises the different roles of ordinary and knowledge labour in production when specifying alternative performance measures and when identifying knowledge labour as a firm’s R&D capacity, which has a highly significant impact on firm performance. Introducing a formal production model in order to define and interpret alternative ways of measuring the impact of R&D, we apply simple ordinary OLS and quantile regressions on the economic model for analyzing the importance for a particular R&D strategy on firms’ productivity and profitability. To the best of our knowledge, we believe that the main findings of the analysis make contributions to the R&D literature.
L19|Is Functional Separation BT-Style the Answer?|This paper focuses on functional separation. After recounting the circumstances that culminated in the imposition of functional separation within the UK, the paper highlights the difficulties that have been encountered subsequent to the creation of Openreach. Functional separation developments outside the UK are then described and doubts raised as to whether the Openreach model is appropriate for other markets.
L19|Judicial Risk and Credit Market Performance: Micro Evidence from Brazilian Payroll Loans|A large body of literature has stressed the institution-development nexus as critical in explaining differences in countries%u2019 economic performance. The empirical evidence, however, has been mainly at the aggregate level, associating macro performance with measures of quality of institutions. This paper, by relating a judicial decision on the legality of payroll loans in Brazil to bank-level decision variables, provides micro evidence on how creditor legal protection affects market performance. Payroll loans are personal loans with principal and interests payments directly deducted from the borrowers%u2019 payroll check, which, in practice, makes a collateral out of future income. In June 2004, a high-level federal court upheld a regional court ruling that had declared payroll deduction illegal. Using personal loans without payroll deduction as a control group, we assess whether the ruling had an impact on market performance. Evidence indicates that it had an adverse impact on risk perception, interest rates, and amount lent.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L19|Issues of standardization concerning organizational culture in change management|This paper is a challenge in taking another view on cultural elements, considered to be more specific then any other strategic issues of management. The paper is structured into the following parts: cultural dimensions and variables; barriers to the organizational culture change and organizational culture change and its adaptation to world values. Conclusions lead to the possibilities of standardizing some related to organizational culture issues, such as: communication, relations and organization’s flexibility, which may be considered as organizational culture elements that are to be standardized.
L19|The industrial districts in the third millennium: old gives way to new in many unexpected ways|What is the future of the industrial districts? Various researches show that the Italian industrial districts are rapidly changing. But they are not about to disappear: on the contrary, they are evolving towards more complex networked and multi-localized forms of organization. A recent book, edited by Fabrizio Guelpa and Stefano Micelli, depicts the main features and stages in this transformation, which is crucial for the future competitiveness of Italian economy, as a whole, and for the expected productivity growth of its different regional systems. On this basis, the articles seeks to trace out the districts’ evolutionary paths in a long-period perspective. The idea proposed is that local production chains will become immaterial multi-localized networks, growing around some key-ideas (quality of life, full service flexibility, cultural models, emotional experience) and some sense-making processes of value production.
L19|Idealization, abstraction, and the policy relevance of economic theories| In theories that idealize the object of study, falsity is inserted somehow. However, the actual propositions by which the idealization takes place need not be false at all. An example from physics illustrates that the Ideal Gas Law and Boyle's Law are respective idealizations of the van der Waals Law. The idealizational procedures involved in reasoning from the latter to the former can be repeated at a higher level of abstraction than that of the laws as we know these from physics textbooks. Thus, idealization and abstraction can be seen as relatively independent methods of reasoning, the one to be carried out with or without the other at the same time. This underlines Uskali Maki's taxonomy, which shows that horizontal isolations in economic reasoning form a procedure completely different from vertical isolations. In contrast, however, to his taxonomy, I propose to define idealization as horizontal isolation. The lessons for the policy relevance of science - and of economics in particular - are that the use of ideal models does not necessarily imply a total lack of their external validity. Further, I show that abstraction in theorizing, under certain conditions, may increase the policy relevance of theories, rather than that it is decreased. Abstract theories tend to count the actual social world - where policymakers try to intervene - among their models more easily than concrete theories. Finally, this paper also deals with one very problematic aspect of the common use of clauses in order to hedge economics hypotheses. Many idealizational clauses have a propensity for imprecise reference, due to which it is impossible to judge the external validity of economic models. I shall indicate how this problem relates to issues of interdisciplinarity in social science.
L19|Content Analysis of Strategic Issue Research 1980-2006|Building on the achievements of the previous research on strategic issue management practices, this paper provides a systematization of the main body of strategic issue management research into three main research streams. These include research on individual issue perception, intra-organizational actions in the strategic issue management context, and organizational responses to strategic issues. Our paper also provides a detailed analysis of linkages between perception research and research on organizational responses to strategic issues. Based on this analysis, we find that direct linkages can be drawn between the two research areas due to the commonly accepted categorization of strategic issues as opportunities and threats. As a synthesis of our review, we put forward a conceptual model of the linkages between the research on issue perception and organizational responses.
L19|Beyond the emission market: Kyoto and the international expansion of waste management firms|This paper analyses the participation of firms without GHG emission liabilities as technology providers in CDM and JI projects, the flexibility mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol. It argues that the motivations for those firms to engaging in CDM and JI projects is based on market stimuli beyond those related to the emission market itself. Instead, their motivations are largely associated with search for new markets where their technological resources and expertise can be exploited. The analysis is based on three firms from the Dutch waste management industry. These cases suggest that the Kyoto's mechanisms compensate to some extent the weakness of the underdeveloped waste management sector in developing and transition economies.
L19|Is Wal-Mart Good for Competition? Evidence from Milk Prices|This article examines the impact of Wal-Mart Supercenters’ entry on incumbents’ pricing behavior and demand. Using a structural model and milk data from the Dallas/Fort Worth supermarket chains, empirical results show that an expansion of Supercenters caused incumbents to price milk significantly more competitively, dropping on average 22.5% between 1996 and 2002, in spite of declines in their milk demand. Furthermore, consumer gains exceeded incumbent losses, lending further support to the notion that Wal-Mart is good for competition and consumers.
L19|"Die Rolle der ""Fertigungstiefe"" als Variable in der Gegenstromplanung von Strategien"|Der vorliegende Beitrag zeigt, dass die Festlegung der Fertigungstiefe in der Gegenstromplanung von Strategien kein stringentes Instrument der Unternehmensführung ist. Die Top-Down und Bottom-Up Analyse über die hierarchischen Ebenen der Unternehmens-, Wettbewerbs- und Funktionalstrategie liefert dazu die Begründung: die Fertigungstiefe ist je nach vertikaler Koordinationsrichtung und Strategieebene endogene oder exogene Variable, d.h. sie ändert fallweise ihren Charakter als Ist-, Soll- und Reflexionsgröße; zusätzlich wird sie aufgrund ihrer unspezifischen Wirkung auf Wettbewerbsstrategien der vertikalen Koordinationsfunktion der Strategieplanung nicht gerecht.
L19|ASPECTS REGARDING SMEs’ STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT| The main objective of the present research is to formulate a set of pertinent recommendations regarding the efficient adjustment of the principles and instruments of strategic management to the particularities of the SMEs. Thus, the authors intend to clarify the aspects referring to matters such as: the manner of defining the organizational vision and objectives; the drawing up of the strategic options regarding the needed resources (financial, material, human); the understanding of the clients and also of the market extension; the evaluating of the performances, etc. Another field of interest that is also going to be discussed refers to aspects related to the implementation of the strategic plan and to its control. The authors’ suggestions are described through practical or hypothetical examples that are meant to illustrate the manner how these proposals may be implemented most efficiently in the practice of the SMEs.
L19|Bargaining and Fixed Price Offers: How Online Intermediaries are Changing New Car Transactions|This paper develops a model of oligopolistic price competition to analyze the impact of online intermediaries such as Autobytel.com on the price setting process in the automobile market. The roles of dealer search costs, the fraction of buyers using the intermediary, the value of the item being sold, and heterogeneity in buyer bargaining abilities are explored. The model provides theoretical insights relevant to the empirical literature addressing the role that intermediaries like Autobytel play in online markets. For example, we present conditions under which the price offered through the intermediary is either higher or lower than offline (bargained) prices.
L19|Sistema de información según el modelo EFQM. Aplicación a la ayuda a la toma de decisiones en las cajas rurales de la Comunidad Valenciana|This paper analyses the dimensions of the adapted EFQM model applied to Agricultural Credit Banks in the Valencia Region in order to study their behaviour, the relationship between these dimensions, and the relationship with results such as progress in trade and business results. It has been found that personnel and information management have a significant influence. There are also groups of institutions that stand out in terms of factors such as information management and the quality of business management. The research was based on a survey carried out over the Internet and was used to create a decision-making assistance system to help Institutions perform a self-diagnosis and benchmarking for the factors contained in the model.
L19|Las singularidades del capital humano de las cooperativas como elementos caracterizadores de su capital intelectual|Over the last decade, business literature has identified knowledge management as one of the key tools in managing a modern company. In this regard, it is possible to identify, measure and manage the critical intangibles in a company by means of intellectual capital statements that can provide the management with important information on where value lies and its evolution over time. Being a special type of companies, the human capital of cooperatives has its own particular characteristics. Therefore, because of their intrinsic values, the way their capital is structured, their recruitment policies, etc. their specific nature is worthy of study. By identifying the features of the human capital in a cooperative it is possible to better define its business strategy, based on the critical resources and capabilities in its area of business. By carrying out a case study of a credit cooperative this article therefore attempts to identify and reach conclusions regarding the competitive advantages of cooperatives in terms of the most import resource of any business: people.
L19|La rhétorique de la stratégie : comment le dirigeant crée-t-il un ordre pour l’action ?|(VF)La communication de la stratégie occupe une place centrale dans la pratique des dirigeants. Les recherches récentes sur les discours stratégiques suggèrent que cette pratique peut contribuer à la création d’un ordre pour l’action. Cependant, ces travaux étudient peu la façon dont les dirigeants procèdent concrètement. Pour étudier cette pratique, l’article propose une analyse par la rhétorique afin de comprendre les ressorts de l’argumentation et leurs effets dans différents contextes de prise de parole. L’article analyse le cas de la communication du dirigeant du Groupe Lafarge vers les parties prenantes stratégiques auxquelles il s’adresse (cadres, administrateurs, investisseurs). Les résultats précisent le rôle de la rhétorique de la stratégie dans la création d’un ordre et apportent un éclairage original au courant de la stratégie comme pratique.(VA)Strategy communication is a central part of CEOs’ strategic activities. Recent research on strategic discourse suggests that this practice can lead to the creation of an order for action. However, former work does not study how managers concretely proceed. To study this practice, we propose to adopt a rhetoric perspective to understand the argumentation mechanisms and their effects in different speech contexts. Our research analyzes the case of the CEO of the Lafarge Group and how he talks to different stakeholders (senior managers, members of the board, investors). Our results contribute to better understand the role of strategy rhetoric in the enactment of a strategic order, and bring original insights to the “strategy as practice” research stream.

L19|The Analysis Of Five Competitive Forces Of Non-Alcoholic Beverage Industry And E-Commerce Industry Cases At The Global Level|This paper has as objective to do an analysis of five competitive forces of non-alcoholic industry and e-commerce industry at the global level. The state of five competitive forces in both industries will depend always of evolution of these industries and government policies of the different countries of the world. For example if these industries are growing and if the govern permit others companies can enter into industry and can help to promote the competition in these industries, that is good for buyers, because they can choose where want to purchase something and what products or goods are according to their necessities or that permits to maximize their utility and it is according to their money amount available for it.
L19|Floss (Free/Libre Open Source Software): A Theme For Cultural Differences Study|Geert Hofstede presented statistical evidence purporting to identify intercultural co-operation and its importance for survival in his scholarship work “cultures and organizations”. This article presents a study, which describes how differences in national culture can affect or influence the participation of programmers who produce open source software (OSS). The four important dimensions of national cultures considered by Hofstede model namely Power Distance Index (PDI), Individualism Index (IAV), Masculinity-Feminity Index (MAS) and Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI) are selected and correlated with the Geographical Distribution of Developers Index (GDD) for testing the above hypothesis. It is suggested that there exists some correlation between the cultural factors and the demographics of programmers who participate in the open source movement. Finally, the manner in which these cultural factors impinge on the incentives of the programmers who are engaged in open source movement by writing codes for free are also discussed.
L19|Evolution of the investment versus evolution of the provincial ports selectionve|The improvements introduced in the transportation sector have propitiated that a merchandise flow can be transported efficiently from different ports and, consequently, they have come accompanied by an increase of the infrastructure investment. However, the port selection carried out from the Spanish provinces to channel their flows of containers remains stable, what suggests that it has not responded to the competitive strategies developed by the managers of the biggest peninsular ports, whose result seems to be related with their respective location.
L19|Airline Deregulation, Competitive Environment and Safety|Air traffic has substantially increased since the introduction of deregulation in both the USA and the European Union. Moreover, aircraft accidents involving fatalities have exhibited a downward trend over time. Still, a series of recently publicized accidents has raised again a serious issue, namely whether cost reduction in a deregulated aviation environment is achieved at the expense of safety standards. To address this question, the paper proposes a mathematical model, which highlights the relationship between competitive behaviour and tort liability. The model has important policy implications suggesting that the level of airline penalisation should be reduced when market rivalry is relaxed and conversely.
L19|Bargaining and posted prices: what does the Internet change ?|The Internet has introduced a variety of online buying services that expand the reach of sellers and reduce search costs for buyers. In markets in which traditional outlets tend to establish prices through bargaining, these online intermediaries have also altered the price setting process. Perhaps the most well known example is Autobytel.com which provides referral services in the automobile market. By using Autobytel, a buyer can obtain a posted price as an alternative to bargaining with a car dealer ship. To understand the effect of online referral systems on the price setting process, we construct a theoretical model of oligopolistic price competition in which one dealership has an exclusive contract with a referral intermediary. We show that posted prices offered through the referral system are not necessarily lower than offline prices (bargained prices). Our model provides theoretical insights relevant to results in the empirical literature addressing the role that Autobytel and other infomediaries play in online markets.
L19|Is Wal-Mart Good for Competition? Evidence from Milk Prices| This article examines the impact of Wal-Mart Supercenters’ entry on incumbents’ pricing behavior and demand. Using a structural model and milk data from the Dallas/Fort Worth supermarket chains, empirical results show that an expansion of Supercenters caused incumbents to price milk significantly more competitively, dropping on average 22.5% between 1996 and 2002, in spite of declines in their milk demand. Furthermore, consumer gains exceeded incumbent losses, lending further support to the notion that Wal-Mart is good for competition and consumers.
L19|Competição e Concentração entre os Bancos Brasileiros|This paper analysis the relationship between market structure and competitiveness in the Brazilian banking industry. First, it quantifies competitiveness by using the statistic-H proposed by Panzar & Rosse and evaluates its relationship with several concentration statistics: Herfindahl-Hirschman, Concentration Ratio, Hall-Tideman and Theil. The concentration indexes lead concentration in CR10 (assets and deposits), while the concentration of credit reduces. There is a monopolistic competition among Brazilian banks. The relationship between competitiveness and concentration is negative and significant.
L19|Integración cooperativa y sistemas de información interorganizativos. Un análisis aplicado al cooperativismo oleícola|In this paper we analyse the relations between the structure of Inter-organisational Information Systems (IOIS) and the structure of integration formulas in the case of olive oil cooperatives in Spain. The relationship between the two structures tends to be established within a collaborative framework in which the IOIS serves the objectives of said integration, thereby reinforcing the links that bind the cooperative’s members. However, in this article we also suggest that there may be a noncollaborative (i.e., competitive) relationship between the IOIS and cooperative integration, especially when the two structures compete for companies in the same sector and geographical area. To test our hypotheses we have analysed a sample of 162 companies belonging to olive oil cooperatives in Spain.
L19|When Should Nintendo Launch its Wii? Insights From a Bivariate Successive Generation Model|November 2006 most likely marks the launch of Sony’s PS3, the successor to PS2. Later, Nintendo is expected to launch the Wii, the successor to the GameCube. We answer the question in the title by analyzing the diffusion of the earlier generations of these consoles, and by using a new model that extends the successive-generations model of Norton and Bass (1987) by introducing two market players. Based on interviews with consumers and with retailers, we calibrate part of this model. The main outcome is that an optimal launch time is around June 2007, as then total sales of Nintendo’s GameCube and Wii would get maximized.
L19|Coping with Problems of Understanding in Interorganizational Relationships: Using Formalization as a Means to make Sense|Research into the management of interorganizational relationships has hitherto primarily focused on problems of coordination, control and to a lesser extent, legitimacy. In this article, we assert that partners cooperating in such relationships are also confronted with ‘problems of understanding’. Such problems arise from differences between partners in terms of culture, experience, structure and industry, and from the uncertainty and ambiguity that participants in interorganizational relationships experience in early stages of collaboration. Building on Karl Weick’s theory of sensemaking, we advance that participants in interorganizational relationships use formalization as a means to make sense of their partners, the interorganizational relationships in which they are engaged and the contexts in which these are embedded so as to diminish problems of understanding. We offer a systematic overview of the mechanisms through which formalization facilitates sensemaking, including: (1) focusing participants’ attention; (2) provoking articulation, deliberation and reflection; (3) instigating and maintaining interaction; and (4) reducing judgment errors and individual biases, and diminishing incompleteness and inconsistency of cognitive representations. In this way, the article contributes to a better understanding of the relationships between formalization and sensemaking in collaborative relationships, and it carries Karl Weick’s thinking on the relationship between sensemaking and organizing forward in the context of interorganizational management.
L19|Uma contribuição para o debate sobre a globalização na indústria automobilística internacional|The general aim of this work is to contribute to the discussion of the globalization process in the international automobile industry. It must be pointed out, however, that it has an exploratory character. Specifically, we will approach 1) the general basic characteristics of the globalization process in the international automobile industry; 2) some chosen aspects from the processes of internationalization of the western (mainly the North American) and the Japanese car assemblers and 3) the yet relatively restrict process of the R&D internationalization in this industrial sector.
L19|Investment and Performance of Firms: Correlation or Causality?|The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical analysis of the two-way causal relationship between some important investment and performance indicators at the firm level, in particular controlling for differences in these relationships between two cohorts of small and middle-sized firms and large firms respectively. Investigated performance variables include sales, value added, profit, cash flow, capital structure and employment. A multivariate vector autoregressive approach is applied to a panel of Swedish firms observed between 1992 and 2000. In particular, an attempt is made to investigate whether causal relationships between R&D and firm performance are of a transitory nature and whether the causal relationships are similar for small and medium-sized and large firms. Results show evidence of some two way causal relationships, which are mainly transitory in character. Significant heterogeneity is observed in the firms’ investment and performance behavior by their size.
L19|Do Commercial Banks, Savings Banks, and Credit Unions Compete?|This paper attempts to evaluate the extent to which rivalry between the different financial intermediaries that operate in the Spanish banking system has been influenced by the recent liberalization process. Our theoretical model is borrowed from population ecology and allows us to take into account the relationship between the three types of financial intermediaries as well as the effect of other exogenous factors on the capacity of the environment to sustain the growth of each population.
L19|Riziko a nejistota ve strategickém rozhodování<BR>[Risk and uncertainty in strategic decision making]|Importance of risk and uncertainty in present period of dynamic changes grows. The article deals with risk and uncertainty in strategic decision making. First the concepts of risk and uncertainty and possibilities of their measurement are discussed. Further shortcomings of strategic decision making from the point of view risk integration are described. The emphasis is on discussion of decision making methods under risk and uncertainty (including decision tables, scenarios, Monte Carlo simulation, real options, decision trees, multicriteria utility function under risk, theory of games and methods of portfolio development) as supporting tools for strategic decision making. In the last part of the article some recommendations for integration of risk and uncertainty in strategic decision making based on scenario approach are suggested.
L19|El desarrollo industrial del MERCOSUR: ¿Qué impacto han tenido las empresas extranjeras?| Durante los años noventa, el MERCOSUR y en particular Argentina y Brasil, fueron un importante polo de atracción de inversión extranjera directa (IED). Hoy, aunque en menor escala, el MERCOSUR continúa atrayendo importantes flujos de inversiones. las investigaciones cuyos resultados se presentan en este libro tratan de responder a interrogantes suscitados por la siguiente constatación: dada la magnitud actual de la presencia de esas empresas, la formulación de políticas para el desarrollo industrial y tecnológico no puede prescindir del análisis del papel que las empresas transnacionales desempeñan en la inserción externa de las economías del MERCOSUR y de su contribución potencial para el desarrollo en la región. Surge de las investigaciones un panorama complejo, que muestra que la presencia de empresas transnacionales en los países del MERCOSUR puede tener un impacto positivo si se aplicaran políticas adecuadas para fortalecer a las empresas nacionales, aumentando su capacidad de innovación y su competitividad.

L19|Towards a Practical Model of Strategy-as-Practice|Strategy-as-Practice is a young research field concentrating on how the strategists actually do strategy. Not being content with the more traditional views of strategy, the central tenet to the field is an understanding that the strength of micro activities of strategy Ã± commonly known as strategy practices Ã± is what separates performers from non-performers. This paper is an attempt towards building a model that details some of the mechanisms, through which supra-organizational institutionalized practices shape the micro activities and in turn, how the micro activities shape the strategy process. The main merit of the model is viewing these links in unison. The link from the supra-organizational practices is modelled through applying the concepts of routines, strategy methods, strategy concepts and behavioural norms and beliefs. The link from micro activities to the strategy process is built by modelling the main functions strategy practices perform within the strategy process.
L19|Capacity Constraints and Investment Decisions under Cournot Competition|This paper analyses how the equilibrium is affected when adding investment decisions and capacity constraints to the traditional Cournot duopoly model. Authors investigate a multiperiod setting with two firms taking investment decisions in every period. We prove that under these circumstances the Cournot equilibrium is unstable and the tendency is to a cartel structure in the industry. However, this behavior is not necessarily cooperative or subject to a tacit agreement. It is optimising for the duopolists to cut down the amount produced in spite of the behavior of the other firm until they reach the monopoly equilibrium.
L19|eStrategies for Promotion End-Use Efficiency Products and Services on the Local Market (Some Results of a Survey of Forestry and Non-Wood Products)|The paper presents results of analysis of the framework of traditional and Web channels which affect achievement of transformation of marketing business strategie. We study the fulfillment of business strategies for promotion and attracting consumers to support solving the traditional public problems in the area of urban consumption - market for end-use efficiency of forestry and non-wood products on traditional and Web channels (an example: parquet and raspberry productions, Sofia area). Our empirical results show slow infiltration of the new ways of virtual promotion for end–use forestry products and services on the local market.
L19|To Buy or Not to Buy? An Experimental Study of Consumer Boycotts in Retail Markets| We investigate experimentally how firms and consumers react to a sudden cost increase in a competitive retail market. We compare two conditions that exclusively differ with respect to how difficult it is to organize and enforce boycotts. We find that cost increases translate into sudden price increases, and that consumer boycotts are frequent in response. However, consumer boycotts are unsuccessful in holding down market prices even if collective action problems are completely eliminated. While consumer boycotts do not increase consumer rent, they reduce market efficiency. Consumer boycotts apparently serve to punish firms for seemingly unfair price increases.

L19|La concentración de mercado en el sector farmacéutico colombiano 2002-2003. Un análisis parcial para las enfermedades cerebrovasculares e isquemias|ResumenEste trabajo estudia la concentración de mercado del sector farmacéutico colombiano para diferentes grupos farmacológicos, teniendo en cuenta el índice de Hefindahl en los años 2002 y 2003. Metodológicamente, se parte de los indicadores de mortalidad para el año 2002, de donde se obtienen las principales causas de muerte para la población mayor de 45 años, esto es; enfermedades cerebrovasculares e isquemias, diabetes, enfermedades cardiovasculares y enfermedades crónicas de las vías respiratorias inferiores. Dichas patologías fueron atendidas con aproximadamente 507 medicamentos, comerciales y genéricos, por diferentes laboratorios de tipo nacional y multinacional. Como resultado importante se destaca que las patologías fueron atendidas por oligopolios fuertes en el año 2002, acentuando su posición para el año 2003.Abstract:This work studies the concentration of market of the Colombian pharmaceutical sector for different farmacológicos groups, considering the index of Hefindahl in 2002 and 2003. Methodologically, part of the indicators of mortality for the year 2002, from where the main causes of death for the greater population of 45 years are obtained, this is; diseases cerebrovasculares and isquemias, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and chronic diseases of the inferior respiratory routes. These pathologies were taken care of with approximately 507 medicines, commercial and generic, by different laboratories from national and multinational type. As important result stands out that the pathologies were taken care of by strong oligopolios in 2002, accentuating its position for year 2003.
L19|Intensité concurrentielle entre lignes de produits rivales:un éclairage par la théorie de la concurrence multimarchés|(VF)Cet article propose une lecture nouvelle et globale des stratégies de marketing produit des entreprises en mobilisant la théorie de la concurrence multimarchés. Il tend à montrer la pertinence de transposer cette théorie au niveau de la rivalité entre lignes de produits et à analyser le lien entre la domination d’une firme dans une ligne de produits et la modification du niveau de concurrence du secteur. À travers une analyse de cas, l’article montre que l’intensité des contacts multimarchés entre les firmes du secteur des cosmétiques incite ces dernières à engager l’essentiel de leurs actions, en l’occurrence portant sur les lignes de produits, sur leurs marchés sphères d’influence.(VA)This article offers a new global approach to understand the product strategies of firms through multimarket competition theory. It shows the relevance of the latter theory when applied to product lines rivalry, and analyzes the link between the domination of a firm within a product line and the change in the intensity of competition among firms. Using a case analysis, the article shows that the intensity of multimarket contacts between the firms of the cosmetics sector encourages them to engage most of their actions relating to product lines in their market spheres of influence.
L19|L’influence du mode de développement sur les avantages liés à la taille : une étude empirique dans le secteur de la grande distribution au niveau mondial|(VF)La relation taille-performance a, depuis la fin des années 70, généré peu d’intérêt. Malgré les nombreux travaux consacrés aux fusions-acquisitions et aux alliances stratégiques qui induisent des effets de taille, peu d’auteurs se sont intéressés à l’efficacité comparée de ces stratégies sur les effets de taille. Cette recherche constitue une première contribution en ce sens. Les tests des hypothèses formulées confirment le lien taille-performance, la supériorité globale de la croissance interne par rapport aux fusions-acquisitions, ainsi que la capacité des alliances à accroître le pouvoir de marché. Contrairement à nos attentes, les fusions-acquisitions améliorent les économies d’échelle.(VA)The size-performance relationship has generated limited interest since the late seventies. Despite much research that has been devoted recently to examining mergers and acquisitions and inter-firm alliances, both significantly affecting a firm’s size, the work on M&As or on alliances, very rarely compares these different modes of growth to one another, or to organic growth, in terms of size effects. This research aims at analyzing this issue. Our empirical tests confirm the strong impact of size on performance and suggest that organic growth outperforms both alliances and M&As. Moreover, strategic alliances increase market power, while M&As result in greater economies of scale.
L19|Exploring Patterns of Upstream Internationalization: The Role of Home-region ‘Stickiness’|Recent work has emphasized the importance of regional strategies downstream, adding new depth to the debate on ‘globalization’. This paper adds to the debate by exploring the regional dimension upstream for a sample of Triad-based Fortune 500 firms. We find support for our hypothesis that MNEs with higher levels of value-added upstream are relatively constrained in their ability to shift that activity outside the home region due to its strategic significance to home-region stakeholders.
L19|A Limit of Bilateral Contracting Institutions|" Nonconvexities undermine the efficiency of the usually robust ""double auction"" or DA market institution. We experimentally examine two modified DAs that allow for particularly rich bilateral contracting such as arbitrarily nonlinear pricing. The first allows for arbitrarily nonlinear pricing but should not necessarily promote it; the second should promote efficient nonlinear pricing. Experiments support predictions on the emergence of nonlinear pricing, but not those concerning efficiency. Coordination problems are the culprit. We conclude that institutions capable of dealing with some nonconvexities must frequently provide multilateral contracting possibilities not permitted by DA rules and other market-like bilateral contracting institutions.

L19|Jurnalistii si factorul politic in anul 2004<BR>[The romanian journalists and political factor in 2004]|This study attempts to identify some characteristics of the relationship between journalists and politicians. The methodology of the research is based on the analysis of responses to interviews in depth applied to a sample of 50 print and audiovisual journalists from Bucharest, Suceava, Pitesti, Galati and Zalau. The central points of interest have focused on tracking the degree of the journalists'independence from the political and consequently economic factors. The results of the analysis found that often political interference in editorial media agenda materialized through print and audiovisual media owners. One of the ways used by the political parties in influencing journalists consist in the providing of economic benefits as state advertising to obedient publications. Precariousness of the professional organizations and associations of journalists from Romania explains in some degree the problems revealed by journalists interviewed.
L19|How do firms protect their “knowledge capital”? socialization versus appropriation (Comment les firmes protègent-elles leur “capital savoir”? socialisation versus appropriation)|The purpose of this paper is to study the strategies implemented by firms to protect their knowledge base. Intellectual property rights – and notably patents - are the first tools that come to mind. Their rationale, since their origin, has been to give inventors some incentives and at the same time to facilitate a large diffusion of knowledge, so that the cumulative process of innovation may take place. However, due to this restriction, and also for reasons of cost, other tools than patents have been used by enterprises: one of the contributions of the paper is to show that firms use a whole set of tools to protect their knowledge capital. However, to assess properly the protection strategies implemented by firms implies to take account of today’s characteristics of elaboration of the knowledge capital by firms. We will see that, due to the profitability imperative, external means of formation of a knowledge capital are now of growing importance – even if in-house strategies are still essential. How do such strategies impact the way firms protect their knowledge capital? According to us, the recent trend to extend patenting possibilities to new fields (information technology, genetics) and closer to the scientific border is driven by the same profitability imperative. As firms are more and more open to their environment, they need to have a wider and stronger protection of their own knowledge base in which patents have a major part to play, even though they have important restrictions. We finally present the consequences of this growing contradiction between, on the one hand, the socialization of the knowledge capital and, on the other hand, its growing oligopolistic appropriation. L’objet de ce document est d’étudier les stratégies mises en oeuvre par les entreprises pour protéger leur capital savoir. Les droits de propriété intellectuelle – et notamment les brevets - sont les premiers outils qui viennent à l’esprit. Depuis leur origine, leur objet a été d’inciter les inventeurs et en même temps de faciliter une large diffusion des connaissances, pour que le processus cumulatif de l’innovation puisse exister. Mais, en raison de cette restriction, et aussi du fait de leur coût, d’autres outils, autres que les brevets ont été utilisés par les entreprises : l’une des contributions de cet article est de montrer que les firmes utilisent un ensemble d’outils pour protéger leur capital savoir. Toutefois, pour évaluer correctement les stratégies de protection des entreprises ; il est nécessaire de prendre en compte les caractéristiques actuelles de l’élaboration du capital savoir. Nous verrons que compte tenu de l’impératif de profitabilité, les stratégies externes de constitution du capital savoir ont une importance grandissante, même si les stratégies internes sont toujours essentielles. Quels sont les impacts de telles stratégies sur la façon dont les entreprises protègent leur capital savoir ? Selon nous, la tendance récente d’étendre les capacités à breveter dans de nouveaux domaines (technologies de l’information, génétique) et plus proches de la frontière scientifique est conduite par le même impératif de profitabilité. Comme les firmes sont plus ouvertes sur leur environnement, elles ont besoin d’une plus large et d’une plus forte protection de leur propre base de savoir, où les brevets, malgré leurs défauts, jouent un rôle majeur. Nous présentons finalement quelques conséquences de cette contradiction croissante entre d’une part la socialisation de la constitution du capital savoir et d’autre part, son appropriation oligopolistique croissante.
L19|The optimal portfolio of start-up firms in venture capital finance|A venture capitalist faces a trade-off between the extent of managerial advice allocated to each start-up and the total number of firms advised. Diminishing returns to advice per firm call for a larger portfolio. As advice gets diluted, further expansion of the portfolio eventually becomes unprofitable.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L19|Start-up investment with scarce venture capital support|Start-up entrepreneurs are often commercially inexperienced. In giving managerial advice, venture capitalists can importantly enhance the success of innovative but highly risky ventures. The supply of experienced venture capitalists is not eas-ily increased, however, when the rate of business formation accelerates. As the entrepreneurial sector expands, the incumbent venture capitalists tend to include more firms in their portfolio which dilutes the quality of advice, making project risks excessively high in the short-run.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L19|Inter-league competition for talent vs. competitive balance|We analyze the distribution of broadcasting revenues by sports leagues. We show that when the teams engage in competitive bidding to attract talent in an isolated league, the league's optimal choice is full revenue sharing (resulting in full competitive balance). In contrast, when the teams of several leagues bid for talent, in equilibrium the leagues choose a performance-based reward scheme. We thus provide an explanation for the differences in revenue sharing rules for national TV rights used by the U.S. sports leagues (full revenue sharing) and European football leagues (performance-based reward).<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L19|Sources of Finance, R&D Investment and Productivity: Correlation or Causality?|In general there is agreement about the positive impacts of R&D on performance of firms measured as productivity, profitability and growth. However, the opposite relationship is less obvious and very little attention has been paid on examining the feedback from performance on investment. This study is an attempt to contribute to the empirical analysis of the causal relationship between investment and performance. We examine the interaction between a number of financial indicators represented by investments in R&D and tangible capital and a number of performance variables including sales, value added, profit, cash flow, capital structure and employment on R&D and physical capital investments. Empirical results are based on a large panel data set of Swedish manufacturing firms over the period 1992-2000. The results show evidence of weak feedback effects from performance on investment.
L19|Ignorant Actors in the Resource Rich World of the Knowledge Based Economy - On Rational Management in an Experimentally Organized Economy (EOE)|The internal dynamics of the Experimentally Organized Economy (EOE) force actors to constantly innovate to survive competition from all other actors in the same situation, or from new actors entering the market. Since ignorance of circumstances that may be critical for survival characterize the situation of each actor, business mistakes abound. With tacit knowledge distributed over hierarchies and markets analytical methods of management not only feed management with the wrong information but also mislead management, and especially so when something unusual occurs. The change from a seemingly orderly and plannable market environment to an unpredictable, faster and differently organized New economy over the last few decades has made this dynamic an acute management problem. Advance in economic and management theory to help policy makers and management cope is lagging economic development . The managers of the new, distributed (over the market) production organizations have little to learn from the experience of their predecessors in monolithic hierarchies. Hence, the rate of business mistakes has escalated, jeopardizing the life even of the big companies with ample resources to finance a come back. The business manager in the new economy is being subjected to a genuine Darwinian learning experience in the market. Access to competence blocs of organized tacit knowledge distributed over markets, however, minimizes the economic consequences for the firm and for the economy at large of business mistakes, notably the risk of losing the “winners”. Since creating and identifying winners and carrying them on to industrial scale production is the single most important growth promoting factor, a broad based competence to choose the appropriate management method for the occasion is also the important growth promoting factor. For the policy maker this means helping to organize vertically complete and horizontally varied competence blocs of actors with tacit competencies.
