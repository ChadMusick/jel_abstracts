H81|Machine learning in the service of policy targeting: the case of public credit guarantees|We use Machine Learning (ML) predictive tools to propose a policy-assignment rule designed to increase the effectiveness of public guarantee programs. This rule can be used as a benchmark to improve targeting in order to reach the stated policy goals. Public guarantee schemes should target firms that are both financially constrained and creditworthy, but they often employ naïve assignment rules (mostly based only on the probability of default) that may lead to an inefficient allocation of resources. Examining the case of Italy’s Guarantee Fund, we suggest a benchmark ML-based assignment rule, trained and tested on credit register data. Compared with the current eligibility criteria, the ML-based benchmark leads to a significant improvement in the effectiveness of the Fund in gaining credit access to firms. We discuss the problems in estimating and using these algorithms for the actual implementation of public policies, such as transparency and omitted payoffs.
H81|Fair-Value Estimates of the Cost of Federal Credit Programs in 2020|The federal government supports some private activities by providing credit assistance to individuals and businesses. CBO shows two kinds of estimates of the lifetime costs of those credit programs: estimates created by following procedures prescribed by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA); and estimates that account for the market value of the governmentâ€™s obligations, which are called fair-value estimates.
H81|"What went wrong?: The Puerto Rican debt crisis, the ""Treasury Put,"" and the failure of market discipline"|What went wrong? Why did seemingly rational bond investors continue to purchase Puerto Rican debt with only a modest risk premium, even though the macroeconomic fundamentals were dismal? Why did financial markets fail to exercise market discipline and restrict capital flows to Puerto Rico? Given gloomy macroeconomic fundamentals and relatively low risk premia, investors were either stunningly myopic/misinformed, or Puerto Rican debt was implicitly insured by the U.S. government. This paper examines the latter hypothesis, which we label the “Treasury Put.” The expectation of a federal bailout was perfectly reasonable given past behavior by the federal government, starting with the prior bailout of the city of New York. Evaluating the Treasury Put hypothesis with a minimal set of assumptions is possible given three unique features – the dire fiscal and economic conditions in Puerto Rico, a fortunate characteristic of Puerto Rican bond issuance, and a “seismic shock.” Regarding the second feature, Puerto Rico issued both uninsured and insured general obligation bonds on the same day and, in many cases, with the exact same maturity. The associated bond price data allow for an accurate computation of the risk premia on Puerto Rican bonds. The third feature is the non-bailout of the city of Detroit in 2013 that effectively extinguished the Treasury Put. Puerto Rican risk premia were stable before the Detroit bankruptcy and bracketed by the risk premia on Corporate Aaa and Baa bonds. However, after the Detroit bankruptcy, risk premia rose dramatically, thus identifying a sizeable Treasury Put of at least 300 basis points and a significant misallocation of capital to Puerto Rico. In effect, the Treasury Put was a form of regulatory forbearance. Institutional reforms that would eliminate the Treasury Put are considered, but none are found satisfactory.
H81|Liquidation, bailout, and bail-in: Insolvency resolution mechanisms and bank lending|We present a dynamic, continuous-time model in which risk averse inside equityholders set a bank's lending, payout, and financing policies, and the exposure of bank assets to crashes. We study how the prevailing insolvency resolution mechanism affects these policies, the insolvency rate, loss in default, value at risk (VaR), and the net value created by the bank. VaR depends non-trivially on jump (crash) risk, diffusion risk and the horizon. We examine the commonplace assertion that bailouts encourage excessive lending and risk-taking compared to the liquidation and bail-in regimes, and explore whether bailouts could be financed by banks without taxpayers' money.
H81|Loan to value caps and government-backed mortgage insurance: Loan-level evidence from Dutch residential mortgages|Using loan level data on mortgage loans originated by Dutch banks during 1996 to 2015, we analyse the determinants of the incidence of non-performance. We find that both the originating loan-to-value ratio (OLTV) and the debt-service-to-income ratio (DSTI) are significantly positively associated with the probability of non-performance. The results suggest that mortgages with government-loan-guarantees perform better. Moreover, several mortgage loan and borrower characteristics, such as the (interest-only) loan type and the underwater status of the borrower, increase credit risk. Our model predictions suggest a novel policy implication: in order to avoid acceleration of non-performance probabilities, the OLTV-limit should be set to about 70%-80% for uninsured mortgages, and to about 90% for those with mortgage insurance.
H81|Bank Leverage, Welfare, and Regulation|We take issue with claims that the funding mix of banks, which makes them fragile and crisis-prone, is efficient because it reflects special liquidity benefits of bank debt. Even aside from neglecting the systemic damage to the economy that banksâ€™ distress and default cause, such claims are invalid because banks have multiple small creditors and are unable to commit effectively to their overall funding mix and investment strategy ex ante. The resulting market outcomes under laissez-faire are inefficient and involve excessive borrowing, with default risks that jeopardize the purported liquidity benefits. Contrary to claims in the literature that â€œequity is expensiveâ€ and that regulation requiring more equity in the funding mix entails costs to society, such regulation actually helps create useful commitment for banks to avoid the inefficiently high borrowing that comes under laissez-faire. Effective regulation is beneficial even without considering systemic risk; if such regulation also reduces systemic risk, the benefits are even larger.
H81|The Consequences of Student Loan Credit Expansions: Evidence from Three Decades of Default Cycles|This paper studies the link between credit availability and student loan repayment using administrative federal student loan data. We demonstrate that expansions and contractions in federal student loan credit to institutions with high default rates explain most of the time series variation in student loan defaults between 1980 and 2010. Expansions in loan eligibility between 1976 and 1988 led to the entry of new, high-risk institutions, and default rates exceeding 30 percent in the late 1980s. Credit access was subsequently tightened through strict institutional and student accountability measures. This contracted credit availability at the highest default rate institutions, which in turn caused an exodus of institutions with high default rates, resulting in lower default rates on student loans. After 1992, the cycle was repeated, with credit access gradually loosened by unwinding many of the pre-1992 reforms. We confirm this time series narrative by examining discrete policy changes governing access to credit to show that tightening credit supply led to the closure of high-default schools and the relaxation of accountability rules resulted in their expansion. Our estimates imply that 85 percent of the increase in default between 1980 and 1990, and 95 percent of the decrease in default between 1990 and 2000 is driven by schools entering and exiting loan programs. One-third of the recent increase in default is associated with the entry of online programs following the relaxation of rules for lending to online schools, and another third is associated with the abolition of rules limiting the share of revenue coming from federal programs
H81|The Effects of Access to Credit on Productivity: Separating Technological Changes from Changes in Technical Efficiency|Improving productivity among microenterprises is important, especially in low-income countries where market imperfections are pervasive, and resources are scarce. Relaxing credit constraints can increase the productivity of microenterprises. Using a field experiment involving agricultural microenterprises in Bangladesh, we estimated the impact of access to credit on the overall productivity of rice farmers and disentangled the total effect into technological change (frontier shift) and technical efficiency changes. We found that relative to the baseline rice output per decimal, access to credit resulted in, on average, approximately a 14 percent increase in yield, holding all other inputs constant. After decomposing the total effect into the frontier shift and efficiency improvement, we found that, on average, around 11 percent of the increase in output came from changes in technology, or frontier shift, while the remaining 3 percent was attributed to improvements in technical efficiency. The efficiency gain was higher for modern hybrid rice varieties, and almost zero for traditional rice varieties. Within the treatment group, the effect was greater among pure tenant and mixed-tenant microenterprise households compared with microenterprises that only cultivated their own land.
H81|Closing the Finance Gap by Nudging: Impact Assessment of Public Grants for Women Entrepreneurs|Several recent papers draw attention to a lack of rigorous research on public policies supporting women entrepreneurs' competitiveness. This paper evaluates the effect of small business development gender-specific matching grants using a quasi-experimental approach. The grants have a positive effect on firm survival, as well as positive effects on obtaining bank loans, turnover, value added, employment, and total factor productivity. Heterogeneous treatment effects show that the grants increase the chance of young women entrepreneurs' firm survival and are even more effective for firms owned by mature women. Cost-benefit analysis estimates an increase in value added, which outweighs scheme-induced costs by 80% in the short-run and 170% in the long run.

H81|The Bank-Sovereign Loop and Financial Stability in the Euro Area|We propose a simple model that captures the link between bank and sovereign credit risk. It allows evaluating policy options to address this ‘doom loop’ in which the government may need to raise debt to recapitalise banks, and an increase in government debt raises sovereign risk and in turn generates potential bank losses via their (sovereign) bond holdings. Hence, an initial shock originating either in the banking or sovereign sector is amplified by the feedback relation. We set up a framework based on detailed actual bank balance sheets and test the model on 35 large EU banking groups, across 7 European countries. The effects of the feedback loops in most cases more than double the effect of the initial shock on bank losses and the sovereign risk premium. We show that a single EU bank resolution mechanism, European Stability Mechanism (ESM) direct bank recapitalisations, and bondholder “bail-in” can be effective to dampen the bank-sovereign loop. Addressing the home bias in banks sovereign bond holdings by reducing excessive exposure to domestic sovereigns has only limited benefit in terms of lower crisis doom loop effects as contagion effects increase.
H81|Second Chance: Life without Student Debt|Rising student debt is considered one of the creeping threats of our time. This paper examines the effect of student debt relief on individual credit and labor market outcomes. We exploit the plausibly-random debt discharge due to the inability of National Collegiate, the largest owner of private student loan debt, to prove chain of title for thousands of loans across the US. Using hand-collected lawsuits filings matched with individual credit bureau information, we find that borrowers experiencing the debt relief shock reduce their indebtedness by 26%, by both reducing their demand for credit and limiting the use of existing credit accounts, and are 11% less likely to default on other accounts. After the discharge, the borrowers' geographical mobility increases, as well as, their probability to change jobs and ultimately their income increases by about $3000 over a three year period. These findings speak to the benefits of intervening in the student loan market to reduce the consequences of debt overhang problems by forgiving student debts.
H81|Measuring distortions in international markets: the aluminium value chain|This report builds on the OECD’s longstanding work measuring government support in agriculture, fossil fuels, and fisheries in order to estimate support and related market distortions in the aluminium value chain. Results show that non-market forces, and government support in particular, appear to explain some of the recent increases in aluminium-smelting capacity. While government support is commonly found throughout the aluminium value chain, it is especially heavy in the People’s Republic of China and countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Looking across the whole value chain also shows subsidies upstream to confer significant support to downstream activities, such as the production of semi-fabricated products of aluminium. Overall, market distortions appear to be a genuine concern in the aluminium industry, and one that has implications for global competition and the design of trade rules disciplining government support.
H81|The Role of Credit Guarantee Schemes in the Development of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises with an Emphasis on Knowledge-Based Enterprises|Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in their growth stage reach the point where, on the one hand, personal resources do not meet their needs, and, on the other, they do not have enough collateral to attract external finance. Access to finance can be facilitated by obtaining loans from financial institutions backed by governmental credit guarantees. Therefore, the development of a sound credit guarantee scheme will be an important step in filling the financing gap of SMEs. We investigate the situation of the credit guarantee scheme for SMEs in Iran by using the available data and interviews with activists from this field with the grounded theory method. We show the weaknesses of the Iranian credit guarantee scheme, and based on the analysis, present solutions and policy recommendations in accordance with the social and economic environment of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The most important problem is the lack of a credit database for comprehensive assessment of SMEs, especially knowledge-based enterprises. The lack of a robust database makes it impossible to carry out a comprehensive evaluation because these models require a large amount of data. The lack of accurate models makes it difficult to rate credit status and thus to issue credit guarantees. In addition, the current level of the capital of the credit guarantee funds in Iran is not sufficient given the large number of SMEs in the country.
H81|Political Connections and Access to Brazilian Development Bankâ€™s Loans|Prior studies suggest that politically connected firms manage to buy the access to subsidized loans from the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) by financing candidates to federal deputies in election campaigns. Nonetheless, and although firms that most donated to these candidates were indeed the same that subsequently most tapped BNDESâ€™ subsidized credit, no anecdotal piece of information has been reported referring to deputies being accused of interfering in BNDES lending policy to benefit their donors. Proxying political connections by the 100 largest Brazilian business groupsâ€™ donations to candidates in the 2006 election for the House of Representatives, we also documented a positive correlation between these groupsâ€™ donations and the amount they borrowed from the bank. However, carrying out regression discontinuity analysis, we found no evidence that federal deputies elected by a small margin of votes had systematically affected BNDES credit allocation decisions. The discrepant empirical results may indicate the influence on the access to the bankâ€™s loans through political connections other than direct donations to winning federal deputies.
H81|Credit Access and Approval|This work focuses on the credit access and credit demand of Italian firms using a sample representative of Italian firms. We investigate whether the gender of the decision-maker of the firm affects the demand for credit and we focus on regional differences in credit access and denial. Results suggest that women are significantly less likely to ask for credit, while no significant differences in credit approval are found between the two genders.
H81|Does the World Bank Move Markets?|This paper examines the impact of World Bank loans on borrowing country equity markets. We exploit a rich dataset with World Bank loan commitments and stock market returns at the monthly level, allowing us to study short run market reactions to news about loan commitments. Given ex ante uncertainty over the influx of resources, we expect a positive overall response to loan size in terms of the local stock market returns. To address potential endogeneity, we use a supply-push instrument based on countries' historic budget shares and the overall World Bank budget. Estimation results point to a sizable positive short run impact of World Bank loan commitments on local markets that may reduce the cost of capital for local entrepreneurs.
H81|Banks' holdings of risky sovereign bonds in the absence of the nexus: Yield seeking with central bank funding or de-risking?|"For the largest 55 German banks, we detect the presence of countercyclical yield seeking in the form of acquisition of high-yielding periphery bonds in the period from Q1 2008 to Q2 2011. This investment strategy is pursued by banks not subject to a bailout, banks characterised by high capitalisation, banks that rely on short-term wholesale funding, and trading banks. In the subsequent period up to 2014, these banks switched to a procyclical divestment strategy resulting in the sale of risky assets. Following the launch of the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) in 2015, a clear investment pattern can no longer be identified. Unlike existing evidence for banks domiciled in vulnerable countries, we find that the recourse to central bank finance is rather limited and does not affect the risk-taking behaviour of banks in the non-stressed country Germany. Yield-seeking strategies were predominantly pursued by healthy banks in Germany. This contrasts with the increases in domestic sovereign holdings in vulnerable countries which can be primarily regarded as the result of moral suasion or, for weakly capitalised banks, a kind of ""indirect"" moral suasion or ""home-biased"" gambling for resurrection."
H81|Funding Liquidity without Banks: Evidence from a Shock to the Cost of Very Short-Term Debt|In 2011, Colombia instituted a tax on repayment of bank loans, thereby increasing the cost of short-term bank credit more than long-term credit. Firms responded by cutting their short-term loans for liquidity management purposes and increasing their use of cash and trade credit. In industries where trade credit is more accessible (based on U.S. Compustat firms), we find substitution into accounts payable and little effect on cash and investment. Where trade credit is less available, firms increase cash and cut investment. Thus, trade credit offers a substitute source of liquidity that can insulate some firms from bank liquidity shocks.
H81|Measuring the Costs of Federal Insurance Programs: Cash or Accrual?|Following on a January 2018 report about using cash or accrual measures in federal budgeting, CBO assesses the advantages and disadvantages of those measures for federal insurance programs, including deposit insurance, flood insurance, and pension insurance. The report also describes a range of options for the expanding the use of accrual measures in the budget process.
H81|Fair-Value Estimates of the Cost of Federal Credit Programs in 2019|The federal government supports some private activities by providing credit assistance to individuals and businesses. CBO offers two kinds of measures for estimating the lifetime costs incurred by those federal credit programs: estimates created by following procedures prescribed by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA); and estimates that account for the market value of the governmentâ€™s obligations, which are called fair-value estimates. Using FCRA procedures, CBO estimates that new loans and loan guarantees issued in 2019 would result in savings of $37.4 billion.
H81|Federal Support for Financing State and Local Transportation and Water Infrastructure|State and local governments own much of the nationâ€™s transportation and water infrastructure, such as highways, mass transit systems, airports, and water treatment systems. The federal government helps states and localities finance investments in such infrastructure through tax-exempt bonds, tax credit bonds, state revolving funds and infrastructure banks, and direct federal credit programs.
H81|Public Development Banks and Credit Market Imperfections|"This paper is devoted to understanding the role of public development banks in alleviating financial market imperfections. We explore two issues: 1) which types of firms should be optimally targeted by public financial support; and 2) what type of mechanism should be implemented in order to efficiently support the targeted firms' access to credit. We model firms that face moral hazard and banks that have a costly screening technology, which results in a limited access to credit for some firms. We show that a public development bank may alleviate the inefficiencies by lending to commercial banks at subsidized rates, targeting the firms that generate high added value. This may be implemented through subsidized ear-marked lending to the banks or through credit guarantees which we show to be equivalent in ""normal times"". Still, when banks are facing a liquidity shortage, lending is preferred, while when banks are undercapitalized, a credit guarantees program is best suited. This will imply that 1) there is no ""one size fits all"" intervention program and 2) that any intervention program should be fine-tuned to accommodate the characteristics of competition, collateral, liquidity and banks capitalization of each industry."
H81|A structural model to assess the impact of bank capitalization changes conditional on a bail-in versus bail-out regime|We develop a structural model for valuing bank balance sheet components such as the equity and debt value, the value for the government when the bank is operated by private shareholders including the present value of a possible future bailout, the bailout value incurred by the government following the abandonment of the private shareholders, and, moreover, some price and risk parameters, including the funding cost spread and the banks’ probability of default. The structural model implies an abandonment threshold, at which if total income drops below this threshold, private shareholders abandon the bank. In this case, the shareholders lose part (or all) of the capital that they hold in the bank, the creditors lose part or all of their debt, and the government receives a portion (or all) of the capital and all of the debt that is not recovered by creditors. Hence, we assume that part of the capital can be lost due to financial distress or to cover bankruptcy costs. We use the model framework to assess the impact of capital-based macro-prudential policy measures and focus in particular on assessing the difference that an assumed bail-in as opposed to bail-out regime can make.

H81|Financial Credit Risk and Core Enterprise Supply Chains|Supply chain finance has broken through traditional credit modes and advanced rapidly as a creative financial business. Core enterprises have played a crucial role in the credit enhancement of supply chain finance. Through the analysis of the core enterprise credit risks in supply chain finance, by means of Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP), the paper constructs a supply chain financial credit risk evaluation system, leading to quantitative measurement and evaluation of core enterprise credit risk. This novel approach should assist enterprises in taking appropriate measures to control credit risk, thereby promoting the healthy development of supply chain finance.
H81|Effects of Macroprudential Policy on Systemic Risk and Bank Risk Taking|Using an international sample of 95 banks from 21 European and North American countries spanning from 2008 to 2014, this paper assesses the effectiveness of a large set of general and housing macro-prudential policies in controlling banks’ systemic importance and risk-taking incentives. Empirical findings indicate that tightening the general capital requirements, sector specific capital buffers, along with housing countercyclical capital requirements and Debt-Service-to-Income lending criteria significantly reduce banks’ contribution to systemic risk and their individual risk-taking. A similar effect has been obtained for loosening real estate loans loss provisioning. Furthermore, the nexus between macroprudential policies and banks’ risk is shaped through several channels like bank size, the share of foreign bank assets, banking sector competition and the independence of supervisory authority.
H81|Guaranteed Success? The Effects of Export Credit Guarantees on Firm Performance|Many countries offer government-backed export credit guarantees to domestic firms. We investigate the effects of such guarantees on firm exports, jobs and value added. Using uniquely detailed and exhaustive transaction-level panel data on guarantees and granular information on trade as well as on exporters and foreign-buyers, we perform difference-in-difference matching estimations. We find that guarantees improve firm performance. However, the effects are strikingly heterogeneous across firm size and response variables. Using guarantees increases the firm-destination probability to export and the value of exports by 18 and 172 percent, respectively, but does not generally increase jobs and value added. Smaller firms benefit the most in terms of exports. Overall, the evidence suggests a causal link from guarantees to firm export performance.

H81|Framing Effects, Earnings Expectations, and the Design of Student Loan Repayment Schemes|Income-driven student loan repayment (IDR) plans provide protection against unaffordable loan payments and default by linking loan payments to borrowers’ earnings. Despite the advantages IDR would offer to many borrowers, take-up remains low. We investigate how take-up is affected by the framing of IDR through a survey of University of Maryland undergraduates. When the insurance aspects of IDR are emphasized, students are significantly more likely to participate, while participation is significantly lower when costs are emphasized. IDR framing interacts with expected labor market outcomes. Emphasizing the insurance aspects of IDR has larger effects on students who anticipate a higher probability of not being employed and/or low earnings at graduation. In contrast, when costs are emphasized, IDR take-up is uncorrelated with students’ expected labor market outcomes. Simulation results suggest that a simple change in the framing of IDR could generate substantial reductions in loan defaults with little cost to long-run federal revenue.
H81|The ECB’s fiscal policy|Abstract While the ECB helped mitigate the euro crisis in the aftermath of Lehman, it has stretched its monetary mandate and moved into fiscal territory. This text describes and summarizes the crucial role played by the ECB in the intervention spiral resulting from its bid to manage the crisis. It also outlines ongoing competitiveness problems in southern Europe, discusses the so-called austerity policy of the Troika, comments on QE and presents two alternative paths for the future development of Europe.
H81|Trust in Lending|We develop a theory of trust in lending, distinguishing between trust and reputation, and use it to analyze the competitive interactions between banks and non-bank lenders (fintech firms). Trust enables lenders to have assured access to financing, whereas a loss of investor trust makes this access conditional on market conditions and lender reputation. Banks endogenously have stronger incentives to maintain trust. When borrower defaults erode trust in lenders, banks are able to survive the erosion of trust when fintech lenders do not. Trust is also asymmetric in nature—it is more difficult to gain it than to lose it.

H81|Fiscal Rules for Sub-central Governments: Design and Impact|Against a background of mounting demands for spending on services provided by sub-central governments, this paper examines how fiscal rules can help to ensure that pressure on resources is minimised and available resources are used efficiently. Drawing on questionnaire responses and other sources, this paper gives a detailed picture of fiscal rules for sub-central governments in place among a number of OECD countries. The paper examines the rationales for using fiscal rules, the various impacts fiscal rules can have, the factors making for effective implementation and the interactions between the various types of rule. It then constructs a number of synthetic sub-indicators designed to assess the extent to which sub-central government fiscal frameworks exhibit favourable characteristics for the achievement of fiscal objectives. It concludes with the construction of a composite indicator based on the combined impacts in the different areas of fiscal policy. Règles budgétaires des collectivités territoriales : Leurs caractéristiques et leur impact Face à l’augmentation des dépenses au titre des services assurés par les collectivités territoriales, cette étude examine comment les règles budgétaires peuvent contribuer à atténuer les pressions sur les ressources et à garantir une utilisation efficiente des ressources disponibles. S’appuyant sur les réponses à des questionnaires et sur d’autres sources, elle présente une description détaillée des règles budgétaires applicables aux collectivités territoriales dans plusieurs pays de l’OCDE. Elle analyse les raisons qui motivent l’utilisation de règles budgétaires, les divers effets que ces règles peuvent avoir, les facteurs qui contribuent à l’efficacité de leur mise en œuvre et les interactions entre les divers types de règles. Un certain nombre d’indicateurs synthétiques sont ensuite élaborés dans le but de déterminer dans quelle mesure les règles budgétaires des collectivités territoriales présentent des caractéristiques favorisant la réalisation des objectifs de finances publiques. L’étude s’achève par la construction d’un indicateur composite des effets combinés dans les différents domaines de la politique budgétaire.
H81|Market mechanisms in public service provision|This paper compares and analyses the use of market mechanisms in core sub-central policy areas, namely education, health care, transport, social protection, and environment. Arrangements like tendering, outsourcing, user choice and competition, user fees and performance-related funding can help to improve quality of service provision or lower its cost. With around 32% of total public expenditure and often wide-ranging spending powers, sub-central governments (SCG) have considerable leeway for improving their services by relying on market mechanisms. The decentralised and often fragmented nature of sub-central government poses some special challenges to efficient arrangements, however, and may require central government support or stronger inter-jurisdictional co-operation. And while market mechanisms are being harnessed ever more broadly, limits to a more extensive use have become apparent, particularly in the potential trade-off between greater efficiency and equity objectives, or between efficiency and sub-central accountability..
H81|The spending power of sub-central governments: A pilot study|This pilot study presents indicators that assess sub-central government (SCG) spending power by policy area. Traditional indicators – such as the share of SCG in total government spending – are often misleading as they underestimate the impact of central government regulation on sub-central spending patterns. In order to gauge true spending power, a set of institutional indicators is established, based on a detailed assessment of institutional, regulatory and administrative control central government exerts over various SCG policy areas. Results tend to confirm the limited discretion of SCGs over their own budget. Education in particular – the main SCG budget item in most countries – is strongly shaped by central government regulation. Federal countries tend to grant more spending power to SCGs than unitary countries.
H81|Bail-in and Legacy Assets: Harmonized rules for targeted partial compensation to strengthen the bail-in regime|In the wake of the global financial crisis, several large bank rescues by governments further entrenched bail-out expectations in the wider public. Then, following a problematic ad-hoc bail-in in Cyprus early 2013, EU rules introduced provisions for ‘bail-in’, that is, the administrative power to require write-down or conversion into equity of non-equity claims – a significant regime change to deal with banks failing or likely to fail. This paper focuses on the implications of this regime change for consumer/investor protection, especially for socially more vulnerable households, and on the resulting risk for political acceptance and the achievement of the bail-in objective. Therefore, it reviews these rules and their application in recent cases, focusing on the treatment of retail bond holders. Moreover, it explores the distribution of retail holders of bank bonds across economy-wide income quantiles in the euro area and various euro area countries. We find that neither the share of below-medianincome households with bank bonds in the total number of households with bank bonds nor the relative vulnerability to ‘bail-in’ of these households that tend to have higher levels of financial illiterateness are negligible. Recent applications of bail-in-rules, while diverse with respect to legal basis, scope and purpose, have barely gone beyond the write-down and conversion of capital instruments, thus excluding senior bonds. Nevertheless, in all these cases, some sort of compensation scheme for retail investors was deemed necessary and implemented, varying in design, but mostly benefiting almost all retail holders. In two prominent cases there was no effective bail-in of retail holders. In conclusion, following a lesser-known example from Italy, we propose EU harmonized partial compensation rules for socially more vulnerable retail holders of bank debt securities acquired before 2016. They would render implementation of bail-in socially more acceptable, politically more feasible and economically more efficient. During the transition period until household investment behaviour will have fully adjusted to the new world of bail-in, the proposed compensation rules would help avoid effective non-application of bail-in that otherwise results from excluding senior bonds and/or granting excessive compensation.
H81|Strategic Intertemporal Budget Allocation of Local Governments in the Model with Spillovers and Mergers|Mergers of local governments, commonly referred to as municipal mergers, have been implemented widely to internalize spillover effects. Many empirical studies point out that municipalities strategically increase their debt issuance before mergers, creating the `fiscal common pool problem', because of pooled budgets after mergers. However,this phenomenon has not yet been analyzed theoretically. Therefore, this paper examines the mechanism of increased debt issuance before municipal mergers. Our results show that three different effects influence intertemporal budget allocations of municipalities at the time of a merger and the existence of externalities may reduce the severity of the fiscal common pool problem.
H81|Creative Accounting and Municipal Mergers -A Theoretical and Empirical Approach-|This study investigates what causes governments to use creative accounting. It is difficult to grasp the mechanism of creative accounting and show its existence. This is because, although creative accounting is seemingly closely tied with increases in debt, whether creative accounting is a cause or result of the debt increase is ambiguous and finding the occurrence of creative accounting is not easy. However,by focusing on municipal mergers in Japan in the 2000s, we clarify that the incentive to increase debt causes the use of creative accounting and show the existence of creative accounting, theoretically and empirically. Our theoretical model shows that a government with a stronger incentive to increase debt rationally employs creative accounting more fiercely and that an improvement in fiscal transparency reduces both the use of creative accounting and the deficit amount. Corresponding to this finding,by using a difference-in-difference analysis and data on Japanese municipal mergers, we show that municipalities with a stronger incentive to increase debt tend to employ creative accounting.
H81|Multinational Banks in Regulated Markets: Is Financial Integration Desirable?|We set up a two-country, regional model of trade in financial services. Competitive firms in each country manufacture non-traded consumer goods in an uncertain productive environment, borrowing funds from a bank in either the home or the foreign market. Duopolistic banks can choose their levels of monitoring of firms and thus the levels of risk-taking, where the risk of bank failure is partly borne by taxpayers in the banks\' home countries. Moreover, each bank chooses the allocation of its lending between domestic and foreign firms, while the bank\'s overall loan volume is fixed by a capital requirement set optimally in its home country. In this setting we consider two types of financial integration. A reduction in the compliance costs of cross-border banking reduces aggregate output and increases risk-taking, thus harming consumers and taxpayers in both countries. In contrast, a reduction in the costs of screening foreign firms is likely to be eneficial for banks, consumers, and taxpayers alike.
H81|Public Debt Frontier. A toolkit for analyzing fiscal policy and debt sustainability|This paper provides a twofold contribution. First, it proposes a synthetic and visual indicator to assess public debt sustainability. This indicator summarizes in a single diagram the linkage between economic activity, government’s budget, and the maximum amount of public debt that is sustainable in the long run. The backing theory is a neoclassical growth model augmented with endogenous tax revenues, disaggregated public spending, different production technologies for public and private goods, non-atomistic wage setters in public labor (unions), and a fully specified maturity curve for public bonds. The second contribution of the paper is to develop and present a stand-alone software that analyzes public debt sustainability in response to variations of fiscal policy. This toolkit is useful for managing public debt or to place an additional constraint on government’s budget. We provide an example of its usage for the emblematic case of Greece during the last public debt crisis.
H81|Hazard Analysis on Public–Private Partnership Projects in Developing Asia|Developing Asia’s infrastructure gap results from both inadequate public resources and a lack of effective channel to mobilize private resources toward desired outcomes. The public–private partnership (PPP) mechanism has evolved to fill the infrastructure gap. However, PPP projects are often at risk of becoming distressed or worst being terminated because of the long-term nature of contracts and the many different stakeholders involved. This paper applies survival time hazard analysis to estimate how project-related, macroeconomic, and institutional factors affect the hazard rate of the projects. Empirical results show that government’s provision of guarantees, involvement of multilateral development banks, and existence of a dedicated PPP unit are important for a project’s success. Privately initiated proposals should be regulated and undergo a competitive bidding to reduce the hazard rate of the project and the corresponding burden to government. Economic growth leads to successful project outcomes. Improved legal and institutional environment can ensure PPP success.
H81|Rationale and Institution for Public–Private Partnerships|Private–public partnership (PPP) methods are considered to be an effective way to narrow the gap between demand and supply of social infrastructure. If successfully pursued, PPP can deliver benefits to users, governments, and the private sector, or the so-called triple wins. Enhancing efficiency by reducing cost and time overruns is beneficial to users and governments, and better quality of service is expected via PPP. It will also examine the factors that have been important for shaping the county’s PPP landscape, including fiscal soundness, unsolicited project proposals, and the refinancing and renegotiation of PPPs. PPPs are not a must-have solution but an option for building and upgrading infrastructure. In conclusion, PPPs are being promoted because it can mobilize needed resources from the private sector, maximize value for money, bring creativity and efficiency to a project, and be a source of fiscal stimulus. That said, countries should be clear on why they are promoting the PPP modality for infrastructure.
H81|Traditional Procurement versus Public–Private Partnership: A Comparison of Procurement Modalities Focusing on Bundling Contract Effects|This paper studies the optimal structure of procurement contracts between public and private sectors by mainly comparing two typical procurement types: traditional procurement and public–private partnership (PPP). We first set up a principal–agent model focusing on bundling effects of procurement based on Hart (2003), and Iossa and Martimort (2015) to see under which conditions PPP has advantages over traditional procurement and vice versa. Then, we consider if the Republic of Korea’s PPP structure in practice is well designed to maximize efficiency regarding the theoretical model. By reviewing the data on major investors and equity transactions of the Republic of Korea’s PPP projects, we show that the bundling effects of PPP contracts, which is one of the main sources of efficiency, is limited under the current economic and political environment and derive policy implications for developing countries implementing PPP projects in the region.
H81|Risk Mitigation and Sovereign Guarantees for Public–Private Partnerships in Developing Economies|Public–private partnerships (PPPs) face a range of challenges in developed economies, such as appropriate risk sharing, attracting the right sponsors, and ensuring quality of service. As a large percentage of ADB’s developing member countries are considered risky borrowers by international standards, sovereign risks play an important role in predicting the number of PPPs as well as the size of investment commitments. To catalyze PPPs in developing economies with higher risk ratings, sovereign risk mitigation is often needed. This article explores how country and sovereign risks deter private investors, solutions provided by multilateral development banks to reduce these risks, and policy implications for employing these solutions.
H81|Determinants Of Loan And Bad Loan Dynamics: Evidence From Italy|In this paper we describe the dynamics of Loans and Bad Loans in the Italian Non-Financial Sector during the period 1998:4 to 2014:4. We use a Factor Model approach to take into account all of the macroeconomic fac- tors that could a ect the cyclical dynamics of the credit market, and we try to capture the causal e ect of di erent variables at quarterly frequency, tak- ing into account the structural break of the Great Recession. We reach two main conclusions: rst, our evidence con rms the well-known negative rela- tion between GDP variation and Bad Loan ows, and moreover shows a strong infra-annual Bad Loan reaction triggered by a GDP shock within a period of six months. Second, if we correctly remove structural economic factors we nd that New Bad Loan Entry rate cause Loan variations. These facts are useful in formulating some policy conclusions.
H81|Die EU-Insolvenzrichtlinie zu vorinsolvenzlichen Verfahren aus ordnungspolitischer Perspektive<BR>[The EU directive on preventive restructuring frameworks from a ordoliberal perspective]|Das Papier analysiert die EU-Richtlinie zum vorinsolvenzlichen Verfahren (2016/0359 (COD)) vor dem Hintergrund der anhaltend lockeren Geldpolitik aus ordnungspolitischer Perspektive. Es wird gezeigt, dass die Voraussetzungen geschaffen werden, durch strategische Kreditvergabe an Unternehmen im vorinsolvenzlichen Verfahren auf Kosten anderer Gläubiger auf Bewertungsgewinne durch Insolvenz zu spekulieren. Zudem kann in einem Umfeld zunehmender Zombifizierung die Haftung von wirtschaftlich schwachen Unternehmen auf Kosten von leistungsfähigen Unternehmen und Banken aufgeweicht werden. Aus ordnungspolitischer Sicht ist die Richtlinie deshalb kritisch zu betrachten.
H81|Debt holder monitoring and implicit guarantees: Did the BRRD improve market discipline?|This paper argues that the introduction of the Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) improved market discipline in the European bank market for unsecured debt. The different impact of the BRRD on bank bonds provides a quasi-natural experiment that allows to study the effect of the BRRD within banks using a difference-in-difference approach. Identification is based on the fact that (otherwise identical) bonds of a given bank maturing before 2016 are explicitly protected from BRRD bail-in. The empirical results are consistent with the hypothesis that debt holders actively monitor banks and that the BRRD diminished bail-out expectations. Bank bonds subject to BRRD bail-in carry a 10 basis points bail-in premium in terms of the yield spread. While there is some evidence that the bail-in premium is more pronounced for non-GSIB banks and banks domiciled in peripheral European countries, weak capitalization is the main driver.
H81|Saving Soviet Science: The Impact of Grants When Government R&D Funding Disappears|I estimate the impact of a historic grant program, funded by George Soros, that provided grants to over 28,000 Soviet scientists shortly after the end of the USSR. Exploiting a discontinuity in the grant eligibility formula, I show that the grants more than doubled publications on the margin, significantly induced scientists to remain in the science sector, and had long-lasting impacts. While existing evidence shows negligible impacts of scientific grants, I show that funding for science can have high marginal returns when funding levels are low relative to the stock of human capital.
H81|Burning money? Government lending in a credit crunch|We analyze a small, new credit facility of a Spanish state-owned-bank during the crisis, using its continuous credit scoring system, firm-level scores, and credit register data. Compared to privately-owned banks, the state-owned bank faces worse applicants, softens (tightens) its credit supply to unobserved (observable) riskier firms, and has much higher defaults. In a regression discontinuity design, the supply of public credit causes: large positive real effects to financially-constrained firms (whose relationship banks reduced substantially credit supply); crowding-in of new private-bank credit; and positive spillovers to other firms. Private returns of the credit facility are negative, while social returns are positive.
H81|Quality enhancements in Government Finance Statistics since the introduction of the euro - Econometric evidence|This paper reviews the development of the quality of the main fiscal data released through the Excessive Deficit Procedures (EDP) since the euro's introduction. As such, this paper presents the outcome of various econometric tests based on all the vintages of the annual main fiscal data (deficit, change in debt) to assess whether qualitative progress took place over the years. Sound Government Financial Statistics (GFS) data are indeed crucial in the context of the fiscal surveillance carried out in the EU. Therefore, we find it useful to carry out a study responding to former criticisms which pointed out that Member States were beautifying their fiscal data and especially their first notified deficit. It was often assumed that Member States could abuse the initial recording of components which bridge the deficit to the change in debt (the so-called deficit-debt adjustments components). To assess this qualitative development properly, the study goes beyond the simple description of the revisions. It proposes innovative ways to identify whether each step of the revision is caused by the upward change in deficit. The study also seeks to better identify the datasets which triggered the qualitative progress observed. JEL Classification: H81, M48
H81|A structural model to study the bail-out process in a bank and its macro-prudential policy implications|In this paper, we construct a structural model to determine the costs of a bank rescue considering bail-outs and bail-ins. In our model, a government assumes the equity stake under unlimited liability upon abandonment of the original equity holders. The model determines an abandonment trigger such that if total income drops below this trigger, private shareholders abandon the bank. Given this trigger, the model also determines the bank rescue costs, the expected time to the bank rescue and the bank rescue probabilities. A static analysis of our model produces several empirically testable hypotheses. The model was explored in a sample of southern European countries considering alternative assumptions regarding parameter estimates and the behavior of operational costs. The model results regarding the rescue costs are reasonable, but the model also predicts bank rescues, estimates equity values, performs welfare analyses and estimates the impact of different macro- and micro-prudential policies. The empirical exercise we present, highlights the importance of the assumptions made regarding the behavior of the operational costs by showing dramatic differences in results in a sample of countries that otherwise appear to share important cultural and geographical proximities.

H81|Balance Sheet Approach for Fiscal Sustainability in Indonesia|This paper models fiscal sustainability in Indonesia using the measure of liabilities-to-asset ratio (LAR), a simple measure of a country’s balanced-sheet. It uses the approach of conditional value-at-risk (VaR), assuming normal or t distributions, to define the risky level. The conditional standard deviation in the conditional VaR is modeled using a univariate generalized autoregressive heteroscedasticity (GARCH) family model. The conditional mean equation is modeled using a simple autoregressive equation. Using quarterly data from 1990 to 2014, the paper finds that the autoregressive term significantly influences the conditional mean of LAR. It also finds that both ARCH and GARCH terms significantly influence the conditional variance. Applying the conditional variance to calculate conditional VaR with 95% confidence level, and comparing the result with the actual LAR, it finds that there are no violations occurred during the period of estimation. This means that the fiscal sustainability in Indonesia is deemed safe. The violation occurs using the confidence level of 90% only.
H81|The value of government ownership during the global financial crisis|This paper examines the value of government ownership in Europe during the global financial crisis. This crisis was an exogenous shock for European firms, which allows us to observe an out-of-equilibrium effect on the costs and benefits of government ownership. Using a comprehensive sample of 4737 listed firms in 28 European countries over the period 2005–2009, we find that firms with government ownership experienced a smaller reduction in firm value than firms without government ownership. This effect was driven by firms located in countries where the risk of expropriation by the government is lower, that is, countries with less corruption and better investor protection.
H81|Fiscal and other rules in EU economic governance: helpful, largely irrelevant or unenforceable?|EU Member States, particularly in the euro area, have been pushed to adopt more extensive and intrusive fiscal rules, but,what is the evidence that the rules are succeeding?. The EU level Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) has been – and remains – the most visible rule-book, but it has been complemented by a profusion of national rules and by new provisions on other sources of macroeconomic imbalance. Much of the analysis of rules has concentrated on their technical merits, but tends to neglect the political economy of compliance. This paper examines the latter looking at compliance with fiscal rules at EU and Member State levels, and at the rules-based mechanisms for curbing other macroeconomic imbalances. It concludes that politically driven implementation and enforcement shortcomings have been given too little attention, putting at risk the integrity and effectiveness of the rules.
H81|"The Effects of the 1930s HOLC ""Redlining"" Maps"|In the wake of the Great Depression, the Federal government created new institutions such as the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) to stabilize housing markets. As part of that effort, the HOLC created residential security maps for over 200 cities to grade the riskiness of lending to neighborhoods. We trace out the effects of these maps over the course of the 20th and into the early 21st century by linking geocoded HOLC maps to both Census and modern credit bureau data. Our analysis looks at the difference in outcomes between residents living on a lower graded side versus a higher graded side of an HOLC boundary within highly close proximity to one another. We compare these differences to counterfactual boundaries using propensity score and other weighting procedures. In addition, we exploit borders that are least likely to have been endogenously drawn. We find that areas that were the lower graded side of HOLC boundaries in the 1930s experienced a marked increase in racial segregation in subsequent decades that peaked around 1970 before beginning to decline. We also find evidence of a long-run decline in home ownership, house values, and credit scores along the lower graded side of HOLC borders that persists today. We document similar long-run patterns among both redlined and non-redlined neighborhoods and, in some important outcomes, show larger and more lasting effects among the latter. Our results provide strongly suggestive evidence that the HOLC maps had a causal and persistent effect on the development of neighborhoods through credit access.
H81|Selecting Primal Innovations in DSGE models|"DSGE models are typically estimated assuming the existence of certain primal shocks that drive macroeconomic fluctuations. We analyze the consequences of estimating shocks that are ""non-existent"" and propose a method to select the primal shocks driving macroeconomic uncertainty. Forcing these non-existing shocks in estimation produces a downward bias in the estimated internal persistence of the model. We show how these distortions can be reduced by using priors for standard deviations whose support includes zero. The method allows us to accurately select primal shocks and estimate model parameters with high precision. We revisit the empirical evidence on an industry standard medium-scale DSGE model and find that government and price markup shocks are innovations that do not generate statistically significant dynamics."
H81|The Mortgage Rate Conundrum|We document the emergence of a disconnect between mortgage and Treasury interest rates in the summer of 2003. Following the end of the Federal Reserve expansionary cycle in June 2003, mortgage rates failed to rise according to their historical relationship with Treasury yields, leading to significantly and persistently easier mortgage credit conditions. We uncover this phenomenon by analyzing a large dataset with millions of loan-level observations, which allows us to control for the impact of varying loan, borrower and geographic characteristics. These detailed data also reveal that delinquency rates started to rise for loans originated after mid 2003, exactly when mortgage rates disconnected from Treasury yields and credit became relatively cheaper.
H81|Student loan relief programs: implications for borrowers and the federal government|As college costs increase and more students fund their education through borrowing, debt load and delinquency rates have become significant problems on a number of levels. Student loan obligations are challenging to manage for new graduates with lower earnings and borrowers in financial hardship. This paper discusses the federal student loan repayment relief programs that are available and estimates their borrower and fiscal impacts. The implications of relief plans on borrowers’ costs and the federal budget vary for different loan amounts, income levels, and relief program. {{p}} It is challenging for policymakers to design programs that adequately balance the risks between borrowers and taxpayers. Existing programs are also tremendously complicated, making it difficult for borrowers to make informed decisions on repayment programs. This paper examines how the various programs work in practice and considers their likely outcomes over a set of income-debt-program scenarios to bring much needed clarity to the repayment environment. In our analysis, lower-income borrowers and borrowers who will have significant remaining balance forgiven at the end of the required repayment period are generally more likely to benefit from student loan relief programs, but participation of these borrowers can be very costly from a fiscal perspective.
H81|European cooperative R&D and firm performance: Evidence based on funding differences in key actions|The Framework programmes created by the European Union are the main financial tools used to support cooperative R&D activities in the EU. Unlike previous empirical studies, this paper suggests that their impact on firms’ competitiveness is significant. We analyze industry-oriented research joint ventures supported by the Fifth European Framework Programme between 1998 and 2002. A key feature of this Programme is that funding is available to the firms based on social and economic concerns instead of pure performance criteria, which guarantees that financial support is not granted conditional on technological opportunities. This allows us to identify the causal effect of the programme on firms’ performance using the funding available to the firms in their respective industries as a source of exogenous variation in the decision to participate in the programme. Our results suggest that participation in research projects may raise labor productivity by at least 44.4% while it has very limited effect on profit margin.
H81|From fixed to state-dependent duration in public-private partnerships|A government delegates a build-operate-transfer project to a private OÌˆrm. In the contracting stage, the operating cost is unknown. The OÌˆrm can increase the likelihood of facing a low cost, rather than a high cost, by exerting costly eÂ§ort when building the infrastructure. Once this is in place, the OÌˆrm learns the true cost and begins to operate. We show that, under limited commitment, if the break-up of the partnership is suÂ¢ciently costly to the government and/or information problems are suÂ¢ciently severe, the contract is not robust to renegotiation unless it has a longer duration when the realized cost is low. This result is at odds with the prescription of the literature on aÌ exible-term contracts, which recommends a longer duration when operating conditions are unfavourable.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H81|Regional Effects of Publicly Sponsored R&D Grants on SME Performance|This paper explores regional variation in the effects of publicly sponsored R&D grants on SME performance. The results suggest that there is no guarantee that the grants will impact firm growth, either positive or negative. Studying the heterogeneity of the results, positive growth effects are most likely to be found for publicly sponsored R&D grants targeting SMEs located in regions abundant with skilled labor, whereas the opposite is found for SMEs located in regions with a limited supply of skilled workers.

H81|Students in Distress: Labor Market Shocks, Student Loan Default, and Federal Insurance Programs|The collapse in home prices during the Great Recession triggered a sharp drop in consumer demand by households, leading to massive employment losses. This paper examines the implications of these labor market shocks for the dramatic rise in student loan defaults, which originated during this time period. Linking administrative student loan data at the individual borrower level to de-identified tax records and exploiting Zip code level variation in home price changes, we show that the drop in home prices during the Great Recession accounts for approximately 24 to 32 percent of the increase in student loan defaults. Consistent with a labor market channel, we find a strong relationship between home prices, employment losses, and student loan defaults at the individual borrower level, which is concentrated among low income jobs. Comparing the default responses of home owners and renters, we find no evidence of a direct liquidity effect of home prices on student loan defaults. Lastly, we show that the Income Based Repayment (IBR) program introduced by the federal government in the wake of the Great Recession reduced both student loan defaults and their sensitivity to home price fluctuations, thus providing student loan borrowers with valuable insurance against adverse income shocks.
H81|Rescuing the Financial System: Capabilities, Incentives, and Optimal Interbank Networks| I model bank rescues in a setting where banks hold each otherâ€™s financial instruments, creating a network of financial linkages. Costly bankruptcies reduce interbank payments, which creates incentives for rescues by other banks. I show that the governmentâ€™s bail-out costs are minimized if regulators promote financial networks that are evenly connected and have intermediate levels of interbank liabilities but interestingly have low diversification at the bank level. Such networks maximize banksâ€™ contributions to the rescue of a distressed bank hit by a relatively small negative shock, but also ensure that banks do not fail sequentially like dominos when a bank hit by a large shock does actually fail. The results also provide a rationale for why some systemically important banks such as Lehman Brothers or Washington Mutual were not rescued in 2007-2008. In the model, a welfare-maximizing government assists the rescues designed to prevent domino failures and maintain financial stability instead of assisting the rescue of a bank that is hit by a large shock.
H81|Logic Models: Strengths and Weaknesses in the Context of Programmes Funded by the European Union|The main objective of the study is to provide opportunities for improvement of the logical model used in the European Union (EU) programming. The study provides an overview of the varieties of logical models, which starts with basic logic models, gradually increasing their complexity. The analysis identifies strengths and weaknesses of the models as well as their application by the European Commission (EC). In view of the identified deficiencies, the study proposes a new model that takes into account the bidirectional links between the elements of the logic model and the possible impact of external factors on each element of the model. The proposed model also includes additional elements that take into account the need for application of the outputs/results; the general objectives of a program, and best practices. Even the partial implementation of the proposed model in this study, allows the identification of weaknesses in the EU programming. In this case, they consist of: too general objectives; weak link between indicators and targets; disregard of prior experience (best practices) and lack of consideration of the general objectives.
H81|The role of public debt managers in contingent liability management|Contingent liabilities are major sources of fiscal risks due to the uncertain financial commitments they involve. Their effective management, therefore, is essential for increasing stability and predictability in public finance. This paper explores the role of public debt managers in contingent liability management based on the results of a background OECD survey and the information provided by seven task force countries. The results indicate that there are certain roles and responsibilities assumed by the public debt managers in this field, while the degree of involvement differs widely across countries. We also observed that the debt management offices’ (DMOs) involvement is more prominent in the management of government credit guarantees, while contingent liabilities arising from Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) and government sponsored insurance programmes appear to be outside the domain of public debt managers in most cases. Drawing on leading country practices and lessons from the past, this paper advises public debt managers on possible motives and areas of involvement.
H81|Fortune or fortitude? Determinants of successful adjustment with IMF programs|Full adjustment programs in the wake of crisis episodes exact a major toll on a country’s economy, yet not all are blessed with success.We identify adjustment needs by a country’s decision to approach the IMF for official assistance.We then investigate the factors conducive to successful exit from official assistance during more than 170 adjustment episodes by means of a panel regression framework. In contrast to the existing literature, we do not use absolute benchmarks. We define success as a resumption of real GDP growth and a reduction of government debt compared to the pre-program period. Our econometric results suggest stringent policy action do play a role for the probability of success. At the same time, we also find that successful exit also very much depends on supportive external conditions and, linked to that, the degree of openness of an economy.

H81|Managing disaster-related contingent liabilities in public finance frameworks|Natural disasters have caused, and continue to cause, a significant amount of economic costs. The costs of disasters are often, and to a large extent, shouldered by governments, especially in economies where private insurance markets are not well developed. Governments are asked to provide financing for explicit commitments made prior to a disaster, and are often under pressure to make payments for which no such commitments were made earlier. Ex-post costs to governments take the form of contingent liabilities within national budgeting and government balance sheet frameworks. Disasters can thereby cause both downside risks to government revenue as well as to expenditure. There is little evidence, and hence limited policy advice, on how disaster-related contingent liabilities are managed by governments. This paper sets out to clarify the concept of contingent liabilities and the channels through which they can impact government balance sheets, including fiscal risks. It provides a framework for identifying and quantifying disaster-related contingent liabilities with a view to inform country case studies for comparative policy analysis.
H81|Distributional Implications of Government Guarantees in Mortgage Markets|We analyze the removal of the credit-risk guarantees provided by the government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) in a model with agents heterogeneous in income and house price risk. We find that wealth inequality increases, driven by higher mortgage spreads and housing rents. Housing holdings become more concentrated. Foreclosures fall. The removal benefits high-income households, while hurting low- and mid-income households (renters and highly leveraged mortgagors with conforming loans). GSE reform requires compensating transfers, sufficiently high elasticity of rental supply, or linking GSE reform with the elimination of the mortgage interest deduction.
H81|Public Support to Business R&D and the Economic Crisis: Spanish Evidence|"The objective of the present study is to compare the effect of public support of business R&D on technological inputs and outputs before and during the recent economic crisis. To do so, we use information provided by the Centre for the Development for Industrial Technology (CDTI), which is the main public agency in Spain that grants financial aid of its own to companies for the execution of R&D projects. Specifically, we consider firms supported through CDTI programmes for periods the 2002-2005 and 2010-2012. Impact assessment is conducted using ""matching"" techniques. Our preliminary results suggest that, during the crisis, public support continued to have positive effects on the resources devoted to R&D activities, and also increased the technological outputs obtained from these resources."
H81|Fiscal and Other Rules in EU Economic Governance: Helpful, Largely Irrelevant or Unenforceable?|EU Member States, particularly in the Euro Area, have been pushed to adopt more extensive and intrusive fiscal rules, but what is the evidence that the rules are succeeding? The EU level Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) has been â€“ and remains â€“ the most visible rule-book, but it has been complemented by a profusion of national rules and by new provisions on other sources of macroeconomic imbalance. Much of the analysis of rules has concentrated on their technical merits, but tends to neglect the political economy of compliance. This paper examines the latter, looking at compliance with fiscal rules at EU and Member State levels and at the rules-based mechanisms for curbing other macroeconomic imbalances. It concludes that politically driven implementation and enforcement shortcomings have been given too little attention, putting at risk the integrity and effectiveness of the rules.

H81|Assessing the effect of public funding on private innovation investment in Uruguay|Despite the recent research efforts and methodological improvements, empirical evidence on the additionality effects of public innovation programs shows heterogeneous results by firm, sector, country and type of innovation. This paper assesses input additionality of public funding on private innovative investment of Uruguayan firms by applying a longitudinal analysis from 2001 to 2012. During this period, there was a dramatic increase of public innovation funds. However, the number of innovative firms remains stable and the amount of public funding for innovation at firm level is still very low. In this context, previous innovation experience appears as the most significant determinant of access to public innovation support. Moreover, we find evidence of a moderate substitution effect between public and private funds. We analyzed heterogeneous effects according to type of innovation, finding significant effects only for innovation based on acquisition of artifacts (embodied). We conclude on the main challenges of the current policy mix in Uruguay, stressing the relevance of further research lines on behavioral additionality to contribute to improve policy results.
H81|Burning Money? Government Lending in a Credit Crunch|We analyze a small, new credit facility of a Spanish state-owned-bank during the crisis, using its continuous credit scoring system, firm-level scores, and credit register data. Compared to privately-owned banks, the state-owned bank faces worse applicants, softens (tightens) its credit supply to unobserved (observable) riskier firms, and has much higher defaults. In a regression discontinuity design, the supply of public credit causes: large positive real effects to financially-constrained firms (whose relationship banks reduced substantially credit supply); crowding-in of new private-bank credit; and positive spillovers to other firms. Private returns of the credit facility are negative, while social returns are positive.
H81|The economic and fiscal value of German guarantee banks|Guarantee banks backed by the state aim to close the gap in the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises or start-ups caused by lacking collateral or equity and high information asymmetry. The present study quantifies the economic and fiscal net benefits of guarantee banks in the new federal states of Germany, where economic development is still lacking behind those in the old federal states. Using data of five guarantee banks and results from enterprise and bank surveys, we measure finance and project additionality of loan and equity guarantees provided over the period 1991-2015. Cost-benefit analyses show that the economic benefits of the guarantee banks are considerable because of increased production and employment, while the economic costs are negligible. The real GDP increases by about 1.2 euro per euro guarantee each year. In the years 2008 to 2014, there were net fiscal gains of several hundred million euros in the respective federal states.
H81|Too-Systemic-to-Fail: What Option Markets Imply about Sector-Wide Government Guarantees|We examine the pricing of financial crash insurance during the 2007-2009 financial crisis in US option markets, and we show that a large amount of aggregate tail risk is missing from the cost of financial sector crash insurance during the crisis. The difference in costs between out-of-the-money put options for individual banks and puts on the financial sector index increases four-fold from its precrisis 2003-2007 level. We provide evidence that a collective government guarantee for the financial sector lowers index put prices far more than those of individual banks and explains the increase in the basket-index put spread.
H81|Bailouts, Time Inconsistency, and Optimal Regulation: A Macroeconomic View|A common view is that bailouts of firms by governments are needed to cure inefficiencies in private markets. We propose an alternative view: even when private markets are efficient, costly bankruptcies will occur and benevolent governments without commitment will bail out firms to avoid bankruptcy costs. Bailouts then introduce inefficiencies where none had existed. Although granting the government orderly resolution powers which allow it to rewrite private contracts improves on bailout outcomes, regulating leverage and taxing size is needed to achieve the relevant constrained efficient outcome, the sustainably efficient outcome. This outcome respects governments' incentives to intervene when they lack commitment.
H81|Bailouts and the Preservation of Competition: The Case of the Federal Timber Contract Payment Modification Act|We estimate the value of competition in United States Forest Service (USFS) timber auctions, in the context of the Reagan administration's bailout of firms that faced substantial losses on existing contracts. We use a model with endogenous entry by asymmetric firms, allowing survivors to respond to the exit of bailed-out firms by entering more auctions and for these marginal entrants to have lower values than firms that would choose to enter in any event, a selective entry effect. Observed asymmetries and selective entry contribute to us finding that the bailout may have increased USFS revenues in subsequent auctions quite substantially.
H81|Public subsidies for SME research and development: Empirical evaluation of collaborative versus individual place-based programs|This paper provides novel empirical evidence on the effectiveness of regional research and innovation policies for small and medium-sized firms (SMEs). Two subsidy programs implemented at the regional level in central Italy are investigated. One program targeted firms' individual research, while the other addressed collaborative research between firms and universities. Using a matched difference-in-differences approach our empirical analysis shows a differentiated impact of the two programs. The first was successful in stimulating additional private R&D investment and, at least partially, in improving firms. performance. The second program had weaker effects, mostly restricted to R&D expenditure and employment. Otherwise, subsidized firms show a reduction in their tangible and intangible investments, thus casting doubts on the benefits of subsidies forcing R&D collaborations.
H81|How well do subnational borrowing regulations work?|There are many positive aspects associated with subnational borrowing, including additional funding and promoting intergenerational equity. However, it may also endanger fiscal sustainability and macro stability due to moral hazard and soft budget constraints, making borrowing controls justified and common. This chapter reviews the different types of ex ante and ex post subnational borrowing regulations used in the international experience based on a large panel of developed and developing countries. Each type of regulation has advantages and disadvantages, with varying suitability to a countryâ€™s circumstances. It is found that the presence of subnational tax autonomy contributes to an increase in the general government primary balance but not significantly for subnational primary balances. A history of subnational bailouts is associated with lower primary balances, on average, at all levels. The â€˜golden ruleâ€™ and limits on debt and borrowing appear effective at all levels of government. However, none of the broad types of subnational borrowing regulations seem to have a distinct significant direct effect on the narrow definition of fiscal sustainability at the subnational level.
H81|Innovative start-ups in Italy: their special features and the effects of the 2012 law|In 2012 the Italian Parliament introduced into Italian law a special section in the Companies Register and a large number of financial incentives to create a favorable environment for the development of ‘innovative start-ups’ (ISUPs). In this paper we compare ISUPs with other start-ups. In accordance with the eligibility criteria established by law, ISUPs show a striking capacity for innovation apparent in a higher incidence of intangible assets and the longer time it takes to begin selling their products. ISUPs also report higher investment rates and stronger growth in sales and assets, while their financial structures are characterized by higher capitalization and greater availability of liquid assets. Based on propensity score matching, we also highlight some direct effects of the 2012 law on their financial structures, almost exclusively on ISUPs operating in the service sectors: their external funding, either debt or equity, increases more than for other similar firms; higher investment rates are specifically associated with a stronger upsurge in their capital.
H81|Does Education Loan Debt Influence Household Financial Distress? An Assessment Using The 2007–2009 Survey Of Consumer Finances Panel|" type=""main"" xml:id=""coep12164-abs-0001""> Families with student loans in 2007 have higher levels of financial distress than families without such loans, and these families also transitioned to financial distress at higher rates during the early stages of the Great Recession. This correlation persists once we control for a host of other demographic, work-status, and household balance sheet measures. Families with an average level of student loans were 3.1 percentage points more likely to be 60 days late paying bills and 3 percentage points more likely to be denied credit. Families with other types of consumer debt were no more or less likely to be financially distressed. (JEL D14, H81, I22)"
H81|Do politicians reward core supporters? Evidence from a discretionary grant program|We investigate whether politicians award intergovernmental grants to core supporters. Our new dataset contains information on discretionary project grants from a German state government to municipalities over the period 2008–2011. The results show that discretionary grants were awarded to municipalities with many core supporters of the incumbent state government. Discretionary grants per capita increased by about 1.4 percent when the vote share of the incumbent party in the state election increased by one percentage point. The fiscal capacity of a municipality does, by contrast, not predict the level of discretionary grants. We propose to trim discretionary project grants to the benefit of formula-based grants.
H81|Cross-Border Banking in Regulated Markets: Is Financial Integration Desirable?|We set up a two-country, regional model of trade in financial services. Competitive firms in each country manufacture untraded consumer goods in an uncertain productive environment, borrowing funds from a bank in either the home or the foreign market. Duopolistic banks can choose their levels of monitoring of firms and thus the levels of risk-taking, where the risk of bank failure is partly borne by taxpayers in the banks’ home countries. Moreover, each bank chooses the share of its lending allocated between domestic and foreign firms, but the bank’s overall loan volume is fixed by a capital requirement set optimally in its home country. In this setting we consider two types of financial integration. A reduction in the transaction costs of cross-border banking reduces aggregate output and increases risk-taking, thus harming consumers and taxpayers in both countries. In contrast, a reduction in the costs of screening foreign firms is likely to be beneficial for banks, consumers, and taxpayers alike.
H81|Multilateral Loans and Interest Rates: Further Evidence on the Seniority Conundrum| During Europe's sovereign debt crisis, interest rate spreads have been highly correlated with the share of multilateral loans that were considered senior to private markets. As both variables are potentially endogenous, we follow 2 different approaches to analyze the direction of causality. First, we use a set of instrumental variable regressions where the differences between sovereign ratings serve as instruments. Second, we analyze a new panel survey dataset on seniority and interest rate expectations. In both approaches, we find evidence for the seniority conundrum, that is, a positive impact of multilateral loans on interest rate spreads.
H81|The Collateral Framework of the Eurosystem and Its Fiscal Implications|"Die vorliegende Arbeit wurde von Jakob Eberl während seiner Tätigkeit als Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter am Center for Economic Studies (CES) an der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) München erstellt. Sie wurde im Dezember 2015 abgeschlossen und von der Volkswirtschaftlichen Fakultät der LMU München als Dissertation angenommen. Die Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit dem Sicherheitenrahmen des Eurosystems und dessen fiskalischen Implikationen. Sie umfasst sieben Kapitel (ohne Einleitung und Schluss), die in zwei Teile gegliedert werden können. Der erste Teil beinhaltet die Kapitel 2 bis 5 und analysiert den Sicherheitenrahmen des Eurosystems. Kapitel 2 gibt eine Einführung in die Entwicklung der Geldpolitik des Eurosystems während der Finanz- und Staatsschuldenkrise. Die Pfänderkriterien des Eurosystems werden dabei als essentiell für das Umsetzen dieser Geldpolitik identifiziert. Kapitel 3 präsentiert eine umfassende Analyse der im Sicherheitenrahmen des Eurosystems verankerten Pfänderkriterien, indem es eine narrative Datenbank von allgemeinen Prinzipien und Änderungen erstellt. Darüber hinaus werden Effekte von Änderungen der Pfänderkriterien auf die notenbankfähigen Sicherheiten („Sicherheitenpool"") hinsichtlich verschiedener Aspekte herausgearbeitet. Kapitel 4 beschäftigt sich mit der Risikokontrolle des Eurosystems und legt dar, wie diese in den vergangenen Jahren angepasst wurde. Ferner werden Schwächen der Risikokontrolle aufgezeigt. Kapitel 5 untersucht Effekte der Pfänderkriterien und der Risikokontrolle, indem es die Entwicklung der Bonität der dem Eurosystem verpfändeten Sicherheiten nachvollzieht. Das innerhalb dieses Kapitels erarbeitete Modell zeigt, dass Banken Sicherheiten minderer Qualität dem Eurosystem verpfänden, während qualitativ hochwertige Sicherheiten am Markt genutzt werden („adverse Selektion von Pfändern""). Der zweite Teil der Dissertation umfasst die Kapitel 6 bis 8 und untersucht die fiskalischen Implikationen des Sicherheitenrahmens. Kapitel 6 entwickelt das Instrumentarium zur Analyse der fiskalischen Implikationen, welche vor dem Hintergrund der fiskalischen Tragfähigkeit durchgeführt wird. Das Erweitern des Konzepts der fiskalischen Tragfähigkeit um Unsicherheit ermöglicht das Formulieren eines intuitiven Indikators zur Beurteilung der fiskalischen Implikationen. Kapitel 7 untersucht die fiskalische Implikation, die aus der Bedeutung dieser Kriterien für die finanzielle Lage einer Notenbank und der engen Verbindung zwischen dieser finanziellen Lage und dem Staatshaushalt resultiert. Das Kapitel bestimmt ein aus fiskalischer Sicht optimales Niveau der Pfänderkriterien und zeigt, dass einheitliche Pfänderkriterien in einer Währungsunion aus heterogenen Staaten länderübergreifende fiskalische Implikationen bergen. Kapitel 8 adressiert die fiskalische Implikation, die aus der Bedeutung der Kriterien für den Anreiz eines Staates explizite Garantien auszusprechen, resultieren. Das Kapitel zeigt, dass der Sicherheitenrahmen des Eurosystems Spielraum für Staaten birgt, notenbankfähige Sicherheiten durch explizite Garantien zu schaffen. Dieser Spielraum muss berücksichtigt werden, wenn das aus fiskalischer Sicht optimale Niveau expliziter Staatsgarantien bestimmt wird. Abschließend schlägt die Dissertation auf Basis der gewonnenen Ergebnisse Verbesserungen der im Sicherheitenrahmen des Eurosystems verankerten Pfänderkriterien und Risikokontrolle vor."
H81|Personal der öffentlichen Verwaltung in Nordrhein-Westfalen: Entwicklungen und Handlungsoptionen zur Neustrukturierung|In dem Gutachten werden ein Überblick der Personalausgaben und der Personalstruktur des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen gegeben und Handlungsoptionen für die Personalpolitik des Landes abgeleitet. Im Jahr 2012 stellten die direkten und indirekten Personalausgaben in Nordrhein-Westfalen (NRW) 43% der Gesamtausgaben des Landes und 28% der Gesamtausgaben aller Gemeinden dar. Organisatorische und haushaltstechnische Veränderungen, insbesondere die Ausgliederung öffentlicher Aufgaben aus dem Kernhaushalt, erschweren eine transparente Erfassung der Ausgaben. Wegen der Ausgliederungen, Kostenvorteile aufgrund der hohen Bevölkerungszahl und einem hohen Kommunalisierungsgrad lagen die direkten Personalausgaben des Landes NRW im Jahr 2012 mit 1.220 Euro pro Kopf unter dem Durchschnitt der westdeutschen Bundesländer, während die Ausgaben der Gemeinden mit 651 Euro pro Kopf über dem Durchschnitt lagen.
H81|How Successful Was the New Deal? The Microeconomic Impact of New Deal Spending and Lending Policies in the 1930s|The New Deal during the 1930s was arguably the largest peace-time expansion in federal government activity in American history. Until recently, there had been very little quantitative testing of the microeconomic impact of the wide variety of New Deal programs. Over the past decade scholars have developed new panel databases for counties, cities, and states and then used panel data methods on them to examine the impact of New Deal spending and lending policies for the major New Deal programs. In most cases, the identification of the effect comes from changes across time within the same geographic location after controlling for national shocks to the economy. Many of the studies also use instrumental variable methods to control for endogeneity. The studies find that public works and relief spending had state income multipliers of around one, increased consumption activity, attracted internal migration, reduced crime rates, and lowered several types of mortality. The farm programs typically aided large farm owners but eliminated opportunities for share croppers, tenants, and farm workers. The Home Owners' Loan Corporation's purchases and refinancing of troubled mortgages staved off drops in housing prices and home ownership rates at relatively low ex post cost to taxpayers. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation's loans to banks and railroads appear to have had little positive impact, although the banks were aided when the RFC took ownership stakes.
H81|Public Development Banks and Credit Market Imperfections|"This paper is devoted to understanding the role of public development banks in alleviating financial market imperfections. We explore two issues: 1) which types of firms should be optimally targeted by public financial support; and 2) what type of mechanism should be implemented in order to efficiently support the targeted firms' access to credit. We model firms that face moral hazard and banks that have a costly screening technology, which results in a limited access to credit for some firms. We show that a public development bank may alleviate the inefficiencies by lending to commercial banks at subsidized rates, targeting the firms that generate high added value. This may be implemented through subsidized ear-marked lending to the banks or through credit guarantees which we show to be equivalent in ""normal times"". Still, when banks are facing a liquidity shortage, lending is preferred, while when banks are undercapitalized, a credit guarantees program is best suited. This will imply that 1) there is no ""one size fits all"" intervention program and 2) that any intervention program should be fine-tuned to accommodate the characteristics of competition, collateral, liquidity and banks capitalization of each industry."
H81|Solidarity with EU Countries in Crisis: Results of a 2015 Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) Survey|In response to the European sovereign debt and currency crisis, the EU has begun to implement measures toward fiscal solidarity at least for the euro area. Survey data from the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) study show that just under half of all adults in Germany generally support providing assistance to EU countries experiencing financial difficulties. Almost one in three respondents also advocate the idea of an individual solidarity contribution for countries in crisis. In return, the majority of people in Germany expect these countries to reduce public spending and forge ahead with privatization. Only a minority call for the crisis country to make cuts in its social spending.

H81|Sovereign to Corporate Risk Spillovers|The first Greek bailout on April 11, 2010 triggered a significant reevaluation of sovereign credit risk across Europe. We exploit this event to examine the transmission of sovereign to corporate credit risk. A 10% increase in sovereign credit risk raises corporate credit risk on average by 1.1% after the bailout. The evidence is suggestive of risk spillovers from sovereign to corporate credit risk through a financial and a fiscal channel, as the effects are more pronounced for firms that are bank or government dependent. We find no support for indirect risk transmission through a deterioration of macroeconomic fundamentals.
H81|Credit risk spillover between financials and sovereigns in the euro area during 2007-2015|This paper presents time-varying contagion indices of credit risk spillover and feedback between 64 financials and sovereigns in the euro area, where spillover is identified based on bilateral Granger causality regressions.

H81|Government finances and bank bailouts: Evidence from European stock markets|Using a sample of European banks and a series of events affecting governments' finances, we conduct an event study to examine whether there is a relationship between governments' fiscal difficulties and banks' stock returns. We find a significant reaction of banks' stocks to news concerning governments' finances. Banks' stock returns fall in response to a deterioration of governments' financial situation. We find little difference in the reaction between large and small banks. The evidence points towards all banks being equally likely to be bailed out. Our data are consistent with a policy during the Eurozone sovereign-debt crisis in which “no bank is too small to save”.
H81|Qualified residential mortgages and default risk|The Dodd–Frank Act tasks regulators with defining a Qualified Residential Mortgage (QRM) as an exemption from risk retention for residential mortgage-backed securities. Congress instructs regulators to consider factors that result in lower levels of historic default in defining a QRM. We analyze non-agency loans and find credit scores and loan-to-value ratios are among the most significant predictors of default, even when controlling for risky loan products and loose underwriting standards. Importantly, credit scores and loan-to-value ratios better tradeoff the benefit of reduced default risk with the cost of limiting access to capital than most factors, yet are absent from the final QRM definition. Our results have important implications for current and future policy on residential mortgage securitization, risk retention, and disclosure.
H81|Do for-profit universities induce bad student loans?|Despite its great social and financial importance, little of the prior empirical research on student-loan default focuses on the role of for-profit universities. This study finds a positive association between student loan default and an institution's for-profit status—even when controlling for previously identified important factors, including graduation rates, the percentage of students who are low-income and from minority groups, and whether the institution is two- or four-year. Overall, my results are consistent with for-profit institutions systematically encouraging ill-advised loans. The results are economically significant, with default rates generally 5–6 percentage points higher for for-profit institutions.
H81|The life-cycle of national development banks: The experience of Brazil's BNDES|We posit a life-cycle hypothesis for the evolving role of National Development Banks (NDBs) using the case of one of the largest such institutions in the world, the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES). NDBs are a particularly important institution for channeling long-term credit in less developed financial markets. However, we argue that as countries develop their financial markets, NDBs should share this role with other local banks and specialize their focus, eventually disappearing altogether. In the Brazilian case, we show how the BNDES evolved from a purveyor of long-term credit to a more complex financial institution. The BNDES was the most important tool used by the Brazilian government as a countercyclical response to the financial crisis. For many developing countries, institutions like the BNDES may be a tenable solution for building long-term local financial institutions and markets, and developing specialized human capital. However, they also pose potential risks centered on issues of scalability, crowding out, graft and inefficiency.
H81|Capitalization of equalizing grants and the flypaper effect|The wide-ranging empirical support for the flypaper effect in local public finance remains a puzzle in spite of various theoretical explanations. We exploit a reform of the fiscal equalization system in the Netherlands to show that the resulting change in grants to municipalities was fully capitalized into local house prices. Nevertheless, only a small fraction was passed on to residents through property taxes, indicating local public service provision as the main adjustment channel. As the marginal homebuyer was apparently willing to pay for these services, capitalization makes rent seeking by local politicians or bureaucrats improbable — thus effectively ruling out one class of explanations for the flypaper effect. The absence of a significant effect on municipal staff provides further evidence against a bureaucratic flypaper effect.
H81|The impact of public support on firm propensity to engage in R&D: Spanish experience|Our objective is to estimate the effect of public low-interest loans for R&D projects on the probability of performing R&D by Spanish firms. The estimations provide evidence of the effectiveness of public low-interest loans, being the stimulus effect larger for SMEs than for large firms and also higher for manufacturing than for services. Supported firms are approximately 25 percentage points more likely to self-finance their R&D investments than non-supported firms. The effect is quite relevant if we consider that the probability of self-financing R&D activities is 53.2 percentage points higher when the firm has invested in R&D activities in the previous year. This result suggests that firms can be induced persistently to perform R&D activities by means of loans.

Second, we document, through various empirical methods, the robust findings about the striking patterns of trend and cycle. Third, we build a theoretical model that accounts for these facts. The model's mechanism and assumptions are supported by institutional details and disaggregated time series distinctive of Chinese characteristics.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
