B26|Models as Speech Acts: A Restatement and a new Case Study|The goal of this paper is to provide a methodological perspective on economic models that accounts for some sociological dimensions of economics, in two senses. Firstly, we are interested in how modeling is an activity that is constrained by the (implicit and explicit) rules underlying the accumulation of academic prestige within economics and at the same time can be a means to change these rules. Secondly, we are interested in how, for a given model, this dynamic can be influenced by the use(s) of that model outside of economics. We first provide a restatement of Brisset’s (2018) original contribution. We then put this clarified methodological perspective to work on a new case study, i.e., on the dual models at the frontier between behavioral and standard economics.
B26|Peregrinations of an Economist: Perroux's Grand Tour of Fascist Europe|This article examines Perroux's intellectual career, from the interwar period to the Vichy period, in the light of his Grand Tour of European authoritarian regimes. By assessing Perroux's singular analysis of the Italian, German, Austrian and Portuguese regimes, we will illuminate how Perroux used foreign fascist experi-ences to speak about France and the organization of Europe as a whole. Ultimate-ly, by analysis Perroux's thoughts it will enable us to develop our understanding of how the Vichy regime perceived itself, and can, thus, contribute to recent debates concerning the ideological nature—fascist or not—of the Vichy regime.
B26|CEO-Board Dynamics|We examine CEO-board dynamics using a new panel dataset that spans 1920 to 2011. The long sample allows us to perform within-firm and within-CEO tests over a long horizon, many for the first time in the governance literature. Consistent with theories of bargaining or dynamic contracting, we find board independence increases at CEO turnover and falls with CEO tenure, with the decline stronger following superior performance. CEOs are also more likely to be appointed board chair as tenure increases, and we find evidence consistent with a substitution between board independence and chair duality. Other results suggest that these classes of models fail to capture important elements of board dynamics. First, the magnitude of the CEO tenure effect is economically small, much smaller for example than the strong persistence in board structure that we document. Second, when external CEOs are hired, board independence falls and subsequently increases. Third, event studies document a positive market reaction when powerful CEOs die in office, consistent with powerful CEOs becoming entrenched.
B26|The causal relationship between short- and long-term interest rates: an empirical assessment of the United States|This paper addresses one of the central aspects of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, namely the ability of central banks to affect the structure of interest rates. To shed light on this issue, we assess the causal relationship between short- and long-term interest rates, that is, the Effective Federal Funds Rate (FF), the Moody's Seasoned Aaa Corporate Bond Yield (AAA), and the 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate (GB10Y). We apply Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) models to monthly data provided by the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). Our findings – estimated for the 1954-2018 period – outline an asymmetry in the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates. In particular, although we found a bidirectional relationship when the 10-year treasury bond GB10Y was included as the long-run rate, a unidirectional relationship that moves from short- to long-term interest rates is estimated when the interest rate on corporate bonds ranked AAA is taken into consideration. Furthermore, the conclusions drawn by the impulse response functions (IRFs) are confirmed and strengthened by the Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD) which shows that monetary policy is able to permanently affect long-term interest rates over a long temporal horizon, i.e., not only in the short run but also in the long run. In this way, following the Keynesian tradition, long-term interest rates appear to be strongly influenced by the central bank. Finally, despite the fact that the Federal Fund rate (FF) is weakly affected by long-term interest rate shocks, the estimated FEVD shows that FF is mainly determined by its own shock allowing us to assume that the central bank has a certain degree of freedom in setting the levels of short-run interest rates.
B26|Monetary Policy in Perspective Conventional Economy and Islamic Economics|This article describes the perspective of differences between monetary policy in conventional economics and Islamic economics. By using a negation approach, this study concludes that Islamic monetary policy offers an economic system that is more resistant to monetary crises because the Islamic monetary system does not use an interest rate system so that it can stabilize prices more and be able to control inflation compared to the conventional monetary system.
B26|Measuring Macroeconomic Uncertainty in Zimbabwe|What matters to economic decision-making is whether the economy has become more or less predictable. People and businesses use information around them to form judgements about what might happen in the future. The rise in uncertainty might be associated with increased concern about extreme events, skewed towards worries about bad or disastrous events. The study seeks to measure macroeconomic uncertainty in Zimbabwe, using stock market indices - industrial index and mining index - for the period 2010M1 to 2019M3. Prevalence of macroeconomic uncertainty has been traced from the stock market index trend and stock market returns volatility. The squared residuals of the GARCH(1,1) regression model proxied macroeconomic uncertainty levels. The prevalence of significant macroeconomic uncertainty has been observed, with some periods highly uncertain. The study linked periods of uncertainty to some known political, social and economic events to derive meaning. The study found that some political, social and economic events have a contributing effect on the level of macroeconomic uncertainty. Good events and policies are accompanied by low levels of uncertainty while bad events and controversial policies match with high levels of uncertainty. The study recommends that to create a good economic climate, to attract investment and boost confidence in the economy, policymakers should dwell on reducing macroeconomic uncertainty. Reducing macroeconomic uncertainty require policy consistency, policy consultations, less frequent policy changes, avoiding numerous policies, avoiding policy reversals, among other measures. The observed macroeconomic uncertainty affects proper economic decision-making and is not conducive for high levels of investment for local and international investors; companies may struggle to hire labor, and employees and corporates may delay spending and saving pattern distorted.
B26|Did the Basel Process of Capital Regulation Enhance the Resiliency of European Banks?|This paper analyses the evolution of the resiliency of the European banking sector after the implementation of the Basel Capital Accord. In particular, by analysing SRISK and CoVaR we trace systemic risk and measures of systematic risk as the Basel process unfolds. We observe that, though systematic risk for European banks have been decreasing over the last three decades, systemic risk has heightened especially for the largest systemic banks. While the Basel process has succeeded in containing systemic risk of small banks, it has been less successful for the larger institutions. The latter ones opportunistically exploited the option of self-regulation by employing internal models and effectively increasing SRISK. Hence, the sub-prime crisis found the largest and more systemic banks ill-prepared and lacking resiliency. This condition was even aggravated during the European sovereign crisis.
B26|Directional predictability and time-varying spillovers between stock markets and economic cycles|We examine the nonlinear dependence structure and causal nexus between business cycles, stock market returns and asset return volatility for the US economy. We implement two novel methodologies, namely quantile-on-quantile analysis and cross-quantilogram to account for tail dependence and spillovers across quantile ranges. We find evidence of statistically significant spillover effects from extreme equity market returns and their corresponding volatility to specific stages of business cycles. The sensitivity of returns and volatility to business cycle shocks is only evident for extreme quantiles. These findings indicate the importance of modeling the nonlinearity and tail behaviour when analyzing the relationships between equity markets and business cycles. Financial and monetary policy regulators may use the dynamics of spillover predictability and influence between the equity market returns, their volatility and business cycles to exert some degree of control upon business cycle formation and development.
B26|Keynes on the Sequencing of Economic Policy: Recovery and Reform in 1933|On December 31 1933, The New York Times published an open letter from John Maynard Keynes to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In it Keynes encouraged FDR to expand public works through government borrowing. He also criticized FDR’s exchange rate policy, and argued that there was a need for lower long-term interest rates. But perhaps the most interesting feature of this letter is that Keynes made comments on the sequencing and speed of economic policies. He argued that “recovery” policies should precede “reform” measures. In this paper I analyze this particular aspect of the open letter, and I argue that for Keynes exchange rate stability was a key component of what he considered to be the appropriate order of policy. I also provide a comparison between Keynes’s views on sequencing and those developed in the 1980s and 1990s.
B26|Time preference and savoring – how to exploit the Loewenstein contradiction|The goal of this paper is to demonstrate and analyze the contradiction between the model of time preference and the concept of savoring and thereupon outline product categories that particularly apply to each one of the preceding models. Both concepts are discussed and exemplified in order to depict the contradiction. Subsequently, the terms utilitarian and hedonic goods are introduced in order to outline useful patterns for the correct assignment of goods to each model. The definition of utilitarian goods is applied to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to show that they do particularly react to the model of time preference. Afterwards, existing knowledge about the concept of savoring is used in order to show the correlation between hedonic goods and the concept of savoring. Finally, the paper shows that companies can benefit from this categorization by either reacting to given distribution structures in terms of marketing or by identifying to which extent a certain product is perceived as utilitarian or hedonic good and correspondingly postpone or speed-up delivery.
B26|Analyzing inflation in Nigeria: a fractionally integrated ARFIMA-GARCH modelling Approach| The study looked into the stochastic properties of CPI-inflation rate for Nigeria from 1995Q1 to 2016Q4. The study employed an autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average and a general autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARFIMA-GARCH) methodology as well as ADF/KPSS to investigate the long-memory properties of CPI-Inflation for Nigeria. The study found that CPI-inflation in Nigeria is shock dissipating at a geometric rate (fast mean reverting ability). The ARFIMA-GARCH process showed that CPI inflation in Nigeria is a heteroskedastic fractionally integrated process with quick mean reverting ability. The study therefore concludes that shocks to CPI-inflation in Nigeria such as sudden hikes in prices of energy products will not cause a permanent change in general price level but will eventually return to its mean state, and therefore having an implication for the Inflation-Unemployment tradeoff of the Philips curve.
B26|Ellsberg’s Decision Rules and Keynes’s Long-Term Expectations|This paper presents an intuitive way to represent Keynes’s notion of long-term expectations and its implications for decision-making, using the so-called e-contamination approach. Further to a suggestion by Ellsberg, a coherent Keynesian expectational function for decisions under uncertainty is derived. The paper draws on the similarities between the analyses of Keynes and Ellsberg and contends that much of current decision theory under ambiguity follows in Keynes’s footsteps
B26|Assessing the risks of asset overvaluation: models and challenges|We propose methods to compute confidence bands for the fundamental values of stocks and corporate bonds. These methods take into account uncertainty about future cash flows and about the discount factors used to discount the cash flows. We use them to assess the current degree of under-/over-valuation of asset prices. We find no evidence of over-valuation of the stocks and corporate bonds of the major economies.
B26|A quantitative analysis of risk premia in the corporate bond market|We propose an econometric model to decompose corporate bond spreads into compensation required by investors for unpredictable future changes in the credit environment and for expected default losses. We use the model to understand whether the significant reduction in corporate bond spreads observed since the launch of the CSPP (Corporate Sector Purchase Programme) is attributable more to the fact that expansionary monetary policy measures tend to increase the risk appetite of investors and compress risk premia, or to the ability of unconventional measures to reduce expected default losses by improving investors’ expectations about the economic and financial conditions of issuers.
B26|Shareholders’ Value of Saudi Commercial Banks: A Comparative Evaluation between Islamic and Conventional Banks using CAMEL Parameters|Islamic banks are playing an important role in the financial sector in various economies, especially in Islamic nations. They provide most of the banking services as are provided by the conventional banks, albeit different in nomenclature and specific characteristics. So far, however, no econometric study has been reported in the literature which analyses and compares the contribution to shareholders’ value by Islamic and conventional banks. This paper uses pooled OLS and random effect model to investigate and compare the contribution to shareholders’ value by the Islamic and conventional banks in Saudi Arabia over the period 2000-2015. Our results indicate that Islamic banks in Saudi Arabia contribute more to the shareholders’ value than conventional banks. We find that higher capital ratio and credit risk lead to a decline in shareholders’ value of the conventional banks but this is not true in the case of the Islamic banks. We also find that higher level of loans decrease the conventional banks’ shareholders’ value but increase the same in the case of the Islamic banks. In contrast to Islamic banks, we find that conventional banks with higher liquidity have a lower shareholders’ value. Lastly, our results indicate that in general, shareholders’ value is associated negatively with declines in cost efficiency and bank size. Policy implications and possible strategic interventions have also been discussed.
B26|Models as Speech Acts: The Telling Case of Financial Models|This paper intends to bring Austinian themes into methodological discussion about models. Using Austinian vocabulary, I argue that models perform actions in and outside of the academic field. This multiplicity of fields induces a variety of felicity conditions and types of performed actions. If for example, an inference from a model is judged according to some epistemological criteria in the scientific field, the representation of the world which the model carries, will not be judged by the same criteria outside the scientific field. A model can be considered as a standard in a strict scientific framework, while not being used as part of public policies, or vice versa. However, we focus on the dynamics between different fields.
B26|Effects of eliciting long-run price forecasts on market dynamics in asset market experiments|In this study, we investigate (a) whether eliciting future price forecasts influences market outcomes and (b) whether differences in the way in which subjects are incentivized to submit ``accurate'' price forecasts influence market outcomes as well as the forecasts in an experimental asset market. We consider four treatments: one without forecast elicitation and three with forecast elicitation. In two of the treatments with forecast elicitation, subjects are paid based on their performance in both forecasting and trading, while in the other treatment with forecast elicitations, they are paid based on only one of those factors, which is chosen randomly at the end of the experiment. We found no significant effect of forecast elicitation on market outcomes in the latter case. Thus, to avoid influencing the behavior of subjects and market outcomes by eliciting price forecasts, paying subjects based on either forecasting or trading performance is better than paying them based on both.
B26|Keynes’s Trading on Wall Street: Did He Follow the Same Behavior When Investing for Himself and for King’s?|In the last few years Keynes’s activity as an investor has attracted attention in the specialized literature. Very recently his investments at Wall Street, in particular – both on his own account (Cristiano, Marcuzzo, Sanfilippo 2017) and on behalf of King’s College (Chambers and Kabiri 2016) – have been analyzed, and the evident connection with his theoretical analysis of the functioning of the financial markets contained in Chapter 12 of the General Theory has been duly stressed. The aim of this paper is to make detailed comparison of Keynes’s investment choices and strategies in the US stock market when he traded for himself and for King’s. As might be expected, there are similarities but also significant differences, well worth investigating. As far as the differences are concerned, one of the most striking is to be seen in his attitude when, after a period of bull market in 1936, he had to face the 1937 burst of the speculative bubble and subsequent recession. Detailed analysis of his behavior reveals that this event took him by surprise but his reaction differed with regard to his personal investments and the King’s investments. The prevalence of a ‘buy and hold’ strategy which, according to Chambers and Kabiri (2016), seemed to characterize his behavior in general when investing for King’s, was not always the typical choice when the investments were undertaken on his own account.
B26|The unresolved problem of gratuitous credit in Austrian banking theory|Abstract Ludwig von Mises called gratuitous credit, the ability banks have to create new credit, the chief problem in a theory of banking. This paper traces how Mises and succeeding generations of Austrian-school economists have grappled with this problem, but have failed to find resolution. The result is that Austrian economists disagree on a variety of issues in banking and business cycle theory, such as whether there is an endogenous business cycle under free banking, or cycles only occur under central banking. Before a resolution can be attempted, current thinking must be clarified. This paper divides Austrian economists into five schools of thought. It points to a possible resolution in the economic development writings of Joseph Schumpeter.
B26|Keynes and the Dollar in 1933|On December 1933, John Maynard Keyes published an open letter to President Roosevelt, where he wrote: “The recent gyrations of the dollar have looked to me more like a gold standard on the booze than the ideal managed currency of my dreams.” In this paper I use high frequency data to investigate whether the gyrations of the dollar were unusually high throughout this period. My results show that although volatility was pronounced, it was not higher than during October 1931- July 1933. I analyze Keynes writings on the international monetary system in an effort to understand what he meant in his letter. I compare Keynes’s “The means to prosperity” with James P. Warburg’s plan for a “modified international standard.”
B26|The London Monetary and Economic Conference of 1933 and the End of The Great Depression: A “Change of Regime” Analysis|In this paper I analyze the London Monetary and Economic Conference of 1933, an almost forgotten episode in U.S. monetary history. I study how the Conference shaped dollar policy during the second half of 1933 and early 1934. I use daily data to investigate the way in which the Conference and related policies associated to the gold standard affected commodity prices, bond prices, and the stock market. My results show that the Conference itself did not impact commodity prices or the stock market. However, it had a small effect on bond prices. I do find that the events associated with the abandonment of the gold standard impacted prices in a significant way, even before the actual monetary and currency channels were at work. These results are consistent with the “change in regime” hypothesis of Sargent (1983).
B26|Finance, farms, and the Fed's early years|We provide causal evidence that discount rate changes by the Federal Reserve affected economic output in the 1920s. Our identification strategy exploits county-level variation in access to the Fed's discount window, and we implement this strategy with hand-collected data on banking and agriculture in Illinois in the early 20th century. The mechanism for the Fed's effect on agriculture was a bank credit channel, operating independently of any deflationary effect on money supply. Our findings suggest that the Fed deliberately managed transitory shocks during 1920-1921, mitigating debt burdens with which farms would struggle in the years leading to the Great Depression.
B26|The grant element method of measuring the concessionality of loans and debt relief|The grant element is the “gift portion” of a financial transaction. The mathematical technique for arriving at a precise grant element percentage was first proposed by John Pincus of the RAND Corporation in 1963, and developed mathematically by Göran Ohlin of the Development Centre in 1966. Pincus also advocated expressing foreign aid in terms of its grant equivalent – i.e. the grant element expressed as a monetary value instead of a percentage. Grant element methodology was first used officially in 1969, in a target for softening the terms of aid. A grant element test was then introduced into the definition of official development assistance in 1972. Grant element methodology was subsequently applied to regulate the terms of export credits, to help assess the sustainability of developing country borrowing, and to calculate the level of debt relief and ensure comparability of effort in relevant Paris Club debt rescheduling operations. Central to grant element calculations is the selection of an appropriate discount rate to reflect financial market conditions. The present low interest rate environment raises challenges in this respect. This paper offers a layman’s introduction to the nature and mechanics of grant element methodology, and to the history of its application in practice.
B26|The Link Between Bank Credit And Private Sector Investment In Nigeria From 1980-2014|TThis study attempts to investigate the link between bank credit and private sector investment in Nigeria from 1980 to 2014 using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression procedure. The study also employs other preliminary investigations which include, unit root, cointegration and Granger causality test procedures. The OLS result indicates that the coefficients of the variables which include, banks credit to the private sector (CRPRIVAT), trade openness (OPEN), exchange rate (EXCHR) and total bank saving (BSAVING) exhibit positive signs to the dependent variable, private investment (INVEST) during the period under review, while the coefficients of two other variables, capital expenditure (CAP) and interest rate (INTR) indicate negative signs to the dependent variable. The stationarity test result shows that all the variables under consideration are stationary and integrated of order one at 5% significance level. Also, the cointegration test result indicates at most five cointegrating equations at 5% level of significance. The Granger causality test result shows that a bi-directional causality exists between banks credit and private investment and also between private investment and capital expenditure, while a uni-directional causality exists from exchange rate to private investment.Statistically, the descriptive statistics result indicates that all the variables have a positive mean values which ranges from 18.05390 to 2427052 with 34 observations.The correlation test result obtained shows that four variables, CRPRIVAT, OPEN, EXCHR and BSAVING have positive relationships with the dependent variable INVEST. The t-statistic result shows that five of the variables which includes, CRPRIVAT, OPEN, CAP, INTR and EXCHR are statistically significant at 5% significance level. The study recommends that there is a need for increased Federal government support to banks in terms of policies that would encourage lending to the private sector in Nigeria.
B26|Moving beyond rhetoric: Can Islamic banking become mainstream in Pakistan|Challenging economic theory that is developed at micro level is a common practice among macro-economic behaviors of conventional economic system. In this context the paper analyses Islamic banking that tries to bring an interest free financial system. The paper explains the circumstances that may lead to a universal application of Islamic banking in Pakistan. This is done after presenting a detailed discussion on the rational for conventional banking.
B26|"The ""dark ages"" of German macroeconomics and other alleged shortfalls in German economic thought"|"Ordoliberalism is often accused as being responsible for Germany's policy stance during the Eurozone crisis. Ordoliberalism originates from the so-called Freiburg School of Economics, founded by Walter Eucken during the 1930s at the University of Freiburg, which is in fact in Germany. It is however neither true that ordoliberal thought has continuously been predominant and a prevailing idea in German macroeconomic policy, nor that it is responsible for Germany's policy stance during the crisis in EMU. In this paper, we show why a proper analysis must arrive at this conclusion by referring to Eucken's thinking and the development of German ordoliberalism across time in relation to the ""Rules vs. Discretion"" debate and to Constitutional Economics. Although ordoliberalism may have had some influence on the design of EMU, pragmatism, the status-quo and national interests are dominant in German economic policy."
B26|A historical retrospective and the essence of strategic financial planning|The author has reviewed the historical retrospective of strategic financial planning, distinguished the concepts of “strategic financial planning”, “long-term financial planning” and “perspective financial planning” and determined that their use as synonyms is incorrect. The correctness of three-tier financial planning has been justified. The difference between financial planning, financial forecasting and budgeting has been explained. The problem of strategic financial planning, its advantages and disadvantages, has been considered.
B26|Impact of Economic Growth, Foreign Direct Investment and Financial Development on Stock Prices in China: Empirical Evidence from Time Series Analysis|The study aims to empirically examine the dynamic relationship between gross domestic product (GDP), stock prices, Foreign direct investment (FDI) and domestic credit to the private sector for China by using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach for the period 1999Q1:2015Q1. The study confirmed the long-run cointegration among the variables. The empirical results revealed that stock prices and the associated regressors are in a long-term equilibrium relationship; stock prices converge to the long-run equilibrium position by 18.6% speed of adjustment via channel of GDP, stock price, FDI, and domestic credit to the private sector. The findings of the study further revealed that FDI has a positive impact on stock prices in the longrun, while financial development has a negative effect. The robustness of the ARDL bounds test of cointegration was examined by using Johansen and Juselius’s (1990) maximum likelihood cointegration approach. Finally, the results of Granger causality under the framework of vector error correction models showed a unidirectional short-run Granger causality that runs from stock prices to economic growth and from economic growth to FDI, specifying the absence of the FDI-led growth hypothesis. Likewise, a bi-directional causality has been found between financial development and stock prices.
B26|International monetary policy with commodity buffer stocks|This proposal argues in favor of commodity price stabilization via international commodity buffer stocks and the tying of these stocks to the creation of a new international reserve currency. Financing commodity buffer stocks through the issuance of an international reserve makes commodity price stabilization financially viable and offers a countercyclical issuance of international reserves to fight global deflation. Both measures address the volatility of commodity prices due to a lack of private sector storage and macroeconomic demand factors. This proposal urges the reader to look back to the global Keynesian policies of the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s for inspiration in solving today's commodity price instability and secular stagnation.
B26|A Kalecki fable on debt and the monetary transmission mechanism|Kalecki explained debt resolution by means of a fable about monetary circulation between mutually indebted individuals. This note explains the context and some of the theoretical implications of the fable. These point to an asymmetry in monetary policy in which excessively tight monetary policy may restrict economic activity and force the resort to informal debt.
B26|Effects of Eliciting Long-run Price Forecasts on Market Dynamics in Asset Market Experiments|In this study, we investigate (a) whether eliciting future price forecasts influences market outcomes and (b) whether differences in the way in which subjects are incentivized to submit ``accurate'' price forecasts influence market outcomes as well as the forecasts in an experimental asset market.

In two of the treatments with forecast elicitation, subjects are paid based on their performance in both forecasting and trading, while in the other treatment with forecast elicitations, they are paid based on only one of those factors, which is chosen randomly at the end of the experiment. We found no significant effect of forecast elicitation on market outcomes in the latter case. Thus, to avoid influencing the behavior of subjects and market outcomes by eliciting price forecasts, paying subjects based on either forecasting or trading performance is better than paying them based on both.
B26|Theoretical Models of Dividend Policy|Why do modern corporations pay dividends and how does dividend policy affect company’s performance remain controversial theoretical questions in both developed and emerging markets. This paper aims to describe concepts and empirical evidence about three of the most widely discussed theories: namely the theory of the dividend payment preference, the theory of irrelevance, and the theory of tax benefits from profit reinvestment. This is a preliminary stage of a study of the dividend policy of publicly traded companies in Bulgaria. By using these theories the future research of data will be based on the achievements of world science and the applied models will be comparable with the results obtained in other countries.
B26|Keynes and the interwar commodity option markets|In the first quarter of the twentieth century, options began to be widely employed in the main financial centres in Europe and the USA for trading in spot and futures markets. From 1921 onward, Keynes embarked upon investment in these derivatives mainly—but not exclusively—in the commodity markets, showing a true fascination for this method of speculation. This type of financial investment he pursued mainly in the 1920s, with only a few operations undertaken during the 1930s. The option markets in which Keynes traded were metals—in particular copper, lead, spelter and, especially, tin. Besides metals, Keynes dealt in options also in other commodity markets, such as rubber and linseed oil, and sparingly in ordinary stocks and government securities. In this paper we offer a reconstruction of Keynes’s speculative activity in commodity options, drawing on the archival material kept in the Keynes Papers held at King’s College, Cambridge. This reconstruction is, to the best of our knowledge, entirely new to the literature and aims to provide an analysis of this particular aspect of Keynes’s investment behaviour, investigating his capacity to predict market trends and offering a preliminary assessment of his performance.
B26|Stabilitatea financiară a României. Determinanți și proiecții pentru următoarele două decenii<BR>[Financial stability in Romania. Determinants and projections for the two next decades]|Ensuring and maintaining the financial stability, in the long and very long term perspective, is an essential prerequisite for achieving Romania's sustainable development goals in the next two decades and accelerating the convergence process with EU member states. The study aims to analyze the main determinants of the financial stability (degree of financial intermediation, costs of bank financing, sustainability of public debt, foreign debt and international investment position, exports of goods and services, foreign direct investments). The current state of Romania from these points of view, the related gaps and vulnerabilities are presented, together with policies, mechanisms and tools that allow them to be achieved. The analysis based on the scenario method for designing the strategic directions and targets of Romania’s economic development over the next two decades highlights a number of aspects, trends and challenges regarding the modalities and ways of the transition to the development stage based on knowledge, innovation and competitiveness under the conditions of maintaining the financial stability.
B26|The Euro and the Battle of Ideas|Why is Europe’s great monetary endeavor, the Euro, in trouble? A string of economic difficulties in Greece, Ireland, Spain, Italy, and other Eurozone nations has left observers wondering whether the currency union can survive. In this book, Markus Brunnermeier, Harold James, and Jean-Pierre Landau argue that the core problem with the Euro lies in the philosophical differences between the founding countries of the Eurozone, particularly Germany and France. But the authors also show how these seemingly incompatible differences can be reconciled to ensure Europe’s survival. As the authors demonstrate, Germany, a federal state with strong regional governments, saw the Maastricht Treaty, the framework for the Euro, as a set of rules. France, on the other hand, with a more centralized system of government, saw the framework as flexible, to be overseen by governments. The authors discuss how the troubles faced by the Euro have led its member states to focus on national, as opposed to collective, responses, a reaction explained by the resurgence of the battle of economic ideas: rules vs. discretion, liability vs. solidarity, solvency vs. liquidity, austerity vs. stimulus. Weaving together economic analysis and historical reflection, The Euro and the Battle of Ideas provides a forensic investigation and a road map for Europe’s future.
B26|A puzzle of excessive equity risk premium and the case of Poland|The article presents a historical review of the literature related to the empirical problem of excessive risk premium. The risk premium (the diff erence between the return on equiti es and risk-free rate) observed in fi nancial markets cannot be reconciled with theoretical models of fi nancial markets – it is too high (“excessive”). We present the original model from the seminal work of Mehra and Prescott (1985), where this problem has been signaled. The arti cle gives an overview of the main trends in the literature concerning this problem, of the proposed solutions and of the extension to the model. Finally, we consider the problem in the Polish context, estimating the original Mehra-Prescott model using data from the Polish fi nancial market.
B26|Recent Advances in Financial Engineering 2014:Proceedings of the TMU Finance Workshop 2014|Since 2004, the Tokyo Metropolitan University (TMU) has been conducting workshops that serve as a forum for academic researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas and developments in different fields of finance. This book is based on papers presented at the 2014 workshop held in Tokyo, on 6–7 November, 2014. The chapters address state-of-the-art techniques in mathematical finance and financial engineering. The authors share ideas and information on new methods and up-to-date results of their research in these fields. This book is a must-read for researchers, practitioners, and graduate students in the fields of mathematical finance, quantitative finance and financial engineering.
B26|Moment Properties of Probability Distributions Used in Stochastic Financial Models|Our goal in this paper is to look at stochastic financial models and especially on those properties of the involved distributions which are expressed in terms of the moments. The questions discussed and the results presented reveal the role which the moments play in the analysis of distributions. Interesting conclusions can be derived in both cases when available are finitely many moments and when we know all moments.Among the results included in the paper are sharp lower and/or upper bounds for option prices in terms of a finite number of moments. However the main attention is paid to the determinacy of distributions by their moments. While any light tailed distribution is uniquely determined by its moments, the uniqueness may fail for heavy tailed distributions. And, here is the point. Heavy tailed distributions are essentially involved in stock market modelling, and most of them are non-unique in terms of the moments. This is why the phenomenon non-uniqueness of distributions deserves a special attention.We treat distributions on the positive half-line used to describe, e.g., stock prices and option prices, and distributions on the whole real line describing log-returns. For reader's convenience we give a brief and unified general picture of existing results about uniqueness and non-uniqueness of distribution in terms of their moments. Some of the results are classical and well-known. In several cases we provide here new arguments along with presenting new recent results on the moment determinacy of random variables and their non-linear transformations and also of stochastic processes which are solutions to SDEs.
B26|An Equilibrium Approach to Indifference Pricing with Model Uncertainty|Utility indifference pricing is an effective method for investors to construct a strategy in an incomplete market. In fact, if an investor can trade a random endowment under the criteria shown by utility indifference pricing, they can devise financial contracts that are optimized according to their preferences. However, because it does not have the direct implication of equilibrium, the value of the random endowment given by indifference pricing is not necessarily the same as the market price. In this study, we attempt to derive the equilibrium of random endowment under the framework of indifference pricing. However, letting the utility function be of exponential type means that any trade involving random endowment will not appear in equilibrium. Thus, we show that non-zero trade in equilibrium appears by introducing uncertainty in a model, which is one of the sources of market incompleteness.
B26|Volume Imbalance and Market Making|Shortcomings of continuous and static microstructure models are noted with motivation provided by data from the NASDAQ. The influence of order imbalance on microstructure dynamics is incorporated in to a model which allows the agent to adjust their strategy based on an easily observable quantity. The predictive power of order imbalance allows the agent to decide when they should trade more agressively to take advantage of beneficial price movements, and when they should trade more conservatively to protect against adverse selection effects. High imbalance results in a stronger inclination to place limit buy orders with the opposite effect on limit sell orders.
B26|Optimal Short-Covering with Regime Switching|We formulate a short-selling strategy of a stock and seek the optimal timing of short covering in the presence of a random recall and a loan fee rate in an illiquid stock loan market. The aim is to study how the optimal trading strategy of the short-seller is influenced by the relevant features of the stock loan market. We consider a regime-switching stock price model that captures the transition in between the bull and the bear markets. The solution to the optimal stopping problem is obtained in closed-form based on the techniques in Guo and Zhang (2005). We provide the numerical example to illustrate of importance of a regime-dependent stopping rule for the short-seller's problem.
B26|Effects of Reversibility on Investment Timing and Quantity Under Asymmetric Information|The paper examines how changes in reversibility of investment affect a firm's investment timing and quantity strategies, in the presence of manager's private information. We find that even under asymmetric information, higher reversibility of investment decreases the investment trigger. More importantly, the quantity under asymmetric information is no longer independent of the degree of reversibility of investment, but increases with it.
B26|Quadratic Gaussian Joint Pricing Model for Stocks and Bonds: Theory and Empirical Analysis|This study proposes a joint pricing model for stocks and bonds in a noarbitrage framework. A stock price representation is obtained in a manner consistent with the quadratic Gaussian term structure model, in which the short rate is the quadratic form of the state variables. In this study, specifying the dividend as a function using the quadratic form of the state variables leads to a stock price representation that is exponential-quadratic in the state variables. We prove that the coefficients determining the stock price have to satisfy some matrix equations, including an algebraic Riccati equation. Moreover, we specify the sufficient condition in which the matrix equations do have a unique solution. In our empirical analysis using Japanese data, we obtain estimates with a good fit to the actual data. Furthermore, we estimate the risk premiums for stocks and bonds and analyze how the BOJ's unconventional monetary policy has affected these risk premiums.
B26|Option Pricing with Ambiguous Correlation and Fast Mean-reverting Volatilities|In pricing an option on multiple assets, volatilities of individual assets and the correlations among different assets are necessary inputs. In practice, implied volatility surface for individual underlying asset can be used to calibrate the marginal distribution, but information on correlations is generally difficult to obtain. By regarding the correlation between two assets as an ambiguous parameter, we obtain the worst case price to option seller. The corresponding pricing problem is formulated as a stochastic optimal control problem in which the uncertain correlation takes the role as a control function. Consequently, the Black-Scholes equation is replaced by an HJB equation for deriving of the option price bounds. We solve this problem using the framework of stochastic volatility asymptotics and explain how volatility surfaces of individual assets can be robustly pulled together to estimate the price bounds of an option on multiple assets. Empirical study with foreign exchange option data illustrates the practical use of the proposed approach.
B26|Callable Stock Loans|In a non-recourse collateralized loan agreement, the lender's recovery is only limited to the market value of the asset as a collateral. In practice, a loan lender can protect himself against any loss by introducing either a margin requirement or a callable feature in the loan contract. In this respect, it is natural to ask: (1) which one of the two mentioned features should be more preferable to the loan manager; (2) how the borrower reacts towards either one of these two features. In the present work, we address these issues by solving explicitly the respective valuation problems of collateralized lending with margin requirement and callable feature under the Black-Scholes model. For the callable feature, we also provide systematic discussions on (1) how to identify whether the smooth-fit condition holds or fails at the optimal stopping boundaries of the associated Dynkin game, and (2) how to solve it when the smooth-fit condition fails at one or both boundaries. We finally utilize these explicit solutions to conduct detailed comparative analysis.
B26|Cash Management and Control Band Policies for Spectrally One-sided Lévy Processes|We study the control band policy arising in the context of cash balance management. A policy is specified by four parameters (d, D, U, u). The controller pushes the process up to D as soon as it goes below d and pushes down to U as soon as it goes above u, while he does not intervene whenever it is within the set (d, u). We focus on the case when the underlying process is a spectrally one-sided Lévy process and obtain the expected fixed and proportional controlling costs as well as the holding costs under the band policy.
B26|A Second-order Monotone Modification of the Sharpe Ratio|The Sharpe ratio is not monotone: an investment strategy which yields a higher return may have a lower Sharpe ratio. This may lead to suboptimal investment decisions.In this paper we present a modification of the Sharpe ratio, which is monotone with respect to second-order stochastic dominance. We study its properties and obtain a representation which allows to compute it in an efficient way.
B26|Ordoliberalism, pragmatism and the eurozone crisis: How the German tradition shaped economic policy in Europe|German policy during the Eurozone crisis supposedly follows an ordoliberal tradition. In this paper, we discuss to what extent this contention holds and to what extent Germany pragmatically responded to different crisis phenomena. A proper analysis of ordoliberal thinking reveals that the European Monetary Union can be justified on ordoliberal grounds as an economic constitution for Europe in which several pillars supposedly aim at ensuring sound money in the Eurozone. The policies the German government pushed during the Eurozone crisis have been informed by the ordoliberal tradition. In particular, this tradition may explain why the German government has been hesitant to support the call for Eurobonds and has only reluctantly established the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). However, the decisions on the ESM and the acceptance of unconventional monetary policy in Europe show that German economic policy largely responded pragmatically to the challenges offered by the crisis.
B26|Explicaciones Austriacas y Estructuralistas de la Crisis Financiera Internacional de 2008|El documento compara y sintetiza los enfoques teóricos de la escuela austriaca y estructuralista en torno a la crisis financiera internacional de 2008. Huerta de Soto (2010) será el autor a tener en cuenta como representante de la escuela austriaca, mientras que por parte de la escuela estructuralista se tomarán autores referentes de la Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (CEPAL). Por último se añaden conceptos atribuidos a Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia y Mauro (2010), Misnky (1992) y Calvo, Izquierdo y Talvi (2006) con el ánimo de presentar una alternativa para entender la crisis.
B26|The Antecedents and Aftermath of Financial Crises as Told by Carlos F. Díaz-Alejandro|Some of the best-known papers of Carlos F. Díaz-Alejandro were about Latin Amer- ica’s crises in the 1980s and 1930s. I show data, figures, and evidence about the crises in the advanced economies thirty years later that fit the same narrative. His unadulterated words aptly describe modern problems across geographical borders and, in this case, income levels. This attests to his timeless insight and understanding. Because some of the observations he made have general applicability to the study of recurring patterns across crises, I have taken the liberty to label these lessons. These are primarily lessons about what to avoid.
B26|Financial Liberalization and Economic Growth in Nigeria: An Empirical Evidence|The liberalization thesis has generated a lot of debate in theoretical and empirical literature. In this paper we construct an index of financial liberalization from 1981 to 2012 to investigate its impact on economic growth in Nigeria using the McKinnon–Shaw framework. The ordinary least squares methodology and cointegration analysis are adopted in the study. The result reveals that financial liberalization (FINDEX) and private investment (PINV) have significant positive impact on economic growth in Nigeria. However, real lending rate (LDR) proved to be negatively related to economic growth in Nigeria within the period under review. We therefore conclude that the monetary authorities and policy makers in Nigeria need to support the liberalization process by formulating complementary policies and financial sector reform measures that will help in strengthening the impact of the liberalization process on the economy and also ensure that the benefits of the liberalization exercise is maximized.
B26|Small-scale cooperative banking and the production of capital: Reflecting on the role of institutional agreements in supporting rural livelihood in Kampot, Cambodia|This paper explores the ecological economics of small-scale cooperative banking (SSCB) through reference to the empirical case of a rice-farming village in Kampot, Cambodia. It combines Georgescu-Roegen's discussion of an economy's capacity to produce economic processes with Ostrom's concept of institutional performance, in order to address the implications and functioning of SSCB within a small-farmer economy. The local collective action situation of maintaining and making use of a SSCB system – a specific finance model – provides the studied community with access to a pooled capital fund that may play an important role in ensuring its capacity to produce and reproduce economic processes, according to its own specifications. The coordinated action among the villagers, which matches up well with Ostrom's criteria for effective institutional performance of common pool resource use governance, is found to include social and environmental dimensions, which we understand to be necessary for achieving transformations toward more sustainable economic activity. While we do not wish to suggest that the adoption of SSCB guarantees either improved ecological or social impacts, our results suggest that this finance model could play a supporting role in enhancing the potential of small-farming communities to improve both, should they wish to do so.
B26|O.M.W. Sprague (the man who “wrote the book” on financial crises) and the founding of the Federal Reserve|O.M.W. Sprague was America's leading expert on financial crises when America was debating establishing the Federal Reserve. His History of Crises under the National Banking System is the most enduring intellectual legacy of the National Monetary Commission; a still frequently cited classic. Since the Commission recommended a central bank, and its recommendation after some modifications became the Federal Reserve System, it might be assumed that Sprague was a strong supporter of establishing a central bank. But he was not. Initially, Sprague favored far more limited reforms, a position that he did not abandon until the Federal Reserve became a fait accompli. Here I discuss the sources of Sprague's opposition to a central bank and the relationship of that opposition to his understanding of the history and structure of the American banking system at the turn of the nineteenth century.
B26|The heterodox notion of structural crisis|Long waves of economic activity, also known as â€˜Kondratiev cycles,â€™ have been known to exist for nearly a century without having ever been given a proper theoretical context. In this paper we try to identify various contributions to shed light on this phenomenon, notably Schumpeter's notion of technological bursts and Minsky's notion of a super-cycle where â€˜stability breeds instabilityâ€™ to the point of systemic crisis. A more comprehensive and methodologically innovative approach to the periodization of capitalism is the French RÃ©gulation School. This heterodox approach has reframed the story of long waves in terms of period-specific â€˜accumulation regimesâ€™ and â€˜modes of (self-)regulation.â€™ Here systemic crises, like the ones we experienced in 1873â€“1879, 1929â€“1939, 1973â€“1982 or 2007â€“2011, play the role of regime-transforming adjustments in the institutional make-up of the wage relation, forms of competition, state intervention, and money and banking, as well as international context. We apply the Regulationist approach to finance-led capitalism, the latest long-wave accumulation regime emerging around 1982 to find itself confronted with its own systemic crisis starting in 2007. How will that crisis, one of the most profound structural crises to date, change our economic system?
B26|Financial and economic stability as ‘two sides of a coin’: Non-crisis regime evidence from the UK based on VECM|Purpose - – The purpose of this paper is to provide a different context for considering issues of financial stability and instability, with reference to economic growth and price stability in particular. Design/methodology/approach - – This paper pursued an empirical exploration of six pillars of financial stability, based on a data set for the UK extending from 1985 (Q1) to 2008 (Q2), through the construction of a vector error correction model, including an impulse response function analysis. Findings - – The findings show a strong association between the financial and economic stability even in a non-crisis regime. This includes, for example, a strong association exists between the stock market and the real economy; exchange rate appreciation may not provide for long-term real economic growth; inflation does not contribute to real economic growth, both the sensitivity of the economy to yields and a significant lag in transitional effects from financial markets to the real sector; a positive role of credit creation within a non-crisis regime; exchange rate appreciation affects purchasing power; and potential points of linkage between sovereign debt activity and general price levels. Research limitations/implications - – The findings should be considered in the context of a concept of the economy as fundamentally dynamic and subject to complex cumulative processes. Practical implications - – The findings indicate there is a role for state oversight and intervention within a non-crisis regime based on the complexity of possible interactions that may undermine financial and price stability, with consequences for their association with economic growth. Originality/value - – The study provides a new perspective for considering issues of financial stability and instability.
B26|Influence of Globalization on the Regional Capital Markets and Consequences; Evidence from Warsaw Stock Exchange|The Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) is one of the newcomers on the European stock market and at the same time is one of the fast developing stock exchanges in Europe. The development of WSE could be an example of successful development of a national stock exchange into a regional in a relatively short period of time. This article provides analysis of the main trends of development of the WSE through its history to show how globalization influenced regional stock exchanges and to determine key factors that affected its successful development. The WSE is one of the most popular stock exchanges in the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Two main lists: Main List and NewConnect are characterized by types of investors, trading turnover and number of companies listed. The article provides quantitative and qualitative analysis of the official reports and analytical papers of key audit and consulting experts that cover both lists of the exchange. The article provides comparison of WSE key performance parameters with major European stock exchanges through 2001 - 2014 and shows those main characteristics of the stock exchange that were mostly influenced by the globalization. Further, the paper shows main consequences of globalization affecting regional stock exchanges. Collected information and results are presented both in tables and in graphical formats.
B26|Kindleberger and Financial Crises|This paper aims to assess to what extent the contributions of Kindleberger to the explanation and control of financial crises may still be a source of valuable insights for the present. Kindleberger had the great merit, to be shared with Minsky, of having resumed in the early 1970s, after an eclipses of more than two decades, the investigation on the intrinsic instability of credit and its impact on financial crises. Though his pure model may be considered less pregnant than that of Minsky, it extends its scope to the international and political aspects of financial crises. In addition Kindleberger provides a powerful support to the model by rooting it in the empirical evidence systematically investigated since the early 18th century. The application of Kindleberger’s model has been successfully extended, with the collaboration of Aliber, also to the financial crises occurred after the publication of his major book (Kindleberger, 1978). This paper argues that Kindleberger’s insights are still invaluable to understand the subprime crisis and the ensuing Great recession and to design the institutions and policies necessary to resume a sustainable path of economic progress.
B26|Keynes, Trouton and the Hector Whaling Company. A personal and professional relationship|John Maynard Keynes’ activities on the stock market are well known. One company in which he bought stocks was the Hector Whaling Company Ltd., London – a comparatively small and little known company founded in 1928. The director of this company was Rupert Trouton. He had worked with Keynes for the Government during the First World War, was his student at Cambridge, and became a close partner in the City from the 1920s and onwards. The reason why Keynes invested in Hector was obviously his association with Rupert Trouton. The first part of this paper explores briefly the development of the Hector Whaling Company and its origins in Norway. The main part analyses the relationship between Trouton and Keynes. The focus is on their co-operation relating to Hector Whaling, but their relationship regarding various other businesses, as well as on the personal level, is also described. The paper is based on studies of the Keynes archives in Cambridge as well as newly available archives of the Hector company. The analysis provides new insights to the more general question on the motivations and decisions behind Keynes’ stock market investments as well as the internationalization of the whaling industry in the 1920s and 30s.
B26|Reconsidering the Finance-Growth Nexus in Asian Countries: A Panel ARDL Approach|Financial sector is a vital segment of an economy. To elucidate its role in economic growth, this paper empirically examines its role for Asian countries. We examine and quantify this long run relationship for a sample of 12 Asian countries with data on relevant variables for a large time dimension (1970 to 2012). Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag model (ARDL) is used to find long run relationship. Panel ARDL being a heterogeneous panel estimation technique allows the slope and short run parameters to vary across the countries. Results show the presence of long run relationship between financial development and national income. The positive contribution of financial development is quantified using Fully Modified OLS and dynamic OLS as well as. Bi-causality is also found between financial development and economic growth. Recommendations are made on the basis of empirical analysis.
B26|Válságból válságba – Az argentin bankrendszer elmúlt 20 évének története|Az argentin bankrendszer a 2001–2002-es válság hatására jelentõs strukturális változásokon ment keresztül. A korábbi széleskörû dollarizációt állami beavatkozással igyekeztek megszûntetni, a bankrendszer pedig drasztikusan mérsékelte az állammal szemben addig felépült magas kitettségét. Az argentin bankrendszer tulajdonosi struktúrája is átalakult a válság után. Az utóbbi években mind az államnak, mind a hazai magánszektornak, mind pedig a külföldnek egyharmadnyi részesedése van. A bankok, bár alacsony bázisról, de dinamikus hitelexpanziót folytatnak a magánszektor irányába az utóbbi években, aminek következtében a jövedelemtermelõ képességük is stabil. Bár tõke- és likviditási oldalról is stabilizálódott a bankrendszer, a reálgazdaságot csak mérsékelten támogatja, a hitelállomány kifejezetten alacsony. Ez továbbra is komoly problémát jelent az ország gazdaságának. Tanulmányunkban az argentin bankrendszer történetét mutatjuk be, kiemelt figyelemmel az 1998–2013 közötti periódusra.
B26|Academics as Economic Advisers: Gold, the ‘Brains Trust,’ and FDR|In this paper I revisit the period leading to the abandonment of the gold standard by the U.S. in 1933. I analyze what the important players – and in particular FDR and the members of the advisory group known as the “Brains Trust” – thought about the gold standard. My conclusion is that during the primary and presidential campaigns, neither Roosevelt nor his inner circle had a strong view on gold or the dollar. They did believe in the need to experiment with different policies in order to get the country out of the slump. Tinkering with the value of the currency was a possible area for experimentation; but it was an option with a relatively low priority, lower than implementing a public works program, and passing a bill that included crops allotment. Until inauguration day FDR’s views on the gold standard were ambivalent and noncommittal; he was neither a diehard fan of the system, nor was he a severe critic.
B26|Dollar’s Triumph in Bretton Woods: How Was It Done?|The increased economic power of the United States and their enormous golden reserves are the main reasons used by economists to explain why the Bretton Woods conference of 1944 put the dollar in the centre of a new international financial system. However, it is not clear if these conditions were sufficient for the introduction of a gold (de facto dollar) standard and excluded any other type of international financial order. The study of historical data reveals an effective diplomatic maneuver conducted by the U.S. administration with an aim to prevent a global transit to fiat money, to keep the importance of gold and to build a strictly hierarchical international financial system.
B26|Russian economy in the face of the global decline of crude oil prices|The purpose of this article is to present problem in which the Russia found after the imposition of her economic and political sanctions by the European Union. It also shows the impact of the global figure the crude oil price to change the size of gross domestic product and the country's budget revenues. The models were to confirm the existence of consistent relationship between the studied variables and indicate the strength of this relationship, between the crude oil price and the size of Russia's GDP and exports in the country. The first model is indicative of the relationship between the change in the size of world crude oil prices and the value of gross domestic product. The second model shows the impact of world crude oil prices on the value of exports. The resulting models confirm that values and confirm the thesis of mine. An important element that should also pay attention to a problem related to the occurrence in the Russian economy Dutch disease. Russia's strong economic dependence on oil and natural gas causes such a violent change of the economic situation of the country from fluctuations in the world prices of crude oil and is a major cause of the economic crisis which took the Russian economy in 2014.
B26|Revisiting the Government Spending and Growth analysis in Ghana: A disaggregated Analysis|Government’s desire to raise economic growth in Ghana has led to a sharp rise in government spending in Ghana without any significant impact on economic growth. This study set out to investigate the relationship between economic growth and government spending at the disaggregated level with the ARDL model with annual data spanning from 1970 to 2010 to advice policy makers on the dynamics of growth. The study found out that, in both the long run and short run, government capital expenditure has a significant negative impact on economic growth but recurrent expenditure has a positive effect on economic growth in both the long run and the short run though it was not significant in the short run. The study therefore advocates for fiscal discipline and efficiency in the disbursement of capital expenditure to trigger positive benefits in the future
B26|Accounting for research quality: Research audits and the journal rankings debate|The question of whether and how research quality should be measured, and the consequences of research audits such as the UK's Research Excellence Framework (REF) – formerly the RAE – are considered in relation to the role of journal ratings such as the Association of Business Schools Academic Journal Quality Guide (the ABS Guide). Criticism of the ABS Guide has distracted attention from the results of successive RAEs, where the panel for Business and Management has been one of the most selective in its allocation of the highest grades, especially when compared with the neighbouring field of Economics. If the ABS Guide had been used to grade outputs submitted for Business and Management in the RAE 2008 then many more outputs would have received the highest grades, especially in accounting where outputs from journals such as Critical Perspectives on Accounting, which are highly rated in the ABS Guide, appear to have been downgraded by the RAE panel. The alleged bias against accounting in the ABS Guide rests on a particular interpretation of citation impact factors for journals, and a narrow definition of subject fields. Critics of the ABS Guide would be better advised to direct their attention to scrutinizing the results of the REF and considering whether it provides an adequate research ranking for UK business schools. 15% of all full time students in the UK study business and management, including accounting and finance, but only 6.7% of the full time equivalent research active staff submitted in the RAE 2008 were in business and management, or accounting and finance. Research audits are therefore forcing the separation of teaching from research in UK business schools. With an estimated ratio of 71 full time students per research active faculty member in UK business schools, it may be time to consider a more appropriate, inclusive, and economical form of ranking for research in business and management.
B26|Modeling FDI Flows from the USA to Canada:Two Main International Financial Variables Affect the Long-Run Economic Growth|This paper develops a model to predict for the spillover effects of the foreign capital inflows on the long run growth under conditions of international economic exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The paper utilizes a simple open economy version of the Solow growth model with the main features of real business cycle models. In addition, the paper uses a time series model with substitution techniques to test the impact of the spillover effect of foreign capital inflows from the USA on long run growth in Canada, while controlling for exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, as well as for both external and internal balances. The results support the existence of positive spillover effects from foreign direct investment on the economy. The results also show that foreign exchange rate fluctuations have weaken the impact of underlying changes in productivity on the attractiveness of the economy to overseas investors and hence moderate the overall impact of the technology spillover effect of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on long-run growth.
B26|Albert Hirschman: a celebration|"The article is the opening address at the Conference “Albert Hirschman scienziato sociale” held in Rome on the 6th May 2014 at the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei and at the presence of the President of Italian Republic, Sen. Giorgio Napolitano. A previous version of this article was published in Italian and available on line on Moneta e Credito, 2014, vol. 67, issue 266, pages 159–165 ( http://ojs.uniroma1.it/index.php/monetaecredito/index ). In this article the author traces the cultural and political environment of Hirschman stating that he ""was a formidable enemy of the narrow lines of reasoning called 'the economic approach', which had—and still has—much following among many economists and some sociologists, who celebrate economics as a 'conquering discipline'. Rather than having social studies influenced by the emaciated understanding of economics that has weakened economics itself, Hirschman was keen on enriching economics by incorporating social, political and cultural considerations"".

B26|Richard Abel Musgrave and Joseph Alois Schumpeter: Two intellectual authorities in economics and their shared and different frameworks, read through the lenses of the Perlman dichotomies|The paper compares R.A. Musgrave and J.A. Schumpeter and their relationship. First, their biographical and intellectual backgrounds are analyzed. Then the approach of shared intellectual frameworks according to M. Perlman’s dichotomies are applied to Musgrave’s and Schumpeter’s contributions.Musgrave was an admirer of Schumpeter but the analysis of their approaches applying the dichotomous approach and the inclusion ofMusgraves article on Schumpeter and the tax state also highlight their intellectual differences despite the fact that both had deep roots in the European tradition and a broad understanding of the social sciences, social economics and the embeddedness of the economy in the institutional-judicial nexus on the one and more individualist traditions on the other hand.

B26|The Theory of Capital as a Theory of Capitalism – Hidden Austrian Contributions to a Historically Specific Approach to Capital|Before economists and sociologists came up with their own definitions of the term “capital,” it was commonly understood as money invested in businesses by their owners or shareholders, and it continues to be understood this way in everyday business practice. In a recent article, Geoffrey Hodgson (2014) advises economists to return to this pre-Smithian usage of the term. The present paper takes up Hodgson’s demand and develops a theory of capital that is based upon this business notion of capital. It also argues that the Austrian theory of capital, if interpreted correctly, can serve as a starting point. Despite the conviction of its adherents to the contrary, the Austrian theory of capital is not universal or ahistorical, but dovetails with Hodgson’s vision of an approach to capital which analyses historically specific features of capitalism.

Based on detailed studies of specific legislation, archival materials, statistical and literature, trying to provide a more complete picture of the mechanism by which compossessorates as a form of property specifies contributed to socio-economic development. This mechanism of operation, although it relates to the economic history of Transylvania is topical, and the paper tries to offer some solutions for integrating the organizational forms in the current financial and economic mechanism in Romania.

B26|Aplicación de las opciones reales en la toma de decisiones en los mercados de electricidad|Las decisiones estratégicas en los mercados de electricidad están sujetas a un alto riesgo e incertidumbre; en consecuencia, las opciones reales aparecen como una alternativa para la toma de decisiones en dichos mercados. En el presente artículo se realiza una revisión de literatura analizando y clasificando aplicaciones de opciones reales sobre decisiones de inversión, operación, y de políticas y programas energéticos. Además se presenta un ejemplo sintético de aplicación teórico utilizando un modelo binomial para incorporar energía eólica en vez de térmica de acuerdo con la volatilidad de los precios del carbón. Se concluye que las opciones reales permiten tomar mejores decisiones que los métodos tradicionales, pues capturan a través de sus múltiples modelos las diferentes incertidumbres propias de estos mercados.

B26|Determinants of Dividend per Share: Evidence from the Nigerian Stock Exchange|This study examines the variables determining dividend per share (DPS) in some selected companies listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). The sample consists of 80 companies listed on the NSE as at 2012. The relevant explanatory variables were subjected to multiple regression analysis. Results revealed that current year earnings per share (EPSt) and previous year dividend per share (DPSt-1) were both positively significant at one per cent. Dividend pay-out ratio (PAYOUTt) was significant at five per cent. Both Profitability (PROFITt) and Investment (INVESTt) were significant at 10 per cent, but INVESTt was negatively significant. One may conclude that EPSt, DPSt-1 and PAYOUTt are the three major variables influencing the companyâ€™s decision to increase or decrease dividend per share (DPSt) in the NSE. Managers should therefore monitor these variables in taking decisions for their companies.
B26|A Letter on Full-Reserve Banking and Friedman’s Rule in Chicago Tradition|Post-war Chicago School advanced a blend of pre-war Chicago and non-Chicago quantity theory, termed Monetarism. The preponderance of the non-Chicago element in this blend has been documented well by the relevant literature. This note maintains that monetarism’s only contribution to pre-war Chicago is the kpercent rule as a powerful countercyclical policy instrument, indeed, along with the cyclically-balanced-budget and no-open-market-operations rules put forth by pre-war Chicago. Early Chicago’s thinking was motivated by what nowadays is called Quantity Theory of Credit too, and a full-reserve banking rule was also included as a policy instrument. This rule was advanced from the viewpoint of nobank- money-rule. By identifying bank money with commercial bank seigniorage, this rule is found here to be consistent with any value of the reserve ratio that nullifies such a seigniorage depending on the bank profit margin. This rule is also as price stabilizing as the k-percent rule, and this is the reason the contribution of the latter to Chicagoan policymaking is linked to its countercyclical rather than anti-inflationary power.
B26|Keynes, King's, and Endowment Asset Management|Founded in 1441, King's College was one of Cambridge University's wealthiest Colleges, endowed with a vast agricultural portfolio. John Maynard Keynes was appointed bursar just after WWI and initiated a major reallocation to equities, an innovation at least as radical as the late 20th century commitment to illiquid assets by Harvard and Yale. Keynes initially pursued a market-timing approach to investment with mixed success and failed to anticipate the 1929 market crash. Thereafter, his switch to a patient buy-and-hold strategy allowed him to maintain his commitment to equities in the subsequent market slump, reflecting the natural advantages that accrue to long horizon investors. Keynes' innovations in endowment asset management, implemented over a dynamic period of capital market development and economic turbulence remain of great relevance to modern investors emerging from the Great Recession.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B26|Financial Markets Efficiency (Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics 2013)|The article considers the ways to overcome the methodological gap between the analysis of economic cycles and the pure economic theory as suggested by the Western economists in the 1920s and 1930s. In this context, N. D. Kondratiev’s project of economic dynamics is analyzed, which implied a radically different vision of the opportunities to solve this problem.
B26|Key Trends in the Development of the Bulgarian Banking System between the Two World Wars|The development of the Bulgarian banking system is a specific process which reflects both the state of the economy as a whole and the financial sector in particular. The system was shaped in the years after the First World War. After the war, the entire development of the country’s economy, including that of the banking system, was largely affected by the fact that Bulgaria had lost the war. BNB was in charge of the payment of the post-war reparations. The bank introduced the so called gold-currency standard – the lev was backed by both gold and foreign currency. Prof. Alexander Tsankov’s government introduced a state monopoly on currency trade (1923). By the beginning of the 1929/1933 crisis the lending system in the country was built and complete. The broad picture showed that there was long-term capital insufficiency in Bulgaria. There were a few big loans – the Bulgarian national loan (1921), the Stabilisation loan (1928) and Redemption Bank bonds. The lending activity in the country and that of the BNB were closely related to foreign loans such as the Refugee loan (1926) and the Stabilisation loan (1928). A law on BNB was passed in 1928, which stipulated that it became a full-bodied issuance institution. The law was also an attempt to establish the bank’s independence from the government. The commercial banks responded to the 1929/33 crisis through consolidation. In 1929 there were 137 banks, in 1934 – 118 and in 1935 their number fell to 99. BNB’s intervention, which involved refinancing the ailing banks, turned out to be of crucial importance to the stability of the banking system. The economic crisis resulted in very high indebtedness of agricultural businesses. The state attempted to curb that negative trend and adopted a Law on the protection of agricultural producers (1932). Redemption bank at the Government debts Directorate was founded. One of the strongest banks in the 1930s was Bulgarian Credit bank. The cooperative companies became more active in banking during that period. Typical characteristic features of the Bulgarian banking system during the 1930s until the start of the Second World War are: stronger centralization, industry concentration, the growing importance of both the public lending institutions and of the big Bulgarian commercial banks, the increased circulation of banknotes and of the financial aid provided to the government by BNB.
B26|Financial Thought as a Shield: Bogotá’s Stock Exchange and the Financial Ideas during its Foundation and Consolidation|The document uses a historical approach to unveil the political nature of financial ideas generated by functionaries of Bogotá’s Stock Exchange in the years following its foundation. Particularly, it demonstrates how these ideas constituted interpretations that aimed at the consolidation of the entity in a dynamic historical and economic context that posed varying challenges to the institution. The interpretative discourse produced and transmitted by said Stock Exchange constituted an adaptive mechanism, which gradually refined so as to placate both existing and emerging social concerns regarding the role and the effects of an entity of the like.
B26|Islamic Finance: From Niche To Mainstream In The Academic World|Not very long ago the practicability of Islamic banking and finance was not taken seriously, and writing on such topics was considered simply a mental exercise in vain. Opportunity of teaching and learning Islamic economics, banking and finance was unheard. But the situation at present has completely changed. At present it is the most discussed and practiced area of Islamic economics. It has received global recognition. Now there is a vast variety of degree programmes in the Western universities, with different specializations. The present paper aims to shed light on the rapid development of Islamic finance in the academic circle all over the world. At the concluding note it strongly recommends for keeping close tie between its theoretical development and practical advancement.

B26|Kenneth Langone Professor of Finance, NYU Stern School of Business|Since the great financial crisis of 2008, governments have set new records in market intervention, re-regulation of banking and financial markets, and in prosecution of banks for mismanagement. The new regulations touch just about everything in finance and completely change the financial regulatory system. However, these regulations have been hastily prepared and contain flaws that suggest they may not be effective in addressing systemic risk in the future. They also impose enormous compliance costs on the banking industry, even though no more than about 40 banks worldwide are systemically important. The costs will be passed on to customers of banks and users of financial markets, which may detract significantly from future economic growth prospects. Banks will have to adapt their business models to the new circumstances of their industry, or surely be challenged by shareholders until they do. But the way the regulatory platform is structured now, they will be adapting toward a more conservative, risk-averse form of what they were before. That may mean that too-big-to-fail becomes too-cautious-to-fail. If we have reduced the banks’ capability to finance basic economic growth, a role that is equally important to our societies as systemic risk reduction, the regulatory response to the crisis may prove to be very mistaken. Risk has to be financed somewhere, if we are to return to the growth rates that we need to maintain and improve living standards. Most likely, the regulatory and other measures taken in response to the crisis will have to be modified in the future, but probably not in the near term.
B26|On the role of the ECB's collateral framework in preventing fire sales|In this paper, I analyze the impact of the extension of the ECB s collateral framework on securities sales. In addition, I evaluate the impact of different macroeconomic and bank-specific characteristics on banks selling behavior. At this, I distinguish between healthy banks and banks rescued from the German government hypothesizing that distressed banks manage sales of their assets differently. My analysis is based on quantile regressions for panel data containing securities holdings of 27 German banks, which allows an assessment of extremely large sales. Such selling behavior could cause a collapse of prices and lead to fire sales adversely impacting other financial institutions. I find clear evidence that the ECB s collateral framework has a stabilizing impact on sales of assets, especially for impaired banks and during the crisis the relationship is significant.
B26|Household Assets and Rural Finance in Nigeria|The study assesses the roles played by the loan service of cooperatives on household assets acquisition among cooperative members in rural communities of Ogun State where there is no bank.Independent student test and one way analysis of variance were used to analyze the data collected through questionnaire from 302 members. The study shows that the following assets – land, generator, television, radio and refrigerator – were more likely to be acquired by members than non-members. This is an indication of improvement in members’ standard of living made possible through access to cooperative loans. The study provided more evidence on the importance of land ownership, and how this is enhanced when rural communities have access to affordable loans. The study did not find evidence that cooperative members took advantage of the program, which is self sustained by their own savings, to acquire buildings and motor vehicles.
B26|Dylematy zwiazane z nadmiernym pobieraniem odsetek. Perspektywa historyczna i terazniejszosc/Dilemmas Connected with Excessive Charging of Interest. Historical Trend and the Present|The problem of charging interest has been discussed since the time of Aristotle. It was condemned in the Christian religion in the Middle Ages. Only when the interest was specified as a payment for productive capital was it considered that the borrower, enriched by the money lent, should let the lender benefit in accordance with the principle of fairness. The borrower should share the profit with the lender, and from this moment the percentage is no longer something shameful and neglected. Religious beliefs and accepted moral values have changed over time, adapting to the circumstances, so has the approach to collecting interest from the capital lent. However, there is still a great deal of criticism of excessive interest rates. The purpose of this paper is to present a discussion related to the charging of interest presented in the tradition of economics and also to show some aspects of the problem in relation to the present times, such as excessive debt and responsible lending.
B26|Lineamientos para impulsar el proceso de profundizacion bancaria en Uruguay|En los ultimos anos, los ratios de bancarizacion en Uruguay han mostrado una tendencia positiva, aunque sin alcanzar los niveles que mantenia antes de la crisis de inicios de siglo. El ratio de credito sobre PIB en el ano 2010 se ubico cerca del 18%, mientras que el de los depositos supero el 33%. Uruguay, sin embargo, aun se encuentra rezagado en comparacion a la media regional, sobre todo en el ratio de credito respecto al PIB e incluso es superado por varios paises con menores niveles de ingreso per capita. A nivel de segmentos, en Uruguay el credito al consumo familiar dista de los valores observados en los paises mas desarrollados como Chile (11% del PIB) y Brasil (15% del PIB) ya que solo alcanza al 3% del PIB. Un poco mas desarrollado -aunque aun en niveles bajos- se encuentra el segmento de prestamos hipotecarios con un 7% de PIB. Un rezago mas importante lo muestra el credito a empresas que solo llega al 12% del PIB mientras que en paises como Chile o Brasil llegan al 52% y 26% del PIB respectivamente. Asimismo, aunque el acceso a servicios financieros en Uruguay se ubica en torno a la media regional, la infraestructura bancaria, particularmente en terminos de ATM y POS esta por debajo del promedio de America Latina, al igual que el uso de medios de pago electronicos. La tesis implicita que discurre en este estudio es que la institucion bancaria es el actor que debe liderar un proceso serio de bancarizacion en un pais. Desde una perspectiva tecnica amplia, se entiende el rol que cumplen determinadas instituciones financieras no bancarias tales como las cajas de ahorro, mutuales, cooperativas, y organizaciones no gubernamentales, para aproximarse a determinados segmentos de la poblacion. Sin embargo, debe entenderse las varias limitaciones estructurales que enfrentan estas instituciones no bancarias para constituirse en actores de cambio en un proceso de bancarizacion (capacidad y costo del financiamiento, economÃƒÂ­as a escala, desarrollos en la gestion de riesgo, cuadros profesionales, supervision amplia por parte de los entes reguladores, entre otras). En el informe comentamos algunos casos como los de China, Bangladesh e India, paises donde se ha impulsado mucho el desarrollo de instituciones no bancarias para la profundizacion financiera, pero que a la postre terminan enfrentando varios cuellos de botella. No hay que olvidar ademas experiencias en Latinoamerica de los fracasos financieros de estas instituciones no bancarias. Incluso experiencias recientes en Europa (el caso de Espana con las Cajas), reflejan que los riesgos de estas instituciones siempre estan presentes cuando se sobredimensionan. Con todo ello, el presente analisis ha buscado brindar recomendaciones para impulsar la bancarizacion en Uruguay, enfocandose en los factores institucionales y en factores propios de la industria bancaria que condicionan el desarrollo de los mercados de ahorro y credito. En cuanto al entorno institucional, se senalan dos medidas que beneficiarian el proceso de bancarizacion del pais: potenciar la cobertura de informacion a la que tienen acceso las centrales de riesgo y reducir el tiempo y costo de registrar propiedades y garantias. El desarrollo del pilar institucional es clave para asegurar al acreedor el cumplimiento por parte del sujeto de credito del prestamo otorgado. Por el lado de los factores propios de la industria bancaria, destacan medidas para impulsar el acceso de la poblacion de menores recursos a productos y servicios financieros. Se plantea discutir alternativas que permitan a los individuos profundizar el uso del sistema bancario para hacer frente a sus necesidades transaccionales, tales como implementar la obligatoriedad de que las empresas realicen el pago de sus nominas a traves del sistema financiero o implementar cuentas de afiliacion automatica de bajo costo. Ambas medidas se verian potenciadas con propuestas para incentivar fiscalmente los pagos que se realizan con tarjetas de debito a traves de descuentos del IVA, y con el fomento del modelo de cajeros corresponsales. Dado el amplio margen que existe para impulsar el credito a empresas, es importante incentivar la penetracion de los prestamos a MPYMES ya que, de un total de 114.000 empresas que existen en Uruguay, la gran mayoria son de pequeno o mediano tamano y practicamente un tercio de ellas no utiliza los servicios bancarios. La alternativa de financiamiento bancario podria mejorar la capacidad productiva de las firmas y con ello incrementar su negocio y rentabilidad, incentivando una mayor formalizacion. Una forma de incursionar en la financiacion a estas empresas podria venir dada por el factoring como se conoce habitualmente al financiamiento por medio del descuento de facturas comerciales. Un elemento importante a discutirse como parte de una reforma integral es el de los altos costos que enfrenta el sector bancario, como consecuencias de normativas que la afectan directamente. Varios estudios -en particular uno desarrollado recientemente por el Fondo Monetario Internacional (2011)- indican que los costos laborales tienen el mayor impacto sobre los resultados financieros de la banca. El mismo informe senala que este factor ha restringido el potencial de desarrollo de la banca y ha incentivado la aparicion de otros intermediarios financieros no bancarios, con regulacion menos astringente que el que recibe el sector bancario. En ese sentido, es importante que los hacedores de politica en el pais tengan en cuenta esta problematica a fin de sopesar los riesgos de limitar, con estos sobre costos, la capacidad de que la actividad bancaria expanda sus servicios a mayores segmentos de la poblacion. De acuerdo a estimaciones de BBVA Research en base a un modelo estadistico de crecimiento del credito y al crecimiento economico potencial, si Uruguay no llevara a cabo ninguna reforma, se estima que el nivel de Credito pasaria de un 18% del PIB en el ano 2010 a un 32,5% del PIB en el ano 2020, gracias a la demanda generada por el crecimiento de la economia y a factores de convergencia en el desarrollo financiero. Las recomendaciones que se hacen en este estudio estan pensadas para ponerse en practica de manera conjunta. Se estima que en un escenario conservador la implementacion de las propuestas realizadas lleve la bancarizacion, medida como el ratio de credito/PIB, a 53.9% del producto en los proximos diez anos, mientras que en un escenario algo mas optimista se podria superar el 68.4%. Lo anterior, sin considerar el impacto que podria tener el efecto de otras medidas que contribuyan a continuar reduciendo la informalidad en Uruguay, con lo que el impacto podria superar el 76% en el escenario alto.
B26|John M. Keynes and His Anti-Crisis Program|The paper presents some crucial fiscal and monetary actions proposed by John M. Keynes in order to struggle with the consequences of the Great Depression. The recent world financial crisis lasting since 2007–2008 restored their significance and efficiency. Nowadays, Keynes’s proposals are explicitly used to create numerous public decisions aimed at active economic stabilization. Keynes’s proposition concerning the necessary reform of the international payments system, however, remains unnoticed and undervalued. Still it seems to be particularly adequate for current situation of the Euro countries.
B26|Law in Finance|No abstract is available for this item.
B26|A legal theory of finance|This paper develops the building blocks for a legal theory of finance. LTF holds that financial markets are legally constructed and as such occupy an essentially hybrid place between state and market, public and private. At the same time, financial markets exhibit dynamics that frequently put them in direct tension with commitments enshrined in law or contracts. This is the case especially in times of financial crisis when the full enforcement of legal commitments would result in the self-destruction of the financial system. This law-finance paradox tends to be resolved by suspending the full force of law where the survival of the system is at stake; that is, at its apex. It is here that power becomes salient.
B26|Toward a supply-side theory of financial innovation|Innovation. The word is evocative of ideas, products and processes which have somehow made the world a better place. Prior to the global financial crisis, many viewed financial innovation as unequivocally falling into this category. Underpinning this view was a pervasive belief in the self-correcting nature of markets and their consequent optimality as mechanisms for allocating society’s resources. This belief exerted a profound influence on how we regulated financial markets and institutions.

B26|Mihail Manoilescu’s international trade theories in retrospect: how and when emerging economies must be protected?|Mihail Manoilescu was one of the main intellectual personalities of the interwar period in Romania. He was known as a politician and a central banker, but also as an economist. From the very beginning of his theoretical and practical career, or at least from the late 1920s till the end of his life, Manoilescu’s ideas and theories were marked by a clear continuity and consistency based on the theory of protectionism. His defence of protectionism is generally presented as clumsy and founded on incorrect method. This paper contributes to a testament of Manoilescu’s conclusions, the validity of which we test in two different paradigms. Section 2 presents the theory of protectionism formulated by the author. Section 3 tries to interpret Manoilescu’s views in modern terms. It presents arguments assimilating his analysis to some post-Marxist presentations of the after-war period. It also develops a Ricardian model proving that Manoilescu’s intuitions can be verified in a Ricardian context. The last section concludes.

B26|The Problem Of Quantifying The Underground Economy: Applying The Method Of Metered Resources|The Underground Economy is a „shadow” of the real economy, endowed with elastic properties: it can be large, small (although not null) based on the specifics of a country, its leaders, economic and legal policies. In relation to the real economy, which is monitored by authorities, the underground economy is usually in a state of growth. In this context, methodologically-practical developments for quantitative estimation of unofficial economic activities are of interest. The problem is generated by a lack of a statistical accounting system, a system of economical indicators in the real economy that would serve as basis for a quantitative estimate of indicators pertaining to the underground economy.

B26|Финансиализация И Современные Экономические Кризисы<BR>[Financialization and Modern Economic Crises]|English Abstract. The paper deals with financialization as a process of converting financial capital into fictive and virtual capital, and its separation from the real, productive sphere. It points to the enormous growth of the financial sector during the last decades of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century, and the increasing dispersal of financial instruments as a consequence of financial innovations whose purpose, among other things, is to avoid the effects of state regulatory measures, resulting in their growing influence on movements in the real and the financial sphere and on the creation of conditions for the appearance of financial crises. Contemporary recessions, such as the one that broke out in 2007, have very little in common with standard cyclical fluctuations to which Schumpeter referred as «creative destruction». They are not influenced by fluctuations in the real sphere but are, rather, a product of the above-described processes of separation of the financial and the real sphere, which has grown too weak to sustain the huge financial superstructure that has been erected over it. The convergence of financial capital with corporations and the state has resulted in the consolidation of a powerful mass of oligarchic capital, embodied in the Wall Street – U. S. Department of Finance – IMF triad, which de facto holds the financial, economic and political power in the U.S. and the world. In that sense, all talk about regulation and deregulation becomes irrelevant, as the current crisis has shown: the processes of financialization prepared the way for the onset of the crisis, while regulative and other state measures can only (re)direct huge financial flows and control the timing and dosage of the strength of the crisis. Russian Abstract. В статье рассматривается «финансиализация» ‒ процесс трансформации финансового капитала в фиктивный и виртуальный капитал и его отделение от реальной, производственной сферы. Показан громадный рост финансового сектора в течение последних декад XX-го и в начале нового столетия и всё большая расчлененность финансовых инструментов как последствие финансовых нововведений, направленных, между прочим, к уклонению от регулятивных мероприятий государства – мероприятий, усиливающих его влияние на тенденции в реальной и финансовой сфере, что ведёт к созданию условий для возникновения финансовых кризисов. У современных рецессий мало общего со стандартными циклическими колебаниями, описанными Шумпетером как созидательное разрушение. Они возникли не под влиянием колебаний инвестиций в реальной сфере, но являются результатом описанных процессов отделения финансовой от реальной сферы, оказавшейся совершенно немощной для столь большой финансовой надстройки. Сплетение финансового капитала с корпорациями и государством сделало возможным укрепление мощного олигархического капитала, олицетворённого в триаде «Уолл Стрит – Министерство финансов – МВФ», в руках коей находятся фактическая финансовая, экономическая и политическая власть и в США, и в мире в целом. В связи с этим вопрос о регулировании и дерегулировании становится уже малозначимым, что и показал актуальный кризис: процессы «финансиализации» подготовили возникновение кризиса, а регулятивные и другие мероприятия государства в состоянии лишь (пере)направлять огромные финансовые потоки и определять время и мощь возникновения и проявления кризиса.
B26|Impact Of Cooperative Societies Savings Scheme In Rural Finance: Some Evidence From Nigeria|This paper examines the extent to which savings products offered by cooperative societies in some parts of Nigeria meet the financial needs of the rural dwellers. The study used the data from interviews and focus group discussions from randomly selected members of cooperative societies in six local governments. The data are analyzed using percentages, content analysis and quotation. The study found that the savings product helps to inculcate a good savings habit among the participants because they find it easier to save now than when they were introduced to the program. The members also developed self esteem as -part owners- of the program because of the compulsory savings that they participate in, and they do not want the program to collapse. Members are also satisfied because they are able to save in the scheme which helps them to reduce their expenses on frivolous spending such as leisure drinking and acquisition of more wives. The members’ inability to withdraw from their savings when in financial need, except on cessation of membership, was found as the drawback of the program.

B26|The theory of reflexivity: A non-stochastic randomness theory for business schools only?|The Alchemy of Finance, a book written by George Soros (1987) on the workings of financial markets, 'has found a place in the reading lists of business schools as distinct from economics departments', according to the author (2003, 4). His theory of reflexivity, which is at the center of the book, states that interdependence exists between the cognitive and manipulative functions of market participants. While Soros claims that imperfect knowledge rules on financial markets, academic orthodoxy assumes perfect knowledge and hence displays - in the absence of external shocks - financial markets as efficient. We review the work of Soros on reflexivity and follow up his claim that it can be used to attack the efficient market hypothesis. Both are discussed and then the ideas of Soros are compared to those of Post-Keynesian economics. We argue that Soros' book is mainly ignored by neo-classical economists because they disagree with his axioms, and by heterodox economists because his ideas are not new.
B26|Does intrinsic value still have a role in capital market pricing?|In this study I make an effort to prove that market price signals are less subject to individual behavioural distortion than those sharing the idea of prevailing irrational investor behaviour, and that intrinsic value plays a major role in the market price. With stock market bubbles, the balance between market and intrinsic value temporarily splits: during a crisis many stocks become overvalued, their prices being higher than their intrinsic value. Furthermore, among the reasons for market anomalies short-termism can be mentioned which indirectly leads to misjudgement of the underlying risk as investors pay less attention to low probability outcomes.
B26|Lineamientos para impulsar el Credito y el Ahorro en el Peru|El presente estudio identifica un conjunto de elementos que condicionan el desarrollo de la bancarizacion, enfatizando en los factores de caracter macroeconomico, estructural e institucional. A partir ello, el estudio brinda algunas recomendaciones para impulsar la bancarizacion en Peru. De manera especifica, el trabajo identifica espacios para potenciar la cobertura de informacion a la que tienen acceso las centrales de riesgo, la formalizacion de la propiedad y mejorar el esquema de garantias, con un registro mas simple y menos costoso, un uso eficiente de las garantias y mayor transparencia en los procesos de remate judicial. Asimismo, por el lado de los factores propios de la industria bancaria, el desarrollo de productos y servicios que permita a esta acercarse a la poblacion de menores recursos requerira en algunos casos del apoyo del Estado. En primer lugar, es indispensable insistir con la obligatoriedad de que las empresas realicen el pago de sus planillas a traves del sistema financiero. Asimismo, se recomienda implementar cuentas default de bajo costo y mayores inversiones en puntos de venta con tarjetas de debito o credito (POS), incentivar fiscalmente los pagos que se realizan con tarjetas, fomentar el modelo de cajeros corresponsales (simplificacion legal para establecerlos), impulsar el credito bancario en sectores como el de las micro y pequenas empresas a traves del empleo de facturas comerciales como medio de financiamiento, dandole liquidez a parte de los activos de las pequenas y micro empresas y reduciendo sus costos. Para ello, es necesario asegurar que el reglamento para este tipo de operacion financiera sea claro y preciso, sin vacios que generen incertidumbre y encarezcan su utilizacion. Las recomendaciones que se hacen en este estudio estan pensadas para ponerse en practica de manera conjunta. Se estima que, en un escenario conservador, la implementacion de las propuestas realizadas llevaria la profundizacion bancaria (medida a traves del monto de las colocaciones bancarias) a mas de 65 por cien en los proximos diez anos.
B26|Expanding Credit and Savings in Peru|"This study identifies a set of elements that determine the development of banking penetration, emphasizing macroeconomic, structural and institutional factors. The study also offers some recommendations aimed at promoting credit and savings in Peru. Specifically, the study identifies how to improve the coverage of information available to credit reporting bureaus, the formalization of property ownership and the system of guarantees, thus introducing a simpler and less costly registry, efficient use of guarantees and greater transparency in judicial auctions. With regards to factors inherent to the banking industry, developing products and services that are accessible to lower income populations will in some cases require state support. Firstly, it is essential that companies be required to pay salaries via the financial system. Likewise, \""low cost default accounts\"" are recommended, in addition to increased investment in point-of-sale terminals for use with credit or debit cards (POS), tax incentives for payments made with cards and optimizing the correspondent ATM system (simplifying legalities). Bank lending should also be promoted in sectors such as the micro and small enterprises sector by use of commercial invoices as a means of funding, thus generating liquidity via other assets at micro and small enterprises and cutting their costs. To this end the regulations covering such financial operations must be clear and precise, with no gaps that might lead to uncertainty or make their use more expensive. The recommendations laid out in this study have been designed to be put into practice jointly. It is estimated that in a conservative scenario, implementing the proposals would increase banking penetration (measured by bank placements) by more than 65% over the next ten years."
B26|Banking penetration in Uruguay|"In recent years, financial depth ratios in Uruguay have trended upwards, although without reaching the levels seen prior to the crisis at the start of the century. The ratio of credit to GDP in 2010 was near 18%, while the ratio of deposits exceeded 33%. However, Uruguay is still lagging behind the regional average, above all in the ratio of credit to GDP, and it is even behind a number of countries with lower levels of per capita income. By segments, credit for household consumption in Uruguay falls far short of the levels observed in more developed countries like Chile (11% of GDP) and Brazil (15% of GDP), as such credit amounts to only 3% of GDP. The segment of mortgage loans is a bit more developed - although still at low levels - at 7% of GDP. A more significant lag can be seen in corporate credit, which amounts to only 12% of GDP, whereas in countries like Chile or Brazil, it amounts to 52% and 26% of GDP, respectively. Moreover, although access to financial services in Uruguay stands at approximately the regional average, banking infrastructure - particularly in terms of ATMs and POS - is below the average of Latin America, as is the use of electronic means of payment. The underlying thesis of this study is that banking institutions must assume the role of leading a serious process of increasing banking penetration in the country. From a broad technical perspective, an understanding exists of the role played by certain non-bank financial institutions, such as savings banks, mutual societies, cooperatives and non-governmental organisations, in reaching specific population segments. However, such non-bank institutions face a number of structural limitations in becoming agents for change in a banking penetration process, such as the financing capacity and cost, economies of scale, development in risk management, professional staffing and broad supervision by regulatory bodies, among others. Our report discusses cases such as those of China, Bangladesh and India, where significant efforts have been made to develop non-bank institutions to deepen the coverage of financial services, but which ultimately face a number of obstacles. Nor should we forget the financial failures of such non-bank institutions in Latin America. Even recent experiences in Europe (such as Spain and its savings banks) show that the risks of such institutions always make themselves felt when they become too large. Hence, this analysis has sought to provide recommendations for driving deepening banking in Uruguay, focusing on both institutional factors and those inherent to the banking sector that condition the development of savings and credit markets. With regard to the institutional environment, two measures are identified that would benefit the banking penetration process of the country: strengthening the scope of information to which risk centres have access and reducing the time and cost of registering properties and guarantees. Development of the institutional pillar is essential for assuring creditors that borrowers will repay loans. Factors intrinsic to the banking sector include measures to boost access of lower income segments to financial products and services. Options are considered to enable individuals to deepen their use of the banking system to meet their transactional needs, such as making it mandatory for employers to pay wages through the financial system or implementing \\\""low cost automatic enrolment accounts\\\"". Both measures would be strengthened by proposals for tax incentives for payments made with debit cards through VAT discounts, and by promotion of the banking correspondent model. Given the wide margin for expanding corporate credit, it is important to incentivise the penetration of loans to MSMEs, as the vast majority of the 114,000 enterprises in Uruguay are small and medium-sized and nearly a third of them do not use banking services. Bank financing could enhance enterprises\\\' productive capacity and help grow their business and profitability, thus incentivising greater formalisation. One way of beginning to provide financing to these enterprises might be factoring, as financing through discounts on trade invoices is commonly known.One important item to be discussed as part of a comprehensive reform is the high costs borne by the banking sector in Uruguay, as the consequence of regulations that directly affect it. Several studies - particularly, a recent one by the International Monetary Fund (2011) - indicate that labour costs have the largest impact on the banking sector\\\'s financial results. The same report points out that this factor has limited the potential for growth of the banking sector in Uruguay and incentivised the appearance of non-bank financial intermediaries that are subject to less stringent regulation than the banking sector. Thus, it is important for the country\\\'s lawmakers to bear in mind these problems and be aware of the risk that such \\\""extra costs\\\"" will limit the capacity of the banking sector to expand its services to broader segments of the population.According to the estimates of BBVA Research based on a statistical model of credit growth and potential economic growth, if Uruguay makes no reforms, the level of credit would increase from 18% of GDP in 2010 to 32.5% of GDP in 2020, owing to the demand generated by growth of the economy and to factors of convergence in financial development. The recommendations set forth in this study are conceived to be implemented jointly. It is estimated that in a conservative scenario, implementation of the proposals will lead to banking penetration, measured as the credit-to-GDP ratio, of 53.9% of GDP in the next ten years, whereas in a more optimistic scenario, it could exceed 68.4%. The foregoing is without taking into account the impact of other measures that could contribute to reducing informality in Uruguay. Hence, the impact could surpass 76% in a best-case scenario."
B26|A dynamic default dependence model|We develop a dynamic multivariate default model for a portfolio of credit-risky assets in which default times are modelled as random variables with possibly different marginal distributions, and Lï¿½vy subordinators are used to model the dependence among default times. In particular, we define a cumulative dynamic hazard process as a Lï¿½vy subordinator, which allows for jumps and induces positive probabilities of joint defaults. We allow the main asset classes in the portfolio to have different cumulative default probabilities and corresponding different cumulative hazard processes. Under this heterogeneous assumption we compute the portfolio loss distribution in closed form. Using an approximation of the loss distribution, we calibrate the model to the tranches of the iTraxx Europe. Once the multivariate default distribution has been estimated, we analyse the distress dependence in the portfolio by computing indicators of systemic risk, such as the Stability Index, the Distress Dependence Matrix and the Probability of Cascade Effects.
B26|Reviewing the proposals for common bond issuances by the euro-area sovereign under a long-term perspective|The paper examines proposals for euro bonds. The aim is to highlight the broader context of various proposals and, in particular, to assess their impact less as a solution to the problems of the current economic and financial conjuncture and, more, to focus on their long-term consequences for monetary union. To this end, the paper reviews the literature related to past proposals for establishing a fiscal union as well as proposals for sharing liabilities between euro area states. The implications for European bond pricing are also discussed. The fact that the issuance of common euro bonds could result in a regime shift suggests that the yield demanded by markets will be lower than the simple weighted average of yields before common issuance. The potential cost for the lowest risk countries will thus be commensurately smaller than often argued.
B26|Book reviews|This paper reviews the classics of financial economics with the benefit of insight offered by the recent financial crisis. The failure of mainstream financial models to explain the observed behavior of markets is put in relation with Itzhak Gilboa’s critique of the decisional model used for assessing choice under uncertainty. The paper argues that Gilboa’s attempt to develop an alternative theory of decision under uncertainty has a clear Keynesian derivation.
B26|Spatial Concentration in the Financial Industry|This paper investigates factors that determine the spatial concentration in the financial industry. Why does the financial industry have such a high spatial concentration? The theoretical framework is based on theories from regional economics, with a focus on agglomeration effects, externalities, and the regional clustering of an industry. The positive agglomeration effects arise from access to i) specialized labor, ii) specialized suppliers, and iii) knowledge dispersion (Marshall 1920). Jacobs (1961, 1969) contributes to a discussion of the role of cities (urban economies) in terms of innovations and entrepreneurship. The high degree of spatial concentration in the financial sector emphasizes the importance of local embeddedness, networks, face-to-face communication, knowledge spillovers, and spatial proximity for the organization of the financial industry. These factors accentuate the importance of local knowledge and the dispersion of knowledge, factors that have been thoroughly discussed and analyzed in the field of Austrian economics. Therefore, an Austrian view is included to examine the role of knowledge in the spatial concentration of financial centers. Scholars such as Hayek (1937; 1945) and Lachmann (1978 [1956]) contribute to understanding the use of knowledge in society.
B26|New Approaches to Monetary Policy in the Context of Actual Financial Crisis|As a result of economic turmoil started in 2007, some questions have been risen whether monetary policy suffers radical changes or just rethinking the details of the basic monetary policy stance. Therefore, in this article, inter alia, we have analyzed the monetary policy relationship with the financial stability. In the context of actual crises, monetary policy should consider whether to rely on credit bubbles and to clean up after their explosion or to interfere and fight against financial fragility during both the financial boom and bust (Lean vs. Clean debate)
B26|Pro Growth Monetary Policy in Africa: Monetarist versus Keynesian Approach|The relative positive economic growth experienced by most African countries in the recent decade has come with insufficient demand stimulation. The concern of poverty at the forefront of economic policy, the need for inclusive growth and sustainable development, inter alia, brings forward the inevitable question of the monetary policy responsibility. Accordingly, the monetarist theory that focuses on price stability inherently neglects the demand stimulation aspect of economic prosperity. Since the mid 1980s, the monetarist school driven by its central aim of fighting inflation and maintaining credibility in markets and economic agents has been priority for monetary authorities (especially in Africa). To this effect, while good results in terms of inflation targeting has been achieved in many African countries; economic growth has sometimes been low. Hence, in light of the above, using a statistical and theoretical debate method, the Credible Monetary Policy (CMP)i paradox is traceable to Africa. Accordingly, with the promising economic environment in Africa, we recommend the promotion of a monetary policy oriented toward improving economic growth under the constraint of price stability. In light of the above view, there are some note worthy signs such the recent decision by the two CFA zone central banks to either maintain interest rates at a low level or reduce it despite tightening measures of monetary policy taken by the European Central Bank (ECB) earlier in the year. In the same vein, the central bank of South Africa has maintained its policy of low interest rates with an objective of economic expansion. Since, the 2008 financial crisis, the consolidation of the Federal Reserve’s declared final objective of lowering interest rates and making emergency loans is an eloquent example to reassure African central banks in the choice of the pro-growth monetary policy option.
B26|Revisiting the socialist calculation debate: the role of markets and finance in Hayek’s response to Lange’s challenge|In the early twentieth century, a range of writers produced visions of a socialist economy whose distinguishing characteristic was an allocation of resources using a ‘technical’ perspective. In the 1930s, Oskar Lange took up the challenge of Ludwig von Mises’ claim of the ‘impossibility’ of constructing a socialist economy on such an engineering basis. He readily acceded to the need for efficiency calculations to be made in value terms rather than using purely natural or engineering criteria, but claimed that these values could emerge without a market for capital goods, and without private ownership of capital. Friedrich Hayek replied stressing the dynamic aspects of competition in the context of the capital market; the latter is to be seen as a discovery procedure wherein production possibilities must not be taken for granted. Thus, socialist calculation is impossible because of the absence of those markets for capital and risk that evaluate the success or failure of different investment decisions under capitalism. Appraising this debate, we emerge with two findings. First, Lange's contribution was based on a one-sided, static conception of the capitalist economy, and therefore of the construction of a socialist alternative. Second, the Austrian approach only surreptitiously concedes the key role of finance in its defence of the dynamic properties of capitalism. And yet it is the very gyrations and instability emerging from the financial sector in capitalism that was one of the central factors motivating the search for an alternative engineering method of allocation in the first place. The latter point invites us to reconsider the place of finance in various schools of economics in mainstream thinking.
B26|Neologism as Theoretical Innovation in Economics: The case of 'Financialisation'|The term 'financialisation' is a recognition that finance has come to play a key role on the modern capitalist economy. But users of the term do not agree on its meaning and recognition of the growing scale of finance has not brought about an increased understanding of financial processes. The paper examines the reasons for increased turnover in financial markets. The main themes in the literature on financialisation are examined and shown to lack a coherent account of financial processes that goes beyond the evidence of financial activity.
B26|Moeda e acumulação de capital: Keynes, Robertson e o conceito de poupança|This paper retrieves the central elements of John Maynard Keynes and Dennis Holme Robertson’s views about the concept of saving during the 1920 and 1930s. The first section covers the partnership between both economists at the beginning of the period, as well as their respective theories on the behavior of the diverse kinds of savings, particularly the ones of a compulsory nature, along the cyclical process of capital accumulation. After that, the principle of effective demand and the multiplier theory, as developed in Keynes’ General Theory, are examined in order to identify how these ideas moved away from the kind of analysis associated with the forced saving doctrine. Following this, the attention is focused on Robertson’s criticisms of the income-multiplier mechanism. Finally, the last section discusses Keynes’s counter argument, especially the adjustment he conducted in his theory of investment by incorporating the notion of finance into the liquidity demand function. The concluding remarks sum up the main points of the debate, evaluating its most important theoretical repercussions.
B26|Moeda, crédito e ciclos econômicos em Marshall|This paper retrieves Alfred Marshall’s analysis of commercial cycles and the role of both speculation and credit in the different phases of this process. After a brief introduction to the subject, Marshall’s contributions to two distinct areas of his theory of economic fluctuations are presented, the first being the Marshallian concept of interest rates and the second his restatement of the Quantity Theory of Money as the basis for the price level determination. Next, comes Marshall explanation of the business cycles as such, followed by its formal dynamic version through a system of differential equations which shows that when inexperienced speculators dominate the demand for credit money, the commercial cycles will likely be quite intense within the framework of the Marshallian macroeconomic approach.
B26|Silent conversion to anti-statism: Historical origins of the belief in market superiority|Despite severe economic turmoil within the last decade the stock diagnosis for most market insufficiencies has been: the state must be 'slimmed down'. Satisfying social needs through the free market under the slogan of 'less government is good government' has been a constitutive feature of economic policy since the rise of neoliberalism in the 1980s. But even as the deregulation of the markets and the 'downsizing' of the state causes growing social turbulences - especially in the context of the current financial and economic meltdown - politicians, scholars and the media still cling to the idea of an omnipotent market. Deeprooted and widely-spread anti-statism still fulfils the role of a creed serving to legitimize the necessity of market-centred 'reforms'.
B26|Mit noch mehr indirekten Steuern zurück zum wohlfahrtsorientierten Staat?: Nur Luxussteuern wären ein richtiger Weg|"It is out of question that the German state is chronically underfinanced. There is a public poverty in form of government borrowing on the one hand and on the other hand there is an unequal divided property for the private people. The chronic-structural under financing of the state is not due to the too high government expenditures, respectively a too high share of the state in distribution, but because of too little tax receipts. This fact is due to high government expenditures as a result of the reunification and because of the long lasting mass unemployment in Germany. Within the background of the practiced neoliberal economic policy since about 1970th, this was a result of a gigantic redistribution from the earned income to the unearned income, also massive direct tax cuts for firms, rich earned income and wealthy people were realized. In this way the governmental redistribution increases the anyhow existing inequality of income and property. At the same time the indirect taxes were strongly raised, this is especially intended for the general sales taxes, to the disadvantage of the low-income persons with saving rates of zero. This was and is a wrong tax-political way. Whereas the right way would be in the area of the indirect taxes, the rise of an income dependent luxury tax, that is to say ""general sales tax-top-surcharge"", and an urgent necessary increase of the direct taxes on profits, income and property. Es steht außer Frage, der deutsche Staat ist chronisch unterfinanziert. Man kann von einer öffentlichen Armut in Form von Staatsverschuldung sprechen, der auf der anderen Seite ein gleich großes, aber völlig ungleich verteiltes Vermögen als privater Reichtum gegenübersteht. Die chronisch-strukturelle Unterfinanzierung des Staates liegt dabei aber nicht an zu hohen Staatsausgaben beziehunsweise einer zu hohen Staatsquote, sondern an zu geringen Steuereinnahmen. Dies vor allen Dingen in Anbetracht der hohen Ausgaben in Folge der Wiedervereinigung und der seit langem bestehenden Massenarbeitslosigkeit in Deutschland. Im Rahmen der seit etwa Mitte der 70er Jahre praktizierten neoliberalen Wirtschaftspolitik, die gigantische Umverteilungen von den Arbeits- zu den Besitzeinkommen zur Folge hatte, wurden auch massive direkte Steuersenkungen für Unternehmen, Einkommensreiche und Vermögende auf den Weg gebracht. Auf diese Weise verstärkte die staatliche Sekundärverteilung die ohnehin bestehende Ungleichverteilung von Einkommen und Vermögen. Gleichzeitig wurden die indirekten Steuern, dies gilt insbesondere für die Umsatzsteuer, zum Nachteil Einkommensschwacher mit Sparquoten von null kräftig erhöht. Dies war und ist ein falscher steuerpolitischer Weg. Richtig wären dagegen im Bereich der indirekten Steuern die Erhebung einer einkommensabhängigen Luxussteuer, sozusagen als ""Umsatzsteuer-Top-Zuschlag"", und eine dringend notwendige Erhöhung der direkten Steuern auf Unternehmensgewinne, Einkommen und Vermögen gewesen."
B26|Financial Keynesianism and Market Instability|"In this paper I will follow Hyman Minsky in arguing that the postwar period has seen a slow transformation of the economy from a structure that could be characterized as ""robust"" to one that is ""fragile."" While many economists and policymakers have argued that ""no one saw it coming,"" Minsky and his followers certainly did! While some of the details might have surprised Minsky, certainly the general contours of this crisis were foreseen by him a half century ago. I will focus on two main points: first, the past four decades have seen the return of ""finance capitalism""; and second, the collapse that began two years ago is a classic ""Fisher-Minsky"" debt deflation. The appropriate way to analyze this transformation and collapse is from the perspective of what Minsky called ""financial Keynesianism""—a label he preferred over Post Keynesian because it emphasized the financial nature of the capitalist economy he analyzed."
B26|A Minskyan Road to Financial Reform|"In the aftermath of the global financial collapse that began in 2007, governments around the world have responded with reform. The outlines of Basel III have been announced, although some have already dismissed its reform agenda as being too little (and too late!). Like the proposed reforms in the United States, it is argued, Basel III would not have prevented the financial crisis even if it had been in place. The problem is that the architects of reform are working around the edges, taking current bank activities as somehow appropriate and trying to eliminate only the worst excesses of the 2000s. Hyman Minsky would not be impressed. Before we can reform the financial system, we need to understand what the financial system does—or, better, what it should do. To put it as simply as possible, Minsky always insisted that the proper role of the financial system is to promote the ""capital development"" of the economy. By this he did not simply mean that banks should finance investment in physical capital. Rather, he was concerned with creating a financial structure that would be conducive to economic development to improve living standards, broadly defined. In this paper, we first examine Minsky's general proposals for reform of the economy—how to restore stable growth that promotes job creation and rising living standards. We then turn to his proposals for financial reform. We will focus on his writing in the early 1990s, when he was engaged in a project at the Levy Economics Institute on reconstituting the financial system (Minsky 1992a, 1992b, 1993, 1996). As part of that project, he offered his insights on the fundamental functions of a financial system. These thoughts lead quite naturally to a critique of the financial practices that precipitated the global financial crisis, and offer a path toward thorough-going reform."
B26|Minsky crisis|This entry examines the approach of Hyman P. Minsky to financial crisis. Minsky famously developed an ‘investment theory of the cycle and a financial theory of investment'. His thesis was that, over the course of the cycle, behaviour changes in such a way that financial fragility develops. This makes a financial crisis more likely. When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, many commentators returned to the theories of Minsky, calling it a ‘Minsky crisis' or a ‘Minsky moment'. This entry agrees that Minsky deserves credit for identifying the processes that led up to the crisis. However, it is not sufficient to narrowly constrain the analysis to the transition that occurred over the past decade or so. Beginning in the 1980s and through to his death in 1996, Minsky had been arguing that a new form of capitalism had appeared, which he called ‘money manager capitalism'. In important respects it reproduced the conditions that Hilferding had called ‘finance capitalism' in the early 20th century – a form of capitalism that collapsed into the Great Depression. What Minsky was arguing was that an extremely unstable form of capitalism had emerged – one based on what is often called financialisation of the economy. He (rightly) feared that it would ultimately lead to a great crash. The rest of the entry looks at Minsky's proposals for reforms that would help to promote stability. Yet, as Minsky always said, stability is destabilising.
B26|Minsky's Money Manager Capitalism and the Global Financial Crisis|" The world's worst economic crisis since the 1930s is now well into its fourth year. Minsky's work has enjoyed unprecedented interest, with many calling this a ""Minsky moment"" or ""Minsky crisis"" and locating the beginnings of the crisis in the 2000s. I argue that we should not view this as a ""moment"" that can be traced to recent developments. Rather, we have seen a slow realignment of the global financial system toward what Minsky called ""money manager capitalism""—something like a return to prewar ""finance capitalism"" analyzed by Rudolf Hilferding, Thorstein Veblen, and John Maynard Keynes—and later by John Kenneth Galbraith. Getting out of this crisis will require radical policy changes no less significant than those adopted in the New Deal."
B26|Worlds in collision: uncertainty and risk in hard times|In this paper we revive the analytical distinction between risky choice settings, in which we have reliable probability distributions based on past observations, and choices made in the face of uncertainty, in which probabilities are either unknown or unknowable. Many political economists assume that we live only in a world of calculable risk. We contest that view in this article. Political and economic agents make many of their most important decisions under conditions of uncertainty, or in ambiguous situations that mix risk and uncertainty. Absent reliable estimates of calculable probabilities, social conventions or technologies, such as risk management models, are indispensible for agents to function in a world in which they must make potentially enormously rewarding or costly choices. We demonstrate the empirical payoffs of a analytical approach that makes room for both risk and uncertainty by drawing on the writings of a financial market insider, George Soros, and by analyzing decision making in the US Federal Reserve.
B26|The Role and Importance of Leverage Rates in the Financial Management of the Company|The aim of this article is to present an own vision regarding the role and importance of the analysis of the leverage rates seen as one of the key aspects of the financial management of the company. Our concerns have in view a theoretical and methodological approach of the debt ratios that can influence the financial activity of the company. Establishing the level of indebtedness is one of the most important financial policy decisions of the company. The analysis of the company indebtedness is a matter of internal management of the company through which it must ensure the effective use of loan contracts and the conditions necessary for the repayment terms and interest on outstanding rates. The rates are sizes that are expressed by number, points or term and are analysis tools used for knowing certain economic and financial historical or forecast phenomena, and also of the elements and factors causing them.
B26|. Relationship between Trade Openness and Inflation: Empirical Evidences from Pakistan (1976–2010)|This study empirically verifies the existence of significant relationship between inflation and trade openness for Pakistan using annual time-series data for the period of 1976 to 2010. The basic objective of this study is to examine the Romer‘s hypothesis for Pakistan with real agriculture value added, real exchange rate, real gross domestic product, financial market openness, money and quasi money and used trade openness, import openness and export openness ratios separately as explanatory variables with inflation rate as dependent variables. For this purpose, we have used multivariate Johansen (1998) and Johansen and Juselius (1990) Maximum Likelihood Cointegration Approach and a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) and the expected empirical findings shows that there is a significant positive long-run relationship between inflation and trade openness, which rejects the existence of Romer‘s hypothesis for Pakistan.
B26|A Note on Chapter 29 of Keynes’s Treatise on Money|The question posed by Chapter 29 of the Treatise is the following: Is it possible, for fluctuations in liquid capital to counterbalance fluctuations in working capital and thus provide the means – apart from the motive – for a recovery after a slump? This note attempts to give an account of how Keynes answers to this question by building a theory of the forward markets.
B26|František Vencovský and Karel Engliš - Two Important Anniversaries|Karel Engliš (1880 - 1961) one of the most prominent Czech economists, politicians and statesmen of the period between the two world wars died fifty years ago on the 30th of June 1961. He is valued for his contribution to the development of the economic theory as well as for his very significant part in making the Czechoslovak fiscal and monetary policy, which he formed both as the Finance Minister in six governments and the Governor of the National Bank of Czechoslovakia. His friend and follower František Vencovský (*1923) one of the most prominent Czech economists of the second half of the XX century died five years ago on the 5th of July 2006. He is valued for his contribution to the development of the history of the Czech economic thought, banking and monetary policy. He employed Engliš’s teleological method while finding solutions for contemporary issues especially in the area of money, exchange rate and monetary policy.
B26|Systemic Risk, an Empirical Approach|We have developed a quantitative analysis to verify the extent to which the sources of systemic risk identified in the academic and regulatory literature actually contribute to it.This analysis shows that all institutions contribute to systemic risk albeit to a different degree depending on various risk factors such as size, interconnection, unsubstitutability, balance sheet, and risk quality. From the analysis we conclude that using a single variable or a limited series of variables as a proxy for systemic risk generates considerable errors when identifying and measuring the systemic risk of each institution. When designing systemic risk mitigation measures, all contributing factors should be taken into account. Likewise, classifying institutions as systemic/non- systemic would mean giving similar treatment to institutions that could bear very different degrees of systemic risk, while treating differently institutions that may have very similar systemic risk inside. Consequently, we advocate that some continuous approach to systemic risk in which all institutions are deemed systemic, but to varying degrees, would be preferable. We acknowledge that this analysis may prove somehow limited given that it is not founded on a predefined conceptual approach, does not fully consider other very relevant qualitative factors and accounts only for some of the relevant sources of systemic risk in the banking system. These limits are currently set due to data availability and the current state of empirical research, but we believe that these should not hinder our work in identifying the true sources of systemic risk and our aim to help avoid any partial and thus limited prudential policy approach.
B26|Factoring: Alternative Model Of Financing|This paper aims to present factoring as an alternative funding model. This paper also tries to scientifically explore and emphasize its economic role thorough advantages and disadvantages of such financing model, and show condition in world and Croatia. Good corporate governance and professional financial management can contribute to the establishment of such business strategy (in terms of: strategy in relation to potential risks, the systems for managing risks and monitoring, investment strategies, interventions, etc.) that will make the company resistant to unexpected and unpredictable changes in both their environment and the global marketplace and timely actions to contribute to faster recover from the effects of the crisis and business damages reduced to a minimum recovery.
B26|Notes on the North-American Expansion in the Investment Market (1)|The article is about the phenomenon of investment expansion in the U.S. and it is the first part of a wider work the author completed with a second article. Here Pitigliani examines the most recent versions of the classical theory of international trade, focusing on the effects of foreign loans on the balance of payments, on exchange rates and interest rates differentials. The last are depicted as the main factor fostering the attainment of balance-of-payments equilibrium. Protectionist arguments against foreign lending are compared to liberal arguments with the balance clearly in favor of the latter.
B26|Optimal Investment under Partial Information|We consider the problem of maximizing terminal utility in a model where asset prices are driven by Wiener processes, but where the various rates of returns are allowed to be arbitrary semimartingales. The only information available to the investor is the one generated by the asset prices and, in particular, the return processes cannot be observed directly. This leads to an optimal control problem under partial information and for the cases of power, log, and exponential utility we manage to provide a surprisingly explicit representation of the optimal terminal wealth as well as of the optimal portfolio strategy. This is done without any assumptions about the dynamical structure of the return processes. We also show how various explicit results in the existing literature are derived as special cases of the general theory.
B26|Финансијализација Као Узрочник И Мултипликатор Кризе<BR>[Financialization as a Cause and Multiplier of the Crises]|The paper deals with financialization as a process of converting financial capital into fictive and virtual capital, and its separation from the real, productive sphere. It points to the enormous growth of the financial sector during the last decades of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century, and the increasing dispersal of financial instruments as a consequence of financial innovations whose purpose, among other things, is to avoid the effects of state regulatory measures, resulting in their growing influence on movements in the real and the financial sphere and on the creation of conditions for the appearance of financial crises. Contemporary recessions, such as the one that broke out in 2007, have very little in common with standard cyclical fluctuations to which Schumpeter referred as «creative destruction». They are not influenced by fluctuations in the real sphere but are, rather, a product of the above-described processes of separation of the financial and the real sphere, which has grown too weak to sustain the huge financial superstructure that has been erected over it. The convergence of financial capital with corporations and the state has resulted in the consolidation of a powerful mass of oligarchic capital, embodied in the Wall Street – U. S. Department of Finance – IMF triad, which de facto holds the financial, economic and political power in the U.S. and the world. In that sense, all talk about regulation and deregulation becomes irrelevant, as the current crisis has shown: the processes of financialization prepared the way for the onset of the crisis, while regulative and other state measures can only (re)direct huge financial flows and control the timing and dosage of the strength of the crisis.
B26|Lead with Cash:Cash Flow for Corporate Renewal|This book takes an entirely new look at how companies ought to be managed. It argues that managers need to focus on how corporate decisions affect the firm's cash. The author, who is well known in the fields of management and crisis management, suggests that companies that follow the paradigm presented in the book are more likely to survive tumultuous times, provide higher returns to their investors, and have a conducive work environment.

B26|Approximate Option Valuation For Arbitrary Stochastic Processes|AbstractWe show how a given probability distribution can be approximated by an arbitrary distribution in terms of a series expansion involving second and higher moments. This theoretical development is specialized to the problem of option valuation where the underlying security distribution, if not lognormal, can be approximated by a lognormally distributed random variable. The resulting option price is expressed as the sum of a Black–Scholes price plus adjustment terms which depend on the second and higher moments of the underlying security stochastic process. This approach permits the impact on the option price of skewness and kurtosis of the underlying stock's distribution to be evaluated.

B26|Arbitrage, Continuous Trading, and Margin Requirements|AbstractThis paper studies the impact that margin requirements have on both the existence of arbitrage opportunities and the valuation of call options. In the context of the Black-Scholes economy, margin restrictions are shown to exclude continuous-trading arbitrage opportunities and, with two additional hypotheses, still to allow the Black-Scholes call model to apply. The Black-Scholes economy consists of a continuously traded stock with a price process that follows a geometric Brownian motion and a continuously traded bond with a price process that is deterministic.

B26|Ex-Dividend Stock Price Behavior and Arbitrage Opportunities|AbstractThis paper investigates the relation between ex-dividend stock price behavior and arbitrage opportunities. In a continuous trading, frictionless economy, we demonstrate that it is possible for the ex-dividend stock price drop to differ from the dividend, and still short-term traders cannot generate arbitrage profits. Our argument is independent of transaction costs. The relevance of this insight to estimating the marginal tax bracket based on ex-dividend stock price drops is explored. Furthermore, this insight is also applied to the area of option pricing in which the special class of escrowed dividend stock price processes is studied. We show that most elements from this class of stock price processes generate invalid option pricing formulas.

B26|The Stop-Loss Start-Gain Paradox and Option Valuation: A New Decomposition into Intrinsic and Time Value| The downside risk in a leveraged stock position can be eliminated by using stop-loss orders. The upside potential of such a position can be captured using contingent buy orders. The terminal payoff to this stop-loss start-gain strategy is identical to that of a call option, but the strategy costs less initially. This article resolves this paradox by showing that the strategy is not self-financing for continuous stock- price processes of unbounded variation. The resolution of the paradox leads to a new decomposition of an option's price into its intrinsic and time value. When stock price follows geometric Brownian motion, this decomposition is proven to be mathematically equivalent to the Black-Scholes (1973) formula.

B26|Alternative Characterizations Of American Put Options|AbstractWe derive alternative representations of the McKean equation for the value of the American put option. Our main result decomposes the value of an American put option into the corresponding European put price and the early exercise premium. We then represent the European put price in a new manner. This representation allows us to alternatively decompose the price of an American put option into its intrinsic value and time value, and to demonstrate the equivalence of our results to the McKean equation.

B26|Market Manipulation, Bubbles, Corners, and Short Squeezes|AbstractThis paper investigates market manipulation trading strategies by large traders in a securities market. A large trader is defined as any investor whose trades change prices. A market manipulation trading strategy is one that generates positive real wealth with no risk. Market manipulation trading strategies are shown to exist under reasonable hypotheses on the equilibrium price process. Sufficient conditions for their nonexistence are also provided.

B26|Derivative Security Markets, Market Manipulation, and Option Pricing Theory|AbstractThis paper studies a new theory for pricing options in a large trader economy. This theory necessitates studying the impact that derivative security markets have on market manipulation. In an economy with a stock, money market account, and a derivative security, it is shown, by example, that the introduction of the derivative security generates market manipulation trading strategies that would otherwise not exist. A sufficient condition is provided on the price process such that no additional market manipulation trading strategies are introduced by a derivative security. Options are priced under this condition, where it is shown that the standard binomial option model still applies but with random volatilities.

B26|Liquidity risk and arbitrage pricing theory|AbstractClassical theories of financial markets assume an infinitely liquid market and that all traders act as price takers. This theory is a good approximation for highly liquid stocks, although even there it does not apply well for large traders or for modelling transaction costs. We extend the classical approach by formulating a new model that takes into account illiquidities. Our approach hypothesizes a stochastic supply curve for a security's price as a function of trade size. This leads to a new definition of a self-financing trading strategy, additional restrictions on hedging strategies, and some interesting mathematical issues.

B26|Pricing Options in an Extended Black Scholes Economy with Illiquidity: Theory and Empirical Evidence|AbstractThis article studies the pricing of options in an extended Black Scholes economy in which the underlying asset is not perfectly liquid. The resulting liquidity risk is modeled as a stochastic supply curve, with the transaction price being a function of the trade size. Consistent with the market microstructure literature, the supply curve is upward sloping with purchases executed at higher prices and sales at lower prices. Optimal discrete time hedging strategies are then derived. Empirical evidence reveals a significant liquidity cost intrinsic to every option.

B26|Liquidity Premiums And The Expectations Hypothesis|AbstractWithin the term structure of interest rate literature, three different quantifications of the expectations hypothesis are commonly employed. This paper demonstrates under very general conditions that the three quantifications are inconsistent. Each quantification implies a different price for the same bond. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of both the theoretical and empirical implications of these results.
B26|Forward Contracts And Futures Contracts|AbstractThis paper provides a detailed discussion of the similarities and differences between forward contracts and futures contracts. Under frictionless markets and continuous trading, simple arbitrage arguments are invoked to value forward contracts, to relate forward prices and spot prices, and to relate forward prices and futures prices. We also argue that forward prices need not equal futures prices unless default free interest rates are deterministic.

B26|Bond Pricing And The Term Structure Of Interest Rates: A New Methodology For Contingent Claims Valuation|AbstractThis paper presents a unifying theory for valuing contingent claims under a stochastic term structure of interest rates. The methodology, based on the equivalent martingale measure technique, takes as given an initial forward rate curve and a family of potential stochastic processes for its subsequent movements. A no arbitrage condition restricts this family of processes yielding valuation formulae for interest rate sensitive contingent claims which do not explicitly depend on the market prices of risk. Examples are provided to illustrate the key results.

B26|Pricing foreign currency options under stochastic interest rates|AbstractIn this paper, we build a general framework to price contingent claims on foreign currencies using the Heath et al. (1987) model of the term structure. Closed form solutions are obtained for European options on currencies and currency futures assuming that the volatility functions determining the term structure are deterministic. As such, this paper provides an example of a bond price process (for both the domestic and foreign economies) consistent with Grabbe's (1983) formulation of the same problem.

B26|Pricing Options On Risky Assets In A Stochastic Interest Rate Economy|AbstractThis paper studies contingent claim valuation of risky assets in a stochastic interest rate economy. The model employed generalizes the approach utilized by Heath, larrow, and Morton (1992) by imbedding their stochastic interest rate economy into one containing an arbitrary number of additional risky assets. We derive closed form formulae for certain types of European options in this context, notably call and put options on risky assets, forward contracts, and futures contracts. We also value American contingent claims whose payoffs are permitted to be general functions of both the term structure and asset prices generalizing Bensoussan (1984) and Karatzas (1988) in this regard Here, we provide an example where an American call's value is well defined, yet there does not exist an optimal trading strategy which attains this value. Furthermore, this example is not pathological as it is a generalization of Roll's (1977) formula for a call option on a stock that pays discrete dividends.
B26|Pricing Treasury Inflation Protected Securities and Related Derivatives using an HJM Model|AbstractThis paper uses an HJM model to price TIPS and related derivative securities. First, using the market prices of TIPS and ordinary U.S. Treasury securities, both the real and nominal zero-coupon bond price curves are obtained using standard coupon bond price stripping procedures. Next, a three-factor arbitrage-free term structure model is fit to the time-series evolutions of the CPI-U and the real and nominal zero-coupon bond price curves. Then, using these estimated term structure parameters, the validity of the HJM model for pricing TIPS is confirmed via its hedging performance. Lastly the usefulness of the pricing model is illustrated by valuing call options on the inflation index.

B26|Pricing Derivatives on Financial Securities Subject to Credit Risk|"AbstractThis article provides a new methodology for pricing and hedging derivative securities involving credit risk. Two types of credit risks are considered. The first is where the asset underlying the derivative security may default. The second is where the writer of the derivative security may default. We apply the foreign currency analogy of Jarrow and Turnbull (1991) to decompose the dollar payoff from a risky security into a certain payoff and a ""spot exchange rate."" Arbitrage-free valuation techniques are then employed. This methodology can be applied to corporate debt and over the counter derivatives, such as swaps and caps."

B26|A Markov Model for the Term Structure of Credit Risk Spreads| This article provides a Markov model for the term structure of credit risk spreads. The model is based on Jarrow and Turnbull (1995), with the bankruptcy process following a discrete state space Markov chain in credit ratings. The parameters of this process are easily estimated using observable data This model is useful for pricing and hedging corporate debt with imbedded options, for pricing and hedging OTC derivatives with counterparts risk, for pricing and hedging (foreign) government bonds subject to default risk (e.g., municipal bonds), for pricing and hedging credit derivatives, and for risk management.

B26|Default Risk And Diversification: Theory And Empirical Implications|"AbstractRecent advances in the theory of credit risk allow the use of standard term structure machinery for default risk modeling and estimation. The empirical literature in this area often interprets the drift adjustments of the default intensity's diffusion state variables as the only default risk premium. We show that this interpretation implies a restriction on the form of possible default risk premia, which can be justified through exact and approximate notions of ""diversifiable default risk."" The equivalence between the empirical and martingale default intensities that follows from diversifiable default risk greatly facilitates the pricing and management of credit risk. We emphasize that this is not an equivalence in distribution, and illustrate its importance using credit spread dynamics estimated in Duffee (1999). We also argue that the assumption of diversifiability is implicitly used in certain existing models of mortgage-backed securities."

B26|Counterparty Risk and the Pricing of Defaultable Securities|"AbstractMotivated by recent financial crises in East Asia and the United States where the downfall of a small number of firms had an economy-wide impact, this paper generalizes existing reduced-form models to include default intensities dependent on the default of a counterparty. In this model, firms have correlated defaults due not only to an exposure to common risk factors, but also to firm-specific risks that are termed ""counterparty risks."" Numerical examples illustrate the effect of counterparty risk on the pricing of defaultable bonds and credit derivatives such as default swaps."
B26|Bankruptcy Prediction with Industry Effects|AbstractThis paper investigates the forecasting accuracy of bankruptcy hazard rate models for U.S. companies over the time period 1962–1999 using both yearly and monthly observation intervals. The contribution of this paper is multiple-fold. One, using an expanded bankruptcy database we validate the superior forecasting performance of Shumway's (2001) model as opposed to Altman (1968) and Zmijewski (1984). Two, we demonstrate the importance of including industry effects in hazard rate estimation. Industry groupings are shown to significantly affect both the intercept and slope coefficients in the forecasting equations. Three, we extend the hazard rate model to apply to financial firms and monthly observation intervals. Due to data limitations, most of the existing literature employs only yearly observations. We show that bankruptcy prediction is markedly improved using monthly observation intervals. Fourth, consistent with the notion of market efficiency with respect to publicly available information, we demonstrate that accounting variables add little predictive power when market variables are already included in the bankruptcy model.

B26|Market Pricing of Deposit Insurance|AbstractWe provide an approach to the market valuation of deposit insurance that is based on reduced-form methods for the pricing of fixed-income securities under default risk. By reference to bank debt prices as well as qualitative-response models of the probability of bank failure, we suggest how a risk-neutral valuation model for deposit insurance can be applied both to the calculation of fair-market deposit insurance premia and to the valuation of long-term claims against the insurer.

B26|Modeling Credit Risk With Partial Information|AbstractThis paper provides an alternative approach to Duffie and Lando [Econometrica 69 (2001) 633–664] for obtaining a reduced form credit risk model from a structural model. Duffie and Lando obtain a reduced form model by constructing an economy where the market sees the manager's information set plus noise. The noise makes default a surprise to the market. In contrast, we obtain a reduced form model by constructing an economy where the market sees a reduction of the manager's information set. The reduced information makes default a surprise to the market. We provide an explicit formula for the default intensity based on an Azéma martingale, and we use excursion theory of Brownian motions to price risky debt.

B26|Theory and Reality in Financial Economics:Essays Toward a New Political Finance|The current literature on financial economics is dominated by neoclassical dogma and, supposedly, the notion of value-neutrality. However, the failure of neoclassical economics to deal with real financial phenomena suggests that this might be too simplistic of an approach. This book consists of a collection of essays dealing with financial markets' imperfections, and the inability of neoclassical economics to deal with such imperfections. Its central argument is that financial economics, as based on the tenets of neoclassical economics, cannot answer or solve the real-life problems that people face. It also shows the direct relationship between economics and politics — something that is usually denied in academic models, given that science is supposed to be value-neutral. In this thought-provoking and avant-garde book, the author not only exposes what has gone wrong, but also suggests reforms to both the academic and the political-economic systems that might help make markets fair rather than efficient. Drawing on interdisciplinary fields, this book will appeal to readers who are interested in finance, economics, business, the political economy and philosophy.
