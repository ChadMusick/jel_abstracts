J81|Risky Working Conditions: An Immigrant Trap or an Income Effect?|Immigrants’ income has been proved to converge to the average native income level with years of residence in the host country. This income assimilation eﬀect is surprisingly not associated with a health improvement. Some emerging studies point towards the role of working conditions as a driver of the counterfactual relation between immigrants’ health and income. Using French data, we first show that, consistently with Viscusi (1978), working conditions are a normal good. An increase in 10% in non-earned income is associated with a decrease by 0.85% in professional injuries and by more than 3.2% in disabilities induced by professional illnesses. Second, we find that while immigrants bear in average worse working conditions than natives, this divergence results from an income divergence eﬀect since for an equivalent non-earned income level there are no significant diﬀerences in working conditions between natives and immigrants. Income assimilation of immigrants is associated with an assimilation in working conditions. We conclude then that bad working conditions cannot be blamed for the degradation of immigrants’ health with years of residence in the host country.
J81|Desempleo y calidad de vida laboral en las áreas metropolitanas de Barranquilla, Cartagena y Santa Marta|En este trabajo se muestra que las principales ciudades del Caribe colombiano han alcanzado en meses recientes las menores cifras en términos de desempleo en el país. Sin embargo, existen algunos aspectos por mejorar en relación con la calidad de los empleos ofrecidos ya que la tasa de informalidad es una de las más altas. Por ejemplo, en Cartagena el 58 % de los trabajadores son informales, Barranquilla alcanza una el 64 % y Santa Marta, el 66 %, mientras que en el promedio de las principales 23 ciudades esta es el 50,8 %. Este trabajo tiene como objetivo analizar la situación del mercado laboral en términos de la informalidad y la calidad del empleo, en tres de las principales ciudades del Caribe colombiano. Los resultados muestran una evolución decreciente de la informalidad en las ciudades caribeñas en el periodo 2007 hasta septiembre de 2018. Dichos aspectos repercuten sobre las condiciones de vida laboral, que en este trabajo se estudia a través del Índice Multidimensional de Calidad del Empleo (IMCE). Sobre este último se encontró que las tres ciudades presentan condiciones laborales poco atractivas, siendo menos favorable para los ocupados con bajo nivel educativo, empleados domésticos o por cuenta propia y los trabajadores de empresas pequeñas. **** ABSTRACT: We show that, in recent months, the main cities of the Colombian Caribbean have been characterized by having the best figures in terms of unemployment. However, there are some aspects to improve in relation to the quality of the jobs offered. The objective of this paper is to analyze the main characteristics of the labor market of the three main cities of the continental Caribbean, namely, Barranquilla, Cartagena and Santa Marta. We emphasize the stylized facts related to labor informality and the quality of employment. The results show a decreasing evolution of informality in the Caribbean cities in the period 2007 until the first semester of 2018, however, Cartagena maintains 58.5 % of its population in informal status, Barranquilla reaches a figure of 64 % and Santa Marta reaches 66 %, while the main 23 metropolitan areas show a figure of 50.8 %. These aspects have repercussions on working life conditions, which we study in this work by means of the multidimensional index of quality of employment (IMCE). Regarding the latter, we found that the three cities have unattractive labor conditions in terms of quality of employment, which is more critical for the employed without any educational level, domestic workers or self-employed workers, and workers in small companies.
J81|Mothers’ care: reversing early childhood health shocks through parental investments|We explore the effects of a child labor regulation that changed the legal working age from 14 to 16 over the health of their offspring. We show that the reform was detrimental for the health of the son’s of affected parents at delivery. Yet, in the medium run, the effects of the reform are insignificant for both male and female children. The sons of treated mothers are perceived as still having worse health at older ages, even if their objective health status has recovered. These boys are also more likely to have private health insurance, which suggests more concerned mothers.
J81|Mission of the company, prosocial attitudes and job preferences: A discrete choice experiment|We conduct a discrete choice experiment to investigate how the mission of high-tech companies affects job attractiveness and induces self-selection of science and engineering graduates with respect to their prosocial attitudes. We characterize mission by whether or not the company combines its profit motive with a mission on innovation or corporate social responsibility (CSR). Furthermore, we vary job design (e.g. autonomy) and contractible job attributes (e.g. job security). We find that companies with a mission on innovation or CSR are considered more attractive. Women and individuals who are more altruistic and less competitive feel particularly attracted to such companies.
J81|Willing to Pay for Security: A Discrete Choice Experiment to Analyse Labour Supply Preferences|This paper investigates the extent to which labour supply preferences are responsible for the marked rise in atypical work arrangements in the UK and US. By employing vignettes in a discrete job choice experiment in a representative survey, I estimate the distribution for preferences and willingness-to-pay over various job attributes. The list of attributes includes key distinguishing factors of typical and atypical work arrangements, such as security, work-related benefits, flexibility, autonomy and taxation implications. The results are indicative that the majority of the population prefer characteristics associated with traditional employee-employer relationships, and this preference holds even when analysing just the sub-sample of those in atypical work arrangements. Additionally, preferences across the UK and US are very similar, despite differences in labour market regulations. Rather than suggesting that labour supply preferences have contributed to the increase in atypical work arrangements, I find that the changing nature of work is likely to have significant negative welfare implications for many workers.

J81|Multiple Violations of Labor Market Regulations: Patterns in the Peruvian Labor Market and the Impact of Enforcement|This paper quantifies labor law violations and how the enforcement efforts impact on the compliance level by considering the possibility of different labor regulations being violated simultaneously. The findings for the Peruvian labor markets over the period 2004-2013 indicate that: (i) multiple violations of labor regulations are an important feature of Peruvian labor markets; (ii) young workers, workers with low level of education, indigenous workers, workers in micro firms and workers employed in the agricultural sector have higher chances of being deprived of several labor benefits simultaneously; (iii) the enforcement of labor regulations, captured through the number of labor inspections at the region level, is effective in detecting and penalizing extreme situations of multiple violations of the labor law, but the evidence also suggests that firms adjust only partially as an attempt to reduce the amount of a potential fine if discovered, and that laid off workers during the adjustment process moved to the informal sector where firms are not inspected. These findings are useful from a policy perspective indicating that there is space to improve firms’ incentives when facing an increase in the enforcement effort.
J81|Employment Uncertainty and Fertility: A Network Meta-Analysis of European Research Findings|The relationship between employment uncertainty and fertility is a major topic in demographic research. Since, particularly, the Great Recession , increasing numbers of papers on this matter have been published. Uncertainty is usually deemed to have a negative effect on fertility, but different fertility reactions are hypothesized by sociological theories, and micro-level evidence is fragmentary and contradictory. In this article, we use network meta-analysis to synthesize European research findings and to offer general conclusions about the effects of employment uncertainty on fertility (in terms of direction and size) and to rank different sources of uncertainty. Our results suggest that employment uncertainty is detrimental for fertility. For men, being unemployed is more detrimental for fertility than having time-limited employment; for women, time-limited employment is the worst condition for fertility, while unemployment is often used as an opportunity window for having children. Next, the negative effect of time-limited employment on fertility has become stronger over time, and is more severe in Southern European countries, where social protection for families and the unemployed is least generous. Finally, we demonstrate that failing to account for income and partnerâ€™s characteristics leads to an overestimation of the negative effect of employment uncertainty on fertility. We advance the role of these two factors as potential mechanisms by which employment uncertainty affects fertility.
J81|Working Conditions In Global Value Chains.Evidence For European Employees|This paper investigates how involvement in Global Value Chains (GVCs) affects working conditions. We use linked employer-employee data from the Structure of Earnings Survey merged with industry-level statistics on GVCs based on the World Input-Output Database. The sample consists of almost 9 million workers in 24 European countries in 2014. Given the multidimensional nature of the dependent variable, we compare the estimates resulting from a Mincerian wage model with zero-inflated negative binomial regressions that analyse other aspects of working conditions (overtime work and bonus payments). As to the impact of production fragmentation on social upgrading, wages prove to be negatively related to sectoral GVC involvement. Workers in sectors more deeply involved in GVCs have lower and less stable earnings, meaning worse working conditions; on the other hand, they are also less likely to have to work overtime, which one may see as a sign of better labour standards.
J81|Employer and Employee Preferences for Worker Benefits: Evidence from a Matched Survey on the Bangladesh Informal Sector|Informality is ubiquitous in the labor markets of developing countries, and requiring that firms formally register, pay taxes, and provide employee benefits stipulated in labor regulations to reduce such informality is challenging. However, a matched survey on employer-employee preferences suggests that mutually beneficial job benefits exist, and that encouraging their adoption might be feasible. Carefully designed discrete choice experiments on combinations of benefits related to compensation, leave and termination policies, working conditions, and accident insurance, along with incentives for employers, reveal the relative values that workers and employers attach to each benefit. The results show that workers tend to value advance notice for job termination and accident insurance, and that employers are not averse to providing these benefits. In contrast, workers find long working hours without overtime compensation to be highly undesirable, whereas many employers are generally unwilling to provide shorter hours or overtime pay unless they face the threat of fines or are offered substantial incentives for doing so. Our findings therefore suggest that encouraging the provision of termination notice and accident insurance may be relatively easy, but that increasing compliance with legal limits on working hours and overtime compensation is likely to require increased enforcement or substantial incentives.
J81|Works Councils and Workplace Health Promotion in Germany|From a theoretical viewpoint, there can be market failures resulting in an underprovision of occupational health and safety. Works councils may help mitigate these failures. Using establishment data from Germany, our empirical analysis confirms that the incidence of a works council is significantly associated with an increased likelihood that the establishment provides more workplace health promotion than required by law. This result also holds in a recursive bivariate probit regression accounting for the possible endogeneity of works council incidence. Furthermore, analyzing potentially moderating factors such as collective bargaining coverage, industry, type of ownership, multiestablishment status and product market competition, we find a positive association between works councils and workplace health promotion for the various types of establishments examined. Finally, we go beyond the mere incidence of workplace health promotion and show that works councils are positively associated with a series of different measures of workplace health promotion.
J81|What Aspects of Formality Do Workers Value? Evidence from a Choice Experiment in Bangladesh|In this study, we use a choice experiment to elicit workers' willingness to pay (WTP) for specific job benefits typically associated with formal employment (contracts, termination notice, paid leave, preferred working hours, and access to a retirement account). We find that workers most value job stability: the average worker would be willing to give up 19 percent of monthly income for a 6-month contract, 27 percent for a 1-year contract and 44 percent for a permanent contract (relative to no contract). Thirty days' of termination notice would also be valued at about 12 percent of monthly income. Using a latent class model, we explore preference heterogeneity and find that government workers are more likely to place a higher value on long-term contracts than private sector employees, while casual workers are more likely to have a particularly strong preference for higher salary, and a relatively low WTP for various benefits. This heterogeneity may be driven by sorting or loss aversion. Our work also lends support to the use of choice experiments to overcome the challenges associated with estimating WTP for specific job benefits from hedonic wage regressions or from observed job durations.
J81|Designing Good Labour Market Institutions: How to Reconcile Flexibility, Productivity and Security?|The world of work is in constant change. Demographic shifts, technological innovation, institutional reforms and global economic integration affect the way people work. Technological innovations have a major impact on occupations and industries, changing the ways economies in different world regions, in both developed and developing countries, work along with new division of labour that are facilitated by global economic integration. This paper is based on the joint work within the International Panel on Social Progress. It highlights three main areas of attention: a) skill formation, d) the challenges to collective bargaining, and e) social protection and labour market policies. Based on an assessment of the existing evidence, the paper suggests some policy principles and concrete policy options that might further those objectives, not ignoring some tensions that might exist between flexibility and security in the different labour markets. The ultimate direction of reforms in line with an idea of social progress lies in institutional arrangements that facilitate the reconciliation of flexibility and productivity with access to decent jobs and social protection. We argue that distinct policy options are available that can be implemented more globally in order to achieve these goals simultaneously.
J81|Arbeitszufriedenheit in der modernen Arbeitswelt|Der fortschreitende Wandel der Arbeitswelt zeichnet sich durch steigende Flexibilitätsanforderungen und ein höheres Maß an eigenverantwortlichem Handeln aus. Verantwortung, Flexibilität und neue Freiräume im Job werden auch von vielen Erwerbstätigen geschätzt – aber nicht von allen. Der vorliegende Beitrag zeigt, dass die Arbeitszufriedenheit nicht allein mit den Eigenschaften des Arbeitsplatzes zusammenhängt, sondern auch damit, wie sehr diese Eigenschaften den Präferenzen des jeweiligen Arbeitnehmers entsprechen. Beschäftigte mit wenig Flexibilität und Eigenverantwortung können somit grundsätzlich genauso zufrieden mit ihrer Arbeit sein wie Arbeitnehmer mit viel Flexibilität und Eigenverantwortung.
J81|Understanding Trends in Alternative Work Arrangements in the United States|This paper describes and tries to reconcile trends in alternative work arrangements in the United States using data from the Contingent Worker Survey supplements to the Current Population Survey (CPS) for 1995 to 2017, the 2015 RAND-Princeton Contingent Work Survey (CWS), and administrative tax data from the Internal Revenue Service for 2000 to 2016. We conclude that there likely has been a modest upward trend in the share of the U.S. workforce in alternative work arrangements during the 2000s based on the cyclically-adjusted comparisons of the CPS CWS’s, measures using self-respondents in the CPS CWS, and measures of self-employment and 1099 workers from administrative tax data. We also present evidence from Amazon Mechanical Turk that suggests that the basic monthly CPS question on multiple job holding misses many instances of multiple job holding
J81|Impacts of Industrial and Entrepreneurial Jobs on Youth: 5-year Experimental Evidence on Factory Job Offers and Cash Grants in Ethiopia|We study two interventions for underemployed youth across five Ethiopian sites: a $300 grant to spur self-employment, and a job offer to an industrial firm. Despite significant impacts on occupational choice, income, and health in the first year, after five years we see nearly complete convergence across all groups and outcomes. Shortrun increases in productivity and earnings from the grant dissipate as recipients exit their micro-enterprises. Adverse effects of factory work on health found after one year also appear to be temporary. These results suggest that one-time and one-dimensional interventions may struggle to overcome barriers to wage- or self-employment.
J81|How Do Alternative Work Arrangements Affect Income Risk After Workplace Injury?|Alternative work arrangements, including temporary and contract work, have become more widespread. There is interest in understanding the effects of these types of arrangements on employment and earnings risk for workers and the potential for existing social insurance programs to address this risk. We study employment and earnings risk in the context of workplace injuries among temporary and contract workers. We link administrative workers' compensation claims to earnings records to measure the employment and earnings risk posed by workplace injuries, comparing labor market outcomes after injury between temporary and contract workers and direct-hire workers injured doing the same job. We use a triple-difference identification strategy to isolate the effect of alternative work arrangements. We find that temporary workers have significantly lower probabilities of employment post-injury relative to similar direct-hire workers; temporary workers also have more severe earnings losses, which persist for at least three years after injury. This difference in income risk cannot be explained by differences in employment dynamics between temporary and direct-hire workers. We find evidence that the additional earnings losses suffered by temporary workers are offset by workers' compensation benefits, suggesting that the program provides insurance for the incremental risk faced by temporary workers.
J81|Beyond the agrimafie-caporalato binary: the restructuring of agriculture in Central Italy and its implications on labour relations|As in many other countries in the world, the Italian agricultural sector has witnessed a process of deep restructuring with the expansion of export-oriented production and the rise of global value chains in the agrifood sector. This paper argues that the new way of producing and delivering food, coupled with country-specific conditions, such as the structure of Italian agrarian capital, have created the room for new forms of exploitation, such as those based on seasonal migrant labour through practices of labour contracting and that sometimes amount to forms of 'modern slavery'. These new forms of exploitation are far from being exceptional. Although often associated with the territory control of Mafia organizations, this article argues that migrant labour exploitation through the labour contracting system is an integral feature of the contemporary agricultural production in Italy. This is shown through the case study of the fruit and vegetable production in the south area of Lazio region where firms can rely, through the role of labour contractors, on cheap and disposable migrant labour, especially Indian workers.
J81|Um Índice de Qualidade do Mercado de Trabalho Metropolitano Brasileiro|This paper presents the methodology for calculating the Labor Market Quality Index (IQT) for the metropolitan regions of Brazil. The IQT attempts to address the lack of a general indicator on the quality of the country’s local labor markets, with a quarterly frequency, easily interpreted and supported in the literature. In this way, we aim to provide a general index that can be used to monitor the short and long-term behavior of regional markets and that can serve as a thermometer for the effect of changes in the economy. At the same time, its simplicity of interpretation should facilitate the use by those interested in assessing the impact of public policies on local labor markets.

J81|Ist der Staat der bessere Arbeitgeber? Arbeitsqualität im Öffentlichen und Privaten Sektor in Deutschland|Die Sicherung und Verbesserung der Arbeitsqualität gehört zu den Zielen der EU und der Bundesregierung. Die politischen Bemühungen werfen die Frage auf, ob der Staat als Arbeitgeber im Hinblick auf die Arbeitsqualität mit gutem Beispiel vorangeht. Mithilfe von repräsentativen Befragungsdaten vergleiche ich an-hand einer Reihe wichtiger Kenngrößen deskriptiv die Arbeitsqualität im Öffentlichen und Privaten Sektor in Deutschland. Außerdem untersuche ich multivariat, ob die Sek-torzugehörigkeit die Kenngrößen der Arbeitsqualität beeinflusst. Die Ergebnisse deu-ten darauf hin, dass Arbeitszeitregelungen im Öffentlichen Sektor beschäftigungs-freundlicher sind als im Privaten Sektor. Auch arbeiten Beschäftigte im Öffentlichen Sektor seltener unter Druck. Mit Blick auf physische Belastungen, die Unterstützung durch den Vorgesetzten und emotionale Belastung werden jedoch Qualitätsnachteile im Öffentlichen Sektor identifiziert. Aufgrund dieser uneinheitlichen Ergebnisse scheint eine Vorreiterrolle des Staates mit Blick auf die Arbeitsqualität nicht gegeben.
J81|Plädoyer für eine neue Tarifpolitik: Kritische Situationsanalyse und Diskussion einer alternativen Gestaltungsvariante|Es gibt gute Gründe, die jahrzehntelang eingespielten Muster der Tarifpolitik kritisch zu hinterfragen. Für einen besonders problematischen Aspekt liefert das aktuelle Jahr 2019 ein gutes Beispiel: Die Ergebnisse von Tarifvertragsverhandlungen weisen aus betriebswirtschaftlicher Sicht ein kontraproduktives zeitliches Muster auf. Die höchsten Tarifabschlüsse werden nämlich oftmals in Jahren getätigt, in denen sich die Wachstumsraten der Wirtschaft deutlich reduzieren. Unternehmen bräuchten in dieser Phase eigentlich eine Kostenentlastung. Stattdessen gehen sie mit sockelwirksam erhöhten Personalkosten in eine Abschwungphase. Diese kontraproduktive Antizyklik kann potenziell zu einer Gefährdung der Arbeitsplätze in einzelnen Betrieben führen. Die Zahl der Betriebe in Kurzarbeit belegt dies deutlich. Weitere problematische Aspekte der üblichen tarifpolitischen Mechanismen sind: Kosten und Störpotenzial von Arbeitskämpfen, Belastung des öffentlichen Lebens und des Betriebsfriedens durch Streiks, Inflexibilität von Tarifverträgen, Kompliziertheit und Antiquiertheit von Verhandlungsritualen, finanzielle Überforderung einzelner Unternehmen durch Betriebsferne der Tarifverträge. Die Diskussion aller Aspekte führt zur Schlussfolgerung, dass die Suche nach alternativen Mechanismen in der Tarifpolitik sinnvoll ist. Es wird dazu ein Lastenheft entwickelt. Im Ergebnis wird ein neues Paradigma in der Tarifpolitik vorgeschlagen und diskutiert, das im Dauerbetrieb stärker durch eine betriebswirtschaftlich sinnhafte Zyklik, Standardisierung, Automatisierung und Einfachheit geprägt ist. Im Kern besteht der Ansatz aus zwei Komponenten. Alle Beschäftigten erhalten zunächst in jedem Jahr automatisch einen Ausgleich für die Inflationsrate. Dies schafft Kaufkraftstabilität. In einem nächsten Schritt wird die Gesamtbelegschaft dann zu einem langfristig vereinbarten Prozentsatz automatisch am Vorjahresgewinn des eigenen Unternehmens beteiligt. Dieses zweite Element sichert eine höhere Flexibilität der Personalkosten und führt zu betriebsnäheren Tarifergebnissen. Im Detail sind dabei eine Fülle von Einzelfragen zu diskutieren, unter anderem muss eine Lösung für nicht gewinnorientierte Organisationen gefunden werden.

J81|Assessing the Legal Value Added of Collective Bargaining Agreements|Abstract: How much value does collective bargaining add to the working conditions already established in general labour law? In this paper we propose a methodology to address this question: we compare the specific contents of collective agreements (except minimum wages) to their equivalent norms set by base law. We illustrate this approach by analysing in detail about 400 norms from six collective agreements in Portugal and then comparing them to the country’s Labour Code. We find that as many as 62% of those collective bargaining norms are exactly or virtually equal to the Labour Code; only 25% (an average of 16 norms per convention) are more favourable for the worker; and 12% (8) are more favourable for the employer. We conclude that collective bargaining in Portugal has a relatively small role as a source of effective labour law. We also present several potential explanations for our findings, including the wide range of base law, which may reduce the negotiating space of bargaining.
J81|Labor Precarization: Russian Empirical Evidence|In the conditions of educational and health institutions reforming and a series of economic crises, representatives of social-oriented helping professions move to the precarization zone. Based on the survey conducted in the spring of 2017 (2,054 school teachers and 870 physicians in state organizations in Moscow, Rostov-on-Don and Kazan), signs of precracious labor were identified: instability, the risk of job loss/changing, an increase in workload, not accompanied by higher wages, social and economic vulnerability. The empirical data shows that despite the satisfactory self-assessment of socially-oriented professionals' life, the level of precarious labor is higher for teachers from provincial cities and lower in the capital schools. In the field of health care, the extent of precarization is approximately the same in the different cities. Most teachers and doctors are concerned about the growth of workload without increasing wages and the risks of job loss. The majority of representatives of helping professions do not agree with the fact that the state effectively solves the social and economic problems of teaching. At the same time, interviewed teachers and doctors will take a rather passive attitude in case of violation of their labor rights. Nothing will be done by more than a half of all respondents. However, the excessive regulation of school teachers and physicians, on the one hand, and the continuing high demand for the work of schools and hospitals on the other, are associated with the risk of social tension increase in the Russian society.
J81|Mental health and labor relationships: a study with the legal analysts of the Office of the Prosecutor General - Brasil|"Realizing the importance of social welfare and worker health, this article aims to investigate the work relations of the Office of the Prosecutor General (PGR), verifying the possibilities of risk and commitment of the mental health of the professionals and contributing to raise a illness in this field. An exploratory qualitative research was carried out with five judicial analysts, servants of the Office of the Prosecutor General. Data collection was performed through semi-structured interviews and the method of analysis was the Analysis of the Core of Senses (ANS). The method adopted allowed the identification of six categories of analysis, namely: ""what is the centrality of the cabinet""; ""Meeting goals is normal""; ""Suffers from the violations that are very veiled here""; ""I do landscape face"" and ""if it was someone else she'd even say I hate it. But I like"". These categories were listed in explanatory tables, which synthesize their definitions, constituent themes and participants' verbalizations. It was observed a distance between the servers in the context of the general institutional environment, associated with a high degree of cognitive effort of reading and interpretations, that hinders the communication among the workers. The ""subjection"" of the worker was also verified to the productivist and managerial social logic. Concealed in a discourse of pleasure and satisfaction with work, the verbalizations of frustration are mostly directed toward the little acknowledgment given to the efforts made, the workload of the cabinets, and impotence in the face of a work that does not end. As a conclusion, it is verified that the work schedule, associated with the tasks routines and the few spaces for discussion of the conflicts, compromise the health of the professionals and render the environment hostile, requiring a rethinking of activities and social relations that permeate the space of work."
J81|Generalised self-efficacy and work values as indicators of job satisfaction: evidence from China|This paper examines the role of generalised self-efficacy and work values, on employee reports of overall job satisfaction in China from 2012 to 2014. This paper is novel in two ways. The first is that different aspects of job satisfaction in China are examined in addition to overall satisfaction and the second is that we examine self-efficacy and work values after controlling for occupation and income. The evidence presented supports our various hypotheses that self-efficacy and perceived work values play a large role in determining both reported overall job satisfaction and job satisfaction with various aspects of the job in China. In particular, we find a strong link between the National Vocational Qualification system in China and generalised self-efficacy, which we believe enhances workers sense of capability. The implication for Chinese employers is that it is imperative for their worker productivity that they look after their employees’ perceived self-efficacy, possibly by encouraging access to the National Qualification system and that they also facilitate a good working environment where worker relations or ‘guanxi’ can flourish.
J81|Sectoral minimum wages in South Africa: disemployment by firm size and trade exposure|This paper measures the impact of South African minimum wages on small and large firm employment in a sector that is exposed to international competition (agriculture) and one that is not (retail). Our results highlight that small firms in a tradable sector are the most vulnerable to minimum wage legislation. In particular, small farms shed jobs, while larger farms employed more unskilled workers as a result of minimum wages. Small firms were more affected by the minimum wage as they employed a higher proportion of low-skilled, low-wage workers. In contrast, large farms employed a lower proportion of low-skilled workers and used a more capital-intensive production process and were thus less affected by the legislation. While this shift represents a short-run response to minimum wages, it intensifies a long-run movement towards fewer, larger, more capital-intensive farms. Retail firms, on the other hand, do not exhibit the same behaviour, with zero employment losses in both small and large firms. This difference in result can be explained by the fact that firms that face international competition cannot easily increase prices when faced with wage increases. Non-tradable sectors, such as retail, can increase prices and shift the burden of higher labour costs onto the consumer as they do not face international competition. The effects of minimum wages in South Africa is, therefore, more complex than what previous research shows. We argue that an undifferentiated national minimum wage can result in intra-industry concentration and inequality could grow. This is true even if the economy-wide impact of a national minimum wage could be potentially benign.
J81|Corporate governance, tax evasion and business cycles|We develop an agency model of corporate tax evasion and auditing by a residual claimant government and embed it to a macroeconomic environment characterised by credit constraints. In our economy, tax auditing by the government reduces the information asymmetry between lenders and entrepreneurs with an investment opportunity. Corporate governance quality consequently affects macroeconomic variables; with changes in tax rates, auditing and quality of corporate governance having aggregate effects. We show that changes in the revenue system; tax and audit rates, can directly affect asset prices and inflate the effects of exogenous shocks to the economy.
J81|Under Pressure? Assessing the Roles of Skills and Other Personal Resources for Work-Life Strains|Many working parents struggle to balance the demands of their jobs and family roles. Although we might expect that additional resources would ease work-family constraints, theory and evidence regarding resources have been equivocal. This study uses data on working mothers and fathers—as well as their cohabiting partners/spouses—from the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey to investigate how personal resources in the form of skills, cognitive abilities, and personality traits affect work-life strains. It considers these along with standard measures of economic, social, and personal resources, and estimates seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) models of work-life strains for employed mothers and fathers that account for correlations of the couple’s unobserved characteristics. The SUR estimates indicate that computer skills reduce work-life strains for mothers, that math skills reduce strains for fathers, and that the personality traits of extraversion, conscientiousness, and emotional stability reduce strains for both parents. However, the estimates also indicate that better performance on a symbol look-up task, which tests attention, visual scanning acuity, and motor speed, increases fathers’ work-life strains.
J81|Labour Market Participation and Atypical Employment over the Life Cycle: A Cohort Analysis for Germany|We use data from the adult cohort of the National Education Panel Study to analyse the changes in the employment histories of cohorts born after World War II and the role of atypical employment in this context. Younger cohorts are characterised by acquiring more education, by entering into employment at a higher age, and by experiencing atypical employment more often. The latter is associated with much higher employment of women for younger cohorts. A sequence analysis of employment trajectories illustrates the opportunities and risks of atypical employment: The proportion of individuals whose entry into the labour market is almost exclusively characterised by atypical employment rises significantly across the cohorts. Moreover, a substantial part of the increase in atypical employment is due to the increased participation of women, with part-time jobs or mini-jobs playing an important role in re-entering the labour market after career breaks.
J81|Prekarität in Deutschland?!|Vor dem Hintergrund der sozialen Marktwirtschaft wird Prekarität als eine Folge von arbeitsmarkt- und sozialpolitischen Veränderungen diskutiert. Es wird bilanziert, dass der soziale Zusammenhalt der Arbeitsgesellschaft in Deutschland gefährdet ist. Im Anschluss an diese Diskussion geht die vorliegende Studie empirisch der Frage nach, ob ein Prekariat existiert: Gibt es Personengruppen, die trotz Erwerbstätigkeit dauerhaft in Unsicherheit leben? Konzentriert sich Prekarität hauptsächlich auf geringqualifizierte Personen oder ist sie vor allem an bestimmte Lebensphasen und -übergänge gebunden? Damit Prekarität in ihren verschiedenen Facetten und Abstufungen erfasst werden kann, wird in dem vorliegenden Papier ein umfassendes Set an Indikatoren zur quantitativen, multidimensionalen Messung von (kumulativer) Prekarität vorgestellt. Auf Basis des Sozioökonomischen Panels (SOEP) werden je sieben Indikatoren operationalisiert, mit denen sowohl prekäre Beschäftigung als auch prekäre Haushaltslagen erfasst und im Zeitverlauf (1993-2012) analysiert werden können. Damit soll der Grundstein für eine quantitative Analyse von Prekarität gelegt werden, um vor diesem Hintergrund die Institutionen des Arbeitsmarkts und der sozialen Sicherung zukünftig neu bewerten zu können.
J81|The International Organization of Production in the Regulatory Void|In recent decades, NGOs and consumers have heavily criticized a large number of leading firms and their suppliers in a diverse set of industries for exploiting cross-country differences in regulation to cut costs at the expense of workers and the environment. In line with a wide range of examples, our explorative empirical analysis links these features of globalization to the international organization of production: a high cost advantage of ‘unethical’ production in an industry favors international outsourcing (as opposed to vertical integration) and most strongly so for sourcing from low-regulation countries. We rationalize this pattern by introducing a cost-saving ‘unethical’ technology, consumer boycotts, and advocacy NGOs into a standard property-rights model of the international organization of production. Contracts are incomplete, limiting a firm’s control over both investment and (un)ethical technology choices of integrated as well as independent suppliers. We identify and analyze a novel unethical outsourcing incentive, which - in line with the empirical findings - links outsourcing to unethical production. We also contribute to the modeling of NGO-firm interactions by providing a microfounded model of investment and pricing under incomplete contracts and monopolistic competition when the production technology is a credence attribute of the final good.
J81|Do Working Hours Affect Health? Evidence from Statutory Workweek Regulations in Germany|This study estimates the causal effect of working hours on health. We deal with the endogeneity of working hours through instrumental variables techniques. In particular, we exploit exogenous variation in working hours from statutory workweek regulations in the German public sector as an instrumental variable. Using panel data, we run two-stage least squares regressions controlling for individual-specific unobserved heterogeneity. We find adverse consequences of increasing working hours on subjective and several objective health measures. The effects are mainly driven by women and parents of minor children who generally face heavier constraints in organizing their workweek.
J81|Working Times and Overweight: Tight Schedules, Weaker Fitness?|Although the rise in obesity and overweight is related to time constraints influencing health investments (e.g., exercise, shopping and cooking time, etc.), there is limited causal evidence to substantiate such claims. This paper estimates the causal effect of a change in working times on overweight and obesity drawing from evidence from the Aubrey reform implemented in the beginning of the past decade in France. We use longitudinal data from GAZEL (INSERM) 1997-2006 that contains detailed information about health indicators, including measures of height and weight. Taking the Alsace-Mosselle department as a control group and a difference-in-differences strategy, we estimate the effect of a differential reduction in working times on body weight. Our results show evidence of 0.7% increase in average BMI an 8pp increase in the probability of overweight among blue collars exposed to the reform. In contrast, we find no effect among white collar workers. The effects are robust to different specifications and placebo tests.

J81|Efectos de la Desregulación del Sistema Universitario en el Mercado Laboral en Perú|In 1995 the Peruvian’s university system was reformed, the requirements for the entry of new universities were relaxed, the result of this reform was an relevant increases in the number of universities (around 218 % between 1996 and 2017). The reform caused a significant proportion of workers, especially those born after 1980 to pursue higher education, which in the absence of the reform would they not have been able to access to the university system. Differences in the exposure to the reform in terms of the workers’ year of birth, allow me to recover positive causal effects of higher education on wages and labor conditions, mainly a lower probability of labor informality.
J81|Work Load Analysis on State-Owned Companies in The Health Sector in Bandung-Indonesia|Objective – This study conducts a workload analysis on state-owned companies in the health sector in BandungIndonesia. The study focuses on a company established on 6 August 1890, which is a manufacturer of vaccines and antisera, and is now developing into a life science company. The objective of Polio eradication by 2020 demands competitiveness and a change in organizational culture in order to increase organizational profits. There are two possible solutions to this phenomenon. From a technical perspective, the company has decided to undertake market expansion. From a psychological perspective, the company needs to change the attitude of its employees to effectively meet the competition. This situation raises problems for the human resources division of the company. First, it increases employee health problems such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure and lower back pain, which increases health costs. Methodology/Technique – Based on the phenomena of excessive workload and the problems posed, this study aims to examine empirical data regarding the workload of the company. The workload analysis in this study is conducted in October 2016 using several methods such as discussions, interviews, questionnaires, and observation. The validation of the data is achieved using a triangulation methodology. Findings – The result show that, when comparing the fair amount workload index with the total number of employees in the company, there is a difference of 11.61%. The six directorates have 75-85% for effectiveness and 79-87% for efficiency. This shows that work load is not a contributing factor to the phenomena's described above in this company. Novelty – The research sheds light on the increasing need for counselling in companies. One of the leading reasons for this is employee work loads and the increase in some employees working overtime. These factors may lead to other problems such as family issues, low job satisfaction, discipline, and absenteeism.
J81|Rather a trigger than a cause of change.Responses of firms and workers to the statutory minimum wage in Germany| The introduction of the statutory minimum wage in Germany directly affected firms with wage earners paid less than EUR 8.50 per hour. This paper studies a variety of responses by employers and employees to adapt to this shock, in particular changes in compensation packages, employment at the extensive and intensive margin, working conditions, and position in product markets. Strategies of non-compliance are also in focus. The analysis is qualitative and based on 131 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with firm representatives, workers and members of work councils. A key finding is that while many firms and workers changed behavior with the introduction of the minimum wage, these changes are less response to concomitant changes in labor costs. Rather, it appears that the reform at many workplaces served as a catalyst to trigger or accelerate pending change processes.
J81|Working Time Flexibility and Parental 'Quality Time' Spent with Children|The aim of our paper is to analyse the relationship between working time flexibility and parental time devoted to children. Using data from a large panel survey of Polish households carried out in 2013 and 2014 (Determinants of Educational Decisions Household Panel Survey, UDE) we investigate whether and how various dimensions of working time flexibility affect the amount of time parents spend with their children reading, playing or teaching them new things. We account for employment status of parents, their socio-economic status and social and cultural norms they share. Our results show that employment status of parents and their working time arrangements are not statistically significant for the amount of parental 'quality time' devoted to children. We show that these are parental human and cultural capital and their values that are primary factors determining the amount of parental time investments.

J81|Working Times and Overweight: Tight Schedules, Weaker Fitness?|We study the causal effect of a change in working times on overweight and obesity drawing from evidence from a national policy (the Aubry reform) implemented in the beginning of the past decade in France that reduced the work week from 39 to 35 hours, or 184 hours per year. We draw on two sources of identification. First, one region, Alsace-Mosselle, blunted its impact by counting two existing public holidays towards the 184-hour reduction. In this region, hours of work per year only fell by 168 until 2003, when it was forced to fully comply with national policy. Second, we use longitudinal data from GAZEL (INSERM) 1997-2006 that contains detailed information about health indicators, including measures of height and weight for employees of EDF-GDF ere two former state monopolies, and were among the very first to implement the 35-hour workweek in 2000. Drawing from a difference-in-differences strategy, we estimate the effect of a differential reduction in working times on body weight. Our results show evidence of 6.7 percentage points increase in the probability of overweight among blue collar workers, when the exposure to the reform. In contrast, we find no effect among white collar workers. The effect is driven by an increase in overweight among normal weight individual and a reduction of obese blue collar employees by 2.6pp. The effects are robust to different specifications and placebo tests.
J81|Globalisation and the Gender Earnings Gap: Evidence from Sri Lanka and Cambodia 1992-2015|This paper focuses on how the forces of globalisation, specifically the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA), have affected women's wages in the apparel sector in developing countries. Using household and labour force surveys from Cambodia and Sri Lanka, we find large positive wage premiums and a closing of the male-female wage gap during the MFA period, but smaller premiums and a widening wage gap after the end of the MFA. Our results suggest that apparel exports continued to benefit women in developing countries post-MFA.
J81|Labour market participation and atypical employment over the life cycle: A cohort analysis for Germany|We use data from the adult cohort of the National Education Panel Study to analyse the changes in the employment histories of cohorts born after World War II and the role of atypical employment in this context. Younger cohorts are characterised by acquiring more education, by entering into employment at a higher age, and by experiencing atypical employment more often. The latter is associated with much higher employment of women for younger cohorts. A sequence analysis of employment trajectories illustrates the opportunities and risks of atypical employment: The proportion of individuals whose entry into the labour market is almost exclusively characterised by atypical employment rises significantly across the cohorts. Moreover, a substantial part of the increase in atypical employment is due to the increased participation of women, with part-time jobs or mini-jobs playing an important role in re-entering the labour market after career breaks.
J81|Under Pressure? Assessing the Roles of Skills and Other Personal Resources for Work-Life Strains|Many working parents struggle to balance the demands of their jobs and family roles. Although we might expect that additional resources would ease work-family constraints, theory and evidence regarding resources have been equivocal. This study uses data on working mothers and fathers – as well as their cohabiting partners/spouses – from the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey to investigate how personal resources in the form of skills, cognitive abilities, and personality traits affect work-life strains. It considers these along with standard measures of economic, social, and personal resources, and estimates seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) models of work-life strains for employed mothers and fathers that account for correlations of the couple's unobserved characteristics. The SUR estimates indicate that computer skills reduce work-life strains for mothers, that math skills reduce strains for fathers, and that the personality traits of extraversion, conscientiousness, and emotional stability reduce strains for both parents. However, the estimates also indicate that better performance on a symbol look-up task, which tests attention, visual scanning acuity, and motor speed, increases fathers' work-life strains.
J81|Forced labour and risk factors for inferior working conditions in Thai fishing sector|Severe working conditions on Thai fishing boats have received international attention as the so-called modern slavery, at least, since 2005. Using a survey in 2012 of fishermen on fishing boats in four provinces of Thailand conducted by the International Labour Organization, this paper examines the ranges of unacceptable working conditions by extending the measurement of forced labour. This paper makes two main contributions by identifying the degree of forced labour and measuring their working conditions. First, we conceptualise two situations, forced labour and possibly forced labour, with different combinations of available variables, which is an attempt to capture the multidimentional complexity in measuring forced labour. Second, we analysed the associated working conditions among the workers. We confirmed that fishing boats are places of forced labour and destinations of trafficked persons, and that the working conditions of forced and possibly forced workers are inferior to those of other workers.
J81|Can RTA labor provisions prevent the deterioration of domestic labor standards? : the cases of statutory minimum wages and employment protection regulations|This study investigates whether labor clauses in regional trade agreements (RTAs) are effective to maintain or improve the domestic labor standards in the signatory countries. The effects of RTA labor clauses on two measures of labor standards, statutory minimum wages and the strictness of employment protection, are empirically analyzed using a unique dataset that classifies the population of effective RTAs into those with and without labor clauses, together with multi-year data on minimum wages and the indicator of employment-protection strictness for a wide variety of countries. The result shows that having labor-clause-free RTAs with more or larger trading partners are associated with lower statutory minimum wages although this negative association is not found for labor-clauseinclusive RTAs. The separate estimation for countries in different income groups further demonstrates that this result is chiefly driven by middle-income countries that sign RTAs with high-income partners, implying that signing RTAs with more or larger high-income trading partners would create to the government of a middleincome country, which has a comparative advantage over the high-income partners in labor-intensive sectors, a downward policy pressure on statutory minimum wages whereas labor clauses could alleviate such a negative policy effect of RTAs on minimum wages. This finding is also contrasted with the case of actual wages for which no evidence is found for the impact of RTAs with or without labor clauses to reaffirm that labor-clause-free RTAs could create downward policy pressure on statutory minimum wages but RTAs might not bring market pressure on actual wages regardless of whether or not the RTAs include labor clauses. Finally, unlike this case of statutory minimum wages, the empirical analysis finds no clear evidence for the potential impacts of RTAs either with or without labor clauses on the strictness of employment protection in the signatory countries.
J81|Doctors' Way of Working: Long Hours, Training, Secondary Jobs, and Desire to Work|"This paper utilizes a large, nationally representative micro data-set, the ""Employment Status Survey (2007, 2012),"" which is administered by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications every five years, to investigate whether doctors' way of working is different from that of other kinds of occupations to give an insight for on-going debate on regulating labor standard of doctors. In particular, we compare doctors employed under regular status working more than 200 days per year with specialized and technical professions or nurses under the same employment conditions. Based on cross tabulations, we find that compared with the specialized and technical professions, the doctors have longer working hours, receive employer-provided training, and have secondary jobs at a very high rate. Moreover, based on logit model analysis, we find that despite working long hours the doctors' desire to terminate or change their position does not increase, contrary to the specialized and technical professions or nurses. However, similar to other professions, doctors also have a distinct desire to reduce their working hours, even when receiving employee-provided training and career development."
J81|The Asymmetric Experience of Gains and Losses in Job Security on Health|Is workers’ health more sensitive to losses than gains in job security? While loss aversion, whereby losses loom larger than gains, is typically examined in relation to decisions about anticipated outcomes, I first show using a large sample of workers from the Euro- pean Household Community Panel and value-added models that losses in job security have a larger effect on health than equivalent job security gains. Second, I address endogeneity issues using the 1999 rise in the French Delalande tax as a quasi-natural experiment. It allows evaluating separately the causal impact of exogenous gains and losses in job security on workers’ health. Difference-in-differences estimation results confirm that lower job security generates significant and robust losses in self-assessed health. Meanwhile a greater feeling of job security does not translate into a higher level of self-assessed health. These results are in line with the predictions of the model linking job security to health under the hypothesis of loss aversion built in this paper. This article also demonstrates that losses in health induced by lower job security are not transitory.
J81|Sens du travail pour les salariés et contexte économique des entreprises, une exploitation de l'enquête Conditions de travail 2013|This article proposes to establish links between the sense of work for employees and the economic and organizational context in which they work. Four sense of work conditions were identified and measured by four scores. Through a multilevel analysis, we seek to measure the impact of the organizational context (level 2) and the macro-sectoral context (level 3) of firms on these four conditions of sense at work. The results show how the organization of work in the establishments and the financialization of firm impact the sense of work for employees. The sign of this impact largely depends on the establishment's position in the value chain.of companies in this branche
J81|The Economics of African American Slavery: The Cliometrics Debate|This working paper explores the significant contributions to the history of African-American slavery made by the application of the tools of cliometrics. As used here “cliometrics” is defined as a method of scientific analysis marked by the explicit use of economic theory and quantitative methods. American slavery of the late antebellum period [1840-1860] was one of the earliest topics that cliometricians focused on and, arguably, the topic upon which they made the largest impact.
J81|The Effect of Physical and Cognitive Decline at Older Ages on Job Mismatch and Retirement|Physical and cognitive abilities of older workers decline with age, which can cause a mismatch between abilities and job demands, potentially leading to early retirement. We link longitudinal Health and Retirement Study data to O*NET occupational characteristics to estimate to what extent changes in workers’ physical and cognitive resources change their work-limiting health problems, mental health, subjective probabilities of retirement, and labor market status. While we find that physical and cognitive decline strongly predict all outcomes, only the interaction between large-muscle resources and job demands is statistically significant, implying a strong mismatch at older ages in jobs requiring large-muscle strength. The effects of declines in fine motor skills and cognition are not statistically different across differing occupational job demands.
J81|Collective bargaining through the magnifying glass: A comparison between the Netherlands and Portugal|Since the global financial crisis, sector-level bargaining has come under renewed scrutiny. While in Southern Europe, the crisis raised concerns about the role of collective bargaining as an obstacle to labour market adjustment, in Northern Europe it was perceived more favourably and, according to some, may even have helped to weather the fallout of the crisis more easily. This paper seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of sector-level bargaining systems and their role for labour market performance. We compare two countries with seemingly similar collective bargaining systems, the Netherlands and Portugal, and document a number of features that may affect labour market outcomes, including: i) the scope for flexibility at the firm or worker level within sector-level agreements; ii) the emphasis on representativeness as a criterion for extensions; iii) the effectiveness of coordination across bargaining units; and iv) pro-active government policies to enhance trust and cooperation between the social partners.
J81|Organised Decentralisation of Collective Bargaining: Case studies of Germany, Netherlands and Denmark|This paper investigates different varieties of so called organised decentralisation of collective bargaining in Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark. Organised decentralisation occurs within the framework of sector agreements, which explicitly allow determination of terms and conditions at company level, and often set certain (minimum) level standards as well as procedure that have to be respected. German decentralisation is based on its dual-channel system and extensive use of opening clauses, which make workplace derogation from sector-level agreements possible. Dutch decentralisation is based on the dual-channel system and on framework agreements that allow company level bargaining as long as minimum stipulations are observed. Finally, Denmark combines a single-channel system with framework agreements setting minimum levels. Germany stands out as the least organised of the three. Opening and derogation clauses mean that terms and conditions in multi-employer agreements can be undercut. Vertical control over these derogations has suffered from the dual-channel representation in which works councils have a new role. The Netherlands exhibit some, very limited, elements of disorganisation and stable bargaining coverage. Decentralisation has mainly happened through framework agreements setting minimum levels or through the organised transfer of competencies to works councils. The Danish system leaves a lot of scope for local bargaining, the minimum levels are generally observed and bargaining coverage has not suffered. Based on these findings, we draw the conclusion that organised decentralisation requires articulation that preserves a regulatory function of multi-employer agreements. Preservation of multi-employer agreements in turn requires high bargaining coverage.
J81|Job Quality, Health and Productivity: An evidence-based framework for analysis|The nature, content and milieu of work – i.e. the quality of the working environment – matter in many ways for people, firms and society as a whole. There is a great deal of evidence to show clear associations between job quality and the health of workers, their ability to successfully combine work and life while fully mobilising their skills and abilities to build a career, and their productivity. Investments in quality working environments can be welfare enhancing and economically efficient. Policies and practices reflect these findings insufficiently, an apparent paradox that finds its roots in various market failures. There is scope for public intervention to raise awareness, to ensure better coordination of key stakeholders (employers, workers’ representatives and various public entities) and to put in place the right financial incentives for firms to invest in better working conditions. Action in this field is also important in view of ongoing considerable changes in the labour market. The future of work is very uncertain at this stage; the digitalisation and uberisation of work have the potential for improvements in working conditions but also bear the risk of de-skilling, lower pay, lower job security and poor working conditions for parts of the labour force.
J81|Measuring the impact of businesses on people’s well-being and sustainability: Taking stock of existing frameworks and initiatives|Businesses have a significant impact on people’s economic and social conditions, as well as on environmental outcomes. This paper presents an overview of the various kinds of initiatives aimed at measuring or reporting on business’ impact, or certain aspects of it. It shows that despite the proliferation of information and frameworks to measure these impacts, there is currently no common understanding and practice on how to assess the performance of businesses in different social and environmental areas. Building on the OECD’s work on measuring well-being at the national level, the paper aims at better understanding how businesses can impact people’s well-being and sustainability. It contributes to, and complements, other initiatives undertaken by the OECD on responsible business conduct and inclusive growth. This analysis is a first attempt at extending to businesses the approach used by the Organisation to assess and benchmark the well-being performance of countries and sub-national regions, in view of creating a common language and improving the quality, comparability, and coherence of information on the impact of businesses on societal progress and people’s life.
J81|Examining Vulnerabilities: the Cycle Rickshaw Pullers of Dhaka City|Dhaka, capital city of Bangladesh, is one of the fastest growing cities of the world in terms of population concentration. Centrally located, it attracts a large number of job seeking migrants from the rural areas of entire Bangladesh on a continuous basis. Some of these job seeking migrants are readily absorbed in the urban informal service sector, which includes cycle rickshaw pulling. Cycle rickshaw pulling is arduous and stressful, with no promotion prospect or insurance for occupational hazards such as accident injuries, while entry is easy as education and training as well as capital asset requirement is minimal. In order to examine vulnerabilities of the rickshaw pullers, a structured questionnaire survey has been conducted on a total of 120 randomly selected cycle rickshaw pullers in five locations across the Dhaka city. The primary survey has examined their current living conditions, livelihood strategies, shocks and insurances against shocks. The respondents lacked education and skill training, did not own capital assets and mostly supported their families stationed in the rural areas with earnings from this cycle rickshaw pulling. Econometric models of OLS and probit regression have been utilized to examine a number of issues, and the results are expected. Most respondents were willing to educate their children and did not want to include them in this sector. There are potentials of entrepreneurship if they are skill trained, financed and advised properly. They are reported to be willing to improve their living conditions, which is difficult due to the vulnerabilities that they face.
J81|Study on financial performance of da Afghanistan Bank 2015 and 2016|This study attempts primarily to measure the financial performance of Da Afghanistan Bank which one of the largest government bank of Afghanistan for the period 2015-2016 and to identify whether any difference exists between a banks’ years of operation and its performance classifying two period (2015-2016). To complete my task I have to use various materials and take help form online source. Analyses the ratio here used financial ratio analysis (FRA) method which help to draw a overview about financial performance of the Da Afghanistan bank in terms of profitability, liquidity. These analyses helps to see the current performance condition of this bank compare past performance. Because now a day’s banking sector of Afghanistan is suffering the disease of default culture which is the consequence or result of bad performance of most banks. The performances of banks are dependent more on the management’s ability in formulating strategic plans and the efficient implementation of its strategies. The study findings can be helpful for management of Da Afghanistan, Always for private commercial banks in Afghanistan to improve their financial performance and formulate policies that will improve their performance. The study also identified specific areas for bank to work on which can ensure sustainable growth for these banks.
J81|Study on the effect of leadership style, reward systems, and working conditions on employee work performance (case study of the state plantation of Merbau Pagar, Indonesia)|The purpose of this study was to observe the influence of leadership style, reward system, working conditions on the work performance of employees of The State Plantation of Merbau Pagar, Indonesia. The samples obtained were 105 respondents, according to the above objectives, this study was formulated using respondent testing, hypothesis testing and questionnaire testing. Data collection techniques used in this study consisted of observations, interviews (interviews), questionnaires and documentation studies in the form of primary and secondary data. To facilitate problem solving, this research was carried out using a linear regression analysis method with the help of SPSS 23. The results of the study showed that, 1) Simultaneously leadership style, reward system and working conditions significantly influence work performance, 2) partially each each factor of the leadership style variable, reward system and working conditions have a significant effect on Work performance, 3) the results of the partial regression analysis indicate that the value of the working conditions factor is the most dominant factor in Work Performance.
J81|Economic and Social Upgrading in Global Value Chains: Insights from Philippine Manufacturing Firms|This study explores the 2012 Survey on Adjustments of Establishments to Globalization (SAEG) to analyze the economic and social upgrading experience of Philippine manufacturers inside global value chains (GVCs). Three broad patterns emerge from the data. First, firms with stronger GVC linkages tend to have better labor indicators than purely domestic producers. Second, the majority of manufacturers either experienced or missed economic and social upgrading simultaneously. Lastly, almost all social upgrading is accompanied by economic upgrading but economic upgrading may take place without a social component. Against this background, this study uses bivariate probit regression to model the joint determination of the two separate but interconnected upgrading outcomes. The estimation results show that the covariates in the model can be grouped into three based on their statistical significance—purely economic (i.e., employment size, unit labor cost, high skill intensity, and the Kaitz dummy), purely social (i.e., training, female intensity and foreign equity), and both (i.e., contractualization and process and product innovations). These results have several important implications. First, GVC firms’ notion of social upgrading are closer to the softer components of working conditions than to traditional measurable indicators such as employment, wages and efficiency. Second, the results suggest direct and indirect channels through which technological upgrading may generate desirable social outcomes. The direct channel highlights that innovation should be accompanied by skills development to sustain higher value creation while the indirect channel underlines the potential of innovation to create upward spirals in output, productivity, and ultimately labor conditions. Lastly, there are some indications that the social benefits of economic upgrading may not be evenly distributed among different types of employment. Overall, the above results emphasize the need for a holistic upgrading experience that shifts the country’s comparative advantage from cheap labor to innovative local industries and highly-skilled workers.
J81|"The Distortionary Effects of Incentives in Government: Evidence from China's ""Death Ceiling"" Program"|"We study a 2004 program designed to motivate Chinese bureaucrats to reduce accidental deaths. Each province received a set of ""death ceilings"" that, if exceeded, would impede government officials' promotions. For each category of accidental deaths, we observe a sharp discontinuity in reported deaths at the ceiling, suggestive of manipulation. Provinces with safety incentives for municipal officials experienced larger declines in accidental deaths, suggesting complementarities between incentives at different levels of government. While realized accidental deaths predict the following year's ceiling, we observe no evidence that provinces manipulate deaths upward to avoid ratchet effects in the setting of death ceilings."
J81|You can(’t) always get the job you want: stated versus revealed employment preferences in the Peruvian agro-industry|Employment in high-value agro-export sectors has been recognized to entail the potential to contribute to poverty reduction in rural areas of developing countries. Concerns have yet been raised about the quality of the created employment and worker preferences have often been overlooked in the literature. We use a discrete choice experiment, in which we relate stated and revealed employment preference of agro-industrial export workers in Peru. We explain employment (mis)matches as a function of personal and employer characteristics. Results suggest that employment preferences are heterogeneous, but that labor market frictions are smaller than what is commonly expected in developing country contexts.
J81|The Effect of Labor Market Polarization on the College Students' Employment|This paper aims to assess the effect of the labor market environment on various aspects of college students' job market related behaviors. In some cases, college students hide or evade their unemployment status by extending school registration or transferring to another school. By estimating the effect of the macroeconomic variables on college students' labor market related outcomes, it is found that labor market polarization has a significant effect on both the nominal unemployment and the hidden actions of college students. It implies that the labor market structure is a key element in understanding youth employment, and the youth labor policy should focus more on micro and institutional level of labor market reform.
J81|Does employment protection legislation promote immigrant self-employment?|The paper analyses the effect of employment protection legislation on immigrant self- employment rates, using OECD indicators on the strictness of employment protection legislation (EPL). As migrants are outsiders in the labour market, the effect of employment protection on their probability of finding a job should be most likely negative, even if the net effect of employment protection on aggregate employment is unclear. We find no significant effects of EPL of migrant self-employment rates, in a multivariate context.
J81|Los trabajadores colombianos carecen de derechos sociales|"El trabajo informal en Colombia es muy alto para los estándares de la región. Se trata de tra-bajadores cuya inserción económica no está atada a la seguridad social. Ahora, el gobierno pretende poner a tributar a esos sectores con la creación del monotributo, pero es difícil exigirle impuestos a una población que carece de derechos sociales: la tributación es un contrato social. La inseguridad económica y social ha obligado a las familias a volverse unidades económicas y asumir la protección social, sin embargo, ello tiene efectos sobre la configuración del mundo social que están por estudiarse. ****** Informal work in Colombia is very high compared to the standards of the region. These are workers whose economic insertion is not tied to social security. Now the government intends to tax these sectors by creating the ""monotributo"" (single tax), though it is difficult to impose taxes on a population that lacks social rights: taxation is a social contract. Economic and social inse-curity has forced families to become economic units and to assume social protection. This off course has effects on the configuration of society, and thus should be studied."
J81|Una contribución a la discusión sobre la jornada laboral|En las últimas semanas se ha generado una interesante discusión en el país en relación con el número de horas trabajadas por los chilenos. Por una parte, la jornada laboral para un trabajador a tiempo completo es de 45 horas, lo que es elevado comparado con otros países, en particular si son países desarrollados. Por otra parte, en los indicadores de la OCDE también se observa que los chilenos están entre los que más horas trabajan al año. En Chile, el promedio de horas trabajadas es de 1.990 horas al año, mientras que el de la OCDE es de 1.737. La diferencia equivale a más de cinco semanas adicionales de trabajo al año en Chile, en relación con el promedio de esos países. No obstante, dado que Chile es una de las naciones con menor ingreso per cápita en la muestra de países OCDE, una pregunta relevante es si el número de horas trabajadas ha ido cayendo a medida que va creciendo el ingreso per cápita y la productividad en el resto de los países; y, dado eso, cuál era dicha cifra cuando llegaron a tener un PIB similar al que tiene Chile hoy o cuando llegaron a tener una productividad del trabajo semejante a la chilena actual. La evidencia muestra que el número de horas trabajadas en promedio en los países de la OCDE ha ido cayendo en el tiempo. Si en 1970 era 1.982 en la actualidad es 1.737. Ello es consistente con la teoría económica que sostiene que el “ocio” es un bien superior que aumenta a medida que el ingreso crece (lo que implica que las horas trabajadas caen). Ello también se observa cuando se comparan en el tiempo las jornadas laborales legales. Para un grupo de 20 países de la OCDE para los cuales hay series de tiempo, la jornada legal bajó de 44,5 horas en 1967 a 41,0 horas en la actualidad.Cuando se compara el número de horas trabajadas de los países de la OCDE cuando tenían el PIB per cápita de Chile en la actualidad, se concluye que el promedio para esas naciones era de 1.859. Es decir, sigue siendo cierto que en nuestro país se trabajan más horas que en esos países cuando tenían igual PIB per cápita que Chile, pero la diferencia es aproximadamente la mitad que cuando no se hace el ajuste por PIB. También se hizo un ejercicio de calcular las horas trabajadas en los países de la OCDE cuando alcanzaron una productividad media del trabajo similar a la chilena actual. Sin embargo, en este caso hay 7 países sobre los cuales no se dispone toda la información, éstos alcanzaron la productividad actual de Chile previo al primer dato que se tiene sobre sus horas trabajadas. Para esos casos se tomó simplemente el primer dato disponible de horas trabajadas. Como éstas han ido cayendo en el tiempo, nuestro cálculo subestima el verdadero número de horas. El resultado, con esta salvedad, es que se trabajaban 1.870 horas, algo mayor aunque no muy distinto al ejercicio anterior. Como este es un límite inferior, se puede decir que los países de la OCDE trabajaban más de 1.870 horas en promedio al año cuando alcanzaron la productividad media del trabajo que tiene Chile en la actualidad. Por cierto, la discusión sobre la jornada laboral es mucho más amplia que el punto específico que se trata en este artículo. En particular, para futuras investigaciones sería interesante acompañar este tema con el de mayor flexibilidad laboral
J81|Sickness absence from work in Spain: are there gender differences?|We use a sample of social security records containing work histories and sick leave episodes to investigate gender differences in the incidence and duration of absence from work due to sickness in Spain. For sick leave incidence we apply a competing risk model to a panel of newly employed workers who can be followed for two years until an episode of sick leave occurs or the job ends. For the duration of sick leave spells, we estimate a Weibull model. We distinguish between sick leave due to occupational illness or injury and sick leave due to common disease or accident. This distinction is important because only for the latter women have higher incidence and longer duration than men. In this respect, the presence of children under 3 years of age in the household becomes a significant explanatory factor.
J81|Is Socially Responsible Production a Normal Good?|This paper uses a controlled laboratory experiment to investigate the effect of wealth on individual social responsibility (ISR), defined as choosing a more socially responsible product if a cheaper alternative is available. We find that rich consumers are significantly less likely to engage in ISR than poor consumers. This suggests that socially responsible production conditions may not be normal product attributes.
J81|Self-managed working time and employee effort: Theory and evidence|This paper theoretically and empirically examines the impact of self-managed working time (SMWT) on employee effort. As a policy of increased worker autonomy, SMWT can theoretically increase effort via intrinsic motivation and reciprocal behaviour, but it can also lead to a decrease of effort due to a loss of control. Based on German individual-level panel data, we find that SMWT employees exert higher effort levels than employees with fixed working hours. Even after accounting for observed and unobserved characteristics there remains a modest positive effect. This effect is largely driven by employees who are intrinsically motivated, suggesting that intrinsic motivation is complementary to SMWT. However, reciprocal work intensification does not seem to be an important channel of providing extra effort.
J81|Working conditions and regulation|Do employers invest sufficiently in the working conditions of employees? We examine this question in a simple principal-agent model. We show that, even though investment is contractible, the principal underinvests whenever her agent's alternatives are rather poor. This provides a reason for regulation. The indirect regulatory approach of taking measures that improve the agent's bargaining power or outside option at least weakly enhances the agent's well-being and welfare. The direct regulatory approach of demanding a certain standard of working conditions increases the principal's investment, but may nonetheless leave the agent's well-being unaffected and deteriorate welfare. This holds true since due to a standard, the principal may provide the agent with a lower-powered incentive scheme and implement a lower effort level.
J81|Striking a balance: optimal tax policy with labor market duality|We develop a dynamic general equilibrium model in which firms may evade the employer contribution component of social security taxes by offering some workers secondary contracts. We calibrate the model to data from the United States and EU-14 countries and obtain estimates of the secondary labor market participation consistent with empirical evidence. We then investigate the optimal mix of the avoidable and unavoidable components of labor taxes and analyze the fiscal and macroeconomic effects of bringing the composition to the welfare optimum. We find that partial labor tax evasion makes tax revenues more elastic, but full tax compliance need not be a welfare enhancing policy mix. Relating to the highly cited work of Trabandt and Uhlig (2011), we extend their framework to analyze the phenomenon of non-standard employment. We distinguish between avoidable and unavoidable labor taxation -- the former may be evaded by firms if they formulate a contract with a worker as a non-standard employment contract and may be associated with employers' share in labor taxation. The latter is paid by worker--households. Our results enrich the intuition about the optimal mix of the two types of labor taxation. We show that in countries where the share of avoidable labor taxes is relatively low, substantial welfare gains can be achieved by changing the mix of the two types of labor taxes. The gains emanate from higher labor supply and consumption which accompanies modest increases in secondary employment. These gains are obtained without loss to aggregate fiscal revenue. In addition to these main results, we also show that plausible estimates of the levels of tax evasion, the efficiency of tax auditing and the shares of secondary employment can be obtained from aggregate tax revenue data.
J81|The Relationship between Working Hours and Mortality in the United States|This study bridges a gap in the literature by examining the relationship between working hours and the probability of mortality among older workers in the United States. We have applied the Cox regression method, a frequently used approach in survival analysis, to panel data from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS). We have found a small negative relationship exists between working hours and the probability of mortality. This study’s findings may raise questions about the need for initiatives in the European Union and other countries that regulate the length of work schedules.
J81|Workforce Entry Conditions and Job Satisfaction|This paper examines the relation between macroeconomic experiences and job satisfaction. Specifically, we analyze whether former work entry conditions have persistent effects on job satisfaction. Pooled Ordinary Least Squares method is applied to eighteen waves of the British Household Panel Survey. In order to check robustness of the established results, we also use Fixed Effect and Ordered Probit Estimation techniques. The results of relationship between work entry unemployment rate and job satisfaction is found negatively statistically significant at rho=.01 level in all methods. Even controlling for important factors on job satisfaction, such as industry and occupation differences, age, gender and income, the negative and significant effect of work entry conditions on job satisfaction continues to survive. The established results indicate that people who entered workforce when unemployment rate is high has less job satisfaction even in later ages compared to the ones who entered workforce when unemployment rate is lower.
J81|The Role of the Working Environment on the Employee Morale|"""Objective – The research aims to know the effect of forming aspects of the work environment consisting of the employee’s service, the work condition and the relationship among employees towards employee morale at Limited Liability Company of Bank Tabungan Negara Branch Jember, whether simultaneously or partially, and to know the forming aspects of the work environment that dominantly influence towards employee morale at Limited Liability Company of Bank Tabungan Negara Branch Jember. The population of this research is all of the employees at Limited Liability Company of Bank Tabungan Negara Branch Jember. Methodology/Technique – The applied method of census is multiple linear regressions. Findings – The result shows that the forming aspects of the work environment simultaneously have significant influence towards employee morale at Limited Liability Company of Bank Tabungan Negara Branch Jember. While the result of the test shows that the three forming aspects of the work environment partially have significant influence towards employee morale at Limited Liability Company of Bank Tabungan Negara Branch Jember. Novelty – The implication of this study is that there are many things to increase the employee morale, one of them is providing a good and comfortable work environment. At least, the company should pay attention to the three forming aspects of the work environment, such as giving employee services, working conditions, and employee relationship with the work place."""
J81|Adjustment of the Vietnamese Labour Market in Time of Economic fluctuations and Structural Changes|In this paper, we consider how labour market adjusts to economic fluctuations, considering structural transformation at work as well as short term changes. We utilise series calculated from population censuses and data published in the statistical yearbooks of GSO for long term series, and Labour Force Surveys from 2007 to 2012 for short term data. The paper highlights the deep transformation of the labour market in the last decades. The labour force has doubled in 25 years and the share of agriculture has declined below 50%. Labour supply absorption was thus one of the main challenges for the Vietnamese economy. The household sector has been the main job provider over the years, in agriculture as well as in non-farm activities. The labour market has adjusted to the recent economic slowdown through different channels. If unemployment does not rise, some people withdraw from the labour force and the number of non-active people has grown. The quantity of labour is also affected by a significant reduction of hours worked. While the non-farm sector generates more jobs for skilled workers, there is a shift of unskilled labour towards agriculture. Due to demographic factors, labour supply absorption and creation of new jobs become a less acute problem. As Vietnam benefits of the demographic dividend, the situation on the labour market should be favourable during the present decade to implement structural policies. _________________________________ Dans cet article, nous examinons les ajustements du marché du travail aux fluctuations économiques, compte tenu des transformations structurelles en cours ainsi que des changements à court terme. Nous utilisons pour cela des données des recensements de la population ou publiées dans les annuaires statistiques de l’Office Général de la Statistique pour les séries à long terme, et les enquêtes emploi conduites entre 2007 à 2012 pour les données à court terme. Cet article souligne la profonde transformation du marché du travail au cours des dernières décennies. La population active a doublé en 25 ans et la part de l'agriculture est passée en dessous du seuil de 50 %. L’absorption de l'offre de travail a donc été l'un des principaux défis pour l'économie vietnamienne sur cette période. Le secteur des entreprises familiales agricoles et non-agricoles a été le principal pourvoyeur d'emplois au cours de ces années. Le marché du travail s'est adapté au récent ralentissement économique à travers différents canaux. Le chômage est resté stable mais le nombre de personnes inactives a augmenté. La quantité de travail a également été affectée par une réduction significative du nombre d'heures travaillées. Alors que le secteur non agricole a généré plus d'emplois pour les travailleurs qualifiés, un flux de travailleurs non-qualifiés vers l’agriculture a été observé. En raison de facteurs démographiques, l'absorption de l'offre de travail et la création de nouveaux emplois ne sont plus le principal problème. En revanche, l’évolution récente du marché du travail appelle à la mise en oeuvre de politiques structurelles en vue d’améliorer les conditions de travail, la période étant particulièrement favorable pour mener ces politiques puisque le Vietnam profite actuellement du dividende démographique.
J81|The Effects of Firm Size on Job Quality: A Comparative Study for Britain and France|Using linked employer-employee data from two comparable surveys this article examines the links between non-pecuniary job quality and workplace characteristics in Britain and France – countries with very different employment regimes. The results show that job quality is better in Britain than it is in France, despite its minimalist regulatory regime. The difference is apparent for all dimensions of job quality (skill development, training participation, job autonomy, job insecurity, work-life balance and relations between employers and employees), except skills' match to a job. Firm size is negatively associated with non-pecuniary job quality in both countries but in France the association is confined to only the largest firms. Internal Labour Markets (ILMs) are associated with higher job quality in France, but not in Britain.
J81|The Effect of Paid Vacation on Health: Evidence from Sweden|This study estimates the causal effect of paid vacation on health. Using register data on the universe of central government employees in Sweden, I exploit an age-based rule stipulated in the collective agreement covering these employees. Identification is achieved by combining a regression discontinuity with a difference-in-differences design to control for time-invariant differences between consecutive birth cohorts and isolate the true effect at two separate discontinuities at ages 30 and 40. The main results indicate no statistically significant changes in health (proxied by specialized outpatient care visits, inpatient care admissions, and long-term sick leaves) induced by an increase of three paid vacation days at age 30 and four days at age 40. There is no evidence of significant effects by sex, being a (lone) parent, education level, or broad group of diagnoses. These findings challenge the anecdotally-motivated view of additional paid vacation days as a means to improve workers' health.
J81|The role of employer, job and employee characteristics for flexible working time : An empirical analysis of overtime work and flexible working hours' arrangements|"""Modern working societies face the challenge to combine the establishments' with the employees' needs for working-time flexibility. The authors investigate the determinants of overtime and different working hours' arrangements using the German Linked Employer-Employee Study of the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP-LEE) and logistic regression models. The results show that employer and job characteristics are most important for determining overtime and the different working hours' arrangements, underlining the power of employers with regard to working-time flexibility. Employee characteristics play the least important role, although employees can flexibly organize their working times and can benefit from certain arrangements, such as self-determined working hours and flexitime within a working hours account. The study provides evidence that working-time flexibility in Germany is mainly employer-oriented. However, through demographic changes and a possible lack of qualified personnel, employee- friendly arrangements are likely to gain importance."" (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en))"
J81|What makes employees satisfied with their working time? : The role of working hours, time-sovereignty and working conditions for working time and job satisfaction|"""Working time arrangements are key elements of working conditions and determine the possibilities for employees to balance work with their other life spheres. Therefore, this paper examines the level of working time satisfaction of employees and identifies the factors that may facilitate or impede satisfaction with working time using crosssectional data from the German BIBB/BAuA-Employment Survey. The analytical basis is a generalized ordered logistic regression model. The main results indicate that individual time-sovereignty is positively linked with a high level of working time satisfaction. Worker-friendly working time arrangements, which lead to less stress, insecurity and mental pressure, increase satisfaction levels, whereas atypical working time arrangements, such as unpaid overtime and working shifts, weekends and under high intensity, reduce satisfaction levels.""

J81|Temporary Employment Boom in Poland: A Job Quality vs. Quantity Trade-off?|Between 2002 and 2015, temporary employment in Poland more than doubled. Poland became the country with the highest share of temporary jobs in the EU. In this paper, we study how this process affected job quality and job quantity. We analyse the gaps between temporary and permanent workers in six dimensions of jobs quality, adopting measures proposed by the OECD and Eurofound. Of these gaps, the differences in earnings quality, job security, and work scheduling quality were the most pronounced. Job quality has improved for both groups of workers, but the gaps have not closed completely. Firms in Poland prefer to employ temporary rather than permanent workers because of the lower firing costs, tax wedges, and wages associated with temporary contracts. We use a stylised labour demand model to quantify the upper bound of a potential job creation effect due to lower labour costs incurred through the use of temporary contracts. We find that this effect did not exceed 4% of dependent employment in 2015. We cannot rule out the possibility that the net employment effect was zero. Our findings show that even if the availability of less-costly temporary contracts caused some additional jobs to be created, temporary workers suffered from lower job quality in several dimensions.

Tomamos como caso el de Chile, que, a pesar de haber implementado importantes reformas modernizadoras en la economÃ­a, aÃºn registra tasas bajas de participaciÃ³n femenina. Usando un modelo macro estÃ¡ndar, estimado economÃ©tricamente, se muestra que hay importantes ganancias en aumentar los servicios de jardines infantiles a travÃ©s de la productividad mÃ©s que por un aumento de la oferta laboral, punto que remarca la literatura de conciliaciÃ©n trabajo y familiar mÃ¡s que la literatura macro tradicional. La segunda contribuciÃ³n es que los cambios en la composiciÃ³n del financiamiento entre trabajadores y empresas se diluyen en la economÃ­a a nivel agregado. AsÃ­, la principal consecuencia de polÃ­tica econÃ³mica para otras economÃ­as con bajas tasas de participaciÃ³n femenina es que aumentar los niveles de conciliaciÃ³n trabajo y familia, y por tanto la productividad, tienen importantes efectos positivos a nivel macroeconÃ³mico sin que los costos de su financiamiento compensen los beneficios.
J81|You Can(’t) Always Get the Job You Want: Stated versus Revealed Employment Preferences in the Peruvian Agro-industry| Employment in high-value agro-export sectors has been recognized to entail the potential to contribute to poverty reduction in rural areas of developing countries. Concerns have yet been raised about the quality of the created employment and worker preferences have often been overlooked in the literature. We use a discrete choice experiment, in which we relate stated and revealed employment preference of agro-industrial export workers in Peru. We explain employment (mis)matches as a function of personal and employer characteristics. Results suggest that employment preferences are heterogeneous, but that labor market frictions are smaller than what is commonly expected in developing country contexts.
J81|Health and Body Mass Index: No Simple Relationship|Many studies have shown that obesity is a serious health problem for our society. Empirical analyses often neglect a number of methodological issues and relevant influences on health. This paper investigates empirically whether neglecting these items leads to systematically different estimates. Based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, this study derives the following results. (1) Many combinations of weight and height lead to the same health status. (2) Obese people have a significantly worse state of health. (3) The hypothesis has to be rejected that weight is an exogenous influence on health. (4) High income helps to improve men's health while deviations between desired and actual working hours induce negative effects. (5) The more siblings a woman has and the lower her father's social status, the worse is her health status. (6) Smoking is not good for health, a well-known fact. Especially for underweight individuals we detect the negative influence on health. Women are less affected. (7) A healthy diet strengthens the resilience for individuals who are not obese. (8) Long but not too long sleeping hours and sporting activities during youth contribute to a good health status. (9) Weight fluctuations induce negative effects on the health of women only. (10) Four of the big five components of personality, namely openness, extraversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness, contribute to resilience against health problems for underweight people.

J81|The Motivation of Temporary Agency Workers: An Empirical Analysis|We are investigating the relationship between individual and job-related characteristics and the motivation of temporary agency workers. To do so, we are using a unique dataset from one of Germany's largest temporary work agencies. For 3,000 temporary agency workers, a subjective motivation appraisal is provided by the respective direct manager within the hiring company. It is possible to observe a positive relationship between the decision on transition to regular employment and the motivation of temporary agency workers. Women in temporary agency work demonstrate a higher degree of motivation than men. However, in the case of men a clearer correlation can be observed between project duration and motivation. A change of hiring company with follow-up projects has a negative effect on the temporary agency worker's motivation.
J81|Labor Unions and Occupational Safety: Event-Study Analysis Using Union Elections|This study examines the dynamic relationship between union elections and occupational safety among manufacturing establishments. Data on union elections come from the National Labor Relations Board, and data on workplace inspections and accident case rates come from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The results indicate that union elections improved occupational safety. First, workplace inspections trended upwards before the election, then decreased immediately after the election, due almost entirely to employee complaints. Second, accident case rates were relatively stable before the election, then trended downwards after the election, due to accidents involving days away from work, job restrictions, and job transfers. These effects are evident regardless of the election outcome. Based on the value of statistical injury, the improvement in occupational safety is equivalent to an increase in the hourly wage between $0.47 and $2.62.

J81|The Effect of Unpaid Overtime Hours on Health|Do working overtime hours affect worker health? Does the effect depend on whether a worker receives overtime payment or not? In this paper, we examine the effect of overtime hours on health, paying attention to overtime payment. We use gPreference Parameters Study of Osaka University h from 2009 to 2013. The dataset enables us to control observable factors, for example: work environment, individual and household characteristics. Further, panel analysis is employed to remove unobservable heterogeneity. Our result shows a harmful effect of overtime hours to worker health. We also find that overtime hours deteriorate worker health only if the worker does not get paid for overtime.

J81|Work-sharing from Different Angles: A literature review|Could work-sharing solves the problems of unemployment, inequality and global warming, and yet produce a happier world? This literature review takes a multidisciplinary view of the problem. We find that theoretically work-sharing can do all these things, but the existing evidence of its performance is debatable and there are hesitations from industry to implement it. We recommend a global initiative, riding on the sustainable development wave, with an appealing narrative to create a just distribution in today's world.
J81|Quality of Work Life in Colombia: A Multidimensional Fuzzy Indicator|Abstract Quality of work (QoW) encompasses multiple objective and subjective dimensions, which may include labor income, job stability, job satisfaction, and social security. This paper follows the method proposed by Gómez-Salcedo et al. (2013) that introduces a new way of measuring QoW, which consists of (1) the use of Sen’s functioning and capabilities approach and (2) a fuzzy sets method to define membership to the sets of good job quality. Using the Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares, we obtain results at the national level about age, gender, educational level, firm size, and industry sector. The results are consistent with previous literature. One topic that is highlighted from our results is the existence of a “Quality of Work Life Cycle”, with higher levels of the index up to age 30, that may have critical implications for the social security system; people with lower quality jobs may not be contributing to health and pension funds, leaving many people without access to a retirement fund and implying more demands on the subsidized system to cover health expenses.
J81|The Trade Impacts of the Naming and Shaming of Forced and Child Labor|This paper investigates whether the provision of information regarding what foreign goods might be produced with child and forced labor affects imports to the United States. I use three different measures of information revelation: inclusion on the U.S. government's list of goods produced with child or forced labor, a media coverage index and an index composed from reports of the International Labor Organisation. Across all specifications I find no evidence that information provision decreased imports of these goods to the United States. The key policy implication of this finding is that public information strategies without more concrete measures will not act as a large disincentive for countries that export goods made with child and forced labor.
J81|The quality of employment in the early labour market experience of young Europeans|This paper presents a new approach to evaluating individuals' employment quality, considering the evolution of individuals' employment conditions over a period of time, instead of the quality of jobs held at a certain point in time. In particular, we present a new definition of employment quality, based on four dimensions: employment security, income security, economic success and the successful match between education and occupation. Using EU- SILC data, we analyse the extent to which the achievement of employment quality five years after leaving education varies according to gender, education, country groups and time periods. Our findings suggest that there is still a pressing need to enhance women's chances to remain continuously in employment and to move up in the labour income distribution. Loosening the rules on the use of temporary contracts actually generates more difficulties for women and low-educated individuals and it also appears to worsen youth employment prospects in general.
J81|Calidad del empleo y crecimiento económico: El caso de Uruguay|This research aims to contribute to knowledge about the quality of employment in Uruguay. The multi-dimensionality of the problem is addressed by constructing a dependent employment quality index (Bad Employment Index -IME-) using the methodology of Alkire and Foster (2001). The IME summarizes information on quality in four dimensions of the problem: income, social protection, hours worked and productivity and development opportunities. The EMI value for the period 1991Q1 - 2016Q4 was calculated using data from the INE Continuous Household Survey. Its evolution in comparison with GDP shows that it is not enough to register economic growth to improve the quality of occupations. It is only since the last quarter of 2005 that there has been a clear improvement in the quality of salaried employment, coinciding with years of uninterrupted economic growth, but also with greater Government intervention in the rules of the labour market. This relationship is estimated using an ARDL modelling with the cointegration analysis proposed by Pesaran et al. (2001). Based on the results, it is concluded that the evolution of GDP is a significant variable in order to reduce bad jobs, but that the changes since the end of 2005 also had an impact on improving the quality of occupations.

J81|Forschungsdesiderate: Bezahlte repetitive Crowdarbeit und Gesundheit|Das zentrale Thema des Human Resource Managements ist die Digitalisierung von Produktion und Arbeit sowie die damit verbundenen Möglichkeiten der Tele- und Cloudarbeit. Hier werden effizientere Lösungen des Personaleinsatzes ausgemacht. Dabei steht besonders auch die Clickarbeit im Zentrum des Interesses. Sie weist zurzeit große Wachstumsraten auf. Im Unterschied dazu gibt es kaum Befunde über das individuelle Erleben dieser Arbeit und deren gesundheitsbezogenen Gefährdungspotenziale. Daher wird in diesem Übersichtsartikel den Fragen nachgegangen: Welche schon systematisch feststellbaren Merkmale liegen für diese Clickarbeit und ihrer gesundheitlichen Auswirkungen vor? Und: Inwieweit beinhaltet das klassische betriebliche Gesundheitsmanagement arbeitsgestaltende Strategien für die Clickworker? Als Ergebnis wird festgehalten: Die Clickarbeit ist jenseits klassischer Beschäftigungs-, Arbeits- und Gesundheitsschutzregeln eine routinebasierte, fragmentierte Arbeit, die eine geringe Anforderungsvielfalt ausweist. Sie ruft nur marginal das berufliche Wissen und die entsprechenden Kompetenzen der Arbeitenden ab und bietet geringe persönliche Anerkennungs- und Entwicklungsmöglichkeiten. Diese Tätigkeit wird gering entlohnt, ist einer schwankenden Auftragslage ausgesetzt und beinhaltet erhebliche gesundheitsbezogene Gefährdungsrisiken. Das klassische betriebliche Gesundheitsmanagement kann diesen Risiken nicht entsprechen. Daher werden Überlegungen zu einem Gesundheitsmanagement im Zeichen des digitalen Wandels von Arbeit vorgetragen.
J81|Qualität der Arbeit in Europa: Eine empirische Analyse auf Basis des EWCS 2015|Die Arbeitszufriedenheit signalisiert, ob die Beschäftigten die Qualität des eigenen Arbeitsplatzes als gut einschätzen. Der Anteil der Arbeitnehmer in einem Land, die mit ihrer Arbeit zufrieden sind, ist damit ein Gradmesser für die Qualität der Arbeitsplätze in einer Volkswirtschaft insgesamt. Die Qualität der Arbeit ist vor diesem Hintergrund in der Europäischen Union und in den einzelnen Mitgliedstaaten hoch. Rund 86 Prozent der Arbeitnehmer in der Europäischen Union sind mit ihrem Beschäftigungsverhältnis zufrieden. In Deutschland sind es mit 88 Prozent etwas mehr. Dies entspricht dem Wert aus dem Jahr 2010. In vielen Ländern, insbesondere in Ostmitteleuropa, ist das Ausmaß der Arbeitszufriedenheit zwischen 2010 und 2015 von einem relativ niedrigen auf ein vergleichbares Niveau wie in Deutschland angestiegen. Für eine schleichende Verschlechterung der Qualität der Arbeit fehlt daher sowohl hierzulande als auch in der Europäischen Union insgesamt der empirische Beleg. Politischer Handlungsdruck existiert von dieser Seite nicht. Ökonometrische Schätzungen mit den Beschäftigtenstichproben für die Europäische Union und für Deutschland zeigen, dass die Wertschätzung und die Anerkennung, die in Geld, Aufstiegsperspektiven und Worten ausgedrückt werden, ein hohes Gewicht bei der Frage erhalten, ob ein Arbeitnehmer mit dem Job zufrieden ist. Eine ähnlich hohe Bedeutung fällt einem guten sozialen Umfeld am Arbeitsplatz zu. Die empirischen Befunde lassen zudem vermuten, dass vielerorts als eher belastend empfundene Arbeitsplatzmerkmale, die für sich genommen mit einer niedrigeren Arbeitszufriedenheit einhergehen, durch andere als unterstützend empfundene Arbeitsbedingungen kompensiert werden. Dadurch wird die Qualität der Arbeit von den Beschäftigten in diesen Fällen bei einer ganzheitlichen Betrachtung als gut wahrgenommen.
J81|Country-Specific Conditions for Work and Family Reconciliation: An Attempt at Quantification|Abstract The country-specific conditions for work and family reconciliation (family policies, labour market structures and gender norms) are believed to influence tensions between paid employment and childbearing. So far there have been very few attempts to quantify these conditions into a single measure which would allow for comparisons across countries of the magnitude of the barriers that working parents encounter. Such a quantitative index could also facilitate a quantitative investigation of the association between the macro-level conditions for work and family reconciliation and fertility at the individual level. In this paper, we seek to fill this gap by proposing a quantitative index of country-specific conditions for work and family reconciliation, which may be used, for example, in a two-level regression framework. The index takes into account all three components of the conditions for work and family reconciliation. We also perform a series of uncertainty and sensitivity analyses which verify the robustness of our assumptions and which illustrate the range of the index volatility.
J81|Temporary Jobs and the Severity of Workplace Accidents|From the point of view of workplace safety, it is important to know whether having a temporary job has an effect on the severity of workplace accidents. We present an empirical analysis on the severity of workplace accidents by type of contract. We used micro data collected by the Italian national institute managing the mandatory insurance against work related accidents. We estimated linear models for a measure of the severity of the workplace accident. We controlled for time-invariant fixed effects at worker and firm levels to disentangle the impact of the type of contract from the spurious one induced by unobservables at worker and firm levels. We found that workers with a temporary contract, if subject to a workplace accident, were more likely to be confronted with severe injuries than permanent workers. When correcting the statistical analysis for injury under-reporting of temporary workers, we found that most of, but not all, the effect is driven by the under-reporting bias. The effect of temporary contracts on the injury severity survived the inclusion of worker and firm fixed effects and the correction for temporary workers' injury under-reporting. This however does not exclude the possibility that, within firms, the nature of the work may vary between different categories of workers. For example, temporary workers might be more likely to be assigned by the employer dangerous tasks because they might have less bargaining power. The findings will be of help in designing public policy effective in increasing temporary workers' safety at work and limiting their injury under-reporting.
J81|Insiders, Outsiders, and Involuntary Unemployment: Sexual Harrassment Exacerbates Gender Inequality|Sexual harassment is perceived to be a major impediment to female labor force participation. We use the random assignment of U.S. federal judges setting geographically-local precedent, and the fact that judges’ biographies predict decisions in sexual harassment cases, to document the causal impact of forbidding sexual harassment. Consistent with an insider-outsider theory of involuntary unemployment, but in contrast to a mandated benefits theory of employment protections, pro-plaintiff sexual harassment precedent spurred the adoption of sexual harassment human resources policies, encouraged entry of outsiders, and reduced gender inequality in labor supply and wages among the population. These effects were comparable to the effects of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and greatest in the construction industry, which was heavily affected by sexual harassment litigation.

J81|Child labor in China|We present the first systematic study on child labor in China. Child labor is not a negligible social phenomenon in China; about 7.74% of children aged from 10 to 15 were working in 2010, and they worked for 6.75h per day on average, and spent 6.42h less per day on study than other children. About 90% of child laborers were still in school and combined economic activity with schooling. Our results show that child labor participation is positively associated with school dropout rate. A child living in a rural area is more likely to work. Compared with place of residence, the gender of a child are less important. The educational level of the household head and its interaction with the gender of the household head seem to be unimportant. However, household assets per capita and household involvement in non-agricultural activities are negatively related to the incidence of child labor. A child from a household with more adults is less likely to work. The prevalence of child labor in China exhibits significant regional variations. The child labor incidence is correlated with the development level of each region: the Western region has the highest percentage of child labor, followed by the Eastern and Central regions.
J81|Human resource management practices and organizational performance. The mediator role of immaterial satisfaction in Italian Social Cooperatives|The paper deals with the mediating role of immaterial satisfaction between substantive human resources (HR) features and organizational performance. We address this relationship in the Italian social service sector using a survey dataset that includes 4134 workers and 320 not-for-profit social cooperatives. The obtained results show that human resource management (HRM) practices influence immaterial satisfaction and, satisfaction positively impacts on firm performance. However, the impact of the different HRM practices is not the same. In this sense, worker involvement and workload pressure have a positive impact on firm performance; but task autonomy or collaborative teamwork do not have impact on organizational performance.
J81|Financialisation and work: New transdisciplinary insights from micro-level survey data|The paper examines the interdependencies of financialisation and working conditions by exploring the comparative findings of a micro-level survey on household income, household debt, and working conditions which was conducted in five European countries representing different institutional and socio-economic contexts (Sweden, Germany, the UK, Portugal, Poland). Referring to different strands of debate in economics and sociology in a transdisciplinary way, four hypotheses on the impact of financialisation on the worker-consumer nexus are selected and tested: 1) the social inequality thesis, 2) the debt-income compensation thesis, 3) the cultural transformation thesis, and 4) the disciplinary thesis. The findings reveal that, notwithstanding differences across the five countries, living conditions have worsened after the Global Financial Crisis for many households, with declining household incomes, higher household indebtedness to cover living expenses, and deteriorated working conditions. Surprisingly, the finance-work nexus has been more detrimental to low-income and non-standard workers in Germany and Poland. Hence, it is concluded that the impact of financialisation on well-being cannot simply be read from the size of national financial systems or the extent of household engagement with finance, nor from mainstream welfare regime typologies. Instead, to better understand these impacts we need to consider the more indirect influence of financialisation on labour market polarization and income distribution.
J81|Self-managed working time and firm performance: Microeconometric evidence|This paper empirically examines the impact of self-managed working time (SMWT) on firm performance using panel data from German establishments. As a policy for the decentralization of decision rights, SMWT provides employees with extensive control over scheduling individual working time. From a theoretical viewpoint, SMWT has ambiguous effects on both worker productivity and wages. Based on the construction of a quasi-natural experiment and the combination of a differences-in-differences approach with propensity score matching as an identification strategy, the empirical analysis shows that up to five years after introduction, SMWT increases firm productivity by about 9% and wage costs by about 8.5%. This implies that SMWT improves both individual and firm productivity, and supplemental evidence shows that these productivity enhancements can primarily be explained by incentive effects associated with decentralization policies in general.

J81|The Charity Of The Extremely Wealthy|In this paper, we compare the charitable behavior of billionaires who inherited their wealth to the charitable behavior of those billionaires who made their own wealth. Self-made billionaires are found to be more likely to sign the ‘Giving Pledge’ and more likely to be in the Million Dollar Gifts lists or the Philanthropy Top 50 list of big givers, even after controlling for many other variables that can affect charitable behavior. They also are found to give more conditional on giving. This finding, which is consistent with ‘mental accounting’ occurring even at extremely high stakes, means policy makers in many emerging markets with ‘new’ billionaires better quickly modernize their outdated charity laws.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J81|Testing the Labor Market Dualism in Korea|The existence of the dual labor market in Korea is tested under the two different definitions of the labor market dualism. First, the estimation results from widely used tools such as Heckman's sample selection model support the existence of two wage equations, advocating the presence of labor market dualism in Korea. Second, the labor market dualism index suggested by Hudson (2007) supports that there is some degree of bifurcation between the good job conditions and bad job conditions.

J81|Working from Home - What is the Effect on Employees' Effort?|This paper investigates how working from home affects employees' work effort. Employees, who have the possibility to work from home, have a high autonomy in scheduling their work and therefore are assumed to have a higher intrinsic motivation. Thus, we expect working from home to positively influence work effort of employees. For the empirical analysis we use the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). To account for self-selection into working locations we use an instrumental variable (IV) estimation strategy. Our empirical results show that working from home has a significantly positive influence on work effort. Moreover, we find that also the frequency of working from home is crucial. The more often employees work from home, the higher is the work effort they provide.

J81|Política social contemporánea. Un paradigma en crisis|Este trabajo consta de dos partes. En la primera se hace una crítica a la política social contemporánea, la cual tiene dos ejes: Lucha contra la pobreza y aseguramiento. El discurso afirma que gasto social se debe dirigir hacia los más pobres y que la mejor forma de ayudarlos consiste en dotarlos de activos para se puedan insertar al mercado y disfrutar de los beneficios del crecimiento económico. Ello se debe combinar con el manejo social del riesgo, permitiendo que los individuos puedan administrar sus seguros a través del mercado. La crítica a dicha política se basa en que promueve el individualismo y la ciudadanía invertida: Se hace necesario ser un fracasado social para acceder a prestaciones sociales gratuitas. En la segunda parte de este trabajo, se afirma que es necesario redefinir el sujeto social de la política social. No es el pobre ni el trabajador asalariado. Dicho trabajador hoy no representa al trabajador contemporáneo, ese trabajador está en la Economía Popular urbana. ****** This work is based in two parts. In first place it's formulated a critique of contemporary social policy, which has two axes: The fight against poverty and insurance. The discourse states that social spending should be directed towards the poorest and the best way to help is to provide them with assets so that they can be inserted to the market and enjoy the benefits of economic growth. This must be combined with social risk management, allowing individuals to manage their insurance through the market. This policy promotes individualism and citizenship inverted: It is necessary to be a social failed to access free social benefits. In the second part of this paper, it is stated that it's necessary to redefine the social subject of social policy. It's no more the poor or salaried worker. This worker today does not represent the contemporary worker, which is inserted in the Urban Popular Economy.
J81|Occupational Choice in Early Industrializing Societies: Experimental Evidence on the Income and Health Effects of Industrial and Entrepreneurial Work|As low-income countries industrialize, workers choose between informal self-employment and low-skill manufacturing. What do workers trade off, and what are the long run impacts of this occupational choice? Self-employment is thought to be volatile and risky, but to provide autonomy and flexibility. Industrial firms are criticized for poor wages and working conditions, but they could offer steady hours among other advantages. This paper worked with five Ethiopian industrial firms to randomize entry-level applicants to one of three treatment arms: an industrial job offer; a control group; or an â€œentrepreneurshipâ€ program of $300 plus business training. It followed the sample over a year. Industrial jobs offered more hours than the control groupâ€™s informal opportunities, but had little impact on incomes due to lower wages. Most applicants quit the sector quickly, finding industrial jobs unpleasant and risky. Indeed, serious health problems rose one percentage point for every month of industrial work. Applicants seem to understand the risks, but took the industrial work temporarily while searching for better work. Meanwhile, the entrepreneurship program stimulated self-employment, raised earnings by 33%, provided steady work hours, and halved the likelihood of taking an industrial job in future. Overall, when the barriers to self-employment were relieved, applicants appear to have preferred entrepreneurial to industrial labor. [Working Paper 22683]
J81|Desigualdades laborales: el empleo y la calificación de la mano de obra en Chile|Son conocidas las grandes diferencias salariales entre personas de distinto nivel de calificación. Sin embargo, cuando se piensa en las condiciones laborales de los individuos, son muchas otras variables las que también entran en juego. ¿En cuántas de éstas se encuentran peor las personas menos educadas? ¿En cuáles las diferencias son mayores? ¿Cómo ha evolucionado la inserción laboral según el nivel de estudios? Este trabajo indaga en estas preguntas y otorga respuestas preocupantes, que dejan en evidencia las muchas desigualdades en el empleo de personas de alto y bajo nivel de calificación. En particular, se comprueba que, conforme aumenta el grado académico de los individuos, mayores son sus tasas de participación y ocupación, mayores son sus ingresos laborales, suelen trabajar en jornada completa y con menor probabilidad de hacerlo más de nueve horas al día, es más probable que tengan contrato, que trabajen de forma dependiente y que realicen cotizaciones previsionales. También es más probable que trabajen en el sector público, en relación a quienes son menos calificados; y que se desempeñen en empresas de mayor tamaño. De esta forma este documento expone un serio problema: en la mayoría de los casos quienes presentan carencias en alguna de las dimensiones de sus condiciones laborales, al mismo tiempo las evidencian en varias otras. Es así como se observan casos extremos en donde hay trabajos de muy buenas condiciones y otros sumamente precarios. Por último, este documento también posee un foco secundario, centrado en poder entender de mejor manera cómo se explican los niveles de desempleo contenido o moderado que se han observado últimamente, a pesar de la desaceleración económica existente. Hecho que ha mantenido en intriga a varios economistas en el último período. Se señala que un aumento de la cantidad absoluta de inactivos no parece ser la mejor hipótesis para explicar el fenómeno. En cambio, se sugiere tener en cuenta que: (i) han existido leves aumentos del porcentaje de la población en la fuerza laboral que podrían estar ocultando un aumento en el número de desempleados, siendo que estos incrementos probablemente han sido absorbidos por la categoría de ocupados; y (ii) que las empresas sí serían sensibles al menor crecimiento, pero harían sus ajustes vía salarios y no vía despidos.
J81|Employment insecurity and employees' health in Denmark|We use register data for Denmark (IDA) merged with the Danish Work Environment Cohort Survey (1995, 2000, and 2005) to estimate the effect of perceived employment insecurity on perceived health for a sample of Danish employees. We consider two health measures from the SF‐36 Health Survey Instrument: a vitality scale for general well‐being and a mental health scale. We first analyse a summary measure of employment insecurity. Instrumental variables‐fixed effects estimates that use firm workforce changes as a source of exogenous variation show that 1 additional dimension of insecurity causes a shift from the median to the 25th percentile in the mental health scale and to the 30th in that of energy/vitality. It also increases by about 6 percentage points the probability to develop severe mental health problems. Looking at single insecurity dimensions by naïve fixed effects, uncertainty associated with the current job is important for mental health. Employability has a sizeable relationship with health and is the only insecurity dimension that matters for the energy and vitality scale. Danish employees who fear involuntary firm internal mobility experience worse mental health.
J81|Home Offices: Plenty of Untapped Potential|As far as the share of individuals with a home office is concerned, Germany is below the EU average and lags considerably behind other countries such as France, the UK, or the Scandinavian countries. Only 12 percent of all employees in Germany work primarily or occasionally from home, although this would theoretically be possible in 40 percent of jobs. In most cases, an employee’s desire to work from home is not recognized by employers. If these employers were to reconsider their position, however, the share of people working from home could rise to over 30 percent. The disparity between employees wanting to telecommute and the options offered by employers is greatest in the financial sector and in public administration. Well-qualified full-time employees in particular are interested in working from home. The main motive would appear to be more autonomy in managing their own time, not only reconciling work and family life, since there are just as many singles who would like to work from home as there are single parents. Telecommuters often end up working much longer hours than average, and it is not at all uncommon for them to do unpaid overtime. Nevertheless, their job satisfaction is higher than that of other employees— particularly those who would like to work from home but are not given the option.

J81|Arbeit am Wochenende greift nicht mehr weiter um sich|From the early 1990s until the period between 2007 and 2008, the share of employees who worked weekends - including self-employed workers as well as jobholders - experienced a relatively steady increase. In the years since, however, the trend reversed and this share began to shrink. Noteworthy is the fact that this decline occurred primarily among those who only occasionally work weekends, whereas the share has remained constant among regular or permanent weekend workers. Two opposing forces are at play here: on the one hand, employment is increasing substantially in sectors where working on Saturday or Sunday is necessary, such as hospitality, retail, and health and social affairs; on the other hand, personnel placement in all sectors is shifting from weekends to regular workdays. Although weekend work is more prevalent among men than among women, women are catching up - and in fact, women are now in the lead when it comes to consistent or regular weekend work. Weekend work is also more common among younger employees than among olderones, and is often associated with shift work. There are also differences between Saturdays and Sundays in terms of the kind of jobs being performed. On Saturdays, relatively simple jobs are more common, which means that these workers are earning below-average wages; Sunday workers, however, comprise a relatively large number of workers in jobs for which a university education is required. Von Anfang der Neunzigerjahre bis zu den Jahren 2007/2008 hatte sich der Anteil der Erwerbstätigen, die am Wochenende ihrem Beruf nachgehen, nahezu stetig erhöht. Seitdem ist der Trend gebrochen; der Anteil der am Wochenende beruflich Aktiven geht zurück. Das gilt sowohl für die Selbständigen als auch für die abhängig Beschäftigten. Bei letzteren fällt auf, dass nur gelegentliche Wochenendarbeit auf dem Rückzug ist, während unter ihnen der Anteil derjenigen, die ständig oder regelmäßig am Wochenende berufstätig sind, in den letzten Jahren konstant blieb. Es gibt zwei gegenläufige Entwicklungen. Zum einen wächst die Beschäftigung in solchen Wirtschaftszweigen besonders kräftig, in denen Arbeit am Samstag oder Sonntag stark verbreitet ist – wie im Gastgewerbe, im Handel oder im Sektor Gesundheit und Soziales. Zum anderen verschiebt sich in der Summe aller Wirtschaftszweige der Personaleinsatz weg vom Wochenende hin zu den üblichen Werktagen. Wochenendarbeit ist unter jüngeren abhängig Beschäftigten stärker ausgeprägt als unter den älteren, unter Männern mehr als unter Frauen – die Frauen haben aber aufgeholt und bei der ständigen beziehungsweise regelmäßigen Wochenendarbeit die Männer bereits überholt. Oft ist Berufstätigkeit am Wochenende mit Schichtarbeit verbunden. Mit Blick auf die Tätigkeiten ist zwischen der Arbeit am Samstag und Sonntag zu unterschieden. Am Samstag werden vergleichsweise häufig einfache Jobs ausgeübt. Die Entlohnung der am Samstag Tätigen ist daher unterdurchschnittlich. Am Sonntag sind indes auch relativ viele Arbeitskräfte aktiv, die für ihre berufliche Tätigkeit eine Hochschulausbildung benötigen.
J81|Home Office: Möglichkeiten werden bei weitem nicht ausgeschöpft|As far as the share of individuals with a home office is concerned, Germany is below the EU average and lags considerably behind other countries such as France, the UK, or the Scandinavian countries. Only twelve percent of all employees in Germany work primarily or occasionally from home, although this would theoretically be possible for 40 percent of jobs. In most cases, an employee’s desire to work from home is not recognized by employers. If these were to reconsider their position, however, the share of people working from home could rise to over 30 percent.

Nevertheless, their job satisfaction is higher than that of other employees—particularly those who would like to work from home but are not given the option. Deutschland liegt beim Anteil der Personen mit Home Office (Heimarbeit) unter dem EU-Durchschnitt und deutlich hinter anderen Ländern wie Frankreich, dem Vereinigten Königreich oder den skandinavischen Ländern zurück. Nur zwölf Prozent aller abhängig Beschäftigten hierzulande arbeiten überwiegend oder gelegentlich von zu Hause aus, obwohl dies bei 40 Prozent der Arbeitsplätze theoretisch möglich wäre. In den meisten Fällen scheitert der Wunsch nach Heimarbeit an den Arbeitgebern. Würden sie umdenken, könnte der Anteil der Heimarbeiter auf über 30 Prozent steigen. Im Finanzsektor und in der öffentlichen Verwaltung klaffen die Wünsche der Arbeitnehmer nach Heimarbeit und die von den Arbeitgebern angebotenen Möglichkeiten am weitesten auseinander. Vor allem gut qualifizierte, vollzeitbeschäftige Arbeitskräfte sind an Heimarbeit interessiert. Grundlegendes Motiv ist offenbar der Wunsch nach mehr zeitlicher Autonomie und nicht allein die Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie, denn Singles möchten ähnlich häufig zu Hause arbeiten wie Alleinerziehende. Heimarbeiter kommen oft auf weit überdurchschnittlich lange Arbeitszeiten, und nicht selten leisten sie unbezahlte Mehrarbeit. Gleichwohl sind sie mit ihrer Arbeit zufriedener als andere Arbeitskräfte – insbesondere als jene, die sich Heimarbeit wünschen, aber nicht die Möglichkeit dazu erhalten.

J81|Enforcement of labor market regulations: heterogeneous compliance and adjustment across gender|Abstract This paper explores microdata from Argentine household surveys to analyze how changes in the enforcement of labor regulations affect the compliance level and other labor outcomes among men and women. Using information of the highly decentralized labor inspection system in Argentina, I construct an enforcement measure with variation at the province, sector, and time level (share of inspected firms) which I instrument using a measure of the arrival cost of labor inspectors to the firms. The main findings reveal that when enforcement increases, the compliance with mandated benefits and formal wages increase among men, while informal wages decline. Among women, the compliance level declines jointly with informal wages. These heterogenous impacts are explained by labor regulations that make formal and informal men more substitutable in the production process than formal and informal women.
J81|Job stress in Japanese academia: The role of relative income, time allocation by task, and children|We examine the role of income relative deprivation, time allocation by task, and children in the job stress experienced by Japanese academics. Males’ job stress increases when their incomes are lower than that of their peers’, but females are not susceptible to such income comparisons. Job stress decreases with hours spent on research, provided the hours are not excessive; however, hours spent in teaching and on administrative tasks always increase job stress. The presence of young children increases job stress only for females, and children largely explain the observed gender differences in job-related stress.
J81|The effects of import competition on worker health|Occupational health is an important determinant of workers' welfare. Existing mechanisms and evidence from the international trade and occupational safety literatures combine to predict that import competition impacts work place injuries, especially at small firms that are most affected by foreign imports. We examine this prediction with novel data on injuries at US manufacturers using Chinese import growth in 1996–2007 as a shock to competition. The data show that injury rates in the competing US industries increase over the short to medium run, particularly at smaller establishments. Back-of-the-envelope calculations show that injury risk increases by 13% at the smallest establishments, the equivalent of a 1% to 2% reduction in workers' wages.
J81|Do working conditions at older ages shape the health gradient?|This study examines whether working conditions at the end of workers' careers impact health and contribute to health disparities across occupations. A dynamic panel correlated random effects model is used in conjunction with a rich data set that combines information from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), expert ratings of job demands from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET), and mid-career earnings records from the Social Security Administration's (SSA) Master Earnings File (MEF). Results reveal a strong relationship between positive aspects of the psychosocial work environment and improved self-reported health status, blood pressure, and cognitive function. However, there is little evidence to suggest that working conditions shape observed health disparities between occupations in the years leading up to retirement.
J81|Quitting and peer effects at work|This paper studies the influence of peers on the extensive margin of effort at work by means of a real-effort experiment in which subjects have to decide on the intensity of effort and when to stop working. Participants perform a task alone or in the presence of a peer. The feedback on the co-worker's output is manipulated and we vary whether the two workers can communicate. We find that when communication is allowed, the average productivity per unit of time and the quitting time are not increased but the presence of a peer causes workers to stay longer and to quit at more similar times. Peer effects on the extensive margin of effort derive more from a sociability effect, i.e. a reduction of the social distance between co-workers that could make the other's presence more valuable, than from performance or quitting time comparisons.
J81|Share capitalism and worker wellbeing|We show that worker wellbeing is determined not only by the amount of compensation workers receive but also by how compensation is determined. While previous theoretical and empirical work has often been preoccupied with individual performance-related pay, we find that the receipt of a range of group-performance schemes (profit shares, group bonuses and share ownership) is associated with higher job satisfaction. This holds conditional on wage levels, so that pay methods are associated with greater job satisfaction in addition to that coming from higher wages. We use a variety of methods to control for unobserved individual and job-specific characteristics. We suggest that half of the share-capitalism effect is accounted for by employees reciprocating for the “gift”; we also show that share capitalism helps dampen the negative wellbeing effects of what we typically think of as “bad” aspects of job quality.
J81|Long-term consequences of workplace bullying on sickness absence|Bullying in workplaces is a problem thought to harm individual productivity. This paper investigates whether being exposed to bullying in the workplace increases long-term sickness absence. We analyze employees from a selection of workplaces from The Bullying Cohort Study conducted in Denmark in 2006. The Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised was used to avoid bias related to self-labeling as being bullied. We account for important confounders, such as historical information on sickness absence and mental health, obtained through rich registry data. Our results show that gender does not significantly explain exposure to bullying and that exposure to bullying is associated with negative immediate self-reported health for both genders. We also find, however, that only bullied females have higher, persistent increases in long-term sickness absence and adverse long-term health. This suggests that men and women have different coping strategies. We investigate plausible explanations for this and find that the differences cannot be explained by, for example, turnover or lack of employment. Although insignificant, our results nonetheless indicate that men are twice as likely to leave the labor force immediately after exposure to bullying.
J81|Politics in the Family. Nepotism and the Hiring Decisions of Italian Firms| In this paper we investigate the effect of family connections to politicians on individuals' labor market outcomes. We combine data for Italy over almost three decades from longitudinal social security records on a random sample of around 1 million private sector employees with the universe of around 500,000 individuals ever holding political office, and we exploit information available in both datasets on a substring of each individual's last name and municipality of birth in order to identify family ties. Using a diff-in-diff analysis that follows individuals as their family members enter and leave office, and correcting for the measurement error induced by our fuzzy matching method, we estimate that the monetary return to having a politician in the family is around 3.5 percent worth of private sector earnings and that each politician is able to extract rents for his family worth between one fourth and one full private sector job per year. The effect of nepotism is long lasting, extending well beyond the period in office. Consistent with the view that this is a technology of rent appropriation on the part of politicians, the effect increases with politicians' clout and with the resources available in the administration where they serve.

J81|Measuring the use of human resources practices and employee attitudes: The Linked Personnel Panel|Purpose - – The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new data source available for researchers with interest in human resources management (HRM) and personnel economics, the Linked Personnel Panel (LPP). Design/methodology/approach - – The LPP is a longitudinal and representative employer-employee data set covering establishments in Germany and a subset of their workforce and is designed for quantitative empirical human resource research. Findings - – The LPP employee survey applies a number of established scales to measure job characteristics and job perceptions, personal characteristics, employee attitudes towards the organization and employee behaviour. This paper gives an overview of both the employer and employee survey and outlines the definitions, origins, and statistical properties of the scales used in the individual questionnaire. Practical implications - – The paper describes how researchers can access the data. Originality/value - – First, the data set combines employer and employee surveys that can be matched to each other. Second, it can also be linked to a number of additional administrative data sets. Third, the LPP covers a wide range of firms and workers from different backgrounds. Finally, because of its longitudinal dimension, the LPP should facilitate the study of causal effects of HRM practices.

J81|Quality of employment regimes and diversity of emerging countries|Emerging countries and their leaders, the BRICS, can be revisited with an institutionalist approach enabling a better recognition of their diversity. Focusing on the composition of their labour nexus, this paper offers to question the category formed by these countries by studying their variety of quality of employment regimes. Two interesting results came out from this study using a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and a Mixed Clustering (MC) break two institutional dimensions into fourteen indicators. (1) Four specific quality of employment regimes appear, illustrating their heterogeneity and the weakness of this category. (2) The BRICS appear notably scattered over some socio-economic aspects of each leader. Far from composing a coherent and independent regime, BRICS countries dispersion can be explained by a specific combination of socio-economic and institutional factors to each one of them.

Methodology/Technique – This paper is based on a questionnaire survey of lecturers in three universities, UNISDA, UNISLA, STIE situated in Dahlan Lamongan, Indonesia. Findings – The findings indicate that work motivation is the dominant factor affecting the performance of the accounting lecturers. Work environment, job satisfaction and work motivation jointly, have a positive influence on the performance of the accounting lecturers. Novelty – The study provides ways to increase the performance of accounting lecturers so that they will be able to produce reliable scholar graduates."""
J81|High involvement management practices, technology uses, work motivation and job search behaviour|Nowadays, employers face the mobility of the most productive employees and large costs induced by labour turnover. This paper examines the impact of two management policies on employees? motivation on one hand and their quitting behaviour on the other hand. These two policies are i) the participation in High Involvement Management (HIM) practices and ii) the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Employees? motivation, which is at the heart of this question, has different facets. Some employees exert effort because their job is in line with their values, gives opportunities for personal growth and pleasure in performing tasks. Alternatively, employees may simply be driven by rewards or compulsion. Using recent survey-based data of employees, the results show that the HIM and ICT strategies are positively related to the two types of work motivation (personal growth and rewards/compulsion). However, these strategies affect differently the likelihood of staff to remain or leave their current employer by type of motivation. While the HIM strategy reduces the risk that employees motivated by personal growth search for another job, it encourages on the contrary those who are motivated by rewards or compulsion to leave. ICT appear to play no role in employee retention.
J81|Long-term Consequences of Workplace Bullying on Sickness Absence|Bullying in workplaces is a problem thought to harm individual productivity. This paper investigates whether being exposed to bullying in the workplace increases long-term sickness absence. We analyze employees from a selection of workplaces from The Bullying Cohort Study conducted in Denmark in 2006. The Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised was used to avoid bias related to self-labeling as being bullied. We account for important confounders, such as historical information on sickness absence and mental health, obtained through rich registry data. Our results show that gender does not significantly explain exposure to bullying and that exposure to bullying is associated with negative immediate self-reported health for both genders. We also find, however, that only bullied females have higher, persistent increases in long-term sickness absence and adverse long-term health. This suggests that men and women have different coping strategies. We investigate plausible explanations for this and find that the differences cannot be explained by, for example, turnover or lack of employment. Although insignificant, our results nonetheless indicate that men are twice as likely to leave the labor force immediately after exposure to bullying.
J81|Temporary Jobs and the Severity of Workplace Accidents|From the point of view of workplace safety, it is important to know whether having a temporary job has an effect on the severity of workplace accidents. We present an empirical analysis on the severity of workplace accidents by type of contract. Method: We used micro data collected by the Italian national institute managing the mandatory insurance against work related accidents. We estimated linear models for a measure of the severity of the workplace accident. We controlled for time-invariant fixed effects at worker and firm levels to disentangle the impact of the type of contract from the spurious one induced by unobservables at worker and firm levels. Results: Workers with a temporary contract, if subject to a workplace accident, were more likely to be confronted with severe injuries than permanent workers. When correcting the statistical analysis for injury underreporting of temporary workers, we found that most of, but not all, the effect is driven by the under-reporting bias. Conclusions: The effect of temporary contracts on the injury severity survived the inclusion of worker and firm fixed effects and the correction for temporary workers’ injury under-reporting. This however does not exclude the possibility that, within firms, the nature of the work may vary between different categories of workers. For example, temporary workers might be more likely to be assigned by the employer dangerous tasks because they might have less bargaining power. Practical implications: The findings will be of help in designing public policy effective in increasing temporary workers’ safety at work and limiting their injury under-reporting.
J81|Gender Differences in the Union Wage Premium? A Comparative Case Study|Trade unions have transformed from male-dominated organisations rooted in manufacturing to majority-female organisations serving predominantly white-collar workers, often in the public sector. Adopting a comparative case study approach using nationally representative linked employer-employee surveys for Norway and Britain we examine whether, in keeping with a median voter model, the gender shift in union membership has resulted in differential wage returns to unionisation among men and women. In Britain, while only women receive a union wage premium, only men benefit from the increased bargaining power of their union as indicated by workplace union density. In Norway, on the other hand, although a union wage premium arises from individual union membership for men and women in male-dominated unions, in workplaces where the union is female-dominated women benefit more than men from the increased bargaining power of the union as union density rises. The findings suggest British unions continue to adopt a paternalistic attitude to representing their membership, in contrast to their more progressive counterparts in Norway.
J81|What If Your Boss Is a Woman? Work Organization, Work-Life Balance and Gender Discrimination at the Workplace|"In this paper, we investigate the association between female leadership, work organization practices and perceived gender discrimination within firms. Using data for 30 European countries for the period 1995-2010, we find that having a female ""boss"" is associated with lower overall gender discrimination at work. The female boss effect, however, differs across gender: it is associated with lower discrimination among female employees, but higher among male employees. We also investigate the underlying mechanisms that shape gender discrimination within firms. We find evidence of a ""women helping women"" pattern through spill-over effects which reduce discrimination among women, but increase discrimination among men, particularly in female-dominated jobs. A better balance between work and life, a supportive work environment and flexible working time, particularly for women in high-skilled jobs, are shown to be effective in reducing gender discrimination. The above findings are robust to a number of specification changes and different sub-populations in our sample. Further, similar results are found when more traditional measures of gender imbalance, such as wages or career prospects, are used. Finally, to account for potential endogeneity and selection, arising from the non-random distribution of females in higher-rank jobs, we jointly estimate the selection process and the discrimination equation, finding support for a causal interpretation of the results."
J81|Health and safety risks in Britain's workplaces: where are they and who controls them?|This is the first paper to identify the correlates of workplace managers' perceptions of the health and safety risks faced by workers and the degree to which workers have control over those risks. The risks that workers face and the control they have over those risks are weakly negatively correlated. Managerial risk ratings are positively associated with both injury and illness rates, but not with absence rates. The control rating is also positively associated with injury and illness rates, but it is negatively correlated with absence rates. Workers are more likely to be exposed to health and safety risks when their workplace is performing poorly and where it has been adversely affected by the recession. Union density is positively associated with risks but is not associated with workers' control over risks. Having onâ€ site worker representatives dealing with health and safety is linked to lower risks than direct consultation between management and employees over health and safety. However, there is no evidence that particular types of health and safety arrangement are related to workers' control over health and safety risks.
J81|Working-time autonomy as a management practice|Allowing workers to control their work hours (working-time autonomy) is a controversial policy for worker empowerment, with concerns that range from increased shirking to excessive intensification of work. Empirical evidence, however, supports neither view. Recent studies find that working-time autonomy improves individual and firm performance without promoting overload or exhaustion from work. However, if working-time autonomy is incorporated into a system of family-friendly workplace practices, firms may benefit from the trade-off between (more) fringe benefits and (lower) wages but not from increased productivity.
J81|Labor clauses in regional trade agreements and effects on labor conditions : an empirical analysis|"An increasing number of bilateral or plurilateral trade agreements (or regional trade agreements: RTAs) include ""labor clauses"" that require or urge the signatory countries to commit to maintaining a certain level of labor standards. This paper performs an empirical analysis of the impacts of such labor clauses provided in RTAs on working conditions that laborers in the RTA signatory countries actually face, using macro-level data for a wide variety of countries. The paper first examines the texts of labor provisions in more than 220 effective RTAs and (re-)classifies ""RTAs with labor clauses"" according to two criteria: (i) the agreement urges or expects the signatory countries to harmonize their domestic labor standards with internationally recognized standards, and (ii) the agreement stipulates the procedures for consultations and/or dispute settlement on labor-condition issues between the signatory countries. Based on this labor-clause RTA classification, the paper estimates the impacts of RTA labor clauses on working conditions in countries with two empirical specifications using the sample covering 136 countries or economies and years from 1995 through 2011. The estimation is extended to takes into account possible lags in the labor-condition effects of labor clauses as well as to consider potential difference in the impacts for countries in different income levels. The empirical results for the four measures of labor conditions (mean monthly real earnings, mean weekly work hours per employee, fatal occupational injury rate, and the number of the ILO's Core Conventions ratified) find no evidence for possible pro-labor-condition effects of RTA labor clauses overall, which should be consistent with the view of economics literature that questions the relevance of linking trade policy with issues in the domestic labor standards."
J81|The Rise and Nature of Alternative Work Arrangements in the United States, 1995-2015|To monitor trends in alternative work arrangements, we conducted a version of the Contingent Worker Survey as part of the RAND American Life Panel in late 2015. The findings point to a significant rise in the incidence of alternative work arrangements in the U.S. economy from 2005 to 2015. The percentage of workers engaged in alternative work arrangements - defined as temporary help agency workers, on-call workers, contract workers, and independent contractors or freelancers - rose from 10.7 percent in February 2005 to 15.8 percent in late 2015. The percentage of workers hired out through contract companies showed the largest rise, increasing from 1.4 percent in 2005 to 3.1 percent in 2015. Workers who provide services through online intermediaries, such as Uber or Task Rabbit, accounted for 0.5 percent of all workers in 2015. About twice as many workers selling goods or services directly to customers reported finding customers through offline intermediaries than through online intermediaries.

Also, the fact of being “Afrodescendent"" reduces the probability to obtain employments with higher quality and increases the probability to get poor employments."
J81|The effect of crisis on employees’ stress and dissatisfaction|This study, using a random sample of employees working in the private and public sectors, investigates the effect of crisis on job stress and dissatisfaction. Two stage cluster sampling is first used to collect primary data and relying on our sample and the collected variables we model for the first time a number of qualitative variables as features representing crisis (especially stress and dissatisfaction but also migration, reprioritizing and behavioral changes). Logistic regressions are used next presenting us with many useful elements concerning the function of stress, dissatisfaction and supportive elements and offering the corresponding probability of the effect on employees during the crisis. There are many new findings like, among others, the acceptance of salary reductions, number of working hours, economic migration, behavioral changes between management and employees, reprioritizing, and minimization of career opportunities.
J81|Workplace perception and job-satisfaction of older workers|This paper addresses the question to what extent workplace perception affects subjective well-being of older workers in their jobs. We use several dimensions of workplace perception in order to estimate their importance for job-satisfaction. Our results show that older workers' happiness in the job strongly depends on opportunities to develop new skills, receiving support in difficult situations, and recognition for their work. These dimensions of workplace attributes are merely psychological by nature; in contrast, salary opportunities and socio-demographic dimensions do not appear to have a strong impact on job-satisfaction, if at all.
J81|Enforcement of Labor Market Regulations: Heterogeneous Compliance and Adjustment across Gender|When compliance with labor market regulations is low, the enforcement of the labor law becomes a concept that is closer to the regulatory environment that firms and workers face. Firms are expected to react to variations in the enforcement level, and the response may differ for male and female workers. This paper explores microdata from Argentine household surveys to analyze: (i) how changes in the enforcement of labor regulations affect the level of compliance with the labor law among men and women, and (ii) how changes in the enforcement of the labor law generate adjustments of other labor outcomes, for men and women separately. Using information of the highly decentralized labor inspection system in Argentina, I construct an enforcement measure with variation at the province, sector, and time level (share of inspected firms). To deal with the potential endogeneity of this measure, I instrument using a measure of the arrival cost of labor inspectors to the firms. The main findings reveal different patterns of adjustment for men and women. When the degree of enforcement increases: the compliance with employment and social security regulations increases for men and decreases for women; the share of wage employees increases and the share of self-employed declines for men, with no changes for women; no changes are found in hourly wages and in the provision of non-mandated benefits. These results bring additional evidence about how the regulatory environment can impact on the decisions of firms and workers about participating in the informal sector. More importantly, they stress that both the written labor regulation and the degree of enforcement are essential parts in the provision of social and labor protection.
J81|Industry Wage Differentials and Working Conditions in Turkey: A Brief Note|In this article, we test the compensating wage differentials hypothesis for the manufacturing industry using official industrial accident figures provided by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security and wage data for the 2009-2014 Household Labor Force Surveys. First, we estimate a standard hedonic wage equation for the fatal and injury risk at the industrial level. After controlling for industry effects, the positive injury risk compensation disappears and becomes insignificant while the fatal risk premium reverses its sign from positive to negative. For an alternative estimation, we also used a two-step procedure by regressing industry wage differentials on working conditions including accident risk and several industry-specific averages. The results show, contrary to the compensating wage differentials hypothesis, that poor working conditions (higher fatal risk, longer working hours and high turn-over rate) are associated with lower wage compensation at the industry level. Our findings reveal a segmented labor market where low pay sectors are characterized by poor working conditions.
J81|The Impact of the Employment Protection Legislation Reform on the Labor Market’s Flexicurity in Morocco|This paper uses the OECD’s methodology to build an Employment Protection Legislation index (EPL) for the Moroccan economy. In this framework, the main objective is to assess the impact of the new Labor Code’s provisions on the degree of flexicurity in the labor market. The paper also investigates the approximate influence of the EPL changes as regards to some employment-related variables. Our results show that after the 2004 Labor Code reform, the labor market’s flexibility level went down from 75 percent to 44 percent, as EPL became significantly stricter. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the new legislation, although it brought relatively strict restrictions on hiring and firing, generated a significant increase in dismissals during the three first years of its implementation. And unlike the buckle of conventional literature and several empirical findings, the unemployment rate actually dropped, allegedly backed-up by a solid GDP growth during the 2000’s.
J81|How much does job autonomy vary across countries and other extra-organizational contexts?|This paper integrates the study of contextual influences on job autonomy as a key workplace practice with the growing literature on intra-country variation (ICV) versus between-country variation (BCV) in international HRM. While contexts such as industry or country are widely recognized to affect workplace practices such as job autonomy, the influences of different extra-organizational contexts are seldom examined simultaneously or their relative influence systematically compared. Similarly, while much research considers the importance of BCV vis-à-vis ICV in international HRM, little attention is paid to variation that occurs between sub-national or supranational contexts. To move forward on both these counts, we use multilevel analysis and empirically assess the comparative importance of industry as a sub-national context and politico-institutional clusters as a supranational context in addition to country context as sources of differences in job autonomy. Results indicate that inter-cluster variation can be substantially larger than inter-country variation, but that inter-industry dissimilarities tend to exceed both inter-cluster and inter-country dissimilarities. Hence, the main finding of our analysis is that dissimilarities in job autonomy associated with crossing country borders are not exceptionally large as employers and employees face larger dissimilarities in job autonomy when they move across industries. Implications of this finding both for international HRM and for international business and cross-cultural management more broadly are discussed.
J81|Global financial crisis, credit access and children: Evidence from Tanzania|This paper investigates the relationship between the recent global financial crisis and child labour in Tanzania. Using the difference-in-difference methodological framework, we identify households' access to credit as a possible transmission channel of the financial crisis to child labour. Unlike most of the existing studies that employ self-reported shocks, we exploit the incidence of the global crisis as an exogenous shock to compare households that were credit recipients before the crisis with households that were not recipients of credit either prior to the crisis or in its immediate aftermath. To deal with possible bias from the endogeneity of access to credit, this study proposes a new instrument that considers the regional concentration of available micro finance institutions and the number of households' assets. Unlike instruments suggested by the existing literature, our proposed instrument incorporates information on both demand and supply sides of credit access irrespective of whether a household has actually received credit. To avoid the wealth effect which would violate the exogeniety condition, we suggest to count the number of the household's assets no matter how much value they possess. By doing so, our instrument utilizes information on how risk averse a household is and therefore their chances of making a successful loan application. The empirical results reveal that a negative shock on credit-recipient households is associated with a significant increase in child labour in Tanzania.

J81|Schoene, neue Arbeitswelt – ist der Arbeitsvertrag dafuer zu „altbacken“? (The employment contract – Too old fashioned for the brave new employment world?)|Der Beitrag wendet sich gegen die These, dass in Abkehr von dem Ausgangspunkt des zweiseitigen Vertrags „multipolare Arbeitsbeziehungen“ fuer eine juristische Betrachtungsweise gewaehlt werden sollen. Neue Organisationsformen der Arbeit duerfen nicht zu Nachteilen fuer den Arbeitnehmer fuehren. Die Arbeitsorganisation wird vom Arbeitgeber vorgegeben. Der Arbeitnehmer hat keinen Einfluss darauf. Die Organisationsform ist Ausdruck der strukturellen Ungleichgewichtslage zwischen Arbeitgeber und Arbeitnehmer. Aufgabe des Arbeitsrechts ist es, die Ungleichgewichtslage zu beseitigen und nicht sie als Ausgangspunkt zu nehmen und so zu akzeptieren. (This article criticizes the argument that in labour law analyses, the bipolar contract should be abandoned as a starting point in favour of multipolar employment relations.. Modern employment relations in multipolar organisations could be used to evade the given legal protection of the employee. Work organisation is the prerogative of the employer and employees have no influence over it.. It is the function of labour law to secure workers’ rights in this situation on the basis of the bipolar contract and not to weaken their position by accepting new organizational forms of work.)
J81|Arbeitsrecht in der vernetzten Arbeitswelt (Labour law in an interconnected digital working world)|Der vorliegende Beitrag untersucht aus arbeitsrechtlicher Perspektive das Phaenomen, dass in der vernetzten Arbeitswelt der Zugriff auf Arbeitskraft seltener im Rahmen des traditionellen Normalarbeitsverhaeltnisses erfolgt und stattdessen zunehmend externe Arbeitskraefte im Rahmen von Netzwerkorganisationen eingesetzt werden. Es wird die These entwickelt, dass es zu kurz greifen wuerde, diesen Wandel unter der fuer das Arbeitsrecht derzeit typischen bipolaren Perspektive zu analysieren, und dass arbeitsrechtliche Begrifflichkeiten und Grundstrukturen im Hinblick auf mehrpolige Rechtsbeziehungen und interorganisationale Fragestellungen weiterzuentwickeln sind. Konzeptionelle Defizite der Regulierung des drittbezogenen Personaleinsatzes werden herausgearbeitet. Ausgehend von den in den Grundrechten wurzelnden staatlichen Schutzpflichten und dem im Rechtsstaatsprinzip wurzelnden Kohaerenzgebot werden ein Leitbild fuer die vernetzte Arbeitswelt entworfen und Schlussfolgerungen fuer eine systematische Entwicklung des Rechts der externen Arbeitskraefte gezogen. (This paper adopts a labour law perspective to analyse the more frequent external deployment of labour than conventional employment in network organisations. We argue that it is insufficient to analyse this phenomenon from the bipolar perspective dominant in the traditional concept of labour law. Instead it is necessary to develop a concept and structure of (labour) law with regard to multipolar relations and inter-organisational problems. The paper analyses the conceptual deficits of the current regulation of triangular labour deployment strategies. It then develops guiding principles for the deployment of labour in an interconnected digital working world. It does so by focusing on the duty of States to protect human rights and the principle of coherent regulation. In the light of these principles, we draw practical conclusions for the regulation of the use of external labour.)
J81|Steigende Schutzdefizite im Arbeitsrecht? (Growing lack of protection in labour law?)|Der Einsatz von „Fremdbelegschaften“ hat wenig mit wachsender Vernetzung von Unternehmen zu tun. Die rechtliche Entkoppelung von arbeitsvertraglicher Beziehung und Arbeitsort wirft Probleme auf, die sich bei den einzelnen Gruppen der Fremdbelegschaften unterschiedlich stellen. Leiharbeitnehmer haben neben ihrer Vertragsbeziehung zum Verleiher zahlreiche arbeitsrechtliche Rechte und Pflichten zum Entleiher, die sich unter dem Leitbegriff eines partiellen Arbeitsverhaeltnisses zusammenfassen lassen. Ihre faktische Schlechterstellung gegenueber Stammbeschaeftigten haengt mit gesetzlich zugelassenen Billigtarifen und einer isolierten Arbeitssituation zusammen, die eine gemeinsame Interessenvertretung erschwert. Bei der zweiten Gruppe – den aufgrund Werk- oder Dienstvertrags in den Betrieb Kommenden – lassen sich die rechtlichen Probleme gleichfalls bewaeltigen, die die Nichtzugehoerigkeit zur „eigentlichen“ Belegschaft mit sich bringt. Ihre schlechtere Lage haengt damit zusammen, dass sie im besten Falle den Tarifen einer „Billig-Branche“ unterliegen, meist aber zu jenen 42 % der Beschaeftigten gehoeren, die nicht mehr durch Tarifvertraege geschuetzt sind. Bei den Soloselbstaendigen als der dritten Gruppe muss man unterscheiden. Wer sein Einkommen im Wesentlichen vom Einsatzbetrieb bezieht, wird als arbeitnehmeraehnliche Person qualifiziert und kann sich deshalb auf bestimmte arbeitsrechtliche Normen wie das Bundesurlaubsgesetz berufen, bleibt andererseits aber vom Kuendigungsschutzgesetz und von der Betriebsverfassung ausgeschlossen. Tarifvertraege sind moeglich, aber faktisch nicht durchsetzbar. Liegt wegen Fehlens eines beherrschenden Auftraggebers keine Arbeitnehmeraehnlichkeit vor, kann sich der Betroffene nur auf zivilrechtliche Schutznormen berufen, die zwar eine intensive Vertragsinhaltskontrolle, aber keinerlei Bestandsschutz gewaehren. Hinter dem Begriff der Crowdworker als vierter Gruppe verbergen sich sehr unterschiedliche Rechtsbeziehungen; soweit fuer auslaendische Plattformen gearbeitet wird, ist selbst der zivilrechtliche Schutz in Frage gestellt. Im Vergleich dazu sind die Probleme jener Beschaeftigten, deren Arbeit von einem anderen Konzernunternehmen als dem Vertragsarbeitgeber gesteuert wird, von relativ geringer Dimension. Ein einheitliches „Modell“ fuer den Umgang mit Fremdbelegschaften kann es nicht geben; die unbestreitbaren Schutzdefizite haben ihre Ursachen nicht in den Schwierigkeiten der „Ankoppelung“ an den Einsatzbetrieb, sondern in der Stellung der Betroffenen auf dem Arbeitsmarkt. (There is no necessary linkage between the use of a so-called external workforce and the increased interconnectedness of organisations. Within the external workforce, we have to distinguish four groups which are less protected than workers in a standard employment relationship. The coordination problems between an external and internal workforce are normally solved in a satisfactory way. Temporary agency workers have many legal links to the enterprise, which together can be considered to be a partial employment relationship. Workers sent to the plant by their employers on the basis of a contract of services keep their rights as employees in the relationship to their employer. In addition, there are also legal links to the company where the worker is deployed. The absence of a contract with the enterprise where the work is done is not the real cause of the weak position of these two kinds of workers. It is rather their position in the labour market and their difficulty in joining trade unions and their lack of access to the improved working conditions of collective agreements. Self-employed workers with no employees are often in a still worse condition, protected only by civil law. If they work more or less exclusively for one enterprise, some labour law rules apply comprising annual leave and the (theoretical) possibility to conclude collective agreements. However, they cannot invoke the rules against unfair dismissal and they are not integrated into the system of works councils. The situation of crowdworkers varies according to the task they have to fulfil. If they are self-employed persons without employees, they will often be protected only by civil law which guarantees an intensive control of contract clauses but does not protect against the termination of the relationship. To improve their position is a question for labour market policy too. The concept of creating a uniform model to cover external workforces is misleading because it neglects the real reasons for decreasing employment protection.)
J81|Entgrenzung von Organisation und Arbeit? Interorganisationale Fragmentierung als Herausforderung für Arbeitsrecht, Management und Mitbestimmung. Einleitung zum Schwerpunktheft|Die Artikel des Schwerpunktheftes setzen an verschiedenen inhaltlichen Dimensionen und Ebenen dieser Fragmentierung an: Auf der Arbeitsebene ist der Beitrag von Gabriele Fassauer und Silke Geithner angesiedelt, der die inner-organisatorische Bewaeltigung von Co-Konfiguration durch Auftragsmanager behandelt. Auf Basis der Taetigkeitstheorie beleuchten die Autorinnen die Co-Konfiguration zwischen Kunden und Produzenten, indem sie die Grenzarbeit von Auftragsmanagern im Zentrum interorganisationaler Leistungserstellung sichtbar machen, um den Anforderungen von Kunden, Zulieferern und den unternehmensinternen Arbeitsgruppen gerecht zu werden. Die Mitbestimmungspraxis von Betriebsraeten im Umgang mit quasi-externalisierter Arbeit ist Gegenstand von gleich zwei Aufsaetzen mit je unterschiedlicher Blickrichtung. Der Artikel von Markus Hertwig, Johannes Kirsch und Carsten Wirth zielt auf die Erkundung des Umgangs des Betriebsrats mit Onsite-Werkvertraegen in strukturationstheoretischer Perspektive. Fuer die Ernaehrungs- und Getraenkeindustrie zeigen sie verschiedene Praktiken auf, die in verschiedenen Typen des Umgangs von Betriebsraeten mit Onsite-Werkvertraegen verdichtet werden, die zwischen Kooperation und Konfrontation, zwischen Ablehnung und Akzeptanz angesiedelt sind. Karina Becker thematisiert aus einer sozialkritischen Perspektive den Gesundheits- und Arbeitsschutz fuer Werkvertragsbeschaeftigte in der Pflege. Dabei interessiert sie sich insbesondere fuer die rechtlichen Sekundaermachtpotenziale der Betriebsraete sowie deren etwaige Verschiebungen innerhalb des Feldes des Arbeits- und Gesundheitsschutzes. Auf diese Weise wird die Reichweite staatlicher Mindestschutzvorschriften im Betrieb bzw. im Haushalt als Verhandlungsgegenstand der Mitbestimmung thematisiert. Auf der Mesoebene zwischen Organisationen und (arbeits-)rechtlichem Rahmen setzen Isabell Hensel, Jochen Koch, Eva Kocher und Anna Schwarz mit einer interdisziplinaeren Einordnung online vermittelter Arbeitsauftraege und Werke an. Sie deuten neue Formen der Arbeitserbringung („Crowdworking“) in ihrer Vielgestaltigkeit, d.h. auch und gerade hinsichtlich von Potenzialen, die jenseits einer allfaelligen Prekarisierung angesiedelt sein koennen. Hierbei greifen sie zum einen auf die Organisations- und Managementtheorie zurueck, zum anderen benutzen sie das Arbeitsrecht, um das Spektrum von Crowdworking in einem Regelkreis aus Autonomie und Kontrolle, Flexibilitaet und Stabilitaet zu ordnen. Auf der Makroebene diskutiert Andreas Buecker die Regulierung der multipolaren Arbeitsbeziehungen und insbesondere des sog. drittbezogenen Personaleinsatzes, indem er bestehende Quellen des Arbeitsrechts (AEntG, MiloG, ArbSchG, BetrVG) auf Anwendbarkeit prueft, um regulative Luecken zu praezisieren. Zugleich thematisiert er die Rolle von Leitbildern im Diskurs der Rechtsfortbildung. Im Ergebnis argumentiert er fuer eine Fortentwicklung des Arbeitsrechts, um ueber den klassischen bipolaren Arbeitnehmerbegriff hinaus auch mehrpolige Rechtsbeziehungen erfassen zu koennen und die Betroffenen nicht schutzlos zu stellen. Hieran knuepfen zwei Debattenbeitraege an, um die derzeitige Konstruktion des Arbeitsrechts auf den Pruefstand zu stellen. Ebenso wie Buecker setzen sowohl Christiane Brors als auch Wolfgang Daeubler am grundsaetzlich bestehenden sozialen Schutzbedarf in mehrpoligen Arbeitsbeziehungen an, blicken aber gleichsam etwas optimistischer in die Zukunft. Brors haelt das zweipolige Arbeitsverhaeltnis nach wie vor fuer den richtigen Anker, um den Schutz abhaengig Beschaeftigter zu gewaehrleisten und zeigt auf, dass bestehende Ansaetze, insbesondere im Rahmen des Rechts der Leiharbeit, ausbaufaehig sind. AEhnlich sieht es Daeubler, der gleichermassen im Arbeitsrecht wie im Recht der Selbststaendigen ausbaufaehige Konstruktionen sieht. Deutlich wird dabei aber, dass gerade im letzteren Bereich der Gesetzgeber gefragt sein koennte, ueber den Typus der arbeitnehmeraehnlichen Person den Schutz von Selbststaendigen zu verbessern. Darueber hinaus macht Daeubler deutlich, dass gerade beim Crowdsourcing ein Problem in der Internationalitaet der Rechtsbeziehung liegen koennte.
J81|Onsite-Werkvertraege und Industrielle Beziehungen: Praktiken der Betriebsraete zwischen Ablehnung und Akzeptanz (Onsite-subcontracting and industrial relations: Practices of works councils between rejection and acceptance)|Mit Onsite-Werkvertraegen koennen vielfaeltige negative Konsequenzen fuer die Arbeitsbedingungen der Beschaeftigten und fuer die Interessenvertretung verknuepft sein. Deshalb fragen wir, wie Betriebsraete mit der Verbreitung von Onsite-Werkvertraegen in den Kernbereichen der Wertschoepfung umgehen und welche Praktiken der Interessenvertretung im Prozess des Outsourcings entwickelt werden. In diesem Beitrag zeigen wir auf Basis einer strukturationstheoretischen Analyse von insgesamt zwoelf Fallstudien aus dem Verarbeitenden Gewerbe und dem Einzelhandel, dass sich zwei grundlegende Handlungsmuster (Ablehnung oder Akzeptanz) herausbilden. Diese Handlungsmuster differenzieren sich weiter nach den grundlegenden Sicht , Handlungs und Legitimationsweisen der Betriebsraete in die vier Typen‚ ‚Ablehnung – Unsicherheit‘, ‚Ablehnung – Konfrontation‘, ‚Akzeptanz – Kooperation‘ und ‚Akzeptanz – Ausgestaltung‘ aus. Die Betriebsraete ueben dabei Einfluss aus, ohne jedoch alle negativen Konsequenzen aufheben zu koennen. Dies hat Folgen fuer das Erwerbssystem als Ganzes. (Onsite-subcontracting can produce multiple negative consequences for employment conditions and interest representation. Therefore, we ask how works councils position themselves towards onsite-subcontracting and how they intervene in the process of outsourcing. Based on a structurationist analysis of twelve case studies in the manufacturing sector and in retailing, we identify two major patterns of action (rejection and acceptance). The patterns of action can be differentiated into four types of works council behaviour: ‘rejection – uncertainty, ‘rejection – confrontation’, ‘acceptance – co-operation’ and ‘acceptance – arrangement’. Furthermore, works councils exert influence to a varying degree but they cannot offset all negative consequences. This has implications for the overall employment system.)

In jedem Fall zeichnet sich deren Verguetung durch eine vergleichsweise hohe Heterogenitaet aus. Gleichzeitig laesst sich eine Verschiebung im Gefuege kollektiver Interessenvertretungsorgane beobachten, die sich darin zeigt, dass neben Gewerkschaften neue intermediaere Akteure (z.B. Agenturen, Genossenschaften) relevant werden. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist das Ziel des vorliegenden Beitrags, die Rolle traditioneller und neuer intermediaerer Akteure in den Aushandlungen der Arbeitsbedingungen, wie der Verguetung, von hochqualifizierten Solo-Selbststaendigen zu eruieren. Die empirische Basis des Beitrags bildet eine qualitative Studie mit Solo-Selbststaendigen sowie Vertretern/innen von Gewerkschaften, Berufsverbaenden, Agenturen und Genossenschaften in den Branchen Filmwirtschaft, IT-Dienstleistungen und Medizin. In der Analyse der Interviews wird deutlich, dass die hochqualifizierten Solo-Selbststaendigen ihre Verguetung nicht per se individuell aushandeln. Vielmehr wird die Aushandlung von Arbeitsbedingungen durch traditionelle und neue intermediaere Akteure gepraegt, die Beratungsangebote fuer Solo-Selbststaendige bereithalten und die Entwicklung und Verbreitung von Standards foerdern. (Solo self-employed people in Germany represent a growing part of the flexible workforce in knowledge-intensive services with highly heterogeneous income situations. This article challenges the common assumption that their working conditions are negotiated individually by exploring the role of traditional intermediary actors (unions, professional associations) and new intermediary actors (staffing agencies, cooperatives) in pay determination. The empirical basis is a qualitative interview study of solo-self-employed and representatives of unions, professional associations, staffing agencies and cooperatives in film, IT and medicine. The analysis illuminates the contribution of traditional and new intermediary actors to individual negotiations, but also to the development and diffusion of collective standards.)

Innovative knowledge work: Individual performance systems as opposed to communitarian team culture)|Im Fokus des Beitrages steht die Arbeitsregulation in wissensbasierten Unternehmen. Interessenvertretungen werden hier nicht nur damit konfrontiert, dass hochqualifizierte Beschaeftigte – Wissensarbeiter/innen – zur Selbstvertretung tendieren, sondern auch mit neuen integrativen Human Resource Strategien, in denen Commitment und Empowerment eine grosse Rolle spielen. Ob das Spannungsverhaeltnis zwischen individualistischer Leistungsorientierung und kommunitaerer Teamkultur – das Paradox der Wissensarbeit – hierdurch jedoch geloest werden kann, ist die Frage; ebenso wie die Vereinbarkeit mit traditionellen Institutionen der Interessenvertretung. Zur Analyse wird das Theoriekonzept der „institutionellen Logiken“ herangezogen, das uns Aufschluss ueber die in wissensbasierten Unternehmen vorherrschenden Spannungen und Interessenskonflikte geben soll. Am Beispiel von Pharma- und Biotech-Unternehmen wird gezeigt, wie widerspruechliche institutionelle Logiken entstehen und bearbeitet werden. Diskutiert werden mit Blick auf die empirischen Befunde auch die Chancen fuer eine Rekonfiguration kollektiver Formen der Arbeitsregulation. (This article examines the role of work regulation in knowledge-based firms. Collective interest representation is faced with a preference of knowledge workers for self-representation as well as the need to counteract integrative human resource strategies which support commitment and empowerment. Could these management strategies resolve the tension between an individualistic performance orientation and a communitarian team culture – the paradox of knowledge work? Or, does knowledge work fit well with traditional models of collective interest representation? Our analysis is based on the theory of institutional logics that offers a framework for investigating tensions and conflicting interests within knowledge-based firms. With reference to the example of pharmaceutical and biotech companies, the article describes how contradictory institutional logics develop and how they are applied. Our empirical findings provide a further discussion of possibilities for reconfiguring the collective representation of interests.)
J81|Zwischen den Welten: Hybride Arbeitsverhaeltnisse in den Kulturberufen (Between worlds: Hybrid employment in the cultural industries)|Der vorliegende Beitrag untersucht Arbeitsverhaeltnisse der Kultur- und Kreativberufe. Es gibt einige empirische Anhaltspunkte, dass sich hier eine neue Stufe der Flexibilisierung von Arbeit vollzieht, die als Erwerbshybridisierung zu beschreiben ist. Die Frage ist, unter welchen beschaeftigungs- und arbeitspolitischen Bedingungen und in welchen empirischen Formen sie auftritt sowie welche Arbeitswirklichkeiten sich damit verbinden. Argumentiert wird, dass die Aufteilung von Erwerbsformen nach sozialversicherungspflichtig versus selbstaendig nur mehr zu kurz greift und dass sich in den Kulturberufen hybride Arbeitsverhaeltnisse entwickeln, die sich als Grenzgaenge zwischen Erwerbsformen und Arbeitsverhaeltnissen manifestieren. Exemplarisch diskutiert wird dieses Problem am Beispiel der Designbranche. Empirische Basis ist eine umfassende, qualitative Studie ueber kuenstlerisch-kreative Arbeit im arbeitsgesellschaftlichen Strukturwandel, die eine Feldstudie von zwei Feldern der Designbranche umfasst: Kommunikations- und Modedesign. Deutlich wird an diesem Beispiel, dass sich das Phaenomen der Erwerbshybridisierung korrespondierend mit der institutionellen Umwelt ausbildet, dass es daher zu strukturell differenzierten Grenzgaengen kommt und dass damit Herausforderungen fuer die Interessenpolitik im Kulturbereich verbunden sind. (This article examines labour relations in the creative industries. There is some empirical evidence to suggest that a new level of work flexibility is emerging in the creative industries, which can be described as employment hybridisation. The question is which labour conditions and industrial relations lead to hybrid employment patterns and which work realities are connected with them. I will argue that in the cultural industries hybrid employment patterns evolve that occur as boundaries between self-employment and employed working conditions. This argument is illustrated with examples from the design industry. The empirical basis is a comprehensive, qualitative study of artistic and creative work, including a field study of two fields in the design industry: communications and fashion design. It is clear from this example that the phenomenon of employment hybridisation corresponds with the institutional environment. Thus, there are structurally differentiated border crossings. Finally, this poses a challenge for industrial relations in the cultural sector.)

Approximately half of health-care output is allocated via markets. In this paper, we analyze the industrial organization literature on health-care markets, focusing on the impact of competition on price, quality, and treatment decisions for health-care providers and health insurers. We conclude with a discussion of research opportunities for industrial organization economists, including opportunities created by the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

J81|Racial Realism: A Review Essay on John Skrentny's After Civil Rights|In his valuable contribution, After Civil Rights, John Skrentny shows that in many sectors of the labor market, race is used in ways that were unanticipated when the 1964 Civil Rights Act was enacted. With separate chapters on the professions and business, the public sector, media and entertainment, and the low-skill market, he demonstrates that the new racial realism is widespread, generally has some justification from social scientific research, and is usually inconsistent with judicial decisions. I review the racially realistic practices (racial matching, increasing diversity, racial signaling, and racial characteristics) and discuss their implications for labor economics and for policy.

J81|Determinants of job quality — Evidence for European country groups|Based on a micro-level approach and using data from the European Working Conditions Survey, covering 27 countries, we analyse the determinants of job quality. With cluster analysis applied to 11 dimensional indices, we form three homogeneous country groups and identify, by estimating twice-censored Tobit models, the main determinant factors affecting the individual level of job quality in each group. We verify the relevance of variables related to worker characteristics, firm characteristics, and the country in which the individual works. Among worker characteristics, education and employment status are the factors with the highest impact on job quality, while the economic sector is the most important firm characteristic. The results suggest the existence of important differences among groups regarding the magnitude of the impact of some factors. The highest dissimilarities are found between the group with better jobs (Nordic countries plus Belgium) and the group with lower quality jobs (Central and Eastern European countries plus Portugal and Greece). Variables related to age, education, dimension of the firm, and economic sector are those in which more heterogeneity is found among the groups.

It further shows that the best jobs fall within the middle section of the age distribution, with the occupations of juvenile and older adults being the worst ones, which points to the existence of a new labor life cycle. The survey also reveals the importance of consumer economies of scale, depending on household size, which plays a key role in maintaining or improving well-being.

The results show that on average two out of three individuals are employed in the informal sector. This finding has key implications for the quality of employment and well-being of the population. Indeed, the Pacific region has low quality jobs, which is more dramatic for individuals with low education levels, domestic workers, and for individuals from the department of Nariño.
J81|Non-Standard “Contingent” Employment and Job Satisfaction: A Panel Data Analysis|" type=""main"" xml:id=""irel12090-abs-0001""> Contingent forms of employment are usually associated with low-quality jobs and, by inference, jobs that workers find relatively unsatisfying. This assumption is tested using data from a representative household panel survey covering a country (Australia) with a high incidence of nonstandard employment. Results from the estimation of ordered logit regression models reveal that among males, both casual employees and labor-hire (agency) workers (but not fixed-term contract workers) report noticeably lower levels of job satisfaction, though this association diminishes with job tenure. Negative effects for women are mainly restricted to labor-hire workers."

Using data from the 2000 Census merged with O NET data on occupation characteristics, I show that the jobs held by immigrants are more physically arduous than the jobs held by U.S. natives. However, data from the California Work and Health Survey on self-reported physical job demands indicate that immigrants do not perceive their jobs as requiring more physical effort than U.S. natives. Immigrants thus have worse jobs than natives but do not view them as such."
J81|Stressed by Your Job: What Is the Role of Personnel Policy?|Work-related stress can lead to substantial health problems and thereby result in immense costs for establishments. Therefore, the question as to what extent establishments contribute to their employees’ stress levels is of great importance for firm performance. We investigate the relationship between personnel policies and work-related stress by considering a series of personnel policies that refer to a worker’s job reward, job demand, or job control situation. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) we find statistically significant associations of several policies and work-related stress. Most importantly, bad promotion opportunities and low working time control turn out to be associated with higher stress levels, while the opposite is true for an adequate salary.

En particular, se discute el impacto de la adopción de las nuevas formas de organización de la producción sobre la calidad del empleo. Para ello se analizan los cambios operados en el proceso de trabajo desde los inicios del capitalismo, especialmente los ocurridos en el último cuarto del siglo XX. Entre las principales conclusiones se destaca que los cambios producidos en los factores que configuran la organización productiva y la gestión del trabajo tienen un impacto discutible sobre la calidad del empleo y el bienestar de los trabajadores.

J81|Job Quality in Segmented Labor Markets: The Israeli Case|Till the early-1990s the collectively-bargained labor contract (between the trade-union that presented the employees, and the employer or the employers'-association) was the norm, granting salaried workers a stable and protected labor contract. Thereafter, and more significantly after 1995, the share of unionized workers dropped constantly, to almost half of its peak level (of more than 80 percent). In parallel, two other types of contracts became more common: personal temporary contracts (between an individual worker and his employer), and contracts between a labor-contractor and employees who are employed in a triangular mode of employment (employee-contractor-client). The latter involves precarious employment and is more common among the more vulnerable sub-populations of new-immigrants, disabled individuals, Israeli-Arabs, foreign-workers and women. The contractual changes resulted in work instability, growth of the secondary labor market and segmentation. Efforts to protect the disadvantaged secondary labor-market workers include legislation, reforms, new regulations, and enforcement of all the above.
J81|Determinants of Job Satisfaction in Young Russian Workers|A growing economic literature regards the analysis of job satisfaction; however, as for young people the investigations are still scarce. In this paper we analyse job satisfaction among Russian young workers by using the data collected for four items, the first of which concerns the general satisfaction about the job; the other three items concern specific aspects of job satisfaction with respect to work condition, earning, and opportunity for professional growth. The corresponding response variables are categorical with five ordered categories, from “absolutely unsatisfied” to “absolutely satisfied”. The longitudinal dataset also contains personal information about the respondents (gender, age, marital status, number of children, educational level, etc.). We estimate ordered logit models of job satisfaction with individual fixed effects for a panel data of Russian young workers, carrying out separate analyses for the general job satisfaction variable and three variables on specific aspects of job satisfaction. If wages adjusted to fully compensate workplace disamenities, we would expect that differences in job satisfaction across individuals would not be systematically related to wage differentials, ceteris paribus. But this is not the case for our panel: for all but one of the samples considered there is at least one job satisfaction variable with a significantly positive wage effect. We, therefore, interpret this result as a failure of the theory of compensating wage differentials in the Russian youth labour market. There is the interesting exception, though, that compensating wage differentials do seem at work among the older subjects in the panel. Our estimates also show strong gender and location effects.
J81|Individual and Workplace-Specific Determinants of Paid and Unpaid Overtime Work in Germany|In Germany, overtime work is a well-established instrument for varying working hours of employees and is of great importance for establishments as a measure of internal flexibility. However, not all employees are affected to the same degree by a variation of the work effort through overtime work. Besides socio-demographic factors, workplace-specific factors that provide information about the position of employees in the establishment play an important role, too. So far, we do not know enough how these workplace-specific factors are associated with overtime work. This question is at the center of this study. In the analysis, women and part-time employees are taken into account, while previous studies mostly focused on full-time employees and/or male workers. On the basis of the data of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), the results show a significant negative correlation between women and paid overtime and between part-time employees and unpaid overtime. If the employees performance is regularly assessed by a superior, paid overtime is less likely, while unpaid overtime becomes more likely. In executive positions, there is a significant positive correlation with paid and unpaid overtime work. Unpaid overtime is more likely with a growing autonomy in the employees’ workplace, whereas paid overtime becomes less likely. However, the length of the training period on the job as well as job related burdens due to a job at risk and a limited employment contract seem to have no association with paid or unpaid overtime.

J81|Macht Wochenendarbeit unzufrieden?|More than 40 percent of Germany’s labor force work not only Monday to Friday, but also Saturdays as well—and a quarter even regularly work on Sundays. Between 1996 and 2014, there was a slight increase in the proportion of those who work weekends; little is known, however, about how weekend work affects these workers’ sleeping patterns and overall life satisfaction. The present analyses show that on average, employees who work weekends exhibit lower satisfaction with their health, family life, and sleeping patterns, as well as with their life in general, than those who do not work Saturdays and/or Sundays. The decisive factor, however, is not the weekend work itself: When looking at those who initially only work weekdays and then begin working weekends, it becomes clear that their satisfaction does not change in most areas; merely job satisfaction slightly decreases when employees take up working on Sundays. Mehr als 40 Prozent der Erwerbstätigen in Deutschland arbeiten nicht nur von Montag bis Freitag, sondern auch an Samstagen, ein Viertel geht sogar sonntags regelmäßig zur Arbeit. Zwischen 1996 und 2014 ist der Anteil derjenigen, die am Wochenende arbeiten, leicht gestiegen. Wie sich das Arbeiten am Wochenende auf die Schlaf- und Lebenszufriedenheit der Betroffenen auswirkt, ist indes wenig bekannt. Die vorliegenden Analysen zeigen, dass Personen, die am Wochenende arbeiten, im Durchschnitt eine geringere Gesundheits-, Familien- und Schlafzufriedenheit haben und auch mit ihrem Leben insgesamt unzufriedener sind als Personen, die samstags und/oder sonntags nicht arbeiten. Ausschlaggebend dafür ist aber nicht die Wochenendarbeit als solche. Betrachtet man Personen, die zunächst nicht am Wochenende arbeiten und dann zur Wochenendarbeit wechseln, zeigt sich, dass sich ihre Zufriedenheit in den meisten Bereichen nicht ändert; lediglich die Arbeitszufriedenheit sinkt bei einem Wechsel zur Sonntagsarbeit leicht.

J81|Long work hours and health in China|Using several waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), this study analyzes the effect of long work hours on health and lifestyles in a sample of 18- to 65-year-old Chinese workers. Although working long hours does significantly increase the probabilities of high blood pressure and poorer reported health, the effects are small. Also small are the negative effects of long work hours on sleep time, fat intake, and the probabilities of sports participation or watching TV. We find no positive association between work time and different measures of obesity and no evidence of any association with calorie intake, food preparation and cooking time, or the sedentary activities of reading, writing, or drawing. In general, after controlling for a rich set of covariates and unobserved individual heterogeneity, we find little evidence that long work hours affect either the health or lifestyles of Chinese workers.
J81|Work hour mismatches and on-the-job search|This paper constructs an on-the-job search model with work hour mismatches. In this model, there are two types of jobs that differ in output per hour, and workers are also heterogeneous with respect to preferences for the working hours. This heterogeneity may generate mismatch between worker's preference and job's type. Because worker's preference is changed by exogenous shocks, workers can eliminate mismatch by two ways: (i) moving to a suitable job by a job-to-job transition and (ii) waiting to change their preference. Those ways are consistent with empirical findings (e.g., Euwal, 2001; Johnson, 2010; Reynolds and Aletraris, 2006). The model shows that job-to-job transitions are less frequent than its efficient level, and hiring subsidies can lead to socially efficient allocation of workers.
J81|Gestión empresarial y dinámica laboral en España|The aim of this paper is to propose some reflections about the recent labour dynamics in the Spanish economy under labour market segmentation theory. From this perspective, the problems and the status in the labour market are due to a combination of factors related to business management practices rather by market dynamics or contractual arrangements. From our point of view it is necessary to overcome the restricted analytical framework of conventional economic approach and introduce other dimensions going further for a better understanding of labour problems. In this sense, we consider key aspects the production structure, business strategies and institutional framework in which the economic activity is taking place.
J81|A web survey analysis of subjective well-being|Purpose - – The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of work conditions and job characteristics with respect to three subjective well-being (SWB) indicators: life satisfaction, job satisfaction and satisfaction with work-life balance. From a methodological point of view, the paper shows how social sciences can benefit from the use of voluntary web survey data. Design/methodology/approach - – The paper makes use of a large sample of individual data obtained from voluntary web surveys collected as part of the WageIndicator project. The sample includes extensive information on the quality of working conditions together with different well-being indicators. The propensity score adjustment weights are used to improve the sample performance. Findings - – The results shed light on the importance of certain job characteristics not only in determining job satisfaction, but also in other SWB domains. The findings support the theory of spillover perspectives, according to which satisfaction in one domain affects other domains. Research limitations/implications - – As a voluntary web-survey, WageIndicator is affected by selection bias. The validity of the sample can be improved by weighting, but this adjustment should be made and tested on a country-by-country basis. Originality/value - – The paper provides analysis of the quality of a web survey not commonly used in happiness research. The subsequent presentation of the effects of working conditions on several satisfaction domains represents a contribution to the literature.
J81|Health, Work and Working Conditions : A Review of the European Economic Literature|"Economists have traditionally been very cautious when studying the interaction between employment and health because of the two-way causal relationship between these two variables: health status influences the probability of being employed and, at the same time, working affects the health status. Because these two variables are determined simultaneously, researchers control endogeneity skews (e.g., reverse causality, omitted variables) when conducting empirical analysis. With these caveats in mind, the literature finds that a favourable work environment and high job security lead to better health conditions. Being employed with appropriate working conditions plays a protective role on physical health and psychiatric disorders. By contrast, non-employment and retirement are generally worse for mental health than employment, and overemployment has a negative effect on health. These findings stress the importance of employment and of adequate working conditions for the health of workers. In this context, it is a concern that a significant proportion of European workers (29%) would like to work fewer hours because unwanted long hours are likely to signal a poor level of job satisfaction and inadequate working conditions, with detrimental effects on health. Thus, in Europe, labour-market policy has increasingly paid attention to job sustainability and job satisfaction. The literature clearly invites employers to take better account of the worker preferences when setting the number of hours worked. Overall, a specific ""flexicurity"" (combination of high employment protection, job satisfaction and active labour-market policies) is likely to have a positive effect on health.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
J81|The Working Conditions of Non-standard Workers and Their Transitions|"By using a unique dataset, ""the survey on non-standard experience and transition,"" in This Article, we examine the relation between the working conditions of non-standard workers and their transition to standard work. Especially, we focus on workers' experience; the changes in place of work as well as the changes in task assignment while they are employed as non-standard workers. We find, firstly, almost half of non-standard workers experienced a change in task or a change in workplace, that implies even non-standard workers are not pinned to a single task. Secondly, the non-standard workers who experienced multiple tasks and workplaces are more likely to search for the opportunities to transition to standard work. Thirdly, experience in multiple tasks, however, does not always enhance the transition to standard work; namely, the success rate is lower for those who experienced multiple tasks and workplaces than for those who experienced only single task and workplace. While experience in multiple tasks means continuity from non-standard work to standard work, such experience is not highly valued in the Japanese labor market. On the contrary, a single task and workplace assignment during non-standard work does not hinder workers' transition from non-standard work to permanent work."

The so called 'Industrie 4.0' implicates chances as well as negative effects on the labour market. This paper takes a look at the consequences of technological change in history and at possible impacts on future occupations and qualifications. Studies from Anglo-Saxon countries identify highly qualified persons as the winners of the new industrial revolution and the middle class as the loser. According to more recent studies, one of the main challenges will be artificial intelligence. Hence, complex occupations requiring creativity and social intelligence will be needed. In the German economy, high-quality consumer goods, chemical products as well as machinery and equipment will offer great potentials. The main precondition for success will be a good 'operating system' containing infrastructure, education, and legal security as well as data security, while employees will need to be more flexible.

Using data from the Establishment Panel we first show that industrial relations factors, employment-contract characteristics and individual characteristics determine working-time accounts' use in establishments. Second, we provide the first analysis concerning the determinants of working-time accounts' use among employees and the employees' access to working-time accounts in establishments using working-time accounts. Using data from the German Socio Economic Panel we show that qualified employees more often have access to working-time accounts. Using linked-employer-employee data we show that in establishments using working-time accounts female employees, part-time employees and employees with fixed-term contracts are not disadvantaged regarding the access to working-time accounts.""

J81|Can working conditions explain the return-to-entrepreneurship puzzle?|"""Some influential studies show that many self-employed could apparently achieve higher earnings were they working in paid employment. One potential explanation for this 'return-to-entrepreneurship puzzle', not empirically tested yet, is that entrepreneurship entails non-monetary benefits, such as autonomy, flexibility, and task variety. Using German data and a decomposition analysis, I examine the contribution of these working conditions to the observed earnings differential between self-employment and paid employment. I confirm that self-employed individuals report lower earnings than what they are expected to earn in paid employment. However, differences in working conditions barely contribute to the earnings gap. This finding casts some doubt on the relevance of compensating differentials for explaining the return-to-entrepreneurship puzzle."" (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en))"
J81|Does self-employment really raise job satisfaction? : adaptation and anticipation effects on self-employment and general job changes (Erhöht eine Selbständigkeit wirklich die Arbeitszufriedenheit? : Adaptions- und Antizipationseffekte der Selbständigkeit und genereller Arbeitsplatzwechsel)|"""Empirical analyses using cross-sectional and panel data found significantly higher levels of job satisfaction for the self-employed than for employees. We argue that by neglecting anticipation and adaptation effects estimates in previous studies might be misleading. To test this, we specify models accounting for anticipation and adaptation to self-employment and general job changes. In contrast to recent literature we find no specific long-term effect of self-employment on job satisfaction. Accounting for anticipation and adaptation to job changes in general, which includes changes between employee jobs, reduces the effect of self-employment on job satisfaction by two-thirds. When controlling for anticipation and adaptation to job changes, we find a positive anticipation effect of self-employment and a positive effect of self-employment on job satisfaction in the first years of self-employment. After 3 years, adaptation eliminates the higher satisfaction of being self-employed. According to our results, previous studies overestimate the positive long-term effects of self-employment on job satisfaction."" (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en))"

J81|Calidad de vida laboral en Colombia: un índice multidimensional difuso|"La calidad del trabajo abarca múltiples dimensiones objetivas y subjetivas, que pueden incluir las rentas del trabajo, la estabilidad laboral, la satisfacción laboral y la seguridad social. En este trabajo se sigue el método propuesto por Gómez et al. (2013), que introduce una nueva forma de calcular la calidad del trabajo, consistente en la medición de: i) el uso del enfoque de funcionamientos y las capacidades de Sen y ii) un método de conjuntos difusos. Usando la Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares (GEIH), se calcula un Índice Multidimensional de Calidad del Empleo (IMCE) a nivel nacional según edad, sexo, nivel educativo, tamaño de la empresa, y el sector de la industria. Un tema que se destaca de nuestros resultados es la existencia de una ""Ciclo de calidad de vida laboral"", con los puntajes más altos del índice a los 30 años, lo cual puede tener implicaciones importantes para el sistema de seguridad social. ******ABSTRACT: Quality of Work encompasses multiple objective and subjective dimensions, which may include labor income, job stability, job satisfaction, and social security. This paper follows the method proposed by Gómez et al. (2013) that introduces a new way of measuring Quality of Work, which consists of: i) the use of Sen’s functioning and capabilities approach and ii) a fuzzy sets method to define membership to the sets of good job quality. Using the Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares, we obtain results for a Multidimensional Index of Quality of Employment, at the national level about age, gender, educational level, firm size, and industry sector. One topic that is highlighted from our results is the existence of a “Quality of Work Life Cycle”, with higher levels of the index up to age of 30, which may have critical implications for the social security system."
J81|Innovative work practices, ICT use and employees' motivations|I investigate the impact of innovative work practices and of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) on employees' motivations. While the existing literature assumes that their positive effects on performance are due to employees' motivation but only assess related concepts, this paper directly analyses employees' motivations. The data come from a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2013. The paper provides new and interesting results on how firms can build a motivational environment shaped by work practices and ICT. I resort to an original empirical framework that permits one to take into account the potential reverse causation between, on the one hand, the voluntary participation in innovative work practices and the use of ICT and motivations on the other. Within this framework, I modify what previous analyses reveal about quality circle and training participation. The results confirm the positive role of work practices such as teamwork, quality norms, formal appraisals, management recognition and family-friendly policies on employee's positive attitudes. Moreover, I introduce a large range of ICT compared to existing research and find that the ICT that most contributed to the development of a motivational environment are those that facilitate access to information and knowledge such as workflow, Internet and e-mail.
