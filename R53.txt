R53|Industrial clusters in the long run: evidence from Million-Rouble plants in China|This paper exploits a short-lived cooperation program between the U.S.S.R. and China, which led to the construction of 156 “Million-Rouble plants” in the 1950s. We isolate exogenous variation in location decisions due to the relative position of allied and enemy airbases and study the long-run impact of these factories on local economic activity. While the “156” program accelerated industrialization in treated counties until the end of the command-economy era, this significant productivity advantage fully eroded in the subsequent period. We explore the nature of local spillovers responsible for this pattern, and provide evidence that treated counties are overspecialized and far less innovative. There is a large concentration of establishments along the production chain of the Million-Rouble plants, which limits technological spillovers across industries.
R53|Le Phénix renaîtra-t-il de ses cendres ? Réflexions sur le recours des collectivités territoriales aux marchés de partenariats public-privé|This article describes the use of public-private partnerships by local governments since their creation in France in 2004. We argue that the municipalities' objectives and constraints explain the development of such contracts. We also study the reason of their current neglect. We conclude that the recent lack of interest for public-private partnerships is also due to the diversification of the contractual tools made available to municipalities.

R53|Is there an Economic Case for the Olympic Games?|The Olympic Games are a major undertaking that promise both large costs and potentially large benefits to host cities. This paper lays out the potential economic benefits of hosting the Olympics and details how, in the vast majority of cases, these gains are unlikely to cover the costs of hosting the event. The ideas are then applied to the experience of Boston in its ultimately unsuccessful bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics.
R53|L'accessibilité aux médecins généralistes en Île-de-France : méthodologie de mesures des inégalités infra-communales|L’un des enjeux majeurs des politiques de santé des pays développés consiste à garantir à la population une égale accessibilité aux soins sur leur territoire. La France, comme de nombreux pays de l’Organisation de coopération et de développement économiques (OCDE), est confrontée à des problèmes de raréfaction et de répartition inégale de la ressource humaine en santé. Les pouvoirs publics français tentent d’inciter les professionnels de santé à exercer dans des zones qualifiées comme?insuffisamment dotées en offre de soin. L’identification de ces zones devient un enjeu majeur et une gageure car, comme le soulignent Handy et Niemeier (1997), «?le plus grand obstacle à l’utilisation du concept d’accessibilité réside dans la difficulté de le traduire sous forme d’indicateurs opérationnels?». Pour mesurer la dimension spatiale de l’accessibilité, la méthode du «?Two-step floating catchment area?» (2SFCA) fait l’objet d’une convergence d’intérêt dans la littérature géographique internationale et s’est imposée dans le paysage institutionnel français puisque son adaptation (Accessibilité potentielle localisée (APL)) au contexte français sert de socle à la définition des zonages déficitaires en médecins généralistes institués en 2017-2018 dans l’ensemble des régions françaises. Nous faisons ici évoluer l’indicateur en réduisant l’échelle géographique d’observation, en prenant en compte de la dimension sociale des besoins, en intégrant au modèle les pratiques multimodales de déplacements et en considérant l’effet systémique des interactions entre l’offre et la demande à l’échelle régionale. Les résultats sont présentés sous forme de scénarios pour analyser les impacts de chacune des hypothèses retenues. Il en ressort que le changement de l’échelle d’observation tend à diminuer globalement les niveaux médians d’accessibilité tout en mettant en évidence des disparités infra-communales notables. D’autre part, les hypothèses de quantification de l’offre et de besoins de soins, de même que les pratiques de mobilité, impactent très sensiblement les résultats et ce, de manière différenciée selon les départements et selon les territoires. L’innovation méthodologique consistant à tenir compte du fonctionnement régional systémique (la probabilité de recours aux médecins dépend à la fois de sa proximité et de sa disponibilité, cette dernière étant dépendante – par effet de chaîne – du nombre de patients qui potentiellement pourraient y avoir recours, etc.) est celle qui modifie le plus les résultats. La mise au point de ce type d’indicateur révèle l’importance de mobiliser - dans un mouvement d’aller et retour – aussi bien des phases de calcul statistique et de représentation géographique des résultats à différentes échelles que des phases d’échanges, avec les partenaires institutionnels et/ou locaux (Agences régionales de santé (ARS), élus locaux, professionnels de santé, usagers). Cela afin d’affiner et de valider les hypothèses retenues en les confrontant aux ressentis des usagers du territoire, mais aussi, éventuellement, de prendre en compte les spécificités de certains territoires.
R53|Inequalities in spatial accessibility of childcare: The role of non-profit providers|Equal access to childcare services is a key concern of childcare policy. This article analyses social inequalities in the availability of such services. We explore how observed disparities are related to the socio-economic status of neighbourhoods and investigate how different provider types contribute to such differences. To do so, we use data on all childcare centres in the city of Vienna, Austria, on the spatial distribution of children aged under six and on three measures of neighbourhood status, over a period of eight years. We find that spatial accessibility is highest in neighbourhoods with the highest socioeconomic status, that such inequality has increased over time and that both effects can be attributed to the role of non-profits. The results indicate that the policy change undertaken in Vienna towards increased communitarisation – that is, a shift towards non-profit provision – has undermined the universal character of the city’s childcare system.
R53|Green Urban Areas|This paper studies the size and location of urban green areas across city spaces. Urban green areas offer amenities that affect residential choices, land consumption and land rent. This paper discusses the socially optimal sizes and locations of urban green areas within a city and their decentralized allocation through land markets. The main result is that the share of land dedicated to urban green areas is a concave function of the distance to the city center. This result is confirmed by the empirical study of urban structures in the 305 largest EU cities. The importance of urban green areas is finally assessed by a counterfactual analysis, where 50% of urban green areas are removed in each city.
R53|Housing cooperatives are a growing presence in Australiaâ€™s housing system, providing a diversity of housing forms to a variety of household types across the income spectrum, typically serving low- and moderate-income households. International evidence shows that housing cooperatives can provide a range of housing from very low price points through to market rate in both non-urban and urban contexts. The research presented in this report reviewed a selection of international cooperative housing sectors in addition to the Australian context, with the aims of compiling current evidence for the social and financial benefits of housing cooperatives, to develop a framework to assess this in Australia; and to identify preliminary issues regarding the growth and diversification of housing cooperatives in Australia. Australian and international evidence for the benefits of housing cooperatives focuses on seven primary areas; greater levels of social capital, greater housing security and quality, health and wellbeing, skills acquisition, reduced costs, broader economic and development outcomes. Based on the international review, five factors can be seen to help the growth of cooperative housing in addition to supportive policy and/or public funding. Core amongst these are a stable asset base if the State itself is not the developer, access to appropriate finance, and familiarity and acceptance in the market. The growth and diversification of Australiaâ€™s cooperative housing sector requires assessment of its legislative and funding environment. Factors for consideration are: 1. Individual project viability; 2. Access to property title; 3. Appropriate development finance and resident mortgage mechanisms; 4. Policy support; 5. Appropriate regulation|No abstract is available for this item.
R53|Stock Market Volatility Analysis using GARCH Family Models: Evidence from Zimbabwe Stock Exchange|Understanding the pattern of stock market volatility is important to investors as well as for investment policy. Volatility is directly associated with risks and returns, higher the volatility the more financial market is unstable. The volatility of the Zimbabwean stock market is modeled using monthly return series consisting of 109 observations from January 2010 to January 2019. ARCH effects test confirmed the use of GARCH family models. Symmetric and asymmetric models were used namely: GARCH(1,1), GARCH-M(1,1), IGARCH(1,1) and EGARCH(1,1). Post-estimation test for further ARCH effects were done for each model to confirm its efficiency for policy. EGARCH(1,1) turned to be the best model using both the AIC and SIC criterions; with the presence of asymmetry found to be significant. The study concludes that positive and negative shocks have different effects on the stock market returns series. Bad and good news will increase volatility of stock market returns in different magnitude. This simply imply that investors on the Zimbabwean stock exchange react differently to information depending be it positive or negative in making investment decisions.
R53|The Optimal Provision of Information and Communication Technologies in Smart Cities|We exploit the public good attributes of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and theoretically analyze an aggregate economy of two smart cities in which ICTs are provided in either a decentralized or a centralized manner. We first determine the efficient ICT levels that maximize the aggregate surplus from the provision of ICTs in the two cities. Second, we compute the optimal level of ICT provision in the two cities in a decentralized regime in which spending on the ICTs is financed by a uniform tax on the city residents. Third, we ascertain the optimal level of ICT provision in the two cities in a centralized regime subject to equal provision of ICTs and cost sharing. Fourth, we show that if the two cities have the same preference for ICTs then centralization is preferable to decentralization as long as there is a spillover from the provision of ICTs. Finally, we show that if the two cities have dissimilar preferences for ICTs then centralization is preferable to decentralization as long as the spillover exceeds a certain threshold.
R53|Police reorganization and crime: Evidence from police station closures|Does the administrative organization of police affect crime? In answering this question, we focus on the reorganization of local police agencies. Specifically, we study the effects police force reallocation via station closures has on local crime. We do this by exploiting a quasiexperiment where a reform substantially reduced the number of police stations. Combining a matching strategy with an event-study design, we find no effects on total theft. Police station closures, however, open up tempting opportunities for criminals in car theft and burglary in residential properties. We can rule out that our effects arise from incapacitation, crime displacement, or changes in employment of local police forces. Our results suggest that criminals are less deterred after police station closures and use the opportunity to steal more costly goods.
R53|Fiscal incentives, competition, and investment in China|This paper explores how fiscal incentives offered to local governments in China affect investment rates in their jurisdictions. Theoretically, we build a simple fiscal competition model to establish the linkage between local fiscal incentives and expenditure policy and consequently, capital movement. The key prediction of the model, borne out by data from Chinese provinces spanning 2004–2013, is that an increase in the local corporate income tax-sharing ratio, which proxies fiscal incentives offered to local governments, motivates local governments to compete for capital investment through increased public expenditures. Our results contribute to the fiscal federalism literature by showing that local fiscal incentives significantly shape policy choices and local economic performance. In addition, by exploring fiscal incentives offered to local governments, we offer a novel explanation for the unusually high investment rate in China that has been sustained over a prolonged period of time.
R53|Public Spending on Transportation and Water Infrastructure, 1956 to 2017|The Congressional Budget Office regularly documents trends in public spending for transportation and water infrastructure. There are six types of infrastructure that are paid for largely by the public sector: highways, mass transit and rail, aviation, water transportation, water resources, and water utilities.
R53|Multigrading and child achievement|We study how multigrading, which is mixing students of different grades into a single class, affects children’s cognitive achievement in primary school. We build instruments to identify the causal effect of multigrading by exploiting an Italian law that controls class size and grade composition. Results suggest that attendance in multigrade versus single-grade classes increases students’ performance on standardized tests by 19 percent of a standard deviation for second graders, and it has zero effect for fifth graders. The positive impact of multigrading for second graders appears to be driven by children sharing their class with peers from higher grades. This last finding rationalizes the absence of a multigrade effect for fifth graders.
R53|Laboratory Evidence on the Effects of Sponsorship on the Competitive Preferences of Men and Women|Sponsorship programs have been proposed as one way to promote female advancement in competitive career fields. A sponsor is someone who advocates for a protï¿½gï¿½, and in doing so, takes a stake in her success. We use a laboratory experiment to explore two channels through which sponsorship has been posited to increase advancement in a competitive workplace. In our setting, being sponsored provides a vote of confidence and/or creates a link between the protï¿½gï¿½s and sponsorï¿½s payoffs. We find that both features of sponsorship significantly increase willingness to compete among men on average, while neither of these channels significantly increases willingness to compete among women on average. As a result, sponsorship does not close the gender gap in competitiveness or earnings. We discuss how these insights from the laboratory could help to inform the design of sponsorship programs in the field.
R53|The Economics of the World Cup|The quadrennial World Cup is perhaps the worldï¿½s most popular sporting event with millions of live fans and a worldwide television audience in the billions. It is also one of the most costly events to host with recent hosts countries such as Brazil and Russia spending around $12 billion putting on the tournament. This paper examines the costs and the benefits of hosting the World Cup with a focus on historical data and past economic impact studies.
R53|The Economic Impact of Olympic Games: Effects of Host Country Announcements on Stock Market Returns|Roughly seven years before an Olympic games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) accepts bids from countries to host an Olympics. Subsequently, the IOC determines and announces to the world who has won and lost the right to host. Contrary to prior evidence, we find the announcements do not affect the bidding countriesï¿½ stock markets. We complement prior studies by using additional years of announcements, by investigating whether there are effects prior to the announcement, and by testing for an effect both parametrically and non-parametrically.
R53|Is There A Case For Subsidizing Sports Stadiums?|In recent decades, governments have committed enormous public resources to subsidize construction of new stadiums, and the dollar value of taxpayer contributions for these subsidies continues to climb. Spending of taxpayer dollars includes both direct subsidies from state and local governments, as well as indirect subsidies from the use of tax-exempt bonds to finance construction. In granting stadium subsidies, governments claim that the stadiums are a public good that attracts tourists and businesses, thereby generating increased spending and job creationï¿½benefits that flow to the community rather than to team owners. But do such benefits exist, and are they large enough to justify the scale of the subsidies? Brad Humphreys, Professor of Economics at West Virginia University, and Victor Matheson, Professor of Economics at the College of the Holy Cross, address the wisdom of public funding of sports stadiums based on the evidence. Brad argues that stadiums should not be subsidized by taxpayers, as the evidence fails to identify any tangible economic benefits generated by stadiums, and a growing body of evidence reveals that stadiums also generate additional local crime, pollution, and congestion. In contrast, Victor argues that while the economic benefits of a new stadium are probably not high enough to justify a taxpayer subsidy of the full construction costs, the benefits may be enough to justify covering some fraction of the costs. Furthermore, governments may use the subsidies to achieve desired development in targeted neighborhoods.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R53|The Rise and Fall (and Rise and Fall) of the Olympic Games as an Economic Driver|This paper traces the economic history of major sporting events focusing on the Olympics. Historically, the Olympic Games as well as other major sporting events have been considered costly events that place a burden on host cities. Only in relatively recent years, coinciding with the massive increases in the cost of hosting these events, have event organizers begun to claim that these events bring with them large economic benefits.
R53|Professional Sports, Hurricane Katrina, and the Economic Redevelopment of New Orleans: Revisited|Hurricane Katrina devastated the city of New Orleans in late August 2005, resulting in damage to much of the cityï¿½s sports infrastructure and the temporary departure of both of New Orleansï¿½ major league professional sports teams, the National Football League Saints and the National Basketball Association Hornets. The city spent over $500 million restoring the sports infrastructure in New Orleans, and both teams subsequently returned to the city. In addition, New Orleans has since hosted numerous mega-sporting events including the Super Bowl, NCAA Menï¿½s Basketball Final Four, and several college football national championships. This paper examines the economic impact of Hurricane Katrina on professional sports in New Orleans and traces the recovery of the city in conjunction with spectator sports.
R53|Looking beyond the farm and household: Determinants of on-farm diversification in India|"This paper analyses the factors affecting on-farm diversification decision. Notwithstanding the influence of farm and household conditions, studies have also highlighted the role of external pull factors on farm diversification. Though appraised in scholarship, this aspect has eluded an empirical scrutiny in literature. Taking India as a case, this study shows that apart from farm and household factors, there is a broader agro-ecological and structural feature which impacts on-farm diversification decision. Correcting for endogeneity in a seemingly unrelated system of ordered probit models, a ""three-stage"" residual inclusion model is estimated. The findings show that proximity to social infrastructure such as schools, colleges, and access to public transport matters for diversification. Results also show that though urbanization may increase demand for variety of products, it might as well impinge upon farm labor supply as non-farm opportunities also rises with urbanization. Thus, the underlying structure of the local economy also merits attention while understanding on-farm diversification process."
R53|The Unintended Composition Effect of the Subnational Government Fiscal Rules: The Case of Italian Municipalities|Although numerical fiscal rules may be introduced to achieve several objectives, to date the maintenance of fiscal sustainability is their predominant goal. This is particularly true at subnational level; maintaining fiscal discipline in a decentralized setting is challenging and subnational government fiscal rules are considered one of the most valid solutions to the problem. While theoretical and empirical literature has mainly focused on their effectiveness in containing subnational deficit and/or debt, little attention has been paid to the possible trade–offs and side effects of the rules on the composition of subnational expenditure. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by exploiting the case of Italian municipalities, which have been subject for fifteen years (1999–2015) to a set of rules called Domestic Stability Pact. The Italian DSP framework – imposing rules only on municipalities above a population threshold (5,000 inhabitants) – allows us to implement a quasi– experimental technique to investigate the unintended composition effects of the rules. A difference–in–discontinuities design permits to find rigorous empirical evidence that the switching in 2007 to rules which are more binding in terms of fiscal discipline leads to a recomposition of municipal expenditure against investment spending. The analysis is then integrated by evaluating the impact of the rules on six categories of investment expenditure. Investment in human capital and infrastructure seems to be the most affected.
R53|Family-Centered Measures of Access to Early Care and Education|This study proposes new family-centered measures of access to early care and education (ECE) services with respect to quantity, cost, and quality and uses them to assess disparities in access across locations and socio-demographic groups in Minnesota. These measures are distance-based and use available geographic data to account for the fact that families can cross arbitrary administrative boundaries, such as census tract or ZIP code lines, and thus better reflect the real experiences of families than conventional area-based measures. Combining synthetic family locations simulated from Census demographic and geographic data and information on ECE provider locations, we calculate travel time between the locations of families with young children and ECE providers to measure families' access to providers of different types. The results yield a map of areas with low and high relative ECE access. The average family in Minnesota lives in a location where there are nearly two children for every nearby slot of licensed capacity, however, access to ECE supply varies considerably at the local level. The supply measure can also serve as a weight useful in computing family-centered measures of ECE quality and access costs, incorporating both prices and travel costs, to further characterize the local ECE market from the perspective of families. Improving measures of variation in families' access to ECE quantity, cost, and quality is valuable as policymakers consider expansions to public supports for early learning and ECE entrepreneurs decide where to invest.
R53|How Small are Small Markets? Location Choice and Geographical Market Size for Child Care Services|In this article we propose an innovative way of delineating geographical markets based on easily accessible data. We apply this concept for the day care industry and investigate providers’ location choices relative to local market characteristics to evaluate the widespread presumption that local markets for child care services are geographically very small. Using a panel of all day care centers for the metropolitan region of Vienna, Austria, for nearly a decade, as well as geographically extremely disaggregated data on the spatial distribution of children under the age of six at the 250m × 250m grid cell level, we find that the location of children and day care centers are strongly related, but this relationship diminishes as soon as the distance between a child’s place of residence and the day care center’s location increases. We conclude that geographical markets for day care services in metropolitan regions are indeed very small (about 500m or 550 yards).
R53|Estimating Urban Water Demand Elasticities using Regression Discontinuity: A Case of Tangerang Regency, Indonesia|We estimate the effect of water tariff adjustment in Tangerang city, Indonesia in November 2014 on monthly water consumption. Due to typical water-block pricing strategy, estimating water demand elasticities are likely to be complex. A unique panel monthly water consumption dataset at consumer level in Tangerang regency covering the period of January 2011â€“September 2016 is used. Using regression discontinuity framework, we find a 13% average tariff increase reduces 4% household water consumption on average. Further, our estimates suggest the tariff adjustment provides no effects on high-income households, industrial, and commercial consumers. We also find more elastic response of water consumption in short-run period than in long-run.
R53|Does Indonesiaâ€™s Macroeconomic Work Well Towards the Political Year?|This paper utilizes the timeframe of 2014â€“2018 as the period with some of the global underperformed macroeconomic indicators. This paper found that in late 2016, Indonesiaâ€™s macroeconomic indicators started shown some improvements that keep real and monetary sectorâ€™s equilibrium to be stable. This paper observes the external balance of current account, exchange rate stability, inflation and interest rate as well as consumption patterns, saving-investment gap, fiscal discipline and fiscal sustainability. It analyses the government expenditure multiplier, real and monetary sector stability and institutional coordination between fiscal authority, monetary authority, and financial service authority. Real sector improvements which have been rolling since 2017 has significantly contributed to the recent Indonesiaâ€™s macroeconomic stability. Technically, if all on the track, this will sustain during the upcoming political year of 2019.
R53|The Revealed Preference of the Chinese Communist Party Leadership: Investing in Local Economic Development versus Rewarding Social Connections|Over the last 30 years, the Chinese government has invested in new industrial parks with the intent of stimulating urban economic growth. The central government delegates the site selection decision to provincial leaders. A principal-agent issue arises because the central government prioritizes efficiency and equity criteria while the provincial leader may allocate such place based investments to reward socially connected mayors. We present a revealed preference test of industrial park site selection and document the willingness of China’s provincial leaders to sacrifice economic development in order to reward social connections. We examine the causes and consequences of this misallocation of capital.
R53|Econometric modelling of the link between investment and electricity consumption in Ghana|The study examines the long run effect of investment (proxied by gross fixed capital formation) on electricity consumption for Ghana, for the period 1971-2011, by employing annual time series secondary data from World Bank database (World development indicator). The Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Kwiatkowski-Philips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests were used to analyse the stationarity features of the data used in levels and in their first differences. The empirical verification was done using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag model (ARDL). The findings of the study indicate the data used are non-stationary in levels, however, stationary in their first difference. Investment and electricity consumption are cointegrated according to the cointegration test performed. There are both stable short run and long run relationship between investment and electricity consumption. Investment is an appropriate policy tool for electricity consumption management in both short run and long run. Further studies in the area of stationarity with structural breaks, cointegration with structural breaks, causality analysis, and multivariate modelling of investment-electricity consumption link is worth doing since the current study did not consider these issues.
R53|Finland Needs New Ways of Financing Transport Infrastructure|Abstract Motor fuel tax revenue is likely to decrease in the coming years because of the shift to electric cars. At the same time, self-driving cars and so-called smart mobility -services require new type of investments into road infrastructure. The concentration of population in urban centres also adds to the investment needs. In other words, investment needs for transport infrastructure are increasing while the tax revenue generated by road traffic is decreasing. To tackle this challenge, Finland should start preparing a road fee system based on a modern positioning technology. A well-designed road fee system would allow for congestion charges thereby also helping urban planning. We should also increase property taxes to tax a higher share of land and house value increases due to transport infrastructure investments. Public-private-partnerships may also be useful in transport infrastructure investments. The fact that the government can usually borrow at a lower rate than private businesses does not imply that private financing is more expensive. This is because in a public-private-partnership, the private sector is expected to bear some of the risks.
R53|Public–Private Partnership Development in Southeast Asia|Infrastructure development in Southeast Asia has been financed mainly by public funds, which leave wide gaps in majority of countries. Governments have tried to attract the private sector by offering various schemes under public–private partnership (PPP). Typically, PPP contributes less than 1% of gross domestic product, while public finance greatly varies from about 2% to 10% of a country’s gross domestic product. Among major factors supporting PPP implementation, the following features are critical: coherent policy, public sector capacity to manage PPP appropriately, public sector willingness to have mutual relation with private partners, and leadership. Private participation is still continuously growing; and its implementation is not limited to hard infrastructure only, but also to social infrastructure.
R53|Optimal Public Investment in Economic Centers and the Periphery|We analyze productivity enhancing public expenditure in a spatial economic model with labor mobility, firm-specific increasing returns to scale, and transport costs. Building on Krugman (1991), Fujita, Krugman and Venables (1999) and Redding (2016), we compare optimal investment and tax policies of fiscally autonomous regions to those of a benevolent central planer. We find transport costs and the size of scale effects to influence optimal tax and spending rates under both regimes. For sufficiently low transport costs and low substitutability between manufactured goods, regional fiscal autonomy leads to underinvestment: The lower the transport costs, the lower the local investment, and the higher the potential welfare gain through centralized policies. Our results challenge the view that local public goods should be financed entirely by local governments. They also help explain the recent decline of public investment at the municipal level in fiscally decentralized countries like Germany.
R53|Police reorganization and crime: Evidence from police station closures|Policy makers often try to optimize local law enforcement by reorganizing police forces. We study the effects of police reallocation via station closures on municipal crime by exploiting a quasi-experiment where a centrally administered reform substantially reduced the number of police stations. Combining a matching strategy with an event-study design, we do not find aggregate effects on crime. Instead, we find changes in the way theft is committed. We observe increases in car theft, apartment and basement burglary but less bicycle theft. We argue that station closures provide an opportunity for criminals to shift from low-value to high-value theft.
R53|Multigrading and Child Achievement|"We exploit Italian law DPR 81/2009, which determines class composition, as an instrument to identify the causal e ect of grouping students of di erent grades into a single class (multigrading) on children cognitive achievement. This article focuses on 7-yearold students|those at the beginning of their formal education. Results suggest that attendance in multigrade classes versus single-grade classes increases students' performance on standardized tests by 15{20 percent of a standard deviation. The positive impact of multigrading only appears for children sharing their class with peers from higher grades and is relatively stronger for students from disadvantaged backgrounds."
R53|The political economy of transportation investment|Will politics lead to over-building or under-building of transportation projects? In this paper, we develop a model of infrastructure policy in which politicians overdo things that have hidden costs and underperform tasks whose costs voters readily perceive. Consequently, national funding of transportation leads to overspending, since voters more readily perceive the upside of new projects than the future taxes that will be paid for distant highways. Yet when local voters are well-informed, the highly salient nuisances of local construction, including land taking and noise, lead to under-building. This framework explains the decline of urban mega-projects in the US (Altshuler and Luberoff, 2003) as the result of increasingly educated and organized urban voters. Our framework also predicts more per capita transportation spending in low-density and less educated areas, which seems to be empirically correct.
R53|Distributive politics inside the city? The political economy of Spain's Plan E|We study distributive politics inside cities by analysing how local governments allocate investment projects to voters across neighbourhoods. In particular, we ask whether politicians use investment to target their own supporters. To this aim, we use detailed geo-located investment data from Plan E, a large fiscal stimulus program carried out in Spain in 2009–2011. Our main empirical strategy is based on a close-elections regression-discontinuity design. In contrast to previous studies – which use aggregate data at the district or municipal level – we exploit spatial variation in both investment and voter support within municipalities and find no evidence of supporter targeting. Complementary results indicate that voters may be responding to investment by increasing turnout.
R53|The Intricacy of Adapting to Climate Change: Flood Protection as a Local Public Goods Game|We study adaptation to climate change in a federalist setting. To protect themselves against an increase in flood risk, regional governments choose among adaptation measures that vary with respect to their costs, the level of protection they offer, and the presence and nature of spillovers to neighboring regions. The central government can provide co-funding in response to specific proposals. If it has to deduce the vulnerability of regions by their actions, the resulting adaptation measures are too costly from a social point of view. The results show that adaptation cannot be expected to be efficient without specifically designed incentive schemes.
R53|Análisis insumo-producto y la inversión pública: una aplicación para el Caribe colombiano|Este artículo busca identificar los sectores con mayor impacto intersectorial en la economía de los departamentos del Caribe colombiano, con el objetivo de ubicar actividades estratégicas para orientar la toma de decisiones de inversión pública. A través del análisis insumo-producto regional, usando los coeficientes de localización FLQ en su versión modificada y un método de extracción hipotética, se encuentra que la industria es el sector con mayor efecto multiplicador sobre el producto, empleo e ingreso. A pesar de ello, se evidencia una baja interconexión entre la mayoría de los sectores, en especial en los departamentos periféricos de la región. ***** This paper tries to identify sectors that have a greater multiplier effect on the economy in the departments located on the Caribbean region of Colombia. The purpose of this is to locate strategic sectors that can guide territorial governments’ investment-making decisions. Through regional input-output analysis, and by using the modified FLQ formula and the hypothetical extraction method, we identify that industry has the greatest impact on output, employment, and household income. However, we found low interconnection between most sectors, especially in peripheral areas of the region.
R53|Cálculo de un WACC diferenciado por región para proyectos de generación de electricidad con fuentes renovables en Colombia|Resumen: En este trabajo estamos interesados en proponer una metodología para estimar la tasa de descuento para proyectos de generación de electricidad divididos en renovables y norenovables (convencionales) y diferenciado por región. Esto requiere estimar adicionalmente un parámetro riesgo para cada región, en este caso para cada departamento del país, que tendría el efecto inmediato de regionalizar directamente la tasa de descuento o el WACC para ambos tipos de tecnologías. En la medición del riesgo-región se consideraron variables asociadas al riesgo de corrupción y a la violencia en cada departamento. Nuestros resultados sugieren que los departamentos de Antioquia y Valle del Cauca son las regiones con más riesgo de violencia y en consecuencia donde debe exigirse una rentabilidad mínima mayor. / Abstract : In this paper we are interested in proposing a methodology to estimate the discount rate for electricity generation projects divided into renewable and non-renewable (conventional) and differentiated by region. This requires estimating a risk parameter for each region, in this case for each department of the country, which would have the immediate effect of directly regionalizing the discount rate or the WACC for both types of technologies. In the region risk measurement, variables associated with the risk of corruption and violence in each department were considered. Our results suggest that departments of Antioquia and Valle del Cauca are the regions with the highest risk of violence and consequently where a higher minimum profitability should be demanded.
R53|Amenities and the Social Structure of Cities|"We develop a new model of a ""featureful"" city in which locations are differentiated by two attributes, that is, the distance to employment centers and the accessibility to given amenities, and we show how heterogeneous households in income are sorted out across the urban space. Under Stone-Geary preferences, the spatial income distribution is governed by a location-quality index which reffects the interaction between the amenity and commuting cost functions. The residential equilibrium typically involves the spatial separation of households sharing similar incomes. Using data on Dutch cities, we show that there is a causal relationship between the amenity level and consumer income, suggesting that richer households sort themselves into high amenity locations. We do not find strong evidence that employment accessibility leads to income segregation, suggesting that the standard monocentric city model without amenities is a poor predictor of the social structure of cities."
R53|A Context-based Procedure for Assessing Participatory Schemes in Environmental Planning|The efficiency of participatory schemes in environmental planning is an emerging research area, and many issues are not solved yet regarding the assessment of such procedures. It is essential for decision makers to identify improvement opportunities of participatory schemes. We propose an original procedure to address such issue, through a bargaining model from the signaling game literature, which accounts for participation design as well as for agents' preferences, beliefs and bargaining power. The model is calibrated using qualitative data from surveys in French local communities involved in municipal solid waste management. Model simulations are used to test for assumptions on the stakeholder dialogue and explore sensitivity of game outcomes to structural parameters. We propose a set of performance indicators to identify the most effective participatory schemes in achieving convergence in stakeholder positions regarding environmental and land-use planning.
R53|Externalities of public housing: The effect of public housing demolitions on local crime|This paper evaluates the potential for negative externalities from public housing by examining crime rates before and after demolition of public housing projects in Chicago between 1995 and 2010. Using data on block-level crimes by type of crime merged to detailed geographic data on individual public housing demolitions, I find evidence that Chicago's public housing imposed significant externalities on the surrounding neighborhood. Using a difference in difference approach comparing neighborhoods around public housing projects to nearby neighborhoods I find that crime decreases by 8.8% after a demolition. This decrease is concentrated in violent crime. I use an event study to show that the decrease occurs at the approximate date of the eviction of the residents and persists for at least 5 years after the demolition. Neighborhoods with large demolitions and demolitions of public housing that had been poorly maintained display the largest crime decreases.
R53|Instruments of Investment Attraction in Order to Fulfill the Structural Priorities of Sustainable Regional Development (Study Based on the Rostov Region)|The aim of the study is devoted to defining most effective tools of investment funds attraction. These funds can be used in implementation of strategic priorities for socio-economic regional development requiring, in areas that are in need of economic restructuring. The authors have selected the Rostov region as the research target, the economy of which is in need of structural change in the direction of increasing innovational, high-tech and scientific production, in order to reduce import dependency and move closer towards the post-industrial model of economic development. The study considers currently available instruments of attraction of private sector closer to solving the stated problems of Rostov region, analyzing their regulatory, financial and organizational consulting security on both state and federal level. Main directions of economic restructuring of Rostov region are also defined. Authors also outline the main problems that private enterprises come across while doing business in the investigated area. On the basis of the research, investigating federal and regional instruments of private sector involvement authors form a number of proposals and recommendations focusing on regional improvement. As a result of the conducted study, the authors reached the conclusion, that there is a number of strategic measures that should be performed in the Rostov region. These don't only include the improvement of financial instruments, but also best available technologies, national technology initiative, and clustering.
R53|Waste collection in rural communities: challenges under EU regulations. A Case study of Neamt County, Romania|The paper aims to examine the changes in the rural waste management sector at regional scale since the Romania adhesion to the EU in 2007. Traditional waste management based on the mixed waste collection and waste disposal often on improper sites prevailed in municipal waste management options of transitional economies across the globe. The lack of formal waste collection services in rural areas has encouraged the open dumping or backyard burning. The paper analyses the improvements and challenges of local authorities in order to fulfill the new EU requirements in this sector supported by data analysis at local administrative unit levels and field observations. Geographical analysis is compulsory in order to reveal the local disparities. The paper performs an assessment of waste collection issues across 78 rural municipalities within Neamt County. This sector is emerging in rural areas of Eastern Europe, but is far from an efficient municipal waste management system based on the waste hierarchy concept.
R53|One Global Map but Different Worlds: Worldwide Survey of Human Access to Basic Utilities|The paper aims to reveal one integrated global map which points out the major geographical inequalities in providing basic utilities across the countries using multivariate analysis and thematic cartography. Sixteen indicators with global coverage were selected taking into account the waste collection services, sanitation facilities, drinking water sources, energy, electricity, habitat and demographic conditions. Several data are broken down for the total, urban and rural population in order to outline the rural-urban disparities between and within countries. A special focus is given to waste collection coverage, in order to compute a comprehensive global assessment of this key indicator of public health, which is one of the poorest monitored basic utility. The world countries were divided into 10 classes according to the hierarchical cluster analysis. Each class has particular features outlining the gaps between high, middle and low-income countries with direct impact on quality of life, public health, and environment.
R53|Spatial assessment of construction waste generated by residential buildings in rural areas|The management of construction waste it is at an early stage in urban areas and lacking in rural areas where this fraction is frequently uncontrolled disposed on public lands. Despite the fact some items of construction waste are considered inert for the environment (soil, concrete) it also contains hazardous items (paint additives, cans, and containers) or recyclables (plastics, metals, wood). Potential recovery of this waste stream is high if it is properly managed. The paper estimates the potential amounts of waste resulted from residential constructions across rural municipalities of Neamț County between 2002 and 2010. These statistical values are calculated at commune level (rural territorial administrative unit) in order to outline the disparities between various geographical areas using thematic cartography. This approach is correlated with demographic features in order to reflect such spatial patterns. The map of population density within built-up areas reveals where the construction sector is emerging at the county scale. Field observations highlight the existence of illegal disposal practices of construction waste in the proximity of settlements or water bodies. This waste stream should receive proper attention in following years in order to achieve recycling and recovery targets imposed by EU regulations.
R53|Sitting on the fence: Pork-barrels and democratization under threat of conflict. The case of Ghana, 1996 - 2004| This paper studies political competition in the case of a democratization process. We present an illustrative model describing political competition when the opposition threatens the stability of the country. In some cases, our model predicts the government should invest in opposition districts to avoid political agitation. This contrasts with existing literature on established democracies, where public funds usually target ruling party supporters or electorally tight districts. We empirically observe the first democratic changeover in Ghana in 2000. Implementing a diff-in-diff strategy, we find that districts with a leading political party member appear to receive slightly more public funds when their party is not in charge. This phenomenon is found in urban areas and in areas that vote the most for this leading member’s party. Hence it occurs in places with the potential for political agitation.
R53|Unconventional wisdom: Estimating the economic impact of the Democratic and Republican national political conventions|We use daily hotel occupancy, price, and revenue data to analyse the economic impact of the 2008 and 2012 Democratic and Republican national conventions. We find that political conventions generate approximately 29,000 room nights of lodging, though this figure is partially offset by lower hotel occupancy during the week before and, to a lesser extent, after conventions. Conventions increase hotel revenue by approximately $20 million on average, a figure which suggests that host cities’ claims of economic impacts of $150 million or more may be implausible. Se utilizaron datos diarios de ocupación, precio e ingresos de hoteles para analizar el impacto económico de las convenciones nacionales demócrata y republicana de 2008 y 2012. Se encontró que las convenciones políticas generan aproximadamente 29,000 noches de alojamiento, aunque esta cifra se compensa en parte con una menor ocupación del hotel durante la semana anterior y, en menor medida, después de las convenciones. Las convenciones aumentan en promedio los ingresos de los hoteles en aproximadamente 20 millones de USD, lo que sugiere que los beneficios declarados por las ciudades anfitrionas de un impacto económico de 150 millones de USD o más podrían ser inverosímiles. 本稿では、ホテルの1日あたりの客室稼働率、料金、収入のデータを用いて、2008年と2012年に開催された民主党と共和党の全国大会の経済効果を分析する。この集会により、およそ29,000室/日の宿泊が発生しているが、集会の前の週は通常より稼働率が低く、さらにこれよりもやや改善しているが、集会の後の週の稼働率が低く、これによってこの数字は部分的に相殺されている。集会により、ホテルの収入は平均でおよそ2000万ドル増加しており、この数字から、開催都市が公表した少なくとも1億5000万ドルという経済効果には信憑性がない可能性が示唆される。
R53|Amenities and the Social Structure of Cities|"We develop a new model of a ""featureful"" city in which locations are differentiated by two attributes, that is, the distance to employment centers and the accessibility to given amenities, and we show how heterogeneous households in income are sorted out across the urban space. Under Stone-Geary preferences, the spatial income distribution is governed by a location-quality index which reflects the interaction between the amenity and commuting cost functions. The residential equilibrium typically involves the spatial separation of households sharing similar incomes. Using data on Dutch cities, we show that there is a causal relationship between the amenity level and consumer income, suggesting that richer households sort themselves into high amenity locations. We do not find strong evidence that employment accessibility leads to income segregation, suggesting that the standard monocentric city model without amenities is a poor predictor of the social structure of cities."
R53|資源配分の変化に伴う地域の生産性向上と経済政策の役割 : 社会資本整備か規制緩和か|経済全体の生産性上昇率は、その経済を構成する各産業固有の生産性上昇率と産業間の資源配分の変化による生産性上昇率に分解できる。この点は地域経済についても同様である。そこで、R-JIP データベースを利用して、各都道府県の生産性向上のうち、資本収益率差に沿って資本が移動することによる生産性向上とTFP 格差に伴って労働力が移動することで生産性の向上が達成される項目に対して社会資本や構造改革特区がどのような影響を及ぼすかについて分析を行った。まず社会資本の影響では、資本収益率差に伴う生産性向上に対してはマイナスの効果しかもたらしていない。一方、産業別社会資本に限れば、生産性格差に伴う生産性向上効果に影響を及ぼしているという結果が得られる。二つ目として、2000 年代に入って新たな地域政策として登場した構造改革特区の影響を検証した。この構造改革特区数の増加が資源配分に伴う生産性向上効果にどのような影響があったかを推計したところ、労働力の移動に伴う生産性向上効果に対しては有意な影響が観察された。

R53|Accessibility-oriented development|Local authorities worldwide have been pursuing transit-oriented development (TOD) strategies in order to increase transit ridership, curb traffic congestion, and rejuvenate urban neighborhoods. In many cities, however, development of planned sites around transit stations has been close to non-existent, due to, among other reasons, a lack of coordination between transit investments and land use at a broader spatial scale. Furthermore, while TOD considers access to transit, it often neglects the access to destinations that is provided by transit.
R53|Justice, Exclusion, and Equity: An Analysis of 48 U.S. Metropolitan Areas|Injustice in transportation services experienced by disadvantaged demographic groups account for much of these groupsâ€™ social exclusion. Unfortunately, there is little agreement in the field about what theoretical foundation should be the basis of measures of the justice of transportation services, limiting the ability of transportation professionals to remedy the issues. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved measure of the justice of the distribution of transportation services, which relates to the effectiveness of transportation services for all members of disadvantaged groups rather than for only segregated members of these disadvantaged groups. To this end potential measures of distributive justice, based on the accessibility to jobs provided by various modes, are evaluated in 48 of the top 50 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. The purpose of the study is to inform recommendations for appropriate use of each measure.
R53|What Drives Local Public Investments? Evidence from Poland|Local public investments satisfy basic local communities’ needs and are crucial from the perspective of regional convergence. Against this background, investments by Polish local government pose as an interesting research subject. It is because, due to its size and dynamics, local public investments exert a considerably significant influence on the Polish economy. Self-government entities with primary responsibility for conducting local public investments in Poland are municipalities. The paper aims to identify fiscal, demographic and infrastructural determinants of municipal investment spending in Poland. I use panel data for 2412 Polish municipalities over the period 2007–2014. For institutional reasons, the sample excludes cities with county rights. The baseline specification employs two-way fixed-effects (FE) estimation that controls both for municipality and year fixed effects. To test for robustness, the sample is restricted to municipalities with up to 20,000; 10,000 and 5,000 inhabitants. For each considered sample there are four regression specifications implemented. Investment spending increases both in own revenues and grants. On the contrary, I document the negative impact of indebtedness level and the coverage of water supply and sewage systems. The coefficients on population size and the share of old inhabitants cease to be negative and statistically significant for municipalities with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants. The results indicate that, apart from fiscal capacity, the investment policies of Polish municipalities are affected by economies of scale, local communities’ preferences and infrastructural endowment. The study also shows that incurring debt should be of particular concern for supervisory and control bodies.
R53|Using REIT Data to Assess the Economic Worth of Mega-Events: The Case of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics|This paper proposes an alternative approach to evaluate the effects of hosting mega-events, such as the Olympics, Football World Cup, and World Expo. Based on capitalization hypothesis, previous literature studies examined whether the announcement of mega-events affects prices of firms’ stock or real estate property. In contrast, I utilize data on Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), whose price is a hybrid of stock and property. The standard event study methodology with high-frequent data allows the estimation of abnormal returns due to the mega-event of interest, and clarifies the relationship between level of returns and characteristics of REIT’s property. I present an empirical example—the 2020 Tokyo Olympics—and the results are as follows: 1) investors judged that the comprehensive effects would be positive; 2) the effect becomes smaller as the distance from Host City (Tokyo-to) increases; 3) even in areas far from Tokyo-to, real estate used for hotels and commercial facilities are relatively susceptible to the Olympics.

R53|Rural Waste Management Issues at Global Level(Introductory chapter)|This chapter intends to draw attention to solid waste management sector toward rural areas where bad practices and public health threats could be avoided through traditional and integrated waste management routes. The expansion of waste collection services across rural municipalities should be a priority for many countries. Agricultural and municipal waste diversion from wild dumps and open burning practices must be avoided through smart solutions at the local level which are cost-efficient particularly in developing countries. The book further examines, on the one hand, the main challenges in the development of reliable waste management practices across rural regions and, on the other hand, the concrete solutions and the new opportunities across the world in dealing with rural solid waste.
R53|Policy Reforms & Analysis of Wheat Procurement System in Punjab, Pakistan|The current policy of minimum price prevailing in the country should be abandoned as although this policy encourages the farmers to produce greater amounts of wheat but it is unfavorable for the government. Instead of minimum price policy, input costs need to be reduced to compete in the international markets as higher domestic prices leave a country internationally uncompetitive and increase the costs to the economy. The objective of this study was to find suitable price policy reforms. Extensive analysis revealed that higher cost of production is the main reason for higher domestic prices. Therefore, the study proposes that controlling and reducing input costs will benefit the farmers as well as the economy. Subsidies on inputs, especially fertilizers, should be given by the government as this will reduce the cost of production significantly. Moreover, reduced input cost for wheat will be the appropriate policy intervention which will lead to achieve international competitiveness. Thus, the policy recommendation on the basis of the analysis carried out in the previous sections is that subsidy should be given on inputs of wheat, especially fertilizers, to reduce the cost of production, as reduction in the production cost will proportionately reduce the support price.
R53|Location of Unwanted Facilities in Prague: NIMBY in Public Administration Hierarchy|The paper investigates how the problem of NIMBY (Not-In-My-Back-Yard) related to the location of unwanted facilities is dealt in a hierarchically organized city. The conventional view of NIMBY is based on two premises: first, that locally unwanted facilities are essential to achieve an important societal benefit and realize the public good; second, that selfish opposition of local community prevents the realization of that societal good. The NIMBY effect is studied as a conflict between the City of Prague and its city districts. The official documents of the Prague City Council and of the Prague City Assembly were searched to find examples of decisions on the location of unwanted facilities. The documents search was concentrated on five selected facilities: municipal waste dumps, services for the homeless, services for drug users, regulation of gambling facilities, and the system of parking zones. In the documents, the authors identified five types of approaches to NIMBY that are called financial compensation, fair distribution, local autonomy, gradual problem shifting, and consultation/cooperation. It was observed that city districts, lower level of public administration, behave as guardians of local interests if they communicate with a higher level of public administration, a guardian of global interests. As local politicians depend on their local voters, it is not surprising that they prefer local interests to global ones. This naturally creates an internal policy conflict in the city that is divided into smaller units.
R53|Accessibility dynamics and location premia: Do land values follow accessibility changes?|The structure of transportation networks and the patterns of accessibility they give rise to are an important determinant of land prices, and hence urban spatial structure. While there is ample evidence on the cross-sectional relationship between location and land value (usually measured from the value of improved property), there is much less evidence available on the changes in this relationship over time, especially where location is represented using a disaggregate measure of urban accessibility. This paper provides evidence of this dynamic relationship using data on home sales in the Minneapolis-St Paul, MN, USA metropolitan area, coupled with disaggregate measures of urban accessibility for multiple modes, for the period from 2000 to 2005. Our investigation tracks the effects of marginal changes in accessibility over time, as opposed to static, cross-sectional relationships, by using an approach in which the unit of observation is a â€˜representative houseâ€™ for each transportation analysis zone in the region. This approach allows us to control for changes in structural attributes of houses over time, while also isolating the effect of changes in accessibility levels. Results of this approach are compared with a cross-sectional model using the same variables for a single year to illustrate important differences. Empirical estimates indicate that while most of the models estimated using a cross-sectional specification yield positive and significant effects of accessibility on sale prices, these effects disappear when the models are transformed into first-difference form. We explain these findings in light of the state of maturity of urban transportation networks.
R53|Infrastructure, Incentives, and Institutions|Expensive infrastructure is ineffective if it doesn't travel the last mile. In nineteenth-century New York and modern Africa, disease has spread when urbanites chose not to use newly built sanitation infrastructure to save money. Either subsidies or Pigouvian fines can internalize the externalities that occur when people don't use sanitation infrastructure, but with weak institutions subsidies generate waste and fines lead to extortion. Our model illustrates the complementarity between infrastructure and institutions and shows how institutional weaknesses determine whether fines, subsidies, both or neither are optimal. Contrary to Becker (1968), the optimal fine is often mild to reduce extortion.
R53|Going for the Gold: The Economics of the Olympics|"In this paper, we explore the costs and benefits of hosting the Olympic Games. On the cost side, there are three major categories: general infrastructure such as transportation and housing to accommodate athletes and fans; specific sports infrastructure required for competition venues; and operational costs, including general administration as well as the opening and closing ceremony and security. Three major categories of benefits also exist: the short-run benefits of tourist spending during the Games; the long-run benefits or the ""Olympic legacy"" which might include improvements in infrastructure and increased trade, foreign investment, or tourism after the Games; and intangible benefits such as the ""feel-good effect"" or civic pride. Each of these costs and benefits will be addressed in turn, but the overwhelming conclusion is that in most cases the Olympics are a money-losing proposition for host cities; they result in positive net benefits only under very specific and unusual circumstances. Furthermore, the cost–benefit proposition is worse for cities in developing countries than for those in the industrialized world. In closing, we discuss why what looks like an increasingly poor investment decision on the part of cities still receives significant bidding interest and whether changes in the bidding process of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will improve outcomes for potential hosts."

Este trabajo describe una metodología de análisis de decisión espacial multi-criterio mediante SIG. Se evalúa la idoneidad del área de estudio para albergar construcciones turísticas armonizadas en su entorno rural. Para establecer ponderaciones de criterios se emplea información de trabajos científicos, políticas regionales, directrices de la Unión Europea y opiniones de expertos. Los resultados muestran que el área más apropiada no responde a un única solución, y explican la fortaleza que supone la flexibilidad de ponderaciones en la toma de decisiones. [EN] Suitable location planning of rural buildings is a complex process to be in harmony with landscapes. This paper presents a multi-criteria spatial decision analysis approach using GIS techniques. The research aim is to evaluate the study area suitability to sustainably site tourism rural commercial buildings with landscapes.

The results reveal the most suitable areas for siting them, not to find a single suitable solution. They explain the weighting flexibility strengths of the application in the decision making process.
R53|Sea Level Rise, Radical Uncertainties and Decision-Maker’s Liability: The European Coastal Airports Case|Until now, most of the growing climate legal litigations mainly concern environmental associations or victims against energy of energy-users firms or States. However, in a near future, because of exacerbating sudden floods linked to climate change, future litigations could (will) concern infrastructure governance versus private companies. Indeed, sues would (will) concern the financial losses these last ones would (will) endure because the infrastructure managers did not made convenient protection choices in due time. This paper particularly investigates the case of coastal airports at the European level. It insists on the importance of climate scientists divergent opinions about the sea level rise and its consequences for decision-takers concerning their potential legal liability for negligence.

Además, se analiza la manera en que se han invertido los recursos teniendo en cuenta los costos de oportunidad y las necesidades de los departamentos. El periodo de estudio es 2012-2015. Se pudieron identificar algunas diferencias en el patrón de la inversión al comparar departamentos productores y no productores. Asimismo, al evaluar la correspondencia entre la participación de algunos sectores (como transporte, ciencia y tecnología, educación, vivienda) en el valor de los proyectos aprobados e indicadores, como la cobertura en educación, el número de investigadores y grupos de investigación, el índice de déficit habitacional y el estado de las vías, no se observan altas correlaciones.

R53|Insider-Outsider Labor Markets, Hysteresis and Monetary Policy|I develop a version of the New Keynesian model with insider-outsider labor markets and hysteresis that can account for the high persistence of European unemployment. I study the implications of that environment for the design of monetary policy. The optimal policy calls for strong emphasis on unemployment stabilization which a standard interest rate rule fails to deliver, with the gap between the two increasing in the degree of hysteresis. A simple interest rule that includes the unemployment rate is shown to approximate well the optimal policy.
R53|Die politischen Kosten von Gebietsreformen|In der Debatte um Gebietsreformen wird zumeist übersehen, dass Fusionen von Gebietskörperschaften mit spürbaren politischen Kosten verbunden sein können. In diesem Beitrag werden die politischen Kos - ten von Gebietsreformen anhand der 2015 in Kraft getretenen Gemeindegebietsreform im österreichischen Bundesland Steiermark erläutert und quantifiziert. Hierbei wird gezeigt, dass eine aus Gemeinde - fusionen resultierende Unzufriedenheit in der Bevölkerung zu einer signifikant geringeren Wahlbeteiligung und einem höheren Stimmanteil für populistische Parteien führen kann. Vor Gebietsreformen sollte der Gesetzgeber daher zunächst immer auch andere, mildere Mittel zur Erreichung möglicher Einspareffekte prüfen.

In ihrer Mehrzahl konnten diese Studien keinen systematischen kausalen Zusammenhang von Einwohnerzahl und kommunalen Ausgaben bzw. Effizienz nachweisen. Dagegen zeigt eine zunehmende Zahl empirischer Studien, dass Gebietsreformen mit substanziellen politischen Kosten, z.B. einer sinkenden Wahlbeteiligung bei Kommunalwahlen, einhergehen.
R53|A Method Of Increasing The Number Of Tourists In Romania: Sibiu – European Capital Of Culture|The title of European Capital of Culture could help immensely a city and its surrounding region from cultural, social and economic pointd of view. Cultural activity in the city is gaining momentum and new categories of tourists are attracted here. To determine if being a cultural capital influenced or not the growth and/or decrease trend as regards the number of tourists that came to Sibiu in a consecutive period of 23 years, the starting point was that this event had a major impact on tourists. The present paper is a quantitative research based on the number of Romanian and foreign tourists accommodated in structures of tourist receptions with functions of tourist accommodation. The conclusions of this article respond to these questions: Being a European Capital of Culture attracts or not more tourists than usual? The increase in the number of tourists was proportional with the effort of the authorities involved in the project?

We also discuss how resources have been invested, taking into account opportunity costs and the needs of the departments. The study period is 2012-2015. We were able to identify some differences in the pattern of investment of producers and non-producing departments. Moreover, in assessing the correspondence between the participation of some sectors (such as transport, science and technology, education, housing) to the value of approved projects and indicators, such as education coverage, the number of researchers and research groups, the housing deficit and the state of the roads, we did not observed high correlations.
R53|Los gobiernos departamentales y la inversión de regalías en Colombia: Un análisis descriptivo, 2012 - 2015|En este trabajo se describe cómo, a raíz del establecimiento del Sistema General de Regalías (SGR) en 2012, los departamentos colombianos ahora no solo manejan más recursos sino que tienen mayor participación en la escogencia de los proyectos que van a financiarse. Además, se analiza si su desempeño fiscal presentó variaciones entre 2012 y 2013, y se examina la forma en que se han invertido las regalías entre 2012 y 2015. Se encuentra que en el 80% de los departamentos la proporción de los ingresos provenientes de los recursos propios fue mayor en 2013 que en 2011, mientras que en ocho departamentos disminuyó la participación de la inversión en el gasto, a pesar de que, en promedio, éstos recibieron más regalías con el SGR. Aunque el sector transporte tiene la mayor participación en la inversión de regalías, existen diferencias entre departamentos productores y no productores de recursos naturales no renovables sobre los sectores que privilegian.

Using survey data for up to 12,264 Swiss citizens, elicited in February–August 2011, and several specifications of distance, we find a statistically and economically significant satisfaction-distance gradient. The gradient is smaller for those who may feel protected by wind direction and topographical conditions, and it differs by age, sex, and the level of education. The satisfaction-distance gradient has changed significantly after the nuclear disaster at Fukushima, Japan, indicating a reassessment of distance-dependent nuclear risk due to an information shock.
R53|Fast charging stations: Simulating entry and location in a game of strategic interaction|This paper uses a game of strategic interaction to simulate entry and location of fast charging stations for electric vehicles. It evaluates the equilibria obtained in terms of social welfare and firm spatial differentiation. Using Barcelona mobility survey, demographic data and the street graph we find that only at an electric vehicle penetration rate above 3% does a dense network of stations appear as the equilibrium outcome of a market with no fiscal transfers. We also find that price competition drives location differentiation measured not only in Euclidean distances but also in consumer travel distances.
R53|Do municipal mergers reduce costs? Evidence from a German federal state|We study the fiscal consequences of municipal mergers by making use of a large-scale merger reform in the German federal state of Brandenburg. This reform, which was implemented from 2001 to 2003, led to a substantial reduction in the number of municipalities. Individual mergers were heterogeneous across a number of dimensions, which allows us to contribute to the literature by exploring the consequences of different types of mergers within the same institutional setting. Focusing in particular on the distinction between compulsory and (semi-)voluntary mergers, we implement a difference-in-difference design with panel data from 1995–2010 at the level of post-merger municipalities. We find significant reductions in (administrative) expenditures after compulsory mergers. Voluntary mergers, on the other hand, have no effect on expenditures. We also show that the effects of voluntary and compulsory mergers vary according to further (secondary) characteristics of a merger.
R53|Workshop 8 report: The wider economic, social and environmental impacts of public transport investment|Workshop 8 discussed the measurement of the wider economic, social and environmental impacts of public transport investment and the way in which these measurements could be useful in discussing the ownership and control of land based public transport. Evidence was presented on a micro scale for measuring accessibility and social impacts with discussions centring first, on how these measurements could be useful for operators and authorities in the measurement of market potential and market penetration and second, presenting accessibility measurement as maps could provide the evidence base for identifying service adequacy and identifying the income impacts of public transport planning. In the area of social impacts, papers were presented that looked at the way in which public transport operators can enhance social capital of communities and how new transport infrastructure can generate social capital too. Alongside this came evidence for understanding the causal underpinnings of social impacts through looking at the role of income, personality and preferences in the generation of social benefits. Finally, more macro approaches to examining the wider economic, social and environmental impacts of public transport investment were presented. One of these showed the fuller picture that emerges if an Economic Impact Analysis (EIA) is presented alongside the more usual Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) since the EIA shows how the economy will respond in terms of jobs, job access and types of jobs which complements the efficiency and welfare approach of CBA. The second showed how incorporating income distributional considerations within a CBA can clearly identify winners and losers. Over and above the detail provided by the evidence in papers, the workshop identified that governments/authorities need to be more explicit and transparent about their objectives and motivations so that operators are clear about what is needed, that governance issues need further debate and that the analysis of risk needs further research and discussion to ensure that better projects are put in place.
R53|Achieving political acceptability for new transport infrastructure in congested urban regions|This paper analyzes the efficiency and political acceptability of road pricing and infrastructure policies targeted at relieving urban congestion. It combines a stylized transport model of an urban road network with a model of the political process that incorporates interactions between voters, citizen interest groups and politicians to explore the possibilities to reach political acceptability for efficient transport policies. In a numerical illustration, the paper compares a set of pricing and investment policies in terms of efficiency and acceptability. The illustration shows how conflicting interests can lead to non-efficient policies being chosen.
R53|Insurgency and Small Wars: Estimation of Unobserved Coalition Structures|Insurgency and guerrilla warfare impose enormous socio‐economic costs and often persist for decades. The opacity of such forms of conflict is an obstacle to effective international humanitarian intervention and development programs. To shed light on the internal organization of otherwise unknown insurgent groups, this paper proposes two methodologies for the detection of unobserved coalitions of militants in conflict areas. These approaches are based on daily geocoded incident‐level data on insurgent attacks. We provide applications to the Afghan conflict during the 2004–2009 period and to Pakistan during the 2008–2011 period, identifying systematically different coalition structures. Applications to global terrorism data and identification of new groups or shifting coalitions are discussed.
R53|"The Unintended Consequences on Crime of ""Pennies from Heaven"""|This paper examines how an infrastructure investment policy, implemented nationwide at the local level, has affected local crime rates. This policy, developed in the wake of the global recession of 2008-09, was designed to boost local economies through job creation. Using monthly figures from the Spanish region of Catalonia's more than 900 municipalities, the paper exploits geographic and time variation in the Spanish Ministry of Public Administration's random approvals of local investment policies, to estimate their impact on both (un)employment and crime. The combination of difference-in-differences and IV estimates makes it possible to precisely assess both the size and timing of the policy's impact on the local labor market and on municipal-level crime rates. While the policy apparently did not tackle the economic recession over the long run, local public finances did experience a boost over the short term, resulting in a temporary reduction in local unemployment rates (as legally required by the policy), as well as a significant drop in crime rates.
R53|L’Accessibilité potentielle localisée (APL) est une mesure locale de l’accessibilité aux soins appliquée aux médecins généralistes. Calculée au niveau de chaque commune, elle considère également l’offre de soins et la demande des communes environnantes|L’APL permet de répondre aux principales critiques faites aux indicateurs usuels d’offre de soins tels que la densité et la distance. L’un des enjeux de l'indicateur est également de proposer des pistes d’amélioration concernant la quantification de l’offre de soins et des besoins de soins ainsi qu’une définition plus précise de l’interaction entre l’offre et la demande. Pour ce faire, l’APL tient compte du niveau d’activité des médecins pour mesurer l’offre et du taux de recours différencié par âge des habitants pour mesurer la demande. Une fonction de décroissance du recours avec la distance à parcourir est également utilisée pour pondérer l’accessibilité spatiale en fonction de l’éloignement de la population à l‘offre de soins. Il s’avère que le paramétrage de ces différents critères a un impact important sur la mesure de l’APL. La mesure de la sensibilité de l’indicateur APL a été testée en modifiant les deux grands paramètres de l’APL que sont la définition d’Equivalent temps plein (ETP) de médecin et les seuils d’accessibilité à cette offre de soins. L’utilisation d’une fonction continue rapportant l’activité du médecin à l’activité moyenne nationale entraîne une augmentation significative de l’APL – entre 21 et 24 % – par rapport à l’APL initiale. Cette augmentation profite à tous les types de communes, qu’elles soient urbaines ou rurales, situées dans un pôle ou dans sa périphérie ou bien hors de l’influence de ceux-ci. Par ailleurs, l’utilisation de fonctions théoriques de décroissance associée à une augmentation du seuil d’accessibilité de 15 à 30 minutes impacte considérablement l’APL. Ceci entraîne à la fois une réduction des disparités infra régionales par rapport à la seule modification du paramètre de l’offre de soins et une structuration des valeurs de l’APL selon le type de communes autour d’un axe centre/périphérie des pôles beaucoup plus importante.

R53|A Decision Support Model Suggestion for Logistics Support Unit in Risky Environment|Storage facilities have an important role for uninterrupted product/service flow and ensuring continuity in supply chains. Criteria, which will be taken into account for the location of this facilities, and criteria values, can alter in accordance with private or public sector and risk environment as well. Besides logistics costs, transportation opportunities and proximity to the customers, risk based criteria such as terror, sabotage, air strikes, and natural disasters play an important role in order to select facility location. During production flow, Logistics Support Bases (LSB) are the military facilities, which affect firstly operation process positively or negatively and secondly result of the operations, serve in the risk environment. In a specific environment, selection of LSB becomes a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem for the decision maker. This study aims to determine qualifications which will be used to select the best suitable location of LSB; define the importance value of selected qualifications via DEMATEL method, and select the best location of LSB between alternative places. DEMATEL has used in the determination of criteria values and then VIKOR method has used to select the most appropriate location for LSB in the risk environment.
R53|Hazardous Materials Warehouse Selection as a Multiple Criteria Decision making Problem|Radioactive, toxic, smother, flammable, and explosive materials in solid, liquid or gas states which can negatively impact goods, organisms, and most importantly humans are called as “Hazardous Materials”. Hazardous material transportation and storage carry risk factors in addition to their other types of transportation operations. Furthermore, selection of a suitable warehouse becomes a problematic issue in which multiple criteria are evaluated as paying attention to risky circumstances. In this context, hazardous material warehouse selection is considered as a multiple criteria decision problem in our study. In particularly, for the explosives storage among other hazardous materials, necessary criteria are determined according to expert’s consultant. The determined criteria are weighted according to decision makers’ consultancy and the alternatives are evaluated by fuzzy MULTIMOORA under uncertainty throughout the decision making process in the study.. The proposed approach is discussed on a case study.
R53|Which firms benefit more from being located in a Science and Technology Park? Empirical evidence for Spain|The aim of this work is to analyse the heterogeneous effect of Science and Technology Parks (STPs) on firms’ innovation outcomes, contingent on firms’ size and innovation effort. Despite the worldwide diffusion of STPs and the increasing literature aimed at analysing their effect on tenants’ performance, empirical evidence on the heterogeneous effect of STPs' location on different firms is very scarce. We use information for a representative sample of 39,722 Spanish firms, 653 of them located on 22 of the 25 official Spanish STP. Results show, on the one hand, that firm size is negatively related to an STP location effect and, on the other, that only a small amount of internal innovation effort is required to achieve a very high return from park location. However, firms without innovation efforts do not benefit from a park location. Finally, as internal innovation efforts increase, the park effect reduces, but is still at a high level.

R53|Competition for Foreign Capital under Asymmetric Revenue-Orientation|This paper develops a model of inter-regional competition for mobile capital considering that regions may have different revenue-orientations. It shows that, if regions are asymmetric in terms of revenue-orientation, the less revenue-orientated region obtains higher tax-revenue and higher social welfare in the equilibrium than the more revenue-oriented region. However, if regions are symmetric, the equilibrium tax-revenue and social welfare are higher in the case of greater revenue-orientation of regions. Moreover, regions spend on public-investment and end up with Pareto-inferior equilibrium outcome, regardless of whether regions are symmetric or asymmetric. It also analyses implications of public-investment spill-over on equilibrium outcomes.
R53|A New Role for Cost-Benefit Analysis in Canadian Transportation Infrastructure Investment|Encouraging greater reliance on Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) as the organizing framework for facilitating discursive democratic procedures is an area in which the Canadian federal government can reinvigorate its role in the development of transportation infrastructure and physical infrastructure in general.The authors examine the microeconomic foundations of traditional CBA models. They find them too narrow to support the promise of CBA as a materially useful tool to help arrive at evidentiary consensus on major transportation infrastructure projects. To achieve its full promise, CBA requires an integration of advances in welfare economics, probability, discourse theory, and capability analysis.A framework for a reformulated CBA is presented along with an application of the approach in the case of gaining community evidentiary consensus on expansion of the Vancouver International Airport in the early 1990s. Potential implications for the federal government infrastructure policies today are explored and recommendations are made.
R53|Cooperative decision-making for the provision of a locally undesirable facility|We consider the decentralized provision of a global public good with local externalities in a spatially explicit model. Communities decide on the location of a facility that benefits everyone but exhibits costs to the host and its neighbors. They share the costs through transfers. We examine cooperative games associated with this so-called Not In My Back-Yard problem. We derive and discuss conditions for core solutions to exist. These conditions are driven by the temptation to exclude groups of neighbors at any potential location. We illustrate the results in different spatial settings. These results clarify how property rights can affect cooperation and shed further light on a limitation of the Coase theorem. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016

Se utilizan cuatro indicadores de accesibilidad de acuerdo con la literatura internacional: la distancia promedio, la distancia mínima y la cantidad y porcentaje de equipamientos en radios de dos y cuatro kilómetros. Como resultado se encuentra que la accesibilidad geográfica es baja en relación a algunos estándares internacionales, principalmente para el caso de la salud.

Four indicators of accessibility are used: the average distance, the minimum distance and the amount and percentage of facilities in a two and four kilometers radio. As a result, it is found that the geographical accessibility is low relative to some international standards, especially in the case of health. In addition, free housing projects recorded a lower availability than those for savers in most of the cases.
R53|Proximity And Voting For Professional Sporting Stadiums: The Pattern Of Support For The Seahawk Stadium Referendum|" type=""main"" xml:id=""coep12108-abs-0001""> This paper evaluates voting behavior on the Seahawk Stadium referendum in the State of Washington. For our empirical strategy, we implement both the linear probability model and a group logit model, which gives greater weight to voting areas with greater number of votes cast. We find that voting support was lowest among those living closest to the proposed stadium site, while voting support was highest among those within “easy access” of the stadium. This nonlinear distance effect differs from the typical “proximity” effect found in most professional sporting stadiums in the United States; however, it is consistent with a referendum-voting outcome for a professional soccer stadium in Germany and public projects such as national forests.

R53|Accesibilidad geográfica a los servicios de salud: un estudio de caso para Barranquilla|En este artículo se utiliza la ampliación de la red pública hospitalaria de Barranquilla para evaluar los avances en la accesibilidad geográfica y la equidad en la prestación del servicio de salud. Se emplean medidas de gravedad para calcular la accesibilidad consi­derando restricciones a la movilidad, así como información de demanda por servicios de salud. Adicionalmente, se utilizan indicativos de satisfacción para evaluar los niveles de equidad logrados con la ampliación de la red pública. Los resultados muestran avan­ces significativos en accesibilidad geográfica entre 2008 y 2013, especialmente para los habitantes de las localidades más pobres. En términos de equidad, se encontró que los factores socioeconómicos siguen siendo determinantes de la satisfacción de los usuarios del sistema de salud.
R53|Impuesto terrirorial y financiamiento municipal|Since most municipal-generated revenues (from property taxes, business licenses and vehicle permits) depend on the income earned by local inhabitants and the business or industry within the municipality, it is not surprising that there is a significant asymmetry in the volume and standard of local public goods available in the Chilean territory. Measures such as reducing exemptions from property tax and directly compensating municipalities for the exempt portion aim at neutralizing this asymmetry. They would also broaden the base of taxpayers and increase the accountability of local authorities.
R53|No Decline in Investment in Public-Sector Energy and Water Supply|A considerable share of public investment comes not only from public budgets but also from public utility companies. One major area of investment is energy and water supply, where the utility companies have substantial fixed assets in the form of distribution infrastructure. Using new microdata which has not been analyzed before, the present report shows that—unlike with the core public budgets—public energy and water supply companies show no signs of insufficient investment. On the contrary, gross investment into distribution networks over the past ten years has shown an upward trend comparable to that of private energy and water supply companies—if investment related to the expansion of infrastructure resulting from the energy transition is not taken into account. In addition, no clear correlation was found between the investment expenditure of energy and water supply companies and the financial strength or demographic trends within a given region. However, this does not rule out the possibility of diverging investment trends in the near future in response to demographic changes.

Einen beachtlichen Anteil öffentlicher Investitionen tätigen – außerhalb der öffentlichen Haushalte – kommunale Unternehmen, beispielsweise Stadtwerke. Ein bedeutender Investitionsbereich ist die Energie- und Wasserversorgung, da die Unternehmen über beträchtliche Sachanlagen in der leitungsgebundenen Infrastruktur verfügen. Der vorliegende Bericht zeigt auf Basis erstmalig verfügbarer Mikrodaten, dass es in der ausgelagerten Energie- und Wasserversorgung – im Gegensatz zu den kommunalen Kernhaushalten – keine Anhaltspunkte für unzureichende Investitionen gibt. Vielmehr folgten die Bruttoinvestitionen in Leitungsanlagen während der vergangenen zehn Jahre einem steigenden Trend, der mit dem der privaten Energie- und Wasserversorgungsunternehmen – sieht man von Erweiterungsinvestitionen im Rahmen der Energiewende ab – vergleichbar ist. Darüber hinaus lässt sich kein eindeutiger Zusammenhang zwischen dem Investitionsverhalten eines kommunalen Energie- und Wasserversorgers und der regionalen Finanzkraft beziehungsweise Bevölkerungsentwicklung finden. Dies schließt jedoch nicht aus, dass insbesondere der demographische Wandel in Zukunft zu regionalen Unterschieden beim Investitionsbedarf führen kann.
R53|Spatial mismatch through local public employment agencies: Answers from a French quasi-experiment|Using the unanticipated creation of a new agency in the French region of Lyon as a quasinatural experiment, we question whether distance to local public employment agencies (LPEAs) is a new channel for spatial mismatch. Contrary to past evidence based on aggregated data and consistent with the spatial mismatch literature, we find no evidence of a worker/agency spatial mismatch, which supports a resizing of the French LPEA network. However, echoing the literature on the institutional determinants of the local public employment agencies’ efficiency, we do find detrimental institutional transitory effects.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R53|Dreams of urbanization: Quantitative case studies on the local impacts of nuclear power facilities using the synthetic control method|This paper uses the synthetic control (SC) method to examine how the establishment of nuclear power facilities (NPFs) in Japan in the 1970s and 1980s has affected local per capita income levels in the municipalities in which they were localted (NPF municipalities). Eight quantitative case studies using the SC method clarify that the effects of NPF establishment on per capita taxable income levels are highly heterogeneous. The estimated effects are often economically meaningful and in some cases huge: the income level was 11% higher on average and 62% higher in one municipality in 2002 when compared with counterfactual units. On the other hand a few of the NPF municipalities have received only weak or negligible effects from NPF establishment. The post-estimation comparisons of employment between the NPF municipalities and the SC units suggest that the size of the direct labor demand shocks and subsequent indirect employment effects on nontradable service sectors have contributed to the increase in per capita income levels.
R53|Saving money when safeguarding species and habitats: Conventional vs. advance land acquisition for transportation mitigation|Advance mitigation has attracted attention for its potential to improve ecological outcomes of and to reduce transportation agency expenditures for compensatory environmental mitigation. When developing or improving infrastructure in ways that impact habitats and species, transportation agencies are required to avoid, minimize, and mitigate natural resource impacts through compensatory mitigation. Whereas agencies traditionally plan and implement compensatory mitigation project-by-project, late in project development, advance mitigation addresses the impacts of one or many transportation projects before or during project planning. This new practice may reduce infrastructure development costs, yet evidence of its associated cost savings has been piecemeal and often anecdotal. We explore the early acquisition of land for compensatory mitigation as one advance mitigation strategy that may reduce costs. With case-based analysis of California's Beach Lake Mitigation Bank, we provide post hoc empirical estimates of savings realized from advance purchase. Additionally, hypothetical scenarios illustrate how the timing of mitigation land purchases can impact cost. Overall, we provide new evidence that advance mitigation, specifically early acquisition of land for compensatory mitigation, could promise agency cost savings, particularly when land is purchased during a market trough instead of at market peak. Still, inevitable project planning and land market uncertainties necessitate cautious optimism.
R53|Il divario digitale infrastrutturale delle Marche|Undoubtedly a fast and sustainable transition to the most innovative eServices requires the preliminary availability of a pervasive, reliable and updated digital network infrastructure. Unfortunately, in Italy nor the Market neither the State effectively worked to solve the enduring infrastructural digital divide affecting many less populated areas of the country. Although the awareness of this divide in the public opinion has recently grown, the accumulated retard persists, and reduces the competitiveness of the national economy, now adversely impacted by the structural crisis and the industrial decline. In this work we critically discuss the conventional empirical evidences available on the Marche Region, and we present new and more accurate ones. Contrary to the received wisdom, it emerges that Marche and more generally the NEC area remain among the most disadvantaged areas of the country, also due to the polycentric and diffused characters of their model of socio-economic and urban development. Looking into the near future, we envisage that the passage to the next generation of broadband (NGAN) will accentuate the existing coverage and quality problems of the digital infrastructure while, considering the employable public funds, to date there isn’t any trace of a prospective landmark change in policy-making
R53|Inversión y stock de capital en España (1964-2013): La salida de la crisis|Este documento de trabajo presenta los principales resultados de las últimas estimaciones —relativas a la inversión y las dotaciones de capital— para la economía española, desarrolladas conjuntamente por la Fundación BBVA y el Ivie. Ofrece una panorámica general de muy largo plazo y en particular se centra en el último ciclo por el que ha transitado la economía española. La base de datos cubre el periodo 1964-2013 utilizando la metodología más actualizada propuesta por la OCDE (2009). Los datos se ofrecen ampliamente desagregados: por activos, sectores, comunidades autónomas y provincias. La riqueza de las estimaciones ofrecidas permite estudiar las características de la capitalización desde múltiples puntos de vista, lo que convierte al banco de datos en un instrumento básico para el estudio de las fuentes del crecimiento en España. El documento analiza el impacto de la crisis en el periodo 2007-2013 en las trayectorias de inversión y el stock de capital, enmarcándolo en una visión de más largo plazo. Los autores reflexionan sobre las perspectivas del stock de capital en España y los cambios necesarios para que la acumulación de capital contribuya al crecimiento futuro orientado por las ganancias de productividad.
R53|Local Polynomial Regressions versus OLS for Generating Location Value Estimates: Which is More Efficient in Out-of-Sample Forecasts?|As an alternative to ordinary least squares (OLS), we estimate location values for single family houses using a standard housing price and characteristics dataset by local polynomial regressions (LPR), a semi-parametric procedure. We also compare the LPR and OLS models in the Denver metropolitan area in the years 2003, 2006 and 2010 with out-of-sample forecasting. We determine that the LPR model is more efficient than OLS at predicting location values in counties with greater densities of sales. Also, LPR outperforms OLS in 2010 for all 5 counties in our dataset. Our findings suggest that LPR is a preferable approach in areas with greater concentrations of sales and in periods of recovery following a financial crisis.

R53|Accessibility of waste collection services in Romania: a multi-scale analysis in EU context using thematic cartography|Low coverage of urban and rural population to waste collection services leads to various environmental threats caused by uncontrolled waste disposal. New EU regulations on waste management issues transposed into national laws have improved this sector, but, the population access to such services is still low compared to others new EU members. A multi-scale approach of this indicator is a necessary tool for a proper analysis of this environmental issue. The maps reveal that Romanian development regions (NUTS 2) have the lowest coverage rates at EU level in 2010. Furthermore, major disparities are reflected between Romanian counties in 2010. Thematic maps outline a comparative analysis at national and regional scale (Romanian counties & cities and communes of North-East Region) between urban vs rural areas in 2010. These geographical approaches are necessary for a better monitoring process of waste management sector.
R53|Powering Up Developing Countries through Integration?|Power market integration is analyzed in a two-country model with nationally regulated firms and costly public funds. If the generation costs between the two countries are too similar, negative business stealing outweighs efficiency gains so that, subsequent to integration, welfare decreases in both regions. Integration is welfare enhancing when the cost difference between two regions is large enough. The benefits from export profits increase the total welfare in the exporting country, whereas the importing country benefits from a lower price. In this case, market integration also improves incentives to invest compared to autarky. The investment levels remain inefficient, however, especially for transportation facilities. Free riding reduces incentives to invest in these public-good components of the network, whereas business stealing tends to decrease the capacity to finance new investment.
R53|Sea Level Rise, Radical Uncertainties and Decision-Maker's Liability: The European Coastal Airports Case|Until now, most of the growing climate legal litigations mainly concern environmental associations or victims against energy of energy-users firms or States. However, in a near future, because of exacerbating sudden floods linked to climate change, future litigations could (will) concern infrastructure governance versus private companies. Indeed, sues would (will) concern the financial losses these last ones would (will) endure because the infrastructure managers did not made convenient protection choices in due time. This paper particularly investigates the case of coastal airports at the European level. It insists on the importance of climate scientists divergent opinions about the sea level rise and its consequences for decision-takers concerning their potential legal liability for negligence.

The Pro-Bowl, Mega-events, and Tourism in Hawaii|We use daily airplane arrival data from 2004 to 2015 from Hawaii’s Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to determine the net change in arrivals around a variety of sporting events. We find only one event generates a positive and significant net impact on arrivals: the Honolulu Marathon, which generates roughly 3,900 additional arrivals. No other sporting events result in a measurable increase in tourist arrivals including, notably, the NFL’s Pro Bowl, which receives a large subsidy from the state’s tourism authority.

For both efficiency and equity reasons, these events are risk propositions at best, and they generally represent an even worse investment for developing countries than for industrialized nations.
R53|“Tourism and high speed rail in Spain: Does the AVE increase local visitors?”|This paper analyses from an empirical point of view the relationship between the provision of high-speed rail services (HSR) and the evolution of tourism at the local level in Spain. We have built a database of 124 municipalities during the 2005-2012 period to study the effects of the introduction of new HSR corridors on the number of visitors and their total and average stay at several end-line and intermediate cities as compared to similar counterparts not having such an infrastructure. We combine both difference-in-difference and panel data techniques to find that these effects are, in general, extremely weak or just restricted to larger cities, once other determining factors are controlled for.
R53|Current managerial topics in public real estate asset management|In recent years, public administrations in modern economies have been deeply transformed. Government units have been granted extensive competences, including ownership and/or control over properties in order to fulfil their obligatory tasks relating to public services in a better way. Real estate has evolved from a source of costs to a source of revenues, as well. This complex asset class requires proper management respecting its operational and strategic needs and requirements. The article focuses on current issues of public real estate asset management (PREAM) and on the real estate assets in local governments in particular. It is a voice in the discussion about current problems with regard to the efficiency and effectiveness of PREAM. We propose directions for further research and development as the principles of asset management in modern democratic societies seem to be universal. The paper is based on a literature study and the authors’ observations.
R53|Intra-household Bargaining for School Trip Accompaniment of Children: A Group Decision Approach with Altruism|This paper tests a group decision-making model with altruism to examine the school travel behavior of schoolchildren aged between 6 and 18 years in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. The school trip information of 1,737 two-parent families with a schoolchild is extracted from Travel Behavior Inventory data collected by the Metropolitan Council between the Fall 2010 and Spring 2012. The proposed model has four distinctive characteristics compared with traditional developed models in the field of school travel behavior including: (1) considering the schoolchild explicitly in the model, (2) allowing for bargaining or negotiation within households, (3) quantifying the intra-household interaction among family members, and (4) determining the decision weight function for household members. This framework also covers a household with three members, namely, a father, a mother, and a schoolchild, while unlike other studies is not limited to dual-worker families. To test the hypotheses, we developed two models with and without the group-decision approach. Further, the models are separately developed for different age groups, namely schoolchildren aged between 6-12 and 12-18 years. This study considered at a wide range of variables such as work status of parents, age and gender of students, mode of travel, and distance to school. The findings of this study demonstrate that the elasticities of two modeling approaches are different not only in the value, but in the sign in some cases. In more than 90 percent of the cases, further, the unitary household model overestimates the results. More precisely, the elasticities of unitary household model are as large as 2 times more than that of the group-decision model in 25 percent of cases. This is a direct consequence of model misspecification that misleads both long-term and short-term policies where the intra-household bargaining and interaction is overlooked in travel behavior models.
R53|Physical Activity in School Travel: A Cross-Nested Logit Approach|This paper considers school access by both active (walk, bike), quasi-active (walk to transit) and non-active modes (car) in a two-level cross-nested logit framework. A sample of 3,272 middle and high school students was collected in Tehran. The results of the cross-nested logit model suggest that for people who choose walking, increasing a 1 percent in home-to-school distance reduces the probability of walking by 3.51 percent. While, this reduction is equal to 2.82 and 2.27 percent as per the multinomial and nested logit models, respectively. This is a direct consequence of the model specification that results in underestimating the effect of distance by 1.24 percent. It is also worth mentioning that, a one percent increase in home-to-school distance diminishes the probability of taking public transit by 1.04 among public transit users, while increases the probability of shifting to public transit from walking by 1.39 percent. Further, a one percent increase of the distance to public transport, decreases the probability of students' physical activity, approximately, 0.04 percent.
R53|The Role of Seaports for Portuguese Economic Recovery: The Port of Sines|The expansion for new export markets seems as inevitable as a challenge to the Portuguese economic recovery. Due to its peculiar geographical location Portugal is conditioned by the need to cross Spanish territory to reach central Europe. Moreover and assuming country’s geographical asymmetries where the coastline continues to be the main interface zone comprising nearly 70% of the population located within a 50 km littoral stripe, the adoption of an integrated policy for ports and other related activities appears as imperative. Portuguese continental ports are more than ever assuming a paramount role to surmount land-side constraints. Easy access to the foreland diminishes adverse land connections and mitigates the weak results arising from the hard task to capture cargo in the competitive hinterland. In order to understand the economic role this sector plays in the opening of new export markets, and pointing out expected growth opportunities and the threats that can arise from close proximity with major competitors, this paper cast a glance over the major continental Portuguese seaport. By giving an appropriate evaluation of the actual status and recommending further policies to adopt this paper aims to contribute for the interdisciplinary studies field applied to ports, using the framework of economic geography and spatial analysis rather than a port-specific approach.
R53|Education: capacity building for human development|Education is one of the key ingredients of Human Development as envisaged by social scientists, reiterated by UNDP, and accepted by National and State Governments. More specifically, greater access to knowledge in its various dimensions is critical to building of human capabilities, enhancement of freedom, and empowerment of people. The Millennium Development Goals (MDG) adopted and ratified by India also speaks of Universalisation of Elementary Education and Promoting gender equality in Education. Therefore, we must look at the issues of Educational Infrastructure, Achievements, Shortcomings, and Policy suggestions as a part of this HDR. This paper traces the trends in sub-regional educational infrastructure and achievements in Bardhaman district of India as part of DHDR revision exercise.
R53|Accessibility of waste collection services in Romania: a multi-scale analysis in EU context using thematic cartography<BR>[L'accessibilità dei servizi di raccolta dei rifiuti in Romania: un'analisi multi-scala in contesto dell'UE utilizzando cartografia tematica]|Low coverage of urban and rural population to waste collection services leads to various environmental threats caused by uncontrolled waste disposal. New EU regulations on waste management issues transposed into national laws have improved this sector, but, the population access to such services is still low compared to others new EU members. A multi-scale approach of this indicator is a necessary tool for a proper analysis of this environmental issue. The maps reveal that Romanian development regions (NUTS 2) have the lowest coverage rates at EU level in 2010. Furthermore, major disparities are reflected between Romanian counties in 2010. Thematic maps outline a comparative analysis at national and regional scale (Romanian counties & cities and communes of North-East Region) between urban vs rural areas in 2010. These geographical approaches are necessary for a better monitoring process of waste management sector.
R53|The Impact of Infrastructure on Trade and Economic Growth in Selected Economies in Asia|Infrastructure plays a key role in facilitating trade, especially since recent trade liberalization in Asia has resulted in significant tariff reductions. This study quantifies the impacts of both hard and soft infrastructure on trade volume for exporters and importers in the region as well as on various economic growth indicators.
R53|Analysis of business incubators in Galicia through the «Integral Model of economic profitability»|One of the economic policies used by governments for local and regional development is the encouragement of entrepreneurship through business incubators, which contribute to the creation of companies and employment, increase business survival rates and the payment of taxes and social contributions to public administration. However, they are consumers of external resources and have a high dependence on the Public Sector. In this study we analyse the net contribution of these business initiative centres in Galicia (Spain) through the use of the «Integral Model of profitability of business incubators» based on structural equations.
R53|Willingness to Pay for Hospital Access in Areas with High Concentrations of Blacks|We estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) of individuals to have increased spatial access to hospitals using a spatial hedonic price model. Employing a dataset of 6,093 observations at the census block group level, we find that the WTP of individuals to live one mile closer to a hospital is positive if the hospital is a designated public hospital, lower for private hospitals, and insignificant for nonprofit hospitals. Areas comprised of a relatively large population of black residents value spatial access significantly more and, for higher concentrations, exhibit a positive WTP for all hospital types. This is likely due to increased transportation costs of individuals in minority areas.
R53|Many Happy Returns? The Pro-Bowl, Mega-events, and Tourism in Hawaii|We use daily airplane arrival data from 2004 to 2015 from Hawaii’s Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism to determine the net change in arrivals around a variety of sporting events. We find only one event generates a positive and significant net impact on arrivals: the Honolulu Marathon, which generates roughly 3,900 additional arrivals. No other sporting events result in a measurable increase in tourist arrivals including, notably, the NFL’s Pro Bowl, which receives a large subsidy from the state’s tourism authority.
R53|Spatial Mismatch through Local Public Employment Agencies? Answers from a French Quasi-Experiment|Using the unanticipated creation of a new agency in the French region of Lyon as a quasinatural experiment, we question whether distance to local public employment agencies (LPEAs) is a new channel for spatial mismatch. Contrary to past evidence based on aggregated data and consistent with the spatial mismatch literature, we find no evidence of a worker/agency spatial mismatch, which supports a resizing of the French LPEA network. However, echoing the literature on the institutional determinants of the local public employment agencies’ efficiency, we do find detrimental institutional transitory effects.
R53|Success is Something to Sneeze at: Influenza Mortality in Regions that Send Teams to the Super Bowl|Using county-level Vital Statistics of the United States data from 1974-2009, we employ a differences-in-differences framework comparing influenza mortality rates in Super Bowl-participating counties to non-participants. Having a local team in the Super Bowl causes an 18% increase in influenza deaths for the population over age 65, with evidence suggesting one mechanism is increased local socialization. Effects are most pronounced in years when the dominant influenza strain is more virulent, or when the Super Bowl occurs closer to the peak of influenza season. Mitigating influenza transmission at gatherings related to large spectator events could have substantial returns for public health.
R53|A quantitatively effectiveness of hybrid sewerage systems allowing rainwater flow into sewage facilities for disaster prevention of inland flooding|In Japan, recent low birthrate and aging population have progressively led to a crisis for infrastructure. In particular, the quantity of drainage from homes and factories is remarkably decreasing, along with the decline of economic activity resulting from the overseas move of Japanese companies. As a result, a condition of overcapacity of sewage systems has arisen. On the other hand, the risks of natural disaster, such as damage from local flooding by heavy rain, are rapidly increasing. But the capacity of rainwater drainage systems remains chronically short. We suggest that underground space is not being used effectively in urban sewage systems. In our study, which focused on the rainwater sewage systems and sewage systems of enormous social capital infrastructure, we commented on the conditions and problems of two systems. To improve the spatial conditions of the two systems, we suggested that space reallocation is required. As such, we proposed a framework of hybrid sewerage systems and showed its various benefits in terms of environmental issues and disaster prevention of inland flooding. Targeting a specific district in Japan, we estimated that the capacity of rainwater drainage systems would improve from 61.6mm/hr. to 65.0 mm/hr. by introducing hybrid usage of sewerage systems. The possibility of inland flooding damage in this district could be reduced up to 20.7%. Realizing hybrid sewerage systems would contribute greatly to appropriate reallocation policy for underground water system space, compared with the river reforming works and the rainwater drainage pipes' constructions. Considering the problem from an institutional viewpoint, the sewage business is planned and operated based on the decisions of city planners, so to construct and perform hybrid sewerage systems, it is important to re-adjust the duties of various relevant authorities. From a technical viewpoint, to allow rainwater into sewage facilities, it is important to devise rules for controlling rainfall inflow and outflow to and from sewage disposal plants. Namely, it is required that inflow loads are reduced at sewage disposal plants. We approach the institutional and technical problems in carrying out hybrid sewerage systems. We suggest that rainwater drainage systems should be treated as a part of whole city systems, as opposed to separating rainwater drainage systems and sewage systems. We construct the Intelligent Rainwater and Sewage Systems (IRSS) concept for handling environment issues and disaster prevention by fully utilizing the capacities of rainwater drainage systems and sewage systems. Finally, we should still expect and be prepared for minimal damage such as local flooding, and should work for a sustainable life environment in the long term. To improve city planning in safety, relief and comfort, we hope IRSS can be included as a part of space reallocation policies by fully exploiting unused capacities.
R53|Walk this way: estimating impacts of Walk in Centres at hospital emergency departments in the English National Health Service|In publicly funded health care systems policy-makers face a dilemma: placing low acuity emergency care services outside hospitals may widen access to care and divert patients from making costly hospital visits, but may also attract new patients that have little need for medical care. Using detailed information contained in hospital records, I evaluate the impacts of one type of low acuity service - Walk in Centres (WiCs) in the English National Health Service (NHS) - relying on timing differences in the deployment of a single wave of services and restricting attention to places where new facilities opened to mitigate endogeneity concerns. Results indicate that WiCs have significantly reduced attendances at hospital Emergency Departments in places close by, but suggest that only between 10-20% of patients seen at hospital-based WiCs and between 5-10% patients seen at other WiCs were diverted from the more costly high acuity facilities at hospitals.
R53|Financiación de la infraestructura en los municipios del sistema de ciudades de Colombia. Documento para la Misión de Ciudades|Las ciudades tienen un rol fundamental en la economía colombiana, no solo concentran el 76% de la población sino que también son responsables del 85% del PIB del país. Además, de los beneficios económicos de las áreas urbanas, éstas están altamente correlacionadas con una mejor calidad de vida de sus habitantes. En este escenario, es relevante estudiar las ciudades y las formas en las que se interrelacionan para promover políticas que permitan potenciar sus beneficios sociales y económicos. Al reconocer la oportunidad de desarrollo económico y social que representan las ciudades para el país, la Misión de Ciudades ha impulsado una serie de estudios que ayuden a diagnosticar y formular la política de ciudades a 2035. El punto de partida fue definir el sistema de ciudades del país, en este se incluyen 151 municipios. Como parte de una serie de estudios de soporte que profundizan sobre el conocimiento sobre dimensiones a considerar para fortalecer el sistema de ciudades como motor de crecimiento del país, este documento da las bases para analizar la dotación de infraestructura con fines sociales y productivos de las ciudades del sistema. La infraestructura juega el rol clave de conectar y dar los cimientos para acceder a una buena calidad de vida. Es importante que las ciudades respondan a las demandas de la producción a través de la provisión de vías y servicios de electricidad de calidad, pero también que brinden a los habitantes un ambiente apropiado y deseable para vivir, esto a través del acceso a vivienda y servicios básicos domiciliarios y acceso al espacio público, bibliotecas, colegios y hospitales. Las dotaciones de infraestructura disponibles en cada ciudad son un indicador de la calidad de vida que esta ofrece y, por lo tanto, incide sobre qué tan atractivo es vivir en una ciudad en comparación con las demás. En el sistema de ciudades estas diferencias no son deseables porque influyen sobre las decisiones de migración de las personas sin que estén guiadas por una mayor o menor productividad relativa de las personas en las ciudades. En consecuencia los beneficios de aglomeración de las ciudades pueden resultar opacados por los costos de congestión y otros efectos negativos. Se debe incentivar a los hogares a migrar por las razones correctas: hacia las ciudades más productivas y no huyendo de la falta de acceso a servicios básicos, como agua potable o saneamiento. Por esto adoptamos el enfoque de la Revisión de la Urbanización en Colombia (2012) que concluye que el sistema de ciudades de Colombia debe buscar igualar el acceso a un paquete de servicios básicos para mejorar su funcionamiento. El objetivo primario debe ser cerrar las brechas de acceso a infraestructura que existe entre ciudades. Este informe contribuye a este propósito, en él se analizan las disparidades en la provisión de servicios de infraestructura entre municipios del sistema de ciudades y se revisan los recursos fiscales que han sido invertidos para alcanzar esos resultados. Además, se estima la medida en que permitirían financiar el cierre de brechas de infraestructura y cuáles deberían ser las fuentes de financiamiento priorizadas.
R53|Inversión requerida para infraestructura en Colombia|"""Cuando se hace referencia al enorme reto que tiene Colombia en materia de infraestructura es muy común que el debate se centre en los problemas de calidad y cantidad de nuestra red vial nacional, nuestros puertos y aeropuertos. Sin dejar de lado que en efecto tenemos un déficit importante en esta materia, los retos en infraestructura van mucho más allá, y probablemente la mejor forma de presentar el desafío es entendiendo que la problemática urbana es distinta a la nacional y a la rural. Por esta razón, el estudio titulado Inversión requerida para infraestructura en Colombia, realizado por Fedesarrollo y patrocinado por Cementos Argos, es de toda la relevancia para el sector y con seguridad se convertirá rápidamente en documento obligado de consulta en materia de política pública sectorial porque cuantifica, por primera vez, las necesidades de inversión anual en infraestructura urbana que se requieren para mejorar el funcionamiento actual del sistema de ciudades del país. Dichos requerimientos se estiman para los sectores de transporte, salud, educación y cultura y recreación. Los cálculos acá planteados se hicieron para un horizonte de tiempo de una década, teniendo en consideración el crecimiento poblacional de las ciudades, y como criterio de priorización de la inversión se propone aquella que contribuya a la provisión de los servicios básicos. Contar con estas estimaciones facilitará el proceso de asignación y priorización del gasto, con el fin de que las ciudades se acerquen a una provisión más adecuada de servicios para atender sus necesidades."""
R53|Weak Investment in the EU: A Long-Term Cross-Sectoral Phenomenon|Based on capital stock, in total, over six trillion euros less was invested in the European Union between 1999 and 2007 than in the non-European OECD countries, including the US, Canada, and Japan. In the euro area, investment was more than 7.5 trillion euros less than in non-European OECD countries. In virtually all EU member states, gross fixed assets (capital stock) are older than the OECD average and also demonstrate slower growth. This is particularly true for industry, which is expected to play a key role in Europe’s recovery. In order to achieve a higher growth rate, Europe must tackle this lack of investment across the board. Just implement investment programs in individual countries, such as the southern European crisis countries is not enough. In order to launch a broad investment offensive across the EU as a whole, specific steps must be taken. With a view to tackling the lack of investment in the long term, measures include an efficient competition policy and investmentfriendly tax policy.

In der Europäischen Union wurden zwischen 1999 und 2007 – bezogen auf den Kapitalbestand – insgesamt gut sechs Billionen Euro weniger investiert als in den nichteuropäischen OECD-Ländern, zu denen beispielsweise die USA, Kanada und Japan gehören. In der Eurozone waren es sogar 7,5 Billionen Euro weniger. Das Bruttoanlagevermögen, der sogenannte Kapitalstock, ist in fast allen EU-Ländern weniger modern als im OECD-Durchschnitt und wächst auch langsamer. Dies gilt auch für die Industrie, die bei der Wiedererstarkung Europas eine Schlüsselrolle übernehmen soll. Zur Erreichung eines höheren Wachstumspfades muss Europa die Investitionsschwäche daher auf breiter Front überwinden. Es genügt nicht, in einzelnen Ländern, wie den südeuropäischen Krisenstaaten, Investitionsprogramme zu implementieren. Um eine breit angelegte Investitionsoffensive in der EU als Ganzes in Gang zu setzen, müssen unterschiedliche Maßnahmen ergriffen werden. Hierzu zählt mit Blick auf die langfristige Investitionsschwäche eine effiziente Wettbewerbspolitik und eine investitionsfreundliche Steuerpolitik.
R53|Olympic Games: No legacy for sports|Countries whose cities host the Summer Olympic Games increase significantly their success during the competition. We study whether such effect is lasting or not. We compute the effect of hosting on the total number of medals in the subsequent games. To confront the issue that the selection of the host city is endogenous, we use a natural counterfactual: countries whose cities also bid for the Olympics but were not selected by the International Olympic Committee. In all cases, we find that Olympic success on medals fades away immediately after hosting.
R53|Competing for firms under agglomeration: Policy timing and welfare|This article studies government tax competition for firms under agglomeration effects. Agglomeration forces avert races to the bottom. They also eliminate the need to harmonize policy if large regions set policy first. However, if regions set policy at the same time, harmonization can still improve welfare. The case against harmonization thus rests on the assumed timing of policy-formation, not on agglomeration itself. Tax floors, an often advocated alternative to harmonization may not form Pareto-improvements: that depend on the effects of local policy outside the own region.
R53|Road infrastructure spillovers on the manufacturing sector in Mexico|This paper investigates the effects of road infrastructure on industrial activity in Mexico from a quantitative perspective. It addresses three main issues. First, it investigates the existence of a relationship between road infrastructure and the industrial average product of labour. Second, it studies the determinants of such a relationship and quantifies the magnitude of the impact of road infrastructure on the average product of labour. Third, it analyses the spatial effects of road infrastructure in Mexico. The findings can be summarised as follows. First, road infrastructure has a positive and significant effect on the industrial average product of labour. However, not all the elements (roads or groups of roads) of the road system have the same effect. Second, we find that the actual magnitude of the effects of accessibility on the average product of labour depends on the physical attributes of the roads, as well as the peculiarities of the road network. Finally, we show that the regional gaps in the average product of labour across the country can be partially attributed to differences in infrastructure endowments. From a methodological perspective, the main contribution of this paper is the development of a comprehensive methodology for the analysis of some of the benefits of road infrastructure in Mexico. This methodology can be applied as a tool in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of actual infrastructure policy in this country.
R53|Infrastructure policy in the USA–Mexico border: Evaluation and policy perspectives|This paper presents a case study of road infrastructure and its impact on accessibility and industrial productivity on the USA–Mexico border. The paper focuses on the analysis of three networks of projects that were presented in Protego (2007), a report prepared for the 35th US-Mexico Border Governors Conference in 2007. These projects comprise a series of local and interregional roads located in the western, central, and eastern areas of the border region. The analytical work uses the North American Road System Model (NARS), a GIS application to assess the effect of the infrastructure improvements on accessibility at different geographic scales. The impact of these accessibility gains on industrial productivity is also estimated. The results of the paper confirm the importance of road infrastructure in this region. They indicate that the productivity gains that can attributed to accessibility improvements are large enough to pay for the cost of new infrastructure during the life span of the project.
R53|Delivering sustainable public transport: The case of the Better Bus Area Fund|Transport for South Hampshire, a joint board responsible for transport planning for a conurbation of over one million people, successfully bid for the UK's Better Bus Area Fund. This will result in investments of £7.4 million over the period 2012 to 2014, of which £4.5 million will come from central government. Investments will include installation of Wi-Fi on vehicles, Near Field Communication (NFC) tags and Next Stop Displays and Announcement systems, along with marketing initiatives, the development of mobile apps and the refurbishment of buses. These investments will be complemented by other initiatives in the conurbation, not least some £27 million of investments from the Local Sustainable Transport Fund over the period 2012 to 2015, including the development of key interchange points and bus corridors.

R53|The impact of fiscal and political decentralization on local public investment in Indonesia|We investigate the effects of the fiscal, administrative and political decentralization process in Indonesia on budget allocation at the sub-national level. We find that after the large-scale expenditure decentralization of 2001, districts with relatively lower levels of public infrastructure started to invest significantly more in health and physical infrastructure, although not in education infrastructure. At the same time, we also see a tightening of the budget constraint in districts where the democratically elected government heads took over already before gaining fiscal powers. Finally, our results document decreases in public investments under directly elected district heads, showing no beneficial effects of direct elections on investment targeting.
R53|"L’investimento nelle reti NGA a larga banda: la ""questione settentrionale"""|Current developments of DAE (digital agenda for Europe) emphasize investments in NGA broadband networks as a main step to promote public and private eServices and transform public administrations. We focus on Northern Italy, where fast diffusion of NGAN is currently perceived as a fundamental ingredient for increasing competitiveness and curb the economy’s decline. In particular, this work investigates the widespread market failures characterizing Italian NGAN roll-out, the possible solutions and the technical and financial feasibility of the proposed plans - both private and public. Together, it connects the issue of NGAN financing with the current debate on the efficient and effective usage of EU structural funds in Italy. The most likely predicted scenario is that many semi-urban and rural areas of Northern Italy currently affected by the broadband digital divide will be lacking fast and ultrafast digital connections for a long period: unfortunately, a large part of these areas hosts crucial and export-intensive aggregations of SME and industrial districts. As a results, most of the targets of DAE will be unachievable for Italy. The need of a more courageous and timely public investment agenda emerges.

Una fattispecie originale che non ha riscontro nella normativa e nelle precedenti esperienze di pianificazione.

R53|Semi-Parametric Interpolations of Residential Location Values: Using Housing Price Data to Generate Balanced Panels|We estimate location values for single family houses by local polynomial regressions (LPR), a semi-parametric procedure, using a standard housing price and characteristics dataset. As a logical extension of the LPR method, we interpolate land values for every property in every year and validate the accuracy of the interpolated estimates with an out-of-sample forecasting approach using Denver sales during 2003 through 2010. We also compare the LPR and OLS models out-of-sample and determine that the LPR model is more efficient at predicting location values. In a balanced panel application, we use GMM estimation to examine how the location value estimates are affected by airport infrastructure investments.
R53|Rural waste generation : a geographical survey at local scale|The paper examines the per capita waste generation rates from from rural areas of Neamț County (Romania) using thematic cartography. Geographical approach of this issue is difficult because the lack of a geostatistic database at commune scale. Spatial analysis of waste indicators reveals several disparities between localities. Comparability of data between communes located in various geographical conditions must be carrefully made according to local waste management systems. Several dysfunctionalities are outlined in order to compare these results, on the one hand, between localities and on the one hand, between recent years. Geographical analysis of waste generation rates is imperative for a proper monitoring of this sector. Data from 2009, 2010 and 2012 shows that rural waste management is in a full process of change towards a more organized, stable and efficient system.
R53|Quantification of territorial keys indicators|The aim of the paper is to indicate the possible direction of the use of certain measures and indicators to operationalize the concept of territorial cohesion in general and in Polish conditions. The starting point is the five “territorial keys” proposed in the Background Report of the Polish Presidency of the European Union: a) accessibility, b) services of general economic interests, c) territorial assets, d) city networking, e) functional regions. For each of the territorial keys the set of indicators was proposed. Their usefulness and formal availability were analyzed. Analyzing the question of how to measure (quantify) territorial cohesion, it seems appropriate to divide the territorial keys for: a) keys-problems and b) keys-tools. The accessibility, services of general economic interests and city networking are undoubtedly keys-problems. The functional regions is a key-tool. The nature of the key territorial assets is double. Lack of assets is a problem, but at the same time proper identification of local resources is a tool - the basis for an effective place-based policy.
R53|Noxious Facilities, Environmental Damages, and Efficient Randomized Siting|This paper considers the efficient siting of a noxious facility that causes environmental damages (for example, increased pollution) in the host community. The analysis shows that there can be multiple efficient locations without transfers, and that an efficient location need not have the smallest WTA or WTP. In general, there exist randomized outcomes that are ex ante efficient and that Pareto dominate efficient outcomes. The analysis also shows that a community’s most preferred lottery never provides full insurance. Under some conditions, lotteries with no host compensation are Pareto superior to those with compensation. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014
R53|Spatial Preference Modelling for equitable infrastructure provision: an application of Sen’s Capability Approach|To determine whether the inclusion of spatial neighbourhood comparison factors in Preference Modelling allows spatial decision support systems (SDSSs) to better address spatial equity, we introduce Spatial Preference Modelling (SPM). To evaluate the effectiveness of this model in addressing equity, various standardisation functions in both Non-Spatial Preference Modelling and SPM are compared. The evaluation involves applying the model to a resource location-allocation problem for transport infrastructure in the Special Province of Yogyakarta in Indonesia. We apply Amartya Sen’s Capability Approach to define opportunity to mobility as a non-income indicator. Using the extended Moran’s I interpretation for spatial equity, we evaluate the distribution output regarding, first, ‘the spatial distribution patterns of priority targeting for allocation’ (SPT) and, second, ‘the effect of new distribution patterns after location-allocation’ (ELA). The Moran’s I index of the initial map and its comparison with six patterns for SPT as well as ELA consistently indicates that the SPM is more effective for addressing spatial equity. We conclude that the inclusion of spatial neighbourhood comparison factors in Preference Modelling improves the capability of SDSS to address spatial equity. This study thus proposes a new formal method for SDSS with specific attention on resource location-allocation to address spatial equity. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014
R53|A multi-period capacitated school location problem with modular equipment and closest assignment considerations|In rapidly growing urban areas, it is deemed vital to expand (or contract) an existing network of public facilities to meet anticipated changes in the level of demand. We present a multi-period capacitated median model for school network facility location planning that minimizes transportation costs, while functional costs are subject to a budget constraint. The proposed Vintage Flexible Capacitated Location Problem (ViFCLP) has the flexibility to account for a minimum school-age closing requirement, while the maximum capacity of each school can be adjusted by the addition of modular units. Non-closest assignments are controlled by the introduction of a parameter penalizing excess travel. The applicability of the ViFCLP is illustrated on a large US school system (Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina) where high school demand is expected to grow faster with distance to the city center. Higher school capacities and greater penalty on travel impedance parameter reduce the number of non-closest assignments. The proposed model is beneficial to policy makers seeking to improve the provision and efficiency of public services over a multi-period planning horizon.

R53|La banda larga del Veneto: stato, orientamenti e politiche|L'implementazione dell'Agenda digitale europea progredisce, ed entro il 2013 uno dei suoi primi target - la copertura universale della banda larga di base - avrebbe dovuto essere raggiunto nella UE. Purtroppo, gli stati membri e le regioni continuano ad esibire differenze persistenti in termini di avanzamento della Societa dell'Informazione. Anche le politiche regionali differiscono tra loro, e queste possono giocare un ruolo sostanziale, specie negli investimenti per la soluzione del divario digitale infrastrutturale. Il lavoro si focalizza sul Veneto, dove le ICT e la banda larga vengono correttamente percepite come un ingrediente decisivo per contrastare la recessione economica ed il declino industriale. Dopo aver criticamente esaminato lo stato e l'evoluzione recente della banda larga regionale, se ne esaminano le relative politiche. In sintesi, la nostra analisi valuta positivamente la strategia e l'attivita del policy-maker regionale, mentre allo stesso tempo riconosce che la demografia ed il modello di sviluppo diffuso di questa regione, unitamente alle problematiche poste dall'orografia e dall'infrastruttura di rete di legacy, richiederebbero fondi pubblici ben maggiori, mancando gli incentivi privati. Correlativamente, l'analisi viene generalizzata guardando alle prossime sde poste dalla transizione alle reti NGA.
R53|Do Neighborhood Parks and Playgrounds Reduce Childhood Obesity?|Using the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health data, we find a statistically and economically significant effect of neighborhood parks and playgrounds on childhood obesity based on covariate matching estimators. The park/playground effect depends on gender, age, race, household income, neighborhood safety, and other neighborhood amenities. The results suggest that adding a neighborhood park/playground may reduce the obesity rate and make children more fit, but relevant interventions must consider socioeconomic status of the targeted children as well as other neighborhood amenities.
R53|Racial Differences in Willingness to Pay for Hospital Access|We estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) of individuals to have increased spatial access to hospitals using a spatial hedonic price model. Employing a dataset of over 90,000 detailed housing observations, we find that WTP of individuals to live one mile closer to a hospital is positive if the hospital is a designated public hospital, lower for private hospitals and insignificant for non-profit hospitals. Areas comprised of a relatively large population of black residents value spatial access significantly more and, for higher concentrations, exhibit a positive willingness to pay for all hospital types. This is likely due to increased transportation costs of individuals in minority areas.
R53|Territorial Pact in context of Europe 2020|According to general acceptation, territorial pact is a contract between a different country's level of government (local, regional, national), a formalized local partnership on different market. This contract represents the relationship between governance and widespread participation of different social group, for different objectives (economic, social, and cultural). In the context of an enlarged European Union and Strategy 2020, cultural/natural heritage plays an important and clear role in at least four initiatives: innovation union, the digital agenda, and an industrial policy for the globalisation era and an agenda for new skills and jobs. The one important instrument for sustain these initiatives is territorial pact, also, a new mode of governance in European Union.This paper presents the general specification concerning to relation between heritage and territorial pacts in context of Europe 2020.
R53|Rural waste generation : a geographical survey at local scale|The paper examines the per capita waste generation rates from from rural areas of Neamț County (Romania) using thematic cartography. Geographical approach of this issue is difficult because the lack of a geostatistic database at commune scale. Spatial analysis of waste indicators reveals several disparities between localities. Comparability of data between communes located in various geographical conditions must be carrefully made according to local waste management systems. Several dysfunctionalities are outlined in order to compare these results, on the one hand, between localities and on the one hand, between recent years. Geographical analysis of waste generation rates is imperative for a proper monitoring of this sector. Data from 2009, 2010 and 2012 shows that rural waste management is in a full process of change towards a more organized, stable and efficient system.
R53|The Effects of European Structural Funds in the Spanish Regions Using CGE Models: a review|This paper reviews the few regional studies on the impact of European Structural funds in Spain using Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Models. While the models in these studies are widely used to evaluate the effects of very different public policies, they rarely have been used to quantify the impact of the Structural funds. In the pioneer papers elaborated for Madrid and Andalusia, the effects of the funds have been simulated through an exogenous change of final demand. I suggest avoiding any accounting of exogenous shocks in final demand of non-affected sectors by more-realistically splitting investment into various capital goods and evaluating the short-run effects of increasing investment in them.
R53|Regional Economic Output and Public Surface Transportation Infrastructure: A Spatial Granger Approach|This paper expands upon the classical Granger causality test with spatial dimensions to investigate the causal linkages between regional economic output and surface transportation infrastructure with a focus on the Northeast Corridor in the United States. To improve the validity of estimation, a panel data set of surface transportation infrastructure including highways, public intercity railways, and public transit, which are measured in real monetary value for the period 1991-2009, is adopted. Granger causality tests with integrations of various forms of spatial spillover interactions are analyzed in different spatial vector autoregressive models. The empirical results reveal that the spatial Granger causality test is able to capture a broader geographic scale of causality than the classical approach, but the causality between regional economic output and surface transportation infrastructure is sensitive to the model specifications.
R53|Sanitation in Rural India: An Analysis of Households’ Latrine Facility|This paper examines Households’ Latrine Facility in rural India using recent datasets from Census of India, National Sample Survey Housing Condition Rounds and other official estimates namely Physical Achievements of IHHL under NBA and Baseline Survey-2012 by Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, and Evaluation Study on TSC by the Programme Evaluation Organization, Planning Commission, on the basis of which, it analyses and discusses the discrepancies found among various statistics. There has been improvement overtime, yet there has been rise in the absolute number of deprived households, with notable variations in access among states, and rising disparities among economic and social groups, highlighting exclusion of backward-areas, Poor, Wage Labourers, STs and SCs. The results highlight the need to inclusively accelerate the pace of sanitation coverage in rural areas so as to comprehensively cover the rural community on target basis, with special attention to backward regions and weaker sections (socio-economic), through renewed strategies for enhancement of the quality of life of the people and to attain the vision of Nirmal Bharat by 2022.
R53|Optimal allocation of area in hierarchical road networks|This paper deals with the hierarchical road network design using a continuous model. The model is based on a grid road network where roads are classified into three types: access roads, minor arterial roads, and major arterial roads. Using a continuous approximation in which the distance is measured as the rectilinear distance, we obtain a simple approximation for the total travel time. We then find the optimal allocation of area taken up by roads at each level of the hierarchy so as to minimize the sum of the travel and construction costs. The result demonstrates how the total traffic volume, the traffic composition, and the unit construction cost affect the optimal road area. The optimal area of major arterial roads increases with the total traffic volume and the proportions of inward, outward, and through traffic and decreases with the unit construction cost.

R53|The impact of science and technology parks on firms’ product innovation: empirical evidence from Spain|Science and Technology Parks (STP) have attracted considerable attention and public funds in recent years. However, the conclusions on their effectiveness remain mixed. This work evaluates the impact of STP on firm product innovation in the Spanish context, as an example of a less developed innovation system in which regional and national governments are prioritizing STP initiatives. This work draws on a large sample of firms provided by the Spanish Survey on Technological Innovation that is conducted annually by the National Statistical Institute. We explore alternative econometric methods to obtain average treatment effects for firms located in 22 Spanish STPs. Our results show that Spanish STPs have a strong and positive impact on the probability and amount of product innovation achieved by STP located firms. These results hold when the endogeneity of STP location is taken into account. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014
R53|Trends in the regional allocation of public investment in the post-bubble Japanese economy|With reference to the assumptions presented by Yamano and Ohkawara (J Reg Sci 40:205–229, 2000 ) on the specification of a production function with region-specific individual effects on public capital, this paper introduces a new benchmark index in order to analyze the Japanese government’s investment allocation policy across subnational regions, with an emphasis on efficiency, equity, and/or redistribution under trade-off restrictions. This index, termed the equity–growth allocation share of public investment herein, is derived from a conventional Solow growth accounting approach. Specifically, it is defined as a region’s share of the periodic change in the nation’s public capital, where its growth contribution with its interregional spillover effects to overall output growth is the same across subnational regions. We apply this index to the post-bubble Japanese economy, which was beset by efficiency–equity trade-offs between Tokyo’s unipolar development and balanced growth given a prolonged recession. We find a shift from a pro-efficiency to a non-pro-efficiency allocation policy in the mid-1990s. This finding therefore rules out the inference that the government chose an inverse policy direction thereafter and instead implies that it rather attempted to balance efficiency and redistribution.

R53|Location choices of highly-educated foreign workers: the importance of urban amenities|Current developed economies' growth becomes increasingly dependent on the performance of innovation and skill-intensive industries. Therefore, the ability of cities to attract skilled or highly-educated individuals becomes more and more important for their growth and economic development. In this research we estimate a residential sorting model in order to shed light on the factors that determine the location choices of foreign skilled workers. We do so by estimating their valuation of various urban amenities in the municipalities of the densely populated Randstad area in the west of the Netherlands, and investigating which amenities increase the attractiveness of these municipalities. We also consider heterogeneity in individual preferences, and compare housing preferences and marginal willingness to pay for amenities between groups based on skill levels and origin. We find that job opportunities, accessibility, natural amenities and presence of historic monuments and buildings are highly valued by both domestic and migrants with high-education. Our results also provide evidence that social amenities, such as an existing community of migrants in a municipality, have an important role in determining the attractiveness of a location.
R53|L'incidenza delle politiche fiscali sulla pianificazione urbanistica. Gli oneri di urbanizzazione per la costruzione della cittÃ pubblica|"In this study, statistical data series of public finances, relatively little-known, has been analyzed to determine the activity carried out by Italian municipal administrations during the period 2000-2012, by conducting some of their important functions, consisting of: first, granting permits for the construction of new buildings, mainly for residential purposes; second, the collection of the revenue arising from existing municipal real estate taxes, and the expected income for the release of these building concessions, as well as for any sanctions in the urban field contextually applied; and finally, the construction of urbanization infrastructures, due to the increase in the share of the urban territory intended for residential or non-agricultural activities. It was so aimed to contribute to the verification of the arrangements by which local fiscal policies affected, even during the ""great recession"", the expansion of urban areas in Italy and the construction of related public infrastructures."
R53|Decentralization and Spatial Allocation Policy of Public Investment in Indonesia and Japan|Public investment is a fundamental response of government to the existing imbalances between subnational regions. Especially, the question concerning the allocation policy of public investment more receives a great deal of public attentions along with the decentralization process, because economic growth is inevitably uneven in its subnational impacts and decentralization has effects on the change in the allocations across the subnational governments and regions. This study explores the public investment allocation policy that either emphasizes efficiency, equity, or redistribution or strives to strike a balance between these three policy directions under the trade-off restrictions. We employ a new benchmark index, “equity–growth allocation share,” defining regional public investment allocation, given equal public capital growth across regions. We apply this method to Indonesia’s and Japan’s pre- and post-decentralization eras, beset by efficiency–equity trade-offs between uneven regional development and balanced growth policy. We found two major observations that contrast between two countries. First, as excessive economic activity regions in two countries, the capital region in Japan mostly shows the highest returns on public capital where the Java-Bali region does not. Second, Indonesia shows a structural change investment concentration in the Java-Bali region before and after decartelization regime while the Japan’s government pursues the pro-efficiency allocation policy under the decentralization process.
R53|Greater Paris: A Plan for a Global City|"Over the last decade or so, the debate on the planning and development of the Paris (ÃŽle-de-France) region has revolved around two little words: ""Grand Paris"", or Greater Paris. Despite existing political and scientific controversies surrounding the future of the capital region, three major issues, different but interdependent in nature, have emerged. The first is the economic development of Paris and its place on the world stage (section 1); the second is socio-spatial justice and quality of life in the region (Section 2); and the third is governance (Section 3). These three issues, in our opinion, are key to understanding the processes currently under way in the ÃŽle-de-France region in connection with the concept of a Greater Paris. The aim of this paper is to stimulate scientific discussion by exploring each of these issues on the basis of the key stylized facts and the rationales of the various stakeholders."
R53|Accesibilidad geográfica y equidad en la prestación del servicio de salud: un estudio de caso para Barranquilla|En este artículo se utiliza la ampliación de la red pública hospitalaria de Barranquilla, como un cuasi-experimento que evalúa los avances en la accesibilidad geográfica y la equidad en la prestación del servicio de salud. En particular, se emplean medidas de gravedad para calcular la accesibilidad considerando restricciones a la movilidad así como información de demanda por servicios de salud.

R53|A translog production function for the Spanish provinces: Impact of the human and physical capital in economic growth|A translog production function and an extended translog production function with third-order terms are estimated for the 50 Spanish provinces in the period 1985–2006. The results show the existence of complementarity relationships between private physical and human capital. Likewise, they show the existence of decreasing returns of private physical and human capital. However, the direction of the decreasing returns of private physical capital is reversed for a high endowment level of this factor. These results suggest the importance of capitalizing the Spanish economy, since it would increase the effect of human capital upon productivity and may also generate positive externalities.
R53|Why not in your backyard? On the location and size of a public facility|In this paper, we tackle the issue of locating and sizing a public facility which provides a public good in a closed and populated territory and generates differentiated benefits to households. In the case of a “Nimby” (“Imby”) facility, the smaller is the distance, the smaller (larger) is the individual benefit. Multiple solutions may arise in both cases, and we derive sufficient conditions for uniqueness in both cases. Optimal decisions on location and size are interrelated and depend on the complementarity or substitutability properties of size and distance in the utility function. Then we introduce a common-agency lobbying game, where agents attempt to influence the location and provision decisions by the government. Even when only a subset of households lobbies, the solution of the lobbying game can replicate the optimal solution. Under-provision or over-provision of the public good may be obtained both in the Nimby and the Imby cases. Finally, some non-lobbying households may be better off than in the case where all households lobby, which raises the possibility of free-riding at the lobbying stage.
R53|Getting doctors into the bush: General Practitioners' preferences for rural location|A key policy issue in many countries is the maldistribution of doctors across geographic areas, which has important effects on equity of access and health care costs. Many government programs and incentive schemes have been established to encourage doctors to practise in rural areas. However, there is little robust evidence of the effectiveness of such incentive schemes. The aim of this study is to examine the preferences of general practitioners (GPs) for rural location using a discrete choice experiment. This is used to estimate the probabilities of moving to a rural area, and the size of financial incentives GPs would require to move there. GPs were asked to choose between two job options or to stay at their current job as part of the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL) longitudinal survey of doctors. 3727 GPs completed the experiment. Sixty five per cent of GPs chose to stay where they were in all choices presented to them. Moving to an inland town with less than 5000 population and reasonable levels of other job characteristics would require incentives equivalent to 64% of current average annual personal earnings ($116,000). Moving to a town with a population between 5000 and 20,000 people would require incentives of at least 37% of current annual earnings, around $68,000. The size of incentives depends not only on the area but also on the characteristics of the job. The least attractive rural job package would require incentives of at least 130% of annual earnings, around $237,000. It is important to begin to tailor incentive packages to the characteristics of jobs and of rural areas.

R53|Is Public Capital Productive in China? Evidence from a Panel of Chinese Provinces|In addition to the direct productivity effect, public capital also has an indirect effect on private capital stock and labor input. This paper offers an evaluation of both the direct and indirect effects of Chinese public capital by applying a trans-log aggregate production function including public capital stock to a panel of regional data from 1986¨C2009. Moreover, we calculate the impact of public capital on regional total factor productivity (TFP) performance by introducing a system GMM estimation. The results show that the output elasticity of Chinese public capital stock is significantly positive, but decreasing year on year, and public capital is found to be a substitute for labor but complementary to private capital input. Finally, public capital has a significant positive effect on regional TFP performance.
R53|Regionalization and its effects in Finland â€“ a regional AGE modelling analysis| Regional structural change is currently among the greatest challenges facing the public sector in many EU countries. In countries like Finland, where the public sectors have a large role in providing educational, health and social services, structural change rapidly becomes a fiscal problem. Demography is directly linked to the demand for public services and to the potential growth of regional economies. On the one hand, ageing increases the demand for age-related services; on the other, it decreases labour supply, limiting the growth potential of many regions. The state's main tools for regional policies consist of both direct subsidies to the regions, as well as a mechanism reallocating tax revenues between poor and rich municipalities. However, the welfare costs of funding subsidies to poorer regions may be considerable. Thus, instruments not involving changes in spending have been preferred. Here, we consider the relocation of certain functions of the central government to the periphery â€“ regionalization â€“ as an instrument for coping with regional structural change. An improvement in regional municipal finances should also reduce the transfers received from the central government. This study aims at evaluating the effects of regionalization on regional development in recent years and in the near future. The study is related to an ongoing evaluation of the financial relations between the central government and local authorities. Regionalization has in practice meant the relocation of central government jobs. We can cover the relocation of jobs quite accurately, and also had a data to make a plausible valuation of the number of employees that actually relocated with the jobs. Moreover, we are able to calculate state transfers to municipalities at the level of individual municipalities within each region. However, to capture all the implications of relocation to regional economies, we extend the model to take into account the average size and age profile of the families of those who relocate. In this way, we obtain an estimate of the effects of regionalization on demand for public services locally, as well as on the overall effect on local population, labour supply and state, municipal and social security funds' budget balances. We analyse regionalization at the level of the twenty regions of Finland, using a dynamic, regional, AGE model. Our main finding is that regionalization has negative overall economic effects for Finland â€“ it decreases national product and employment, deteriorates the fiscal balance and increases state transfers to municipalities. However, these effects are small by magnitude. We found that the cumulative decrease in GDP until 2018 was a bit less than 0.05 percentages. The policy altogether succeeds in leveling regional disparities. We also find that while regionalization has been beneficial for many regions by creating new jobs and increasing municipal tax revenues, it has also used resources wastefully as there has been double efforts during the transition period.
R53|Are State Governments Roadblocks to Federal Stimulus? Evidence on the Flypaper Effect of Highway Grants in the 2009 Recovery Act|This paper examines how state governments adjusted spending in response to the large temporary increase in federal highway grants under the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The mechanism used to apportion ARRA highway grants to states allows one to isolate exogenous changes in these grants. The results indicate that states increased highway spending over 2009 to 2011 more than dollar-for-dollar with the ARRA grants they received. Rent-seeking efforts are shown to help explain this result: states with more political contributions from the public works sector to the governor and state legislators tended to spend more out of their ARRA highway funds than other states.
R53|EU acquis compliance on urban waste management. Case study: Piatra Neamt, Romania|This paper examines the current challenges in urban waste management systems under EU regulations for a newcomer state. Piatra Neamț is among the first Romanian cities which made the transition from a traditional to a modern waste management infrastructure through ISPA funds. These changes are poor reflected in rate of recyling and treatment so far according to analysis of waste streams. The paper performs a critical review of waste management services and also assesses the vulnerability to illegal dumping. Inappropriate sites of waste management facilities contribute to environmental pollution and urban landscape degradation. Comparative analysis between pre-accession period vs. current situation highlights one the one hand the improvements in this sector and on the other hand the difficulties to comply EU targets.
R53|Determining rural areas vulnerable to illegal dumping using GIS techniques. Case study: Neamț county, Romania|The paper aims to mapping the potential vulnerable areas to illegal dumping of household waste from rural areas in the extra- Carpathian region of Neamț County. These areas are ordinary in the proximity of built-up areas and buffers areas of 1km were delimited for every locality. Based on various map layers in vector formats ( land use, rivers, buil-up areas, roads etc) an assessment method is performed to highlight the potential areas vulnerable to illegal dumping inside these buffer areas at local scale. The results are corelated to field observations and current situation of waste management systems. The maps outline local disparities due to various geographical conditions of county. This approach is a necesary tool in EIA studies particularly for rural waste management systems at local and regional scale which are less studied in current literature than urban areas.
R53|Infrastructure Investments and Mega-Sports Events: Comparing the Experience of Developing and Industrialized Countries|Countries vigorously compete for sports mega-events in hopes of generating an economic impact during the event but also long-term growth induced by the hallmark event. It is well understood that the economic legacy depends on the infrastructure that not only facilitates the games but also has far broader implications for sustainable economic activity in the host city’s economy. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the extent to which developing and developed countries adopt different strategies as it related to the composition of infrastructure enhancements that have implications for the generation of an economy legacy from the mega-sports event.
R53|Time is money, but how much? The monetary value of response time for Thai ambulance emergency services|The monetary values for how much ambulance emergency services are calculated for two different time factors, response time, which is the time from when a call is received by the EMS call-taking centre until the response team arrives at the emergency scene, and operational time, which is the time from alarm to the accident scene and to the hospital. The study is performed in three steps. First, marginal effects of reduced fatalities and injuries for a minute change of the time factors are calculated using logistic regressions. Second, monetary values are chosen for fatalities and injuries; third, the marginal effects and the monetary values are put together to find a value per minute. The values are found to be 5.5 million Thai Baht per minute for fatality, 326,000 Baht per minute for severe injury, and 2,100 Baht per minute for slight injury. The total value of fatality, severe injury and slight injury for a one-minute improvement for each dispatch, summarized over one year, is 1.6 billion Thai Baht using response time. The resulting total values could be used on the benefit side in an economic cost-benefit analysis of investments, such as new technology, which could reduce the response and operational times.
R53|Estimating the effects of nuclear power facilities on local income levels: A quasi-experimental approach|This paper studies how the establishment of Nuclear Power Facilities (NPF) in the 1970s and 1980s has affected local per capita income levels in NPF-located municipalities in Japan by using the synthetic control method (SCM). Eight quantitative case studies using the SCM clarify that the effects of NPF establishment on per capita taxable income levels are highly heterogeneous, but often economically meaningful and in some cases huge: an 11 % increase on average, a 62 % increase in Rokkasho village in 2002 and a 30 % increase in Tomioka town in 2002. On the other hand, a few NPF-located municipalities receive weak or negligible effects from NPF establishment. I also examine the statistical significance of individual treatment effects with several placebo tests and find that the treatment effects of 4 out of the 8 NPF locations are larger than 95% of placebo effects.
R53|Key Features Of The First Phase Of The National Cluster Program In Russia|Cluster policy is recognized as one of the pivotal elements of state-of-art innovation policy. State support for clusters helps to take into account regional peculiarities and engage the most innovative local actors into the process of innovation policy drafting and implementation. Cluster development stimulates trust building and enhances knowledge spillovers among different organizations in the region. Finally the cluster approach makes innovation policy more systemic by coordinating measures aimed to support different actors (large companies, SMEs, universities, venture funds) towards comprehensive efforts linking the most perspective localized industries (ecosystems). The development of clusters has been determined as one of the priorities of the Strategy of Innovative Development of the Russian Federation for the period to 2020 which was confirmed end 2010. In the framework of this Strategy the first national cluster program was launched in 2012. The paper is devoted to the detailed description of the background of the national cluster program in Russia and its first phase – the selection of the pilot innovative clusters – which was implemented last year. Special attention is given to the comparison of planned design of the Russian cluster program with such widely known cluster programs as the BioRegio, InnoRegio and Les poles de competitivite. The similarities and peculiarities of the Russian program have been defined that allowed to identify several most significant areas for improvement.

R53|Public Investment, Tax Policy and Economic Growth in Taiwan|This paper applies Kocherlakota and Yi's (1997) model to discuss the effects of public investment and tax policies (tax burden and tax mix) on economic growth using Taiwanese data from 1960 to 2010. These effects changed structurally in 1990. First, public investment had no impact on economic growth before 1990. After 1990, the benefits resulting from the effects of public investment on economic growth outweighed the crowding-out effect on private investment. Public investment hence had a positively significant effect on economic growth. Second, the growth rate of direct tax relative to indirect tax has negatively affected the economic growth. Third, the tax burden has had no significant impact on economic growth because the effects of direct and indirect taxation on economic growth cancel each other out. In order to promote economic growth, we suggest that the government increase public investment and adjust tax mixes, such as by lowering the ratio of direct to indirect tax.
R53|Valuing Local Environmental Amenity with Discrete Choice Experiments: Spatial Scope Sensitivity and Heterogeneous Marginal Utility of Income|Using discrete choice experiments we examine preferences for the spatial provision of local environmental improvements in the context of regeneration policies. Amenities we consider are: improvements to areas of open space, recreation facilities and other public spaces; street cleanliness; restoration of derelict properties; and the provision of paths dedicated to cycling and walking. We include the spatial scope of the policy as an attribute, making the trade-off between environmental amenity and its spatial provision explicit. We employ a novel estimator for average willingness to pay (WTP) for mixed logit models with a random cost coefficient, which is robust to the presence of price insensitive respondents and performs well relative to mixed logit estimation in WTP space. We find that the spatial scope of the policy affects both the intensity and heterogeneity of preferences, and that these effects are of statistical and economic significance.

R53|Gross In-Migration and Public Policy in the U.S. during the Great Recession: An Exploratory Empirical Analysis, 2008-2009|For the period 2008-2009 of the “Great Recession,” the gross state-level in-migration rate was an increasing function of expected per capita personal income, state parks per capita, and warmer January temperatures. For the same study period, the gross in-migration rate was a decreasing function of the cost of living, the poverty rate, the average state income tax rate, per capita property taxation, and hazardous waste sites. All of the estimates yield results suggesting consistently, as in previous studies of earlier time periods, that migrants (consumer-voters) at the very minimum prefer lower state income tax burdens and lower property tax burdens. Consumer-voters’ evaluation of government services in determining their choice of location during the “Great Recession” appears to depend upon the type of government service. While consumer-voters on average appear to prefer states with greater public provision of state parks, our results do not indicate a strong preference for states with higher per pupil outlays on primary and secondary public education.
R53|Foreign Capital and Investment in Pakistan: A Cointegration and Causality Analysis|Present study is focused to examine the effects of foreign capital flows on domestic investment in Pakistan economy for the period of 1972-2013. Time series econometric techniques like unit root test, Johansen cointegration and Granger causality methods have been used for the data analysis. Long run cointegration relationship has been found between domestic investment and foreign capital flow variables. Unidirectional causality running from external debt stock, remittances and domestic saving to domestic investment has been found. The causality between external debt servicing and investment is bidirectional. Bidirectional causality is also observed between foreign direct investment and domestic investment but causality between investment and inflation is confirmed in neither direction. The results are statistically robust and the estimated model is stable. The study suggests some policy recommendations.
R53|Development of MSW collection services on regional scale : spatial analysis and urban disparities in North-East Region, Romania|The cities are facing illegal dumping of municipal solid waste (MSW) because the waste collection facilities do not cover the entire population. Furthermore, this sector is poorly developed in small towns or villages annexed to administrative territory units (ATU) of cities,MSW are disposed in open dumps polluting the local environment. This paper analyzes on the one hand the urban disparities on public access to waste collection services (WCS) in the North-East Region on the other hand, it performs a comparative analysis between 2003 and 2010 outlining the changes made in the context of Romania’s accession to EU. Also, it performs a quantitative assessment method of uncollected waste at urban level and correlated to demographic features of each city. Spatial-temporal analysis of waste indicators using thematic cartography or GIS techniques should be a basic tool for environmental monitoring or assessment of projects from this field in every development region (NUTS 2). The EU acquis requires the closure of noncompliant landfills, the extension of waste collection services, the development of facilities for separate collection, recycling and reuse according to waste hierarchy concept. Full coverage of urban population to waste collection services is necessary to provide a proper management of this sector. Urban disparities between counties and within counties highlights that current traditional waste management system is an environmental threat at local and regional scale.
R53|EU acquis compliance on urban waste management. Case study: Piatra Neamt , Romania|This paper examines the current challenges in urban waste management systems under EU regulations for a newcomer state. Piatra Neamț is among the first Romanian cities which made the transition from a traditional to a modern waste management infrastructure through ISPA funds. These changes are poor reflected in rate of recyling and treatment so far according to analysis of waste streams. The paper performs a critical review of waste management services and also assesses the vulnerability to illegal dumping. Inappropriate sites of waste management facilities contribute to environmental pollution and urban landscape degradation. Comparative analysis between pre-accession period vs. current situation highlights one the one hand the improvements in this sector and on the other hand the difficulties to comply EU targets.
R53|Determining rural areas vulnerable to illegal dumping using GIS techniques. Case study: Neamt county, Romania|The paper aims to mapping the potential vulnerable areas to illegal dumping of household waste from rural areas in the extra- Carpathian region of Neamt County. These areas are ordinary in the proximity of built-up areas and buffers areas of 1 km were delimited for every locality. Based on various map layers in vector formats (land use, rivers, built-up areas, roads etc) an assessment method is performed to highlight the potential areas vulnerable to illegal dumping inside these buffer areas at local scale. The results are correlated to field observations and current situation of waste management systems. The maps outline local disparities due to various geographical conditions of county. This approach is a necessary tool in EIA studies particularly for rural waste management systems at local and regional scale which are less studied in current literature than urban areas.
R53|Economic examples of latent budget analysis|Latent budget analysis is a classification technique that allows clustering identification by using compositional data. This paper presents examples of how this technique deals with the unit-sum constraint by establishing an initial independence model to which subsequent models are compared in terms of their relative fitness degree. In fact, latent budget analysis does not impose linearity, homogeneity, or even specific distributions on data. Examples analyzed in this work help to understand some important relationships between capital stock composition and income or food diet composition in a heterogeneous sample of countries.
R53|The Role of Asset Prices in Forecasting Inflation and Output in South Africa|This article assesses the predictive ability of asset prices relative to other variables in forecasting inflation and real GDP growth in South Africa. A total of 42 asset and non-asset predictor variables are considered. Forecasts of inflation and real GDP growth are computed using both individual predictor autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models, forecast combination approaches, as well as large scale models. The large scale data models considered include Bayesian vector autoregressive models and classical and Bayesian univariate and multivariate factor augmented vector autoregressive models. The models are estimated for an in-sample of 1980:Q2 to 1999:Q4, and then one- to eight-step-ahead forecasts for inflation and real GDP growth are evaluated over the 2000:Q1 to 2010:Q2 out-of-sample period. Principle Component forecast combination models are found to produce the most accurate out-of-sample forecasts of inflation and real GDP growth relative to the other combination and more sophisticated models considered. Asset prices are found to contain particularly useful information for forecasting inflation and real GDP growth at certain horizons. Asset prices are however found to be stronger predictors of inflation, particularly in the long run. JEL Classification: C11, C32, R53
R53|Political Institutionalisation and Economic Specialisation in Polycentric Metropolitan Regions: The Case of the East German â€˜Saxony Triangleâ€™|The rising focus of politicians as well as scientists in the EU on the large urban agglomerations as centres of economic growth is accompanied by political efforts to identify and to demarcate such agglomerations under the label â€˜metropolitan regionsâ€™. This study develops a theoretical framework broaching the issue of cooperation between municipalities from the perspective of regional economics as well as political science. The framework is applied to the empirical case of the polycentric metropolitan region of the â€˜Saxony triangleâ€™ in east Germany. The results show that various intervening factors prevent intense co-operation between the actors in the region. Policy implications and conclusions for future research are discussed.
R53|Infrastructure Investments and Mega-Sports Events: Comparing the Experience of Developing and Industrialized Countries|Countries vigorously compete for sports mega-events in hopes of generating an economic impact during the event but also long-term growth induced by the hallmark event. It is well understood that the economic legacy depends on the infrastructure that not only facilitates the games but also has far broader implications for sustainable economic activity in the host city’s economy. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the extent to which developing and developed countries adopt different strategies as it related to the composition of infrastructure enhancements that have implications for the generation of an economy legacy from the mega-sports event.
R53|The spatial range of local governments: does geographical distance affect governance and public service?|Does space matter for local governments in the implementation of development policies? Geographical distance is believed to weaken the transmission of the socioeconomic development policy. Peripherally located local governments may be weaker than those centrally located local governments. Polish local governments from 1995–2007 were assessed based on performance indicators. The results show that the effective range of regional centres is limited to adjacent municipalities within a distance of 25 km and other local governments should be considered as having peripheral significance.

R53|Public and private capital productivity in Russia: a non-parametric investigation|The productivity of public capital has been very popular research topic for US and other OECD countries, while studies using data from transitional countries are almost non-existent. In this paper, we analyze the productivity of public and private capital in Russia with parametric and non-parametric regression methods utilizing a unique regional level panel data from 2003 to 2007. More specifically, we assess public capital’s spillover effects, i.e., the productivity of public capital on private output, as well as the productivity of different capital ownership types on total output. We find that public capital has a clear positive effect on private output. However, our estimates and test statistics show that parametric methods are not able to grasp vast non-linearities and heterogeneity present among Russian regions, while the non-parametric approach can capture these important features of the data better. Furthermore, we find that multicollinearity is an important methodological problem which should be accounted for in analysis concerning capital data. Our results also suggest that the impact of public capital in Russia is heterogeneous in the sense that for some regions its contribution to private output is insignificant or even negative while it has a considerable positive role for most regions. Concerning the capital elasticities of total output, we find that public capital is less productive than private capital and roughly as productive as joint private-public capital.

R53|How big is the impact of infrastructure on trade? Evidence from meta-analysis|Low levels of infrastructure quality and quantity can create trade impediments through increased transport costs. Since the late 1990s an increasing number of trade studies have taken infrastructure into account. The purpose of the present paper is to quantify the importance of infrastructure for trade by means of meta-analysis and meta-regression techniques that synthesize various studies. The type of infrastructure that we focus on is mainly public infrastructure in transportation and communication. We examine the impact of infrastructure on trade by means of estimates obtained from 36 primary studies that yielded 542 infrastructure elasticities of trade. We explicitly take into account that infrastructure can be measured in various ways and that its impact depends on the location of the infrastructure. We estimate several meta-regression models that control for observed heterogeneity in terms of variation across different methodologies, infrastructure types, geographical areas and their economic features, model specifications, and publication characteristics. Additionally, random effects account for between-study unspecified heterogeneity, while publication bias is explicitly addressed by means of the Hedges model. After controlling for all these issues we find that a 1 per cent increase in own infrastructure increases exports by about 0.6 per cent and imports by about 0.3 per cent. Such elasticities are generally larger for developing countries, land infrastructure, IV or panel data estimation, and macro-level analyses. They also depend on the inclusion or exclusion of various common covariates in trade regressions
R53|Spatial Impact of Transportation Infrastructure: A Spatial Econometric CGE Approach|Transportation infrastructure plays an important role in regional economic development both in the stimulation of growth and as a response to output expansion. However, measuring these effects quantitatively has been a challenge due to the complicated impact mechanisms of transportation infrastructure. This complication is due to two reasons: first, regional impacts of transportation infrastructure are achieved through a mechanism that involves both a demand influence through the variation of transportation price and a supply influence implemented through the variation of transportation cost; second, impacts of transportation are usually evaluated in a regional context where the presence of unobserved local or regional variables may give rise to spatial autocorrelation. As a result, impact analysis may become biased and spurious. This study develops a new method called Spatial Econometric Computable General Equilibrium (SECGE) model, which integrates both spatial econometrics with equilibrium modeling techniques to improve the effectiveness of impact analysis on transportation infrastructure. This study differs from previous studies in the following three aspects: First, through a spatial autocorrelation test, the presence of spatial dependence is observed and confirmed among the elasticities of factor substitution in the US. To deal with spatial dependence, spatial panel econometric techniques are introduced to estimate the elasticity of factor substitution of different sectors for the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function with consideration of spatial direct and indirect effects. Second, transportation impact analysis is conducted under different scenarios of general equilibrium frameworks. Unlike partial equilibrium analysis, general equilibrium analysis allows researchers to obtain much comprehensive understanding of transportation infrastructure's impacts given its consideration of interactions between the demand and the supply. The study validates the method by comparing traditional equilibrium simulation without controlling for spatial dependence and the new equilibrium simulation with consideration of spatial dependence. The comparison allows researchers to justify spatial impacts of transportation infrastructure. Third, the study is conducted with a focus on multiple modes of transportation that includes road, rail, air, transit, pipeline and water transportation. Unlike a unimodal perspective, the perspective of multiple modes is essential to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the transportation infrastructure systems. It also enables us to compare impacts between different types of infrastructures and understand the relative importance of transportation investment by mode. The study confirms that the US highway and streets plays a dominant role among all transportation infrastructure systems in economic development while public transit and passenger transportation only plays the least important role among the systems. The result general equilibrium analysis also shows a difference between using spatial econometric estimates and traditional OLS estimates. Although the differences are relatively small in this aggregate case study, implications for more sensitive disaggregated regional models are clear.
R53|Efficiency Assessment of Regional Social and Demographic Process Management: Global Trends and Regional Specifics|The problem of management of regional social and demographic process becomes the most actual whereas its consideration through the lenses of global trends (small number of children in a nuclear family, higher life expectancy rate, objective ageing of the population). This population reproduction level is an irreversible consequence of the urbanization processes and entrance into the phase of postindustrial development. Nevertheless, this is not to say that management of regional social and demographic process is impossible. It indicates that there are limits of management opportunities. The irreversible nature of this change is more or less typical for all regions; however, it should not be reduced to a single direction of social and demographic change in the regions. Spatial differentiation and extremely unbalanced social and economic development of the Russian regions have a significant effect both on the social and demographic situation, and on the development of the respective management tools. The problem of management of regional social and demographic process lies in acceptance of the irreversible nature, and in taking into account of simultaneous impact of the global trends and regional specifics on social and demographic processes. In this connection, the research objective is identification of social and demographic processes which are in the social and demographic global trend line and its deviations that the efficiency of management of regional social and demographic process is assessed. This paper presents methodology for assessment of efficiency of the social and demographic processes management on a regional level. The methodology is based on indicative analysis techniques and procedures. Since the development of any management techniques recommendations should be based on a clear understanding of the nature of social and demographic processes in the region, this methodology also addresses the task of identification of social and demographic processes following the global reproduction of population trends, as well as any variations from these trends. In addition, for the purposes of assessing efficiency of management of social and demographic processes in the region, the authors recommend monitoring the amounts of financing of the socially significant budget items, which would provide a tool for rationalizing the investment requirements for the specific social and demographic projects. This paper presents the results of the methodology approbation in the Ural Federal District.
