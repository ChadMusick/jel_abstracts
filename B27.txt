B27|Blended Finance Funds and Facilities: 2018 Survey Results|The OECD Survey on Blended Finance Funds and Facilities represents a major step forward to consolidate evidence and provide further policy guidance in support of the OECD DAC Blended Finance Principles, whose focus is unlocking commercial finance for the Sustainable Development Goals.This working paper presents findings from the 2018 survey edition relating to the management, capital structure, investment strategy and portfolio allocation of the surveyed blended finance funds and facilities. The quantitative analysis is complemented by the OECD statistics on private finance mobilised by official development interventions and by information provided by Convergence. It will be followed by another OECD Development Co-operation working paper discussing the development strategy, performance tracking and evaluation approach.The 180 responses received illustrate to what extent blended finance funds and facilities vary widely in characteristics and functioning. Collectively, the managing organisations reported over USD 60.2 billion invested in 111 developing countries at the end of 2017. This new evidence confirms trends observed on the broader blended finance market (priority sectors, geographical coverage, targeted SDGs), while shedding light on additional aspects (e.g. investors, clients and investment instruments).
B27|Currency Unions|A currency union is when several independent sovereign nations share a common currency. This has been a recurring phenomenon in monetary history. In this article I study the theoretical foundations of such unions, and discuss some important currency unions in history, most notably the case of the US. Finally I contrast the design of the EMU with economic theories and historical experiences of currency unions.
B27|Discipline or external balance? The choice of international monetary systems in Europe|While there is a huge literature on exchange rate systems since the classical gold standard, less research has been devoted to comparisons of the different arguments that guided the choices. While the origin of the international gold standard in the 1870s was a result of silver coins disappearing from circulation due to rising silver prices, the gold standard has later been interpreted as a quest for monetary discipline. This discipline argument was introduced by the end of WWI as a support for a restoration of the gold standard. Its failure led to an emphasis on the need to avoid external imbalances, which came to the fore in the preparations of the Bretton Woods system. The balance argument was also central in the early discussions of a monetary union in Europe, but with the critique of Keynesianism it was superseded by the disciplinary argument which became determinant for the design of EMU.
B27|The Implications of Brexit for UK and EU Regional Competitiveness|Any form of Brexit will impact heterogeneously in terms of sectors and regions on the competitiveness of firms in both the UK and Europe. The ongoing uncertainty about the conditions under which the UK will be leaving the EU, creates difficulties in structurally estimating these impacts. Using uniquely-detailed interregional trade data on goods and services for the EU, we apply a novel methodology that disentangles region-sector sensitivities (elasticities) of firmsâ€™ competitiveness to (non)tariff barriers from the implications of different post-Brexit UK-EU trade scenarios. This enables us to derive the impact of Brexit on the competitiveness of firms along with the degree of uncertainty that surrounds these impacts, independently from the scenarios. Our analysis demonstrates that the adverse international competitiveness shocks on UK firms are much larger than those on the rest of the EU due to the dependency of the UK on the EU via global value chains. The competitiveness shocks mean that within the UK, Brexit is likely to increase both interregional inequalities and also intra-regional inequalities. In contrast interregional inequalities across Europe may actually fall, depending on the nature of the post-Brexit UK-EU trading arrangements.
B27|Efectos de la Ley Glass-Steagall en los mercados financieros: origen y derogación|La banca se ha posicionado como un pilar fundamental de las economías contemporáneas en tanto las regulaciones en este sector determinan no solo su rumbo sino también el de los demás sectores de la economía que se verán ampliamente influenciados. De esta forma, la Ley Glass-Steagall (LGS) se convierte en uno de los exponentes más importantes de la regulación bancaria. En el presente texto, se analiza la LGS y sus efectos sobre el sistema financiero. Para ello, se examina su origen,implementación y derogación. A partir de ello, se pondrá en tela de juicio su relevancia en los mercados financieros internacionales. Por medio de una exhaustiva revisión bibliográfica y una serie de análisis individuales, se concluye que la derogación de la LGS supuso un punto de inflexión en la normativa de regulación financiera y contribuyó al posterior desarrollo de las crisis financieras, tales como la crisis del 2007-2008. *** Banking has positioned itself as a fundamental pillar of contemporary economies as regulations in this sector determine not only its direction but also that of other sectors of the economy that will be widely influenced. In this way, the Glass-Steagall Act becomes one of the most important exponents of banking regulation. In this text, the GSA and its effects on the financial system are analyzed. To this end, its origin, implementation and repeal are examined. From which, its relevance in the international financial markets will be questioned. By means of an exhaustive bibliographical review and a series of individual analyses, it is concluded that the repeal of the LGSwas a turning point in financial regulation regulations and contributed to the subsequent development of financial crises, such as the 2007-2008 crisis.
B27|Keynes on the Sequencing of Economic Policy: Recovery and Reform in 1933|On December 31 1933, The New York Times published an open letter from John Maynard Keynes to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In it Keynes encouraged FDR to expand public works through government borrowing. He also criticized FDR’s exchange rate policy, and argued that there was a need for lower long-term interest rates. But perhaps the most interesting feature of this letter is that Keynes made comments on the sequencing and speed of economic policies. He argued that “recovery” policies should precede “reform” measures. In this paper I analyze this particular aspect of the open letter, and I argue that for Keynes exchange rate stability was a key component of what he considered to be the appropriate order of policy. I also provide a comparison between Keynes’s views on sequencing and those developed in the 1980s and 1990s.
B27|International Monetary Relations: Taking Finance Seriously|In this essay, we highlight the interactions of the international monetary system with financial conditions, not just with the output, inflation, and balance of payments goals usually discussed. We review how financial conditions and outright financial crises have posed difficulties for each of the main international monetary systems in the last 150 years or so: the gold standard, the interwar period, the Bretton Woods system, and the current system of floating exchange rates. We argue that even as the world economy has evolved and sentiments have shifted among widely different policy regimes, there remain three fundamental challenges for any international monetary and financial system: How should exchange rates between national currencies be determined? How can countries with balance of payments deficits reduce these without sharply contracting their economies and with minimal risk of possible negative spillovers abroad? How can the international system ensure that countries have access to an adequate supply of international liquidity—financial resources generally acceptable to foreigners in all circumstances? In concluding, we evaluate how the current international monetary system answers these questions.
B27|Exploring Links between FDI Inflows, Energy Consumption, and Economic Growth: Further Evidence from MENA Countries|This study aims to examine the nexus between economic growth, FDI inflows and energy consumption on a panel of 17 countries using a ¡®growth model¡¯ framework and simultaneous-equation models estimated by the generalized method of moments (GMM) over the 1990-2012 period. We also implement these empirical models for 17 countries selected on the basis of data availability. They include: (a) 12 Middle Eastern countries, namely: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Lebanon, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Syria, Jordan and Yemen, (b) 5 North African countries, namely: Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Libya. Our results indicate that there is a bidirectional causal relationship between FDI inflows and economic growth, as between well as energy consumption and economic growth. Besides, there is a unidirectional causal relationship between energy consumption to FDI inflows for the global panel. This implies that the increase of energy consumption increases the FDI inflows for individual and collective countries.
B27|Structural analysis of foreign trade of Romania|In this paper, the authors study the evolution of Romania’s foreign trade during the recent period. There are used relevant indicators for the purpose of the research, such as the value of FOB exports, CIF imports, the foreign trade balance, its result, the coverage degree of imports by exports, formation of fixed capital through the contribution of foreign capital, structure of imports and exports. As part of the research, the evolution of the international trade depending on the partner countries is approached.
B27|The Interdependence of Monetary and Macroprudential Policy under the Zero Lower Bound|This paper considers the interdependence of monetary and macroprudential policy in a New Keynesian business cycle model under the zero lower bound constraint. Entrepreneurs borrow in nominal terms from banks and are subject to idiosyncratic default risk. The realized loan return to the bank varies with aggregate risk, such that bank balance sheets are affected by higher-than-expected rm defaults. Monetary and macroprudential policies are given by an interest rate rule and a capital requirement rule, respectively. We first characterize the model's stability properties under different steady state policies. We then analyze the transmission of a risk shock under the zero lower bound and different macroprudential policies. We finally investigate whether these policies are indeed optimal.
B27|The European Payments Union and the origins of Triffin’s regional approach towards international monetary integration|Robert Triffin (1911-1993) played an important role in the international monetary debates in the postwar period. He was known as one of the main advocates of a multipolar international monetary system. In this paper we analyse the origins of riffin’s “regional” approach towards international monetary integration. We argue that Triffin’s experience with the European Payments Union (EPU)played hereby a crucial role. Triffin was not only an “architect” of the EPU, but the EPU also led to an important shift in Triffin’s view of the geography of the international monetary system. Before his work on the EPU, Triffin thought of the international economy as composed of two geographical entities: national economies and the world economy. With his work on the EPU he introduced a third geographical entity: the region. The EPU would so be at the basis of Triffin’s advocacy of a regional approach towards international monetary integration. Moreover, while Triffin was initially quite positive on the IMF, he became, through his EPU experience, more critical of the IMF and its worldwide approach.
B27|The Analysis of International Trade of Romania|In this paper, the authors develop a complex analysis, from multiple viewpoints, of the international trade of Romania. The study covers the recent evolutions in this sector, the contribution of foreign partners to the achievement of the results recorded, measured by relevant indicators, the dynamics of the financial balance of the foreign trade. A special attention was given to the geographical dimension of the analysis, as the outcomes of the Intra-EU and Extra-EU trade were presented and discussed
