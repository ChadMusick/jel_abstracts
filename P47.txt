P47|The Economic Analysis of Populism. A Selective Review of the Literature|Economic analysis is essential to the understanding of the rise and fall of populism. The conceptual and analytical framework of economics to the study of populism is still in its infancy, but great advances have been made in recent years. This paper reviews some key contributions behind this progress. When analyzing populism, economists face two methodological hurdles: lack of consensus and clarity about its definition and reconciling the populist vote with voter rationality. The former has plagued sociologists and political scientists for decades. As to the latter, it raises a conundrum: if populist policies are detrimental to economic growth, as most economists agree, the vote for a populist candidate suggests some irrationality or inefficiency in the political markets. But accepting that individuals are irrational when making political decisions, would imply that they are irrational when making economic decisions unless, of course, there is something fundamentally different about political markets. The works reviewed in this paper propose alternative approaches to address these issues. The most promising line of research in the economic analysis of populism incorporates and expands concepts developed by academics in other social sciences such as political theory, sociology, history and social psychology.
P47|What Drives the Institutionalization of Performance Measurement Systems in Indonesian Local Government?|Objective – The objective of this paper is to explore and understand the motivators of institutionalization of Performance Measurement Systems (PMS) in the Indonesian Local Government (ILG), particularly in the Batu municipality presenting the performance paradoxes. Performance accountability issues have been encouraging the Batu municipality to implement PMS since the beginning of the 2000s. Methodology/Technique – The theoretical framework and interpretation of this study are adopted from the institutional theory (coercive, mimetic, normative, and allomorphism) which is used to analyze the phenomenon. The researchers employ a single case study to scrutinize the motivators of institutionalization by elaborating on document analysis conducted from the interviews of 10 employees in a different range of management levels (top, middle, and lower). Findings – The results of this study reveal that exogenous (coercive, mimetic and normative) and endogenous (allomorphism) drivers encourage the institutionalization of PMS in the Batu municipality with coercive pressure as a major driver and allomorphism as a mere ceremonial driver (rather than an instrument). Novelty – The practical implications of this study can be used to improve the PMS process and the quality of performance reporting in the Batu municipality and in other local governments. This paper is also expected to fill the gap in existing literature on the implementation of PMS within a developing country (in this case, Indonesia). Type of Paper: Empirical Paper.
P47|A new societal contract|"This paper argues that the traditional societal contract that underlies the market economy has run its course and needs to be replaced by a new contract, based on a new conception of the ""empowering economy."" Whereas different societal contracts are relevant to different societies, there must be some features that all societal contracts will have in common, in order to address some basic human needs that every thriving society must satisfy and to promote popular approval for multilateral agreements to address multilateral problems. The paper proposes a new societal contract that promotes three building blocks of economic policies: (1) automatic stabilizers that reduce inequalities of economic power, (2) policies that focus not just on material prosperity, but also on personal and social empowerment and (3) policies that develop the human capabilities of cooperation and innovation."
P47|Democratic development and credit : “Democracy doesn`t come Cheap” But at least credit to its corporations will be|Does democratization reduce the cost of credit? Using global syndicated loan data from 1984 to 2014, we find that democratization has a sizeable negative effect on loan spreads: a one-point increase in the zero-to-ten Polity IV index of democracy shaves at least 19 basis points off spreads, but likely more. Reversals to autocracy hike spreads more strongly. Our findings are robust to the comprehensive inclusion of relevant controls, to the instrumentation with regional waves of democratization, and to a battery of other sensitivity tests. We thus highlight the lower cost of loans as one relevant mechanism through which democratization can affect economic development.
P47|Directed Technical Change in Clean Energy: Evidence from the Solar Industry|This paper studies directed technical change and innovation in renewable energy. We construct panel data with micro- and macro observations from nearly 200 countries over a 20-year period and estimate how energy prices, government subsidies, financial markets, spillovers, and path dependence affect patenting in solar thermal and solar cells. Carbon taxes, R&D subsidies to solar technology and own-knowledge stocks have strong, significant positive effects on solar innovations. Subsidies to fossil energy have the adverse effect. We find no compelling evidence that the quality of financial markets and institutions has any consistent impact on the patenting activities of innovators in solar energy.
P47|The influence of emotional intelligence on the performance of health department officers of Deli Serdang regency|Employee performance is the responsibility of employees to their work and the results achieved by the employees in performing the job given to them either in quantity or quality within a certain time. The goals of employee performance are to adjust employee expectation with organizational goals. Incompatibility between efforts to achieve employee performance goals with organizational goals will result in poor performance. Employee performance is influenced by internal and external factors. One of the internal factors that affect employee performance is emotional intelligence. This research analyzed the influence of emotional intelligence which consists of self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills on the performance of the Officer of Health Department of Deli Serdang Regency, North Sumatera, Indonesia. The type of this research was causal research with cross-sectional study design. The subjects of this research were Civil Servants working in the Health Department of Deli Serdang Regency who occupied operative positions or staff of 100 people. The sampling used data were collected through interviews, questionnaires distribution and literature study. The data were analyzed using a multiple linear regression model, hypothesis and testing was done by using T-test and F-test. This research was conducted at the Health Department of Deli Serdang Regency, North Sumatera Province, Indonesia. The result showed that emotional intelligence which had a significant influence on the performance of Health Service Officers of Deli Serdang Regency was motivation and social skill. The results of the T-test showed that the emotional intelligence: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills simultaneously had a positive influence on the performance of the Health Department officers of Deli Serdang Regency. The results of the -test concluded that emotional intelligence: motivation and social skills had a positive and significant influence on the performance of the Health Department officers of Deli Serdang Regency. Emotional intelligence consisting of self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills had a positive and significant influence on the performance improvement of the Health Department officers of Deli Serdang Regency. The higher the emotional intelligence of the Health Department officers of Deli Serdang Regency, the better the employee performance, the lower the emotional intelligence, the lower the performance of the employees.
P47|Assessment of the State of Implementation of Excellence Model Common Assessment Framework (CAF) 2013 by the National Institutes of Research – Development – Innovation in Romania|The paper highlights the part of the results of a research based on a questionnaire conducted at the National Institutes for Research, Development and Innovation (NIRDI) of Romania, under the coordination, under the authority or the subordination of the National Agency for Scientific Research and Innovation (NASRI), goals being pursued: Assess the current status of implementation of the Common model of excellence Self-Assessment framework (CAF) in 2013 by NIRDI in Romania; Determining the impact that the implementation of one or more management systems has on achieving excellence in research and innovation; Capacity assessment CAF 2013 model of excellence to provide enlightening information on the most important risks and challenges facing the entity being (self-) evaluation. The research was conducted in July 2016 to a representative sample of 51 of the 53 INCDI, under the coordination, under the authority or subordinate NASRI. It appears that although there is a high degree of fulfillment of the 9 criteria of the excellence model CAF 2013 NIRDI have not assimilated the spirit and the purpose of the excellence model induced by the principles of total quality management by importance (percentage) given to each criterion and sub-criterion. It appears real progress criteria results on customers and processes, products and services. At the same time there are serious shortcomings in the criteria results on the organization and results on the staff. On the one hand, based on the results analyzed, it was determined that to achieve excellence in research is not sufficient to implement two or more management systems, on the other hand it was confirmed that the results of (self-) evaluation stage of implementation of the model of excellence CAF 2013 provides significant and enlightening information to identify the principal risks and deficiencies faced by the entity (self) assessed.
P47|The Political Economy of Opposition Groups: Peace, Terrorism, or Civil Conflict|This paper proposes a simple framework to better understand an opposition group’s choice between peace, terrorism, and open civil conflict against the government. Our model implies that terrorism emerges if constraints on the ruling executive group are intermediate and rents are sizeable, whereas conflict looms under poor executive constraints. Analyzing annual data for up to 158 countries in a panel setting provides evidence consistent with these hypotheses. The results emerge both when considering the incidence and onset of terrorism and conflict. The corresponding magnitudes are economically sizeable. Overall, these findings can help us understand and anticipate the choices of opposition groups.

P47|Mind the Gap: Analyzing the Impact of Data Gap in Millennium Development Goals’ (MDGs) Indicators on the Progress toward MDGs|This paper analyzes the impact of data gap in Millennium Development Goals’ (MDGs) performance indicators on actual performance success of MDGs. Performance success, within the MDG framework, is quantified using six different ways proposed in the existing literature, including both absolute and relative performance and deviation from historical transition paths of MDG indicators. The empirical analysis clearly shows that the data gap in performance measurement is a significant predictor of poor MDG performance in terms of any of the six progress measures. Larger the data gap or weaker the performance measurement system, lesser is the probability of MDG performance success. The empirical methodology used in the paper combines a Heckman correction and instrumental variable estimation strategies to simultaneously account for potential endogeneity of the key data gap variable and bias due to sample selection. This result holds true even after controlling for overall national statistical capacity and a variety of socioeconomic factors. The paper underlines the need to strengthen the performance measurement system attached to the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the associated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper is the first attempt at empirically evaluating the value of data in the context of international development goals and gives empirical evidence for the need to harness the “data revolution” for sustainable development.
P47|Local institutional structure and clientelistic access to employment: the case of MGNREGS in three states of India|This work is a contribution, first, toward measuring and characterizing some features of rural clientelistic institutions and then toward exploring its impact on household access to an employment scheme (MGNREGS programme in India). We focus on patron-client relationship and the presence and intensity of that- i.e., on the nature and distribution of power in the rural society based on the data on personalized day-to-day interactions of the households residing in a village in economic, social and political spheres. We formulate a theoretical model to predict that the patrons use MGNREGS employment to secure political support of their respective clients. Using primary data that we collected from 36 sample villages in the states of Maharashtra, Orissa and (Eastern) Uttar Pradesh in India we (i) identify the presence of patron-client relationships with varying intensity, (ii) show that clients of elites have better access to MGNREGS employment than non-clients and (iii) a household in an elite village (i.e., a village where patron-client relationship is present), on average, has higher access to MGNREGS employment than a household in a nonelite village.
P47|Analysis of Public Subsidies to the Solar Energy Sector: Corruption and the Role of Institutions|This study investigates the connection between rent-seeking behaviour, corruption activity and quality of institutions to empirically evaluate the unexpected implications of an energy policy for criminal activity. The object of this research is a program of public subsidies introduced in Italy in 2005, which successfully boosted the solar energy sector but seems to have generated a growth of corruption activity, arisen from the opportunity of rent extraction. In particular, according to the main hypothesis of this research, bribery is expected to rise significantly where big photovoltaic plants are concentrated and administrative procedures are more complicated. To determine the causal effect of the subsidies on corruption, the study employs a Difference-in-Difference methodology on a sample of 76 Italian provinces and exploits solar radiation as exogenous variable to discriminate the profitability of investments and bribing. Results confirm that, in poor-institutions areas, the growth of the solar sector in sunniest provinces has gone hand in hand with increasing corruption. Results suggest that policy makers should pay additional attention to the potential distortions of public policies implying large rent opportunities, in areas where the weakness of institutional settings and the bureaucratic complexities encourage illegal behaviour.
P47|Employment, Education and the State|The 2016 India Employment Report demolishes the myths of both `demographic dividend' and `jobless growth' in the India growth story. But it recognises that the growth of decent, productive employment is too slow even to absorb the annual increment of new workers in the workforce, let alone eliminate the huge backlog of open unemployment and low productivity underemployment. This paper argues that this challenge is a man-made problem, the consequence of a range of dysfunctional policies that have a strong anti-employment bias. Moreover, a long standing elitist bias in education policy has pre-empted the provision of quality basic education without which the bulk of the workforce cannot be suitably skilled for decent, productive employment. The paper suggests that these dysfunctional policies are attributable to a fractionalized polity and India's soft state, which stands in sharp contrast to the hard states seen in the dramatically successful East Asian model of guided capitalism.
P47|Effects of ISO 9001 on Non-Financial and Financial Performance in the Organizations: A Review|The main purpose of this paper was to specify the impact of ISO 9001 on financial and non-financial performance. For this aim, a comprehensive literature review was carried out on the scholarly published studies, which investigated empirically the effects of ISO 9001 standard on the organization's performance in different sectors. Subsequently, the ISO 9001 studies identified and selected carefully that were relevant to the objectives and criteria of the study with the aim of achieving the results and making conclusions. The analysis of the results of the empirical studies uncovered that ISO 9001 significantly affected production process (internal business process), while this standard was not correlated with the indicators of innovation and learning perspective at significant level. Furthermore, the systematic review of the existing literature provided enough evidence that the effectiveness of ISO 9001 on customer's results and financial performance were unclear and contradictory.
P47|Seven Basic Tools of Quality Control: An Appropriate Tools for Solving Quality Problems in the Organizations|Dr. Kaoru Ishikawa was first total quality management guru, who has been associated with the development and advocacy of using the seven quality control (QC) tools in the organizations for problem solving and process improvements. Seven old quality control tools are a set of the QC tools that can be used for improving the performance of the production processes, from the first step of producing a product or service to the last stage of production. So, the general purpose of this paper was to introduce these 7 QC tools. This study found that these tools have the significant roles to monitor, obtain, analyze data for detecting and solving the problems of production processes, in order to facilitate the achievement of performance excellence in the organizations.
P47|Reconsidering Communication Regarding Economic Phenomena. Some Hints from a Complexity Approach|This paper, inspired by the notion of complexity and the use of network analysis, is presented as a short survey on communication in economics when it is addressed to people who approach the subject neither for study nor for professional purposes. Their perception of the economic system has also been shaped by events interpreted by opinion and political leaders. Its main contribution is an attempt to avoid current misunderstandings arising from a mechanical notion of the economic system and a consequent excess of confidence in what political economy can do in pursuing welfare. To do this, after a brief review of useful perceptions of phenomena both at system level and at firm level, we will propose some hints arising from complexity and network theory for an alternative viewpoint on political prescriptions and for a better appreciation of the entrepreneurial function. At the end, we will conclude with some teaching suggestions along with final remarks about understanding economics.
P47|The need to customise innovation indicators in developing countries|Innovation is becoming more and more important as a driver of economic growth. In developed countries, a diverse set of innovation indicators has been developed to monitor innovation performance and the impact of innovation policies. Developing countries have been late to jump on this bandwagon and are now faced with a set of well-established innovation indicators that might not be that well suited to measure innovation in their economies. Existing innovation indicators can be broadly classified into three different types: Science & Technology (S&T) indicators, Innovation survey indicators, and Composite innovation indicators combining different indicators, including S&T and Innovation survey data, into one indicator. All of these have their own particular strengths and weaknesses, and they score above or below average on a wide range of attributes considered to be favourable, if not downright necessary, for innovation indicators. This paper argues that, for innovation indicators, and for innovation survey indicators in particular, data collection has to be customised to the different socio-economic structures of developing countries. For this, the definition of innovation has to become more inclusive by recognising the multitude of innovation actors and processes in developing countries. Developing countries also need to build competence regarding innovation indicators, not only within their statistical systems but also among their policy makers.

P47|The outcomes of 25 years of agricultural reforms in Kyrgyzstan<BR>[Die Ergebnisse von 25 Jahren landwirtschaftlicher Reformen in Kirgistan]|Kyrgyz agriculture experienced substantial reform during the 1990s and early 2000s. Subsequently, the pace of reform slowed and at present the government does not appear to have any clear strategy for further development in the sector. Summarizing the outcomes of these reforms, a certain freedom granted to farmers stands out as one of the main achievements and an important reason for the sector's efficiency. Peasant farms are effectively protected from attempts to administratively regulate crop structure or introduce any other types of market distortions. However, an insufficient level of investments is undermining long-term prospects for development in the sector. Supporting large professional players in the sector is one of the key policy priorities of the government. It is however necessary to provide space for these enterprises to emerge on their own. It is additionally important to ensure that any support policies in favor of such players also provide positive spillovers to the small farmers around them, and do not aim at replacing them mechanically. The list of incomplete policy reforms is very long, especially in the area of natural resource management and provision of other essential public goods. The state of pastures and irrigation systems is alarming and requires government support well above its current level. Understanding the key areas for government intervention and focusing interventions on public goods provision should be the key components of a future agricultural development strategy.
P47|Текущая Роль Производственных И Обслуживающих Кооперативов В Сельском Хозяйстве Южного Казахстана<BR>[Current role of production and service cooperatives in agriculture in southern Kazakhstan]|Перед агропромышленным комплексом Казахстана стоят кардинальные задачи по устойчивому развитию и наращиванию сельскохозяйственного производства, увеличению выпуска экспортоориентированной, конкурентоспособной продукции и обеспечению продовольственной безопасности страны. Сегодня для решения поставленных задач перед АПК страны принята Государственная программа развития АПК на 2017–2021 годы и внедряются в производство новые Законы «О сельскохозяйственных кооперативах», «О пастбищах» и др. Особое внимание в этих документах уделяется созданию крупных товарных хозяйств на основе кооперации. Анализ современного состояния развития сельского хозяйства в республике показал, что мелкие крестьянские хозяйства, состоящие из одной семьи или из группы людей, слабо оснащенные материально-техническими средствами, в одиночестве без объединений общих сил не в состоянии вести расширенное производство и установить межотраслевые связи в процессе производства и переработки. Эти хозяйства не в состоянии самостоятельно решать проблемы повышения конкурентоспособности производимой ими продукции, внедрения инноваций, поставок безопасных для здоровья населения продуктов питания и лишены возможности получать услуги высококвалифицированных специалистов. Основными сдерживающими факторами развития кооперативного движения в республике являются недостаточные меры государственной поддержки сельского хозяйства, кадрового обеспечения, несовершенство правого законодательства, налогообложения и отсутствие механизмов организации взаимоотношений внутри кооператива. Для реализации поставленных выше задач перед АПК страны, необходимо объединить мелкие крестьянские хозяйства в крупные сельскохозяйственные кооперативы по производству, переработке, хранению, транспортировке и сбыту сельскохозяйственной продукции.
P47|Neoliberalism, Urbanization and Change in Africa|"In the much of the popular media, the discourse around Africa has changed. Whereas stories of the ""coming anarchy"" or the ""hopeless continent"" abounded a little over a decade ago, it was, until the recent collapse in commodity prices, increasingly seen as the final global investment frontier, with rapid uptake of cellular technology and economic growth. Although much of this growth has been propelled by natural resources, the current conjuncture offers opportunities as well as challenges for African urban areas and raises questions about the role of cities in the continent's future development as they continue to become more deeply informalised. The response of many city authorities to the deepening informalisation of their economies has been to try to connect to the global economy in new ways, through the creation of new financial service, high-tech and elite residential areas. In this paper we explore these developments through the Foucaudian lens of heterotopia. These new developments attempt to erase their associations with the cities from which they originate in favour of new connections outwards. However the creation of these new enclaves is filled with socio-spatial contradictions, which make them unlikely to achieve their ostensible objectives."
P47|Stochastic Techno-Economic Analysis of Alcohol-to-Jet Fuel Production| This study assesses the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) biofuel production pathway for three biomass feedstocks, and advances existing techno-economic analyses (TEA) of biofuels in three ways. First, we incorporate technical uncertainty for all by-products and co-products though statistical linkages between conversion efficiencies and input and output levels. Second, future price uncertainty is based on case-by-case time-series estimation. Third, breakeven price distributions are developed to present profitability at each price level. The stochastic dominance results show that sugarcane is the lowest cost feedstock over the entire range of uncertainty, followed by corn grain and switchgrass, with the mean breakeven jet fuel prices being $0.96/liter ($3.65/gal), $1.01/liter ($3.84/gal), and $1.38/liter ($5.21/gal), respectively. With a 75% profitability level, the breakeven prices for corn grain, sugarcane and switchgrass become $1.07/liter ($4.05/gal), $1.05/liter ($3.97/gal), and $1.53/liter ($5.81/gal), respectively. Sensitivity analyses show that technical uncertainty significantly impacts breakeven prices and NPV distributions.
P47|Conspicuous Consumption and Darwin's Critical Sexual Selection Dynamic That Thorstein Veblen Missed|" Thorstein Veblen's theory of conspicuous consumption is one of his most powerful contributions to social science. Conspicuous consumption is undertaken in an attempt to maintain or increase social standing. But why do humans seek to acquire status through their consumption practices? Or more fundamentally, why do they seek status? Veblen does not present it as grounded in an instinct such as his instincts of parental bent, workmanship or idle curiosity, although he claims that ""the propensity for emulation is probably the strongest and most alert and persistent of the economic motives properâ€¦ a pervading trait of human nature."" But why? Had he read Darwin, or read him more carefully, he would have picked up on Darwin's concept of sexual selection and recognized it as the driving force behind conspicuous consumption as well as much other behavior intended to favorably impress others, if not the driving force behind all of his instincts. Sexual selection is a form of natural selection that works through mate selection as opposed to physical survival. How much an individual can consume signals an ability to command resources essential for successfully raising children. This article adds the Darwinian depth that Veblen missed to his important concept of conspicuous consumption, and in doing so adds clarity to humanity's prospects."

P47|Sukuk Issuance in China: Trends and Positive Expectations|The paper assesses the potential and importance of Sukuk issuance in China. The research proposes that Sukuk can be used as an alternative financing instrument to materialize the “One Belt One road (OBOR)” strategy. Hong Kong as a gateway of China had launched two Sukuks in 2014 and 2015 respectively. This paper analyzes the two sovereign Sukuk issuances out of Hong Kong in the last 3 years. Meanwhile, by conducting un-structured interviews of the potential issuers and related scholars, it is found that Sukuk issuance in China will face some challenges such as policies and regulations of Sukuk, tax and stamp duty issues, investors’ protection, establishing of Shariah Supervisory Committee, etc. However “OBOR” initiative provides the best opportunity for Sukuk to move forward in China.
P47|Statehood, democracy and preindustrial development|This paper proposes a growth model linking state history to economic development. It considers three state systems: non-statehood, authoritarian statehood, and democratic statehood. These differ in the way a public good is provided, which in turn determines growth rates. Under certain assumptions, democratic states grow faster than authoritarian ones, which in turn grow faster than non-states. All societies start with non-statehood and transition into authoritarian statehood at some point, but the timing is random. When later given the opportunity, only those societies that transitioned relatively recently to authoritarian statehood transition to democracy. When they do, they begin to grow faster, eventually overtaking older and still authoritarian states. This generates an inversely U-shaped cross-sectional relationship between development and state history consistent with modern cross-country data.
P47|Estructuras económicas y tendencias del Crecimiento Real en Bolivia, 1980-2015|En este trabajo se describe la estructura económica de Bolivia a lo largo del período trimestral que abarca desde 1980 al 2015, mediante el uso de los momentos estadísticos; a la vez de puntualizar los acontecimientos que influyeron en el comportamiento del producto interno bruto a nivel consolidado y sectorial. Este análisis comprende el crecimiento sectorial y la magnitud en que éstos participan en el producto interno bruto (Pib). En consecuencia, se deduce la capacidad de las políticas públicas para fortalecer los sectores que presentan mayor relación o asociación con el crecimiento de la economía. Los resultados indican que en Bolivia dos sectores que evidenciaron mayor crecimiento (petróleo-gas y electricidad-agua), son los que menos aportaron a la composición del Pib. Por otra parte, el sector de mayor participación en la economía (manufactura), fue el que mostró menor crecimiento sectorial. A su vez, todos los sectores ejercieron una participación entorno a su promedio, excepto la contribución relativa de la administración pública –sin condición estadística de normalidad- para el período abordado.
P47|Global Energy Trends and Their Implications for Russia: A Pathway to the New Energy Wave|Despite the success of many countries in increasing energy saving and energy efficiency, the global energy consumption is expected to continue its growth. The main reasons are economic development and population growth happening primarily in developing and emerging economies, especially in India and China. In such circumstances fossil fuels will remain the dominant energy source in the medium and even long run. The present research paper aims at analyzing the current global trends in the energy sector identified through literature review and expert tools, and their influence on Russia. Considering a broad range of factors, the paper determined the following main challenges for the Russian energy sector: tightening competition at international energy markets, the need for comprehensive modernization and stronger energy efficiency measures, the need for technological catch-up in a number of energy sector segments, the need to increase recovery factor at traditional oilfields, and the need to diversify energy mix by increasing the share of renewables. The paper also considers the main rationale for the last challenge that include strengthened security, reliability and sustainability of the Russian energy sector. Among the key preconditions for advancements in renewable energy are improvements in investment climate, modernisation of the central grid and changes in energy policy. The paper is based on the outcomes of the first stage of the Foresight project devoted to renewable energy technologies
P47|Peace, Terrorism, or Civil Conflict? Understanding the Decision of an Opposition Group|When do opposition groups decide to mount a terrorism campaign and when do they enter an open civil conflict against the ruling government? This paper models an opposition group's choice between peace, terrorism, and open conflict. Terrorism emerges if executive constraints are intermediate and rents are sizeable. Open conflict is predicted to emerge under poor executive constraints. Analyzing country-level panel data firmly supports these hypotheses, even when relying on within-country variation only in a fixed-effects framework. In particular, both the incidence of terrorism and the likelihood of terrorism onset increase under intermediate executive constraints (following an inverted U-shape) and if large rents are available from natural resources, oil, or foreign development assistance. A one-standard-deviation increase in rents raises casualties by approximately 15 percentage points. Related to civil conflict, moving from an authoritarian regime to comprehensive executive constraints is associated with a decrease in the number of battle-related deaths by approximately 74 percentage points. These findings can help us to better understand and anticipate the underlying decision of opposition groups and their choice between peace, a terrorism campaign, and open conflict.
P47|Social Obstacles to Technology, Technological Change, and the Economic Growth of African Countries: Some Anecdotal Evidence from Economic History|This paper comments on a number of social obstacles to the economic growth and technological change of African economies from the perspective of economic history. Economic history is full of evidence about what held African economies back for years. Some obstacles are of domestic origin such as excessive consumption and luxury masqueraded as public investment. Other obstacles were imposed from outside such as the destruction and weakening of traditional African religions and religious leadership as well as other wide ranging institutions. The combined effects can be summed up in one word: de-institutionalization. De-institutionalization devalued local knowledge (technology) thereby reducing performance. It is not possible to turn the clock back, but current policy is better-off bringing these obstacles into discussion as they stand a good chance of lowering the socalled “Africa dummy” variable common to growth regressions. Future research would also benefit if it sought to adjust conventional economic theory to allow space for the special features of African economies. Market theory is misleading in treating private use rights as antithetical to private ownership rights. For example, the suggestion that land tenure in Africa is anti-growth is inconsistent with the spectacular growth China has experienced even without private property rights.
P47|The Balance of Economics and Political Science in Islamic Political Economy|The purpose of this paper is to investigate the balance of economics and political science in Islamic political economy. The economic science here refers to economics value based on Islamic teaching, while political science refers to political value based on Islam. Whereas Islamic political science is a field that evaluates the interaction between the Islamic economy and politics as well as the implication of the influences of one field on the other.Beyond this assessment, between the economic and political value, which one is more influential in Islamic political economy? To date, most scholars are inclined towards the influence of their respective field. For those in economic field, the focus of Islamic political economy is mostly directed towards economic value rather than political value.Similarly, those who are in politics will be more inclined towards the political value rather than economic.Thus, which of the political or economic value should be made priority in Islamic political economy? Based on literature review and textual analysis, this paper will firstly, re-evaluate the issue where it is perceived that Islamic political economy does not necessarily need to focus on both political and economic value; secondly, analyse the extent to which the economic and political values are needed in Islamic political economy; and thirdly, summarise the option between the economic and political value in Islamic political economy in order to achieve a holistic field of study in overcoming problems and presenting solution for the political economy of the Ummah (Islamic nation).
P47|Identità nazionale e globalizzazione. il caso italiano|The world is again undergoing a great transformation which is affecting national identities. The market economy and information technology are now linking the entire planet in an unprecedented way. New trade circuits, no longer under the control of public authorities, are altering local cultures. Traditional institutions like the state, religious organizations, political parties, the family and even the ways of making a living are changing everywhere. Some countries are losing inhabitants while others are gaining them. Some countries are rising in international ranking tables; others are losing ground. Italy is in an intermediate position. It is higher than other countries in some fields and is backward in others, but stands out for its resilience. Italy encompasses conflicting attitudes which is probably because it was a nation long before being politically united. Some of its fundamental features can be traced back many centuries and have not been entirely modified by time. Deeply rooted values like family, its economic self-sufficiency and its social distinction are very ancient. In the same way, blood-ties, corporative bonds, territorial differences and the state weakness are firmly established and distinctive characters coming from the past. Not surprisingly suggestions for present day situation show similarity to a literature dating back two hundred and fifty years, to the time before Italy was politically unified.
P47|The role of IMF in Pakistanâ€™s economy|This study examines â€œThe role of IMF in the economy of Pakistanâ€ over the period of 1974 to 2013.The results of the auto regressive distributed lag (ARDL)model has been used for examining the cointegration among the variables of the model and vector error correction model is used for short run dynamics of the models. ARDL bound testing approach show that there is cointegration among the variables of the model. The long run results show that the coefficient of GDP and political instability have negative and insignificant relationship with government borrowing. There is negative and significant relationship between IMF charges and government borrowing. Exchange rate has positive and significant relationship with government borrowing. Political instability is treated as dummy variable in model.
P47|Research Trends on Zakāh in Western Literature|This study explores research trends in Western literature about Zakāh, which is considered to be an equivalent, to a certain degree, to a charity in the Christian tradition. The study is based on a sample of considerable studies in English and French, collected over a period of eighty one years (1934-2015). The preliminary results highlight three important implications. These are: (1) the multiplicity and the diversity of the conceptualization of Zakāh beyond the purely moral, juristic, discursive and literalistic approaches which seem to be dominating research trends in the Arab-Muslim world; (2) the predominance of theoretical studies over applied ones. (3) Zakāh as a valuable resource is perceived; according to some treatises as an instrument of power from the geo-economics view-point.

P47|Сельскохозяйственная Политика В Производстве Пшеницы И Диверсификации Производства Сельскохозяйственных Культур В Узбекистане<BR>[Agricultural policy in wheat production and crop diversification in Uzbekistan]|В период независимого развития в Узбекистане производство пшеницы достигло восьмикратного роста, в то время как ее посевные площади увеличились почти в три раза. Рост валовых показателей не привел к улучшению качества пшеницы и повышению рентабельности ее производства для фермерских хозяйств. Существующая арендная система землепользователя перегружена дополнительными обязательствами для арендаторов, что снижает их мотивацию. При этом надо иметь в виду, что официальная статистика по производству пшеницы не достоверна. Главный вопрос для сельского хозяйства Узбекистана не в том, какая форма организации сельскохозяйственного производства лучше и не в размерах земельных участков, а в механизме закупок сельскохозяйственной продукции для государственных нужд и гарантиях прав собственности для субъектов сельскохозяйственного производства. Реформы в системе обязательного государственного заказа по хлопку и пшенице могли бы повысить стимулы к эффективному землепользованию у фермеров и расширить их возможности по диверсификации производства за счет увеличения посевов альтернативных культур (плодоовощные, кормовые и пр.), и тем самым увеличить экспортный потенциал сельскохозяйственного сектора.
P47|Опыт Сельскохозяйственной Реструктуризации В Туркменистане<BR>[Agricultural restructuring in Turkmenistan]|Данный отчет представляет основные моменты земельной реформы и аграрной реструктуризации в Туркменистане. В первой части отчета основное внимание уделяется описанию хода аграрной реформы с представлением хронологии основных осуществленных мер аграрной политики, а также рассмотрена организация поставки материалов и ресурсов в сельскохозяйственное производство. Центральная часть отчета отведена на описание изменений в структуре посевов, а также динамики развития различных категорий сельскохозяйственных производителей и их вклад в развитие аграрного сектора и продовольственной безопасности страны. Как показывает исследование, земельная реформа и аграрная реструктуризация в стране в целом проводились со значительными функциями государства в регулировании этих процессов. На основе реформирования сельского хозяйства за период с 1992-2013 гг. общая посевная площадь в стране возросла на 25 %, в то время как, крестьянские объединения остаются основной категорией в сфере производства сельскохозяйственной продукции, базирующейся на арендной системе земледелие с целью выполнения государственного заказа стратегических культур.

P47|Resolving Insolvency Management: Competitiveness Of National Business Environments1|The problem of insolvency and over-indebtedness has long been present in most of the world economies. Number of insolvent businesses, as well as the value of unsettled obligations has been steadily rising in the past decade. On the other hand legal business environment framework is considered to have an important facilitating/limiting role in treating the problems, arising from the situations of insolvency and over-indebtedness of businesses. The insolvency legislation and monitoring as an essential part of such framework belongs to the most dynamic fields of contemporary research interest. The goal of this paper is to detect the most reformative national economies of the European Union in business insolvency management dealing with speediness and cost management of the resolution process. Th at should reveal the features of a business environment as a platform for finding better indebtedness management possibilities. The methodology entails using World Bank data on efficiency in resolving insolvency across all EU national economies in the period of 12 years. Scoring system is developed and applied to the data.As a result, the countries are ranked according to the intensity of their reformative efforts in the field of insolvency management in the researched period. The features of the highest ranking countries will be analyzed, as the best practices of facilitating role of such frameworks.
P47|Bangladesh’s Democractic Challenge|Bangladesh is currently in the midst of a deadly political crisis. When Bangladesh was born forty-plus years ago, it was generally thought that the Achilles heel of this newly minted country will be its economy. History has, however, proved it wrong. Though the proximate cause of this current political crisis is the controversial parliamentary election of 2014 and the legitimacy of the incumbent government, its history dates back to the birth of the country. Designing a neutral institutional mechanism for holding elections, ensuring smooth transfer of power and establishing intra-party democracy—these are the obvious first steps for a procedural democracy . They will extinguish the immediate fire, but do not address the root cause of the recurrent democratic crises in the country.
P47|Malaysia NAP: More Shadows than Lights|After World War II, and in particular during the 1960s and the 1970s, many developing countries began their industrial revolution path. In particular, most of them followed a path of government-led industrial development, with central planning at the heart of the industrial policy. Such a model is not new in economic history and it is typical of many ‘second-comers’ in the industrialization process. The most famous one is the case of Prussia/Germany: with the Zollverein (1833-34) and after the unification in 1870, it was the government which stimulated the development of a powerful heavy industrial system, following what was preached at the time by Friedrich List. In particular, the key point of List preaching was that second-comers countries need to protect their industrialization process (characterized by infant industries) from foreign competition. According to List, once the protected industries reach an adequate competitive level, protection should be removed and the national companies should face competition in the market, in order to stimulate further technological development. Many second-comers countries embraced this model; however, in most cases they failed to follow the second part of List’s recommendations: opening to the market in a second stage.
P47|Auction Schemes, Bidding Strategies and the Cost-Optimal Level of Promoting Renewable Electricity in Germany|Germany is among the leading countries regarding the promotion of renewable energy towards a sustainable energy system transition. In this paper, we investigate the German pilot auction scheme for solar photovoltaics introduced in the Renewable Energies Act 2014 (EEG 2014) that serves as a pilot for the auction-based promotion of the three major large-scale renewable electricity generation technologies (wind, solar, biomass) as of 2017. A strategic bidding model is used to determine the optimal bidding strategy and to determine the resulting project value. We consider pay-as-bid and uniform pricing and single and multiple bids. Moreover, we investigate the impact of investment cost uncertainty. In a sensitivity analysis we show how bid strategy adjustments affect the outcome. Specifically, higher uncertainty regarding the market clearing price increases the project value, as this additional uncertainty can be used to raise the probability of obtaining a higher level of remuneration by an adjusted auction strategy. The first-price auction can generate additional profits by placing a second, higher bid with a low probability of success. Investment cost uncertainty can have either a positive or negative impact on the project value, depending on the auction parameter values chosen.

Grundgesetz und Organisation der Bundesrepublik Deutschland sind natürlich weder dafür gedacht noch optimal dafür geeignet, alle Menschen und Völker der Erde zu integrieren. Trotzdem wäre eine Bundesrepublik Erde vermutlich ein friedlicherer Ort mit besser geschützten Menschenrechten und höherer Wohlfahrt als die gegenwärtige Welt. Der Beitrag folgt dem Aufbau des Grundgesetzes unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der Grundrechte, um Anpassungen für die Bundesrepublik Erde und mögliche Konsequenzen zu diskutieren.
P47|China’s Roadmap to Harmonious Society : Third Plenum Decisions on “major issues concerning comprehensively deepening reforms”|In November 2013, the central committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), at its third plenum, issued a Directives Paper (with 16 items and 60 prescriptions), setting out a long-term strategic compendium of China’s reform agenda, based on the principle of separation between market and state under the unifying predominance of the Law. Its prescriptions refer to three basic objectives: inclusiveness, protection of rights, and improving economic efficiency. The Directives Paper formulates an ambitious plan of reforms over the next 20 years, aimed at overhauling the factor price system. There are two pillars to the Reform. First, labor market developments should provide workers with enhanced bargaining power. Government is expanding the basic social safety net, promoting low catch-up, enforcing labor contracts and introducing collective bargaining. Second, capital market reform has been speeded-up by the urgency of dealing with non-performing loans held in state-owned enterprises and credit platforms guaranteed by local governments. The Government intends to foster bond markets, encourage private banks to finance SMEs, build a strong prudential framework, deregulate interest rates, and move to Renminbi convertibility in the new Shanghai free trade area. We believe that the political feasibility of the Reform depends on the sequencing of its implementation. Benefits in the early stage would legitimate more contentious future policy decisions. But the deep social changes involved in the Reform also imply risks. Reforming rural land and natural resource prices will be difficult. Farmers’ land-use rights will be secured by law and made transferable in rural land markets. Fuel, water, electricity and carbon prices will rise progressively to their social marginal costs within an integrated urban rural model to accommodate 350 million migrants over the next 20 years. New smart cities and greater social inclusiveness will be spurred by relaxing the hukou system and the one child policy. Tough political decisions will be required related to fi scal sharing amongst local H77governments, and rebalancing the tax system towards more progressive direct taxes.

P47|Entrepreneurship, innovation, and human flourishing|This essay uses Edmund Phelps’ new book Mass Flourishing: How Grassroots Innovation Created Jobs, Challenge, and Change (Phelps 2013 ) as inspiration to discuss innovation and entrepreneurship. The book is laudable for its discussion of what constitutes a “good life”. Phelps argues that true life satisfaction cannot be achieved through a purposeless quest for wealth and material consumption, but rather through adventure, entrepreneurship, and creative endeavors. Weaknesses of the book include an overly glossy characterization of the period before World War II, a niggardly evaluation of European innovation, and the lack of convincing empirical evidence for the claim that the rate of innovation has slowed. These flaws are regrettable given the importance of the book’s main message: innovation and creative entrepreneurship are not merely the keys to economic growth, but to life satisfaction as well. This essay discusses topics in entrepreneurship research linked to the book, including the link between innovation and entrepreneurship, the role of institutions for entrepreneurship, and the tendency of national accounts to under-record the social value of innovation and entrepreneurship. If the measures used do not capture the full social value of innovation, we are likely to underestimate the genuine rate of innovation. Government policy may also be misguided. Finally, the challenge to entrepreneurial capitalism posed by the postmodernist research paradigm is discussed. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
P47|Corruption in Russia, Russia Corrupted: Is There a Way out?|The article views corruption as an integral feature and the engine of the Russian economy. The main causes of corruption are linked to the nature of Russian privatization, mechanisms of government appointments and carrier growth, the lack of resource control in the process of the execution of economic policies. Corruption is considered to be a multilevel phenomenon, which embraces the process of governmental decision making, functioning of businesses and householders’ performance. Systematic analysis of the dissemination of corruption and successful experiences of other countries allow full scale measures for combating corruption in Russia to be proposed. Special attention is paid to the formation of state, corporate and public anti-corruption institutions.

P47|Is There a Sustainable Learning Economy Regime?|In this paper we deal with the concept of the learning economy and its suitability to describe the modern globalizing economy. We contend that in contrast to the many fleeting catchwords and phrases found in economics and public policy, the notion of the learning economy represents a superior conceptual starting point, which reflects a new and emerging economic regime. Even though it is still circumscribed to a small minority of developed countries, the learning economy offers a concrete example for the more numerous ‘have nots’ of the world to emulate.

P47|European integration, financial resources and the absorption of European funds in Central and Eastern European Countries|The regional integration has the purpose to enhance the income in the region, which may be achieved through getting higher economic results by using the production factors more efficiently, increasing their mobility and benefiting from the access to a comprehensive knowledge base. This paper aims to provide insights in European integration, financial resources and, absorption of European funds. The paper proposes an analysis of financial framework by means of data and statistics provided by European institution, national statistics institutions and international statistics institutions. The financial framework is a mechanism designed to ensure a strict budgetary discipline of the maximum spending cap for each major area of European Union budget. This mechanism is drawing on the basis of political and economic priorities. One of the main objectives should be the expenditure forecasting, annual budgets, so they be situated under overall cap, knowing that achieving long-term economic growth depends on the financial incentives that the European Union can sustain.
P47|Corporatism and job satisfaction|We introduce reported job satisfaction as a measure of economic performance and find it positively correlated with GDP per capita and the labor force participation rate in a sample of OECD countries and negatively correlated with unemployment. Moreover, we find that many measures of corporatism, which we define in the wider sense as institutions that hamper with the allocation of the factors of production and the distribution of income in a capitalist economy, are negatively correlated across countries with job satisfaction. Thus job satisfaction is positively correlated across countries with measures of the protection of property rights and negatively correlated with the volume of regulations of credit markets, labor markets and businesses, in addition to barriers to entrepreneurship, corruption and lack of access to capital. In contrast, measures of capitalism, such as the number of listed companies and market capitalization, are positively correlated with job satisfaction.
P47|Empirical Study Regarding Sustainability Of Romanian Pension System|"This paper is part of a broad, applied scientific research, based on popular empirical procedures (such as natural observation). Positivistic and constructive research methodology used was based on the consensual-inductive system (Locke), which is why we studied the different views of specialists on sustainability of pensions in Romania, necessary to formulate the problem of generating relevant information. Research strategies used were the comparative and longitudinal ones, as we analyzed the time evolution of qualitative indicators VUAN (unitary value of net asset) specific to pension funds Pillar II and Pillar III of Romania, concomitant with the number of participants in these funds, as to determine their direct relationship with the need for sustainability in this area. The hypotheses regarding causal relationship efficiency â€"" participants - sustainability and needed measures for pension reform were built in this paper inductively (by analyzing the sustainability issues of pensions in time), causally (by explaining the cause and effect phenomenon studied), deductively, logically and subjectively (due to the existence and perpetuation of conflict premise between generations and social inequality between employees and pensioners). The qualitative approach of the phenomenon studied by collecting information (using mediated data collection technique) has allowed the relevant findings and practical solutions necessary for all those involved in this concerted action of pensions, which affects us all."
P47|The Impact of Developments Implemented from Public Finances, with Special Regard to EU Cohesion Policy|In the latest, most recent phases of the economic crisis when the economic and governmental actors are regularly consulting with each other about the direction that should be followed, it is essential to determine how to use the limited resources available – for the purposes of this topic, the resources aimed at development – in the most efficient and sustainable way. Naturally, in order to be able to assess the efficiency of resource use, one must first decide what should be measured and how. The assessment of public investments and the impact of EU cohesion policy is controversial; assessing necessity, utility and sustainability is no easy task. It is clear, however, that the terms of the assessment of development policy interventions have shifted from the success of the absorption of development resources towards a stronger enforcement of the aspects of efficiency and effectiveness.
P47|Romania's Competitiveness and Competitive Position in Global Context|Competitiveness increase has become a primordial framework of the social and economic development strategies of most world countries (mainly the most developed ones) over the last decades. The vigorous boost of the contemporary phenomenon of globalization, which has widened the global area of economies, sectors and firms confrontation, has laid an emphasis on their competitiveness importance for their favorable position in the international competition and has therefore force the status to take proper, broad and concerted measures to stimulate the determining factors of action and to take better advantage of their effects. The purpose of the paper is to determine whether an increase in competitiveness could reduce the disparities between regions. The E.U. Member States and regions need significant financial help to solve various structural problems and to achieve their potential of growth. Romania is no exception, one of the main problems being the low rate in attracting European funds
P47|EU Regional Policy. Realities and Perspectives on the Absorption of European Funds|EU expansion to 27 Member States has generate challenges in terms of its competitiveness and internal cohesion. The already existing disparities between the Member States and among their regions have deepened. These disparities are generated by the structural deficiencies in key factors of competitiveness, i.e. inadequate endowment with physical and human capital (infrastructure and workforce), insufficient capacity for innovation, business support and low level of environmental capital (natural environment and / or urban pollution). The purpose of the paper is to determine whether the cohesion policy reduced or increased the disparities between regions. Therefore in order to achieve this goal of the cohesion policy, the Member States and regions need significant financial help to solve various structural problems and achieve their potential of growth

P47|Towards the European integration model perspectives|European integration within the booming European Union with its original as well as emerging members became a prominent example of sustainable economic growth, employment and social and ecologic development. However, conditions throughout the EU are not the same everywhere; moreover, they change drastically due to demographic processes and migration, which have a huge impact on the social structures and social policy, correspondingly. During the year 2011 it became clear that the last financial and economic crisis not simply had a negative impact on dynamics of economic development of EU, but revealed deep contradictions in European integration model. These processes (quite often accompanied by erroneous anti-recessionary steps of the national governments of EU countries) led to the aggravation of the whole range of economic and social problems in the European states. For instance, expected measures including rigid economy of the budgetary expenses have a boomerang effect, i.e. cause reduction of consumer demand and investment activity; therefore growth rates of gross domestic product slow down as well. As a result, the budgetary incomes continue to shrink while sufficient deficiencies and the related new loans remain. Finally, Greece and other problem states get to the 'vicious circle'. We aim to discuss some issues concerning the European integration project and its reasonability: to define the degree of national EU member states' responsibility in regard to their national economic and social policy, to assess possibilities of restriction of their sovereignty within EU, to analyze peripheral relations’ overcoming within EU when Germany and some of the most successful member countries tend to be “locomotives of economic growth” and the centers of key economic decision-making which are only applied on other states of EU.
P47|The Exploitation of the Open Economic System’s Synergistic Relational Potential|This paper proposes and depicts certain aspects that we consider to be essential in the matter of the economic systems’ relational potential utilization for their functional synergism's turning up and synergic acting in the benefit of the concerned systems (with emphasis on the open ones) and in the purpose of avoiding undesirable results. It aims at highlighting, defining and outlining the main conceptual issues, including the formalizing and also showing of certain real examples. After a short introduction and a very synthetic review of the evolution of economic entities (from the angle of the managerial approach) to the open system form, a conceptual presentation of those systems’ potential to generate synergism by multiple connections and relations is made. The paper’s conception is based on the hypothesis that the concern and action for quantifying and exploiting the synergic relational potential of the active economic entities (including the case of complex entities, of regional or national level) would represent support and impulse for their success in competition; this specific advantage of those economic entities is perceived as being obtained out from of the conventional means. Further on, the factorial substantiation of the growth of an open economic system’s synergic potential is made and the benefits of its turning to good account are described, but also certain problems (and examples) concerning its accounting and finding in statistic records.The essential aspects (argumentative and to be followed to achieve synergy effects) are synthesized into a suggestive formula concerning especially the number and intensity of the established and functional links, as a result of trying to measure the exploitation degree of the synergistic relational potential that belongs to the active economic networks or systems. Objective arguments of empirical nature result, regarding the necessity of quantification and exploitation of relational synergistic potential of economic entities (including the complex entities at regional and national level).
P47|Firm break-up and performance|We analyze the long-term effects of firm break-up and ownership change on corporate performance. Our analysis is based on a unique data set for a large number of Czech firms spanning the period 1996–2005. We employ a propensity score matching procedure to deal with endogeneity problems. Our results, which are generally in line with the positive effects of firm break-up found in the developed-market literature, show that the initial effects of firm break-up are positive but after a certain point they quickly diminish over time. Factors like changes in ownership structure and management are to be found behind later improvements in the performance of firms.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P47|Does conflict disrupt growth? Evidence of the relationship between political instability and national economic performance| Current empirical growth models limit the determinants of country growth to geographic, economic, and institutional variables. This study draws on conflict variables from the Correlates of War (COW) project to ask a critical question: how do different types of conflict affect country growth rates? It finds that wars slow the economy. Estimates indicate that civil war reduces annual growth by 0.01--0.13 percentage points, and high-intensity inter-state conflict reduces annual growth by 0.18--2.77 percentage points. On the other hand, low-intensity conflict slows growth much less than high-intensity conflict, and may slightly increase it. The detrimental effect of conflict on growth is intensified when examining non-democracies, low-income countries, and countries in Africa.
P47|Rebuilding Babel: finding common development solutions using cross-contextual comparisons of multidimensional well-being|We build on the theoretical tradition of livelihood strategies and capital portfolios to empirically assess wellbeing among rural households, but with an eye to comparison across contexts. First, we estimate a multidimensional measure of poverty based on fuzzy logic, for two rural frontiers: Nang Rong, Thailand and Altamira, Brazil. To enable cross-contextual comparison, we calculate a second estimate using a subset of shared measures. We find that the pattern of response over the range of many key variables – for example education, income, and demographic dependency ratio – is robust to model specification, suggesting that comparative generalizations, useful in formulating cost-effective policy interventions across contexts, could be satisfactorily identified in many instances. More generally, our approach provides researchers and policymakers with a framework for understanding the interaction of context and the subjective construction of wellbeing that is useful for distinguishing stable corollaries of poverty from those that are volatile across contexts.
P47|Calidad institucional y crecimiento económico: nuevos avances y evidencia|The aim of this paper is to analyse the effect of institutions on economic growth. On the one hand, we present an analysis of the existing theoretical and empirical studies, which have achieved wide consensus regarding the positive effects of institutional quality. On the other hand, we identify a good number of pending questions and generated debates which require further research. For instance, not all institutional dimensions have the same impact on development and some authors do not agree with the thesis that the influence of geographical factors upon growth is only produced through institutions. Moreover, the type of indicator, the sample of countries and the methodology used may greatly condition the achieved results.
P47|FDI from emerging to advanced countries: some insights on the acquisition strategies and on the performance of target firms|The paper deals with acquisitions from emerging to advanced countries and the performances of the target firms. We have used descriptive statistics to investigate the strategies and the impact of the entry of emerging multinational companies (EMNCs) from Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC) on the performance of firms acquired in Europe, North America and Japan between 2000 and 2007. The results show that EMNCs do not always acquire firms with a high pre acquisition performance and that they do not significantly increase the post acquisition profitability of the target firms. Nevertheless, EMNCs contribute to increase target firms’ productivity and sales and to slow down their loss of jobs. We also show the importance of the acquisition experience of the acquiring firms. Experienced EMNCs not only acquire firms with a higher pre acquisition performance, but also contribute to increase more significantly the productivity and sales of the target firms. Ultimately, we highlight the differences in the sizes and the technology intensity of the target firms acquired by experienced and inexperienced EMNCs to provide further insights about the strategies and the effects of acquisitions from emerging to advanced countries.

P47|Logistics Platforms – Optimization Factor of Transportation and Distribution Processes|The logistics company is challenging and at the same time is a necessity to introduce it in the management activity, which in our opinion means more than just the supply of means of transportation with goods since the company's manager of logistics problems should know very well which are the existing internal and external infrastructures and organized in logistical platform that will be introduced in the company's strategy to save resources and surface sizing storage. The purpose of this paper is to show that creating an efficient logistics system by a company leads to the reduction of the negative effects of freight transport, but also creates conditions for a sustainable development.

P47|Vliv rozdělení českých podniků na ziskovost a produktivitu<BR>[Effect of the Czech Firms Break-Up on their Profitability and Productivity]|In this article we analyze medium- and long-term effects of firm break-up (and subsequent change in ownership) on its profitability and productivity. We use an extensive data-set of the Czech firms for the period 1996-2005. We employ the propensity score based matching methodology to account for potential endogeneity. Our results show that initial effects of the firm break-up are positive but they vanish in five to seven years after the break-up. Hence, the break-up of large and less efficient companies delivers a positive effect on corporate performance for a period of time. The effect is not permanent, though. Subsequent development in profitability and productivity is likely affected by ownership structure, corporate governance and other micro-level factors.

P47|The Conseqences Of The Global Financial Crisis Regarding The Romanian Banking System|Romania has not passed through a crisis as the existing one in the last 10 years. Despite the unfavorable conditions of economy, Romania, however, has sufficient advantages in comparison with other states which have been more seriously affected by the global crisis. Therefore, one of the economists’ greatest fears is that, because of decreased liquidities and the lack of confidence in Romania, the holding banks form Europe may let their branches in our country with less money than it should. BNR says that this thing is not going to happen. Romanian bankers sustain the same fact, and they say that credit lines, and that means the money put at the disposal of Romania’s banks by the European groups they are belonging to, will be at least at the same level as last year.
P47|Forecast of the Economic- Financial Performance Based on Diagnostic Analysis|To ensure efficient financial management is necessary to achieve the forecast of economic and financial performance on the basis of diagnostic analysis, approach most often developed starting from the prediction of turnover and also necessary for shaping an organization's prospects. In financial management, the turnover’s increasing is considered an objective in itself, being interpreted as generating increased market share, profit. Sales condition therefore the entire activity of a company, their variation being considered the main risk factor of enterprise’s economic and financial performance and the staring point in their forecast.
P47|Whither Islamic Finance? Risk Sharing in An Age of Crises|The aim of this paper is to explore potential path of progress in developing full-spectrum Islamic finance. It will be argued that all Islamic transaction contracts (‘uqud) are risk sharing contracts. Next,the paper will explore ways and means of creating sufficiently strong impetus for widening and deepening the present menu of instruments toward longer time, higher risk-return, investment-oriented instruments. It will argue that governments can create the energy and the incentives within the private sector in this direction by first developing a vibrant and efficient equity market. Such a market will serve to stake out the higher end of the spectrum of Islamic finance instrument menu. Incentives will then allow the private sector to develop risk-sharing instrument in between the low and high end of time, risk-return profile of the menu. The paper will also address principles and methods underlying the legal, regulatory, supervisory infrastructure as well as economic policies needed to organize such an equity market.
P47|Divestitures, privatization and corporate performance in emerging markets|We use new firm‐level data to examine the effects of firm divestitures and privatization on corporate performance in a rapidly emerging market economy. Unlike the existing literature, we control for accompanying ownership changes and the fact that divestitures and ownership are potentially endogenous variables. We find that divestitures increase the firm's profitability but do not alter its scale of operations, while the effect of privatization depends on the resulting ownership structure – sometimes improving performance and sometimes bringing about decline. The effects of privatization are thus more nuanced than suggested in earlier studies. Methodologically, our study provides evidence that it is important to control for changes in ownership when analyzing divestitures and to control for endogeneity, selection and data attrition when analyzing the effects of divestitures and privatization.

P47|The Informational Valences Of The Financial Signals System Used In The Evaluation Of Companies Global Performance|For a long period of time the analysis of company's performance has been approached preponderant or only for financial point of view, but in the last half of century, because of an environment characterized by intensified competition, there have been elaborated and developed a number of measurement tools, the goal of which is to reflect all the factors involved in a company's performance.The practic goal of performance measurement, the standard it refers to and the measuring tools are tightly correlated with the objectives of each of the company's stakeholders. In order to obtain a good quantification of company's performance is necessary to use a system of indicators that may provide reliable information for evaluating the degree to which firm's objectives are reached. In this system, financial indicators remain, an essential tool of management, regardless the changes which affect the company's environment.

P47|Togo: Failed election and misguided aid at the roots of economic misery|The holding of early parliamentary elections in Togo on October 14, 2007, most likely the first free and fair Togolese elections since decades, are considered internationally as a litmus test of despotic African regimes’ propensity to change towards democratization and economic prosperity. Western donors took Togo as model to test their approach of political conditionality of aid, which had been emphasised as corner stone of the joint EU-Africa strategy. Recent empirical findings on the linkage between democratization and economic performance in Western Africa are challenged because of lack of viable data. It is open to question, whether Togo’s expected economic consolidation and growth will be due to democratization of its institutions or to improved external environment, notably the growing competition between global players for African natural resources.
P47|Modelling The Economic Growth In Romania With The Solow Model|In this study I make an estimation of the Solow model for the Romanian economy. Starting from the estimates of the parameters from other studies, I simulate the model both for the 1990-2004 period and in the long run. The study shows that the Solow model provides a good approximation of the dynamics of the Romanian economy for the 1990-2004 period, with respect to the dynamics of the aggregate GDP and to the ratios of the main macroeconomic variables, like production per worker, capital-output ratio or capital per worker. The simulation for the 2030 time horizon indicates a potential of growth of over 3%.

P47|Speaking the Same Language within the International Organizations; A Proposal for an Enhanced Evaluation Approach to Measure and Compare Success of International Organizations|It is currently difficult for Member States to assess and compare the success or performance of UN organizations despite recent movements towards results-based approaches. Efforts in the implementation of logical frameworks have been too independent and uncoordinated and left at the discretion of agencies. This has led to different and deficient implementations of the same theoretical approach making it almost impossible to draw any conclusions. The lack of a common approach is perceptible across agencies in the diversity of evaluation standards and terminology used to describe the same concepts, the unevenness and diversity of staff training as well as in the way intentions and results are presented. The myriad of organizations with some different sort of evaluation role may be seen as an additional symptom of the lack of coordination within the UN system. The establishment of a useful and reliable evaluation process in the UN system requires three main elements: 1- a common and enhanced evaluation framework, 2- the human and organizational capacity to ensure the accurate implementation of the framework, and 3- the commitment of Member States and agencies to implement the approach. This report mainly discusses the common evaluation framework and methodological issues, although it also provides significant insight regarding how to build the human and organizational capacity of the UN to carry out this approach. Assessing the success of an organization entails the determination of three elements: mandate or mission relevance, effectiveness, and efficiency. The report provides insight into these three components of success but its primary focus is on effectiveness. Measuring effectiveness entails establishing precise targets to be reached by agencies and collecting actual results in order to assess if intended targets are being met. Indeed, assessing effectiveness encompasses comparing intentions (provided by targets) to actual achievements (collected through monitoring). The UN Secretariat itself does not provide targets to be met by the organization. Additionally, it over-emphasizes outputs (output implementation rates) and disregards the “big picture” provided by outcomes. Under the proposed approach, subprograms meeting most of their targets are the most effective. Programs (agencies) with a large share of effective subprograms (programs) may be considered effective themselves. As a way to simplify and give an intuitive sense of effectiveness, subprograms could be attributed a category or color following a “traffic light” methodology (green for satisfactory, amber for average, red for below expectations) according to the share of targets satisfactorily met. The same could be done for programs according to their share of satisfactory subprograms. Program and subprogram performance data of every agency could be centralized (by a coordinating body) in a comprehensive webpage that would facilitate comparison between similar functions or themes across the UN system [Please refer to pg. 27 for an elaborate illustration]. The report also suggests the possibility of complementing this objective approach with a perception survey. Despite significant limitations of this type of subjective approach, it is still widely used and gives an idea of which organizations are best regarded by their peers. Contrasting actual performance data and perception indicators could be revealing, and could shed light in areas where the objective methodology may fall short. One of the most important recommendations concerns the organizational capacity ensuring the accurate implementation of the evaluation approach. This capacity should be embodied by a centralizing coordinating body (perhaps under the CEB) that would 1-ensure a common evaluation training and support of UN staff and uniformity of standards (terminology, methods, etc.), 2- centralize performance data gathered from agencies in a common database and present results in a user-friendly manner where programs and agencies could be compared and 3- verify the validity of the data submitted by the agencies (performance auditing).
P47|Economic Policy and State Owned Enterprises: Evolution Towards Privatisation in India|The paper endeavours to look into the evolution of the role of the state and move towards privatisation in India. It starts with a discussion on the role of State intervention in the economic development within the contours of socio-economic and political circumstances. It recognises the fact that different scholars have advocated various ways through which state can intervene in an advanced capitalist economy and a developing economy or a colony. The nature of intervention is different in each case. The paper argues that State owned enterprises (SOEs) are one such manifestation of state Intervention. In many developing countries, state enterprises are assigned the responsibility of fulfilling specific social goals, which have their origin in colonial period. Whatever may be the idea behind the creation of such enterprises, they come into existence either by direct state investment or through nationalisation of private enterprises. The state intervenes through state owned enterprises in the countries where investment needs for different projects are large and the expected returns at least in the short run are too low to motivate private capital to invest. Since 1980, however, the intervention by the state through state owned enterprises has been undergoing a close scrutiny in many developing countries including India. The argument is that excessive political interference and lack of managerial interests (autonomy) hamper the performance of state enterprises. It has resulted in the reflection of various theories on assessing the performance of state enterprises which includes property rights theory, public choice theory, non-market failure and competition theory. Since economic policy making by the state requires balance of accumulation and legitimisation, then generally, the adopted economic policy serves the interests of a few major social groups. These dominant social groups react to the adopted policy and their reactions are normally taken into account while amending the existing policy or making the new economic policy. Hence, the proper understanding of the economic policy of an economy like India necessitates its historical evaluation. Therefore, in this chapter, the whole period of interaction of economic policy and state owned sector in the post-independence India has been divided into following four phases: (i) 1950-1965, (ii) 1966-1984, (iii) 1984-91 and (iv) post-1991 policy regime. During the first phase, i.e. 1950-65, the growth rates of the economy were generally high and state owned sector was occupying the position of 'commanding heights'. Despite the economy passing through crisis during this phase, the state owned sector enjoyed by and large a significant position. The policy adopted in 1982 was a step forward towards the process of liberalisation. In state owned enterprises, a visible change in the attitude took place. The economy was made predominantly dependent upon market forces rather than on the state. The industrial policy that was initiated in 1985 was the culmination of the process of drifting away, which started during the second phase of the economic policy in India. In the Post 1991, Policy Regime, the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Plan documents suggested many policy initiatives towards restructuring, modernisation, rationalisation of capacity, product-mix changes, privatisation, autonomy, performance accountability and disinvestments policy. However many studies emerged in favour of and against the policy of privatisation and disinvestment of SOEs and also on the performance of those enterprises that were privatised. While referring to those studies, the chapter looks into the trends of the privatisation of State Owned Enterprises from 1991 to 2000 and points out that during this period, the government offloaded shares in as many as 39 state owned enterprises. However, since March 2000 emphasis has increasingly been on strategic sales of identified state owned enterprises (SOEs). The chapter ends with a critical analysis of the performance of disinvestment process in india and observes that the policy of disinvestment has been looked upon with scepticism.

P47|L’impresa tra dirigismo e mercato|This essay discusses the endemic weaknesses of Italian industry in a historical as well as analytical perspective. The main conclusion is that these weaknesses may not be determined by some hereditary shortcomings of character and skill of our entrepreneurial class, but rather by the economic and social policies that have been followed since the Constituent Assembly. In particular, the prevailing small size and strong concentration of ownership could mainly be a consequence of labour market rules introduced at the end of the 1960s, as well as the economic and social policies followed in order to permit those rules to survive, despite their inconsistency with the changing competitive environment.

P47|INFRASTRUCTURAL v. SUPERSTRUCTURAL EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONS ON INCOME DETERMINATION ACROSS U.S. NATIVE AMERICAN ECONOMIES|Institutions either promote or constrain economic performance, but which part of institutions does so, and why do economies sharing similar institutions sometimes perform differently? This paper applies a novel model that is capable of separating infrastructural and superstructural effects of institutions on aggregate and average income using a cross- section of 84 U.S. Native American economies (USNAEs). It finds that aggregate and average incomes for these economies depend mainly on the accumulation of physical resources. However, resources and resource productivity are necessary but insufficient determinants of income for institutional reasons. Infrastructures that aid human capital formation are inadequate so that even when the local superstructure is generally accepting of external technology, the impact of human capital on income (performance) remains modest. It appears that infrastructural and superstructural aspects of institutions are competitive rather than complementary, thereby weakening the Nelson-Phelps channel for transmitting external technology into USNAEs.
P47|Solow and the Native Americans: Technological Residuals and the Economic Performance of U.S. Native American Economies|This paper decomposes the large regression residuals of income across 84 U.S. Native American economies (USNAEs) into Solow and Solow-like parts. Decomposition is accomplished algebraically. The calculations find a weak to negative correlation between income and Solow residuals, and a strong correlation between income and Solow-like residuals, especially those associated with human capital and external technology. It also finds that technological residuals are skewed towards high income USNAEs. The reason seems to be that high income USNAEs are better able to build human capital which supports the Nelson-Phelps channel for transmitting technology from external sources.
P47|The Structure and Equilibrium Conditions of a Generalized Economic Canopy: A Note|This note draws upon ecological models to describe the structure and equilibrium conditions of a generalized economic canopy consisting of three interactive economies assumed to be in competitive epiphytic, parasitic, and host relationships to each other. The maintained hypothesis is that generally (a) parasites are a drag on their hosts, (b) epiphytes interfere with normal functioning of both parasites and hosts, and (c) hosts must support their own performance as well as the survival of epiphytes and parasites. The results show that hosts must perform twice as better to support the other competitors, and question the notion that individual economies fend for themselves. The challenge is firmly grounded in ample real-life evidence; for example, primary sectors have historically supported economic growth of nations, especially in the early stages of development. In some cases, primary sectors transform themselves and other sectors, as in the lumber industry giving birth to Nokia, and thereby transforming both Finland and the world. In other cases the emergence of tertiary sectors consisting mainly of governments (parasites) has diminished the performance of other sectors and along with them economic growth. The world may be flatter today than it was even a decade ago, but how economies perform remain constrained and/or promoted by individual intra-actions as well as by the interactive dynamics between and among economies.
P47|Economic Growth and Economic Policy in Sweden in the 20th Century: A Comparative Perspective|It is conventional wisdom that Sweden’s economic growth internationally seen was unusually rapid 1870-1970 and then very slow. In this paper Sweden is compared with three country groups viz. sixteen industrialised countries, six countries at the same income level as Sweden 1970, and European small industrialised countries. It is shown that as to relative growth another periodisation is relevant. 1890-1950 with Sweden’s industrial break-through and the world wars where Sweden was non-belligerent showed an exceptional growth. Then, already from the 1950s growth was slow internationally seen. It is hypothesised that this was due to institutional factors related to the so-called “Swedish Model”.
P47|Spinoffs, Privatization and Corporate Performance in Emerging Markets|We use new firm-level data to examine the effects of spinoffs and privatization on corporate performance in a rapidly emerging market economy. Unlike the existing literature, which analyzes spinoffs almost exclusively in advanced economies, we control for accompanying ownership changes and the fact that spinoffs and ownership are endogenous variables. We find that spinoffs increase the firmâ€™s profitability but do not alter its scale of operations, while the effect of privatization depends on the resulting ownership structure â€“ sometime improving performance and sometime bringing about decline that is consistent with tunneling (looting) by managers or (partial) owners. The effects of privatization are hence much less clear-cut than suggested in earlier studies. Methodologically, our study provides evidence that it is important to control for changes in ownership when analyzing spinoffs and generally to control for endogeneity, selection and data attrition when analyzing the effects of spinoffs and privatization.

The calculations find a weak to negative correlation between income and Solow residuals, and a strong correlation between income and Solow-like residuals, especially those associated with human capital and external technology.

P47|Human Capital: Infrastructural and Superstructural Constraints to Economic Performance across U.S. Native American Reservations and Trust Lands|The current research emphasis on institutions as key determinants of economic performance, rather than on resources and resource productivity, has uncovered important questions for further research. For example, if institutions are central to economic performance, then what explains observed differences in performance across parts of one economy sharing similar institutions? What specific aspects of institutions are responsible for economic performance? This paper suggests that two broad aspects of institutions are involved - infrastructure and superstructure. The paper then applies a simple model to 50 U.S. reservation economies to assess how the two aspects affect income. The results show that resources and resource productivity are necessary but insufficient determinants of income in reservation economies. A key constraint is human capital; human capital is a serious limitation for two institutional reasons. First, infrastructures for fostering human capital (schools, hospitals, etc.) are either inadequate or inappropriate. Second, the local superstructure seems resistant to existing infrastructures that were supposed to enhance human capital formation. Since infrastructural and superstructural aspects of institutions are competitive rather than complementary, the Nelson- Phelps channel for transmitting external technology into USRATLs appears clogged up.
P47|Economic Performance in a Cross-Section of U.S. Native American Economies|Institutions either promote or constrain economic performance, but which parts of institutions advance or restrict performance, and why do economies sharing similar institutions sometimes perform differently? This paper is a modest attempt at addressing a small part of these questions. It applies a novel model that is capable of separating infrastructural and superstructural effects of institutions on aggregate and average income across 84 U.S. Native American economies (USNAEs). It finds that USNAEs have much in common with developing countries inasmuch as their aggregate and average incomes depend mainly on the accumulation of physical capital and exogenously-given labor. However, resources and resource productivity are necessary but insufficient determinants of income for institutional reasons. Because of the apparent scarcity of physical capital, infrastructures that aid human capital formation (schools, hospitals, and the like) are inadequate, so that even when the local superstructure is generally accepting of external technology, the impact of human capital on performance remains modest. Clearly infrastructural and superstructural aspects of institutions are competitive rather than complementary, which weakens the Nelson-Phelps channel for transmitting external technology into USNAEs. One obvious policy implication is to improve extant infrastructures; another is to align the competing forces. How best to go ahead is left to further investigations.
P47|Broadening monitoring and evaluation within reforming national agricultural research systems|The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Ghana, together with the Natural Resources Institute of the United Kingdom and with input from the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration convened a one-day Policy Dialogue Forum on “Broadening Monitoring and Evaluation within Reforming National Agricultural Research Systems”. The meeting provided a platform for discussing current experiences with monitoring and evaluation by CSIR and for introducing alternative practices (frameworks, methods and tools) that would enable research bodies to manage and demonstrate their performance and contribution to national development targets in a consistent and coherent form. While the pilot project was conducted at institutional level, involving two CSIR institutes (CRI and FRI), the forum was conducted at the corporate level, and including other corporate organisations from the public and private sectors. The objectives of the forum were 1. To disseminate experiences from the first phase of a performance measurement action research project within NARS in Ghana and Uganda 2. To raise awareness among Ghana’s research management community and allied stakeholders of the importance of measuring institutional performance as an element of demonstrating developmental impact 3. To explore with key stakeholders opportunities for strengthening institutional performance measurement and management in the context of ongoing institutional reform in CSIR and other public sector organisations. Participants were made up of Senior Management Personnel from public organisations and training institutions.
P47|Strategic Bargaining Behavior, Self-Serving Biases, and the Role of Expert Agents An Empirical Study of Final-Offer Arbitration|In this paper we study the complete evolution of a final-offer arbitration system used in New Jersey with data we have systematically collected over the 18-year life of the program. Covering the wages of police officers and firefighters, this system provides virtually a laboratory setting for the study of the evolution of strategic interaction. Our empirical analysis provides convincing evidence that, left alone, the parties do not construct and present their offers as successfully as when they retain expert agents to assist them. In principle, expert agents may be helpful to the parties for two different reasons: (a) they may move the arbitrator to favor their position independently of the facts, or (b) they may help eliminate inefficiencies in the conduct of strategic behavior. In this paper we construct a model where the agent may influence outcomes independent of the facts, but where the agent may also improve the outcomes of the process by moderating any self-serving biases or over-confidence that may have led to impasse in the first instance. Our data indicate that expert agents may well have had an important role in moderating self-serving biases early in the history of the system, but that the parties have slowly evolved to a non-cooperative equilibrium where the use of third-party agents has become nearly universal and where agents are used primarily to move the fact finder's decisions.
P47|Corporatism – A New Type of Socioeconomic System|"Some elements of the socioeconomic system called Corporatism are outlined and analyzed in this paper. In this system a new type of property on the means of production comes into being, and a considerable part of the functions executed respectively by the individual or by the state in the alternative systems capitalism and socialism, pass over to the corporation. This leads to changes in the character of competition, the system of social protection, the aims of the social production, the manifestation of the freedom of the individual. The fundamental characteristics of corporatism are traced out on three different levels - intercompany (meso), intracompany (micro) and national (macro) level. The relations between companies are institutionalized predominantly under the form of multisector amalgamations of joint stock companies (MSAJSC), which are namely considered as a new type of property on the means of production. The basic peculiarities of the corporatistic company can be summarized in the integration of management and workers and in the independence of the company leaders from the control of capital. The influence of the state on corporations is indirect and is based on the ""mutual understanding"", built up in the process of continuous interaction."

P47|Islamic Banking: An Evaluation|Islamic banking, a financial innovation, has come to be seen as the most 'visible' aspect of Islamization. Notwithstanding its novelty, it has made considerable progress, measured by the rapidity with which it has been adopted in the Muslim (even non-Muslim) countries in a relatively short period of time. However, the progress made by Islamic banking is seen by some Muslim economists as more apparent than real because it is not being run exclusively (or even mostly) on the basis of the Sharicah-favored profit and loss sharing (PLS) principle; rather, the fixed-rate type of financial instruments, which are seen as a 'deviation' from the Islamic ideal, have proliferated. It is argued in this paper that there is no warrant whatsoever for this misplaced 'financial puritanism', which has obfuscated the subject and its manifestations. The fact of the matter is that, deviation or not, the fixed-rate financial instruments, duly approved by the Sharicah, form an integral part of Islamic banking; and that it would be counterproductive to limit the possibilities of this institution just to the PLS principle. Hence, respecting the preferences of the consumers, Islamic banks should aim to evolve a risk-minimizing 'mixed' investment portfolio, containing both the variable and fixed-rate of return types, without any 'imperfection complex'. Even more important, rather than pursue an ambiguous financial ideal, which cannot be reached, the focus of the future reform should be to produce something strikingly original which can win the acknowledgement of the people. To this end, Islamic banking should be informed with an earnest knowledge of the ethical objectives of an Islamic economic system, the truth of which can be established only by the quality of social justice and the primacy it accords to the needs of the underclass in society.
