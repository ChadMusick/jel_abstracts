P45|Pricing Financial Derivatives Subject to Multilateral Credit Risk and Collateralization|This article presents a new model for valuing financial contracts subject to credit risk and collateralization. Examples include the valuation of a credit default swap (CDS) contract that is affected by the trilateral credit risk of the buyer, seller and reference entity. We show that default dependency has a significant impact on asset pricing. In fact, correlated default risk is one of the most pervasive threats in financial markets. We also show that a fully collateralized CDS is not equivalent to a risk-free one. In other words, full collateralization cannot eliminate counterparty risk completely in the CDS market.
P45|A Look to Cash Waqfs as an Indicator of Ottoman Financial Mentality|In spite of the fact that the waqfs have existed with the history of humankind and are helpful in all social communities, they have a different and important place in Islamic societies. The waqfs have made assistance and solidarity between individuals organized and institutionalized. Especially in Islamic societies, a great importance has been attached to waqfs. The waqfs that helped institutionalize the concept of infaq met many needs of the community. One of the Islamic states where the waqfs are very active was the Ottoman Empire. The size of the waqf services in the Ottomans expanded so much that, besides the human services, waqfs for injured birds and sick animals were established. The fact that the waqfs are so widespread in the state has made it possible to refer the Ottoman Empire as a waqf civilization. One of the waqf types operating in the Ottoman Empire was the cash waqfs (CWs) which had cash money as capital. The CWs operated its capital with various Islamic finance methods. Revenues from the operating money were used in the direction of waqf purpose. The CWs provided the vital necessities of the society such as education and religion in the period they were active in the Ottoman Empire. Another function of these waqfs was to operate as a micro-credit mechanism. Through these waqfs, the surplus and the accumulated savings in the hands of the asset owners were made available to merchants, farmers, craftsmen, and artisans. Hence, these waqfs have served as resource transfer channels as well as functioning as a charity in the society. The main goal of CWs, which is the pioneer of modern Islamic financial institutions, is different from the goal of Islamic interest-free financial institutions. The CWs did not transfer the profits they got to the waqf founder or owner. The income obtained was spent to fulfill the charitable services. Therefore, these institutions created an altruistic finance model operating within the borders of Islamic prohibitions and orders. This model has its own principles. In our study, the financial mentality of the Ottoman society in the context of the CWs and how this mentality shaped the CWs will be discussed. The basic principles of this mentality and model will be emphasized.
P45|LDC Graduation: Challenges and Opportunities for Vanuatu|"Vanuatu will graduate from the least developed country (LDC) category on 4 December 2020. This will be a momentous occasion, heralding a new era in the nation’s development journey. However, it will be essential to carefully manage the transition leading up to, and following graduation. A smooth transition will be dependent on improving institutional and productive capacity; providing the stimulus for the private sector to flourish; ensuring inclusive, culturally sensitive development; and working to mitigate the country’s deep-seated vulnerabilities. Transition strategies should be led by, and continue to inform, the implementation of Vanuatu 2030 | The People’s Plan - the national sustainable development plan - and be integrated into sector strategies and action plans. Overcoming the challenges and maximizing the opportunities associated with graduation will require collaborative partnerships between government, community leaders, businesses, civil society, and the country’s development and trading partners. Working together, these partnerships should honour the global commitments made by the international community and serve to deliver the development aspirations articulated by the people through Vanuatu 2030. This background paper is intended to build awareness and increase understanding of the key issues associated with Vanuatu’s graduation to help inform national consultations, and the formulation of strategies that guide the smooth transition. It is based on a synthesis of the existing knowledge base, analysis and shared learning that exists on the topic, and has benefited from an initial round of consultations with key stakeholders. While it concludes with a series of recommendations in support of the formulation of appropriate transition strategies, this paper is not presented as a final strategy document. Rather, it is envisaged that it will provoke the necessary further thinking, discussion, research and analysis that will be guided by the National Coordinating Committee for LDC graduation in the lead up to December 2020."
P45|Preparing to graduate: Issues, challenges and strategies for Kiribati’s LDC graduation|This paper outlines the recent development trajectory of Kiribati in relation to the least developed country (LDC) categorisation and the prospect of Kiribati’s graduation out of LDC status. In particular, the paper discusses the economic vulnerability of Kiribati’s economic and fiscal position due to recent increases in fishing license revenue, and presents a framework for policies moving forward. The framework aims to mitigate the fishery revenue as a source of risk by (1) making the most of current resources (through public financial management reform and prudent fiscal management), (2) ensure the sustainability of the key resource (protect fish stocks), and (3) create an environment for new opportunities through establishing the precursors to tourism-orientated development (through deregulation and investment in public infrastructure). More broadly, the paper advocates for a risk-averse approach to policymaking in Kiribati through broad-based improvements in public financial architecture and investment rather than targeting higher-level interventions.
P45|The Impact of Crime and Other Economic Forces on Mexico's Foreign Direct Investment Inflows|This paper examines the effect of different crimes on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows into the 32 Mexican states. Using a state-quarter panel data for the period 2005 to 2015, we estimate alternative models of FDI, with fixed effects throughout a flexible lag-lengths methodology and System Generalized Method of Moments (SGMM) models in order to identify the determinants of FDI inflows into the country. The dependent variable in our model is the annual inflow of FDI and the independent variables are state level indicators (real wages and electricity consumption), and macroeconomic forces (the real exchange rate and interest rate). We find that homicides and thefts have negative statistically significant effects on FDI, while other crimes show no effects. Partitions of the sample suggest higher negative effects in the most violent states.
P45|Asymmetric Effects of Terms of Trade Shocks on Tradable and Non-tradable Investment Rates: The Colombian Case|Terms of trade (ToT) shocks drive business cycles and have direct impact on the macroeconomic equilibrium conditions in commodity-exporter countries. ToT shocks also affect the dynamics of other variables such as national income and relative prices, and consequently, cause agents and firms to adjust their saving, spending and investment decisions accordingly. The latter is of special interest because of its link with potential GDP and the capital stock of the economy, relevant concepts when assessing sustainable and long-run growth. In this document we explore how tradable and nontradable investment rates respond asymmetrically to ToT shocks. We estimate a Threshold VAR (TVAR) in which the ToT are the transition variable. The empirical results suggest the existence of two regimes (low and high ToT levels) and that ToT shocks have different effects on tradable and nontradable investment rates depending not only the direction of the shock, but also on the levels from which the shock departs. **** Los choques de Términos de Intercambio (TdI) determinan en parte los ciclos económicos y tienen impacto directo en el equilibrio macroeconómico en los países exportadores de materias primas. Estos choques también afectan las dinámicas de variables como el ingreso nacional y los precios relativos, haciendo que los agentes y las firmas ajusten sus decisiones de ahorro, gasto e inversión. La inversión es de especial interés debido a su vínculo con el PIB potencial y el stock de capital de la economía, conceptos que resultan relevantes al evaluar el crecimiento sostenible y de largo plazo. En este documento se estudian cómo las inversiones transable y no transable reaccionan de forma asimétrica a choques de TdI. Estimamos un modelo VAR por umbrales (TVAR) en el cual la variable de transición son los TdI. Los resultados sugieren la existencia de dos regímenes (de altos y bajos TdI) y que los choques de TdI producen respuestas asimétricas en la inversión transable y no transable, dependiendo no sólo de la dirección del choque, sino del nivel de TdI desde el cual se parte cuando éste sucede.
P45|Are Rushed Privatizations Substandard? Analyzing Firm-Level Privatization under Fiscal Pressure|In this paper we provide the first analysis of whether rushed privatizations, usually carried out under fiscal duress, increase or decrease firms' efficiency, scale of operation (size) and employment. Using a large panel of firm-level data from Poland over 1995-2015, we show that rushed privatization has negative efficiency, scale and employment effects relative to non-rush privatization. The negative effect of rushed privatization on the scale of operations and employment is even stronger than its negative effect on efficiency. Our results suggest that when policy makers resort to rushed privatization, they ought to weigh these negative effects against other expected effects (e.g. on fiscal revenue).
P45|Plataformas de Capital versus Plataformas Sociales en la Economía Colaborativa: Punto de vista jurídico internacional|In the economy, we distinguish, in a simple way, the strictly capitalist business sector and the corporate social sector. This simple dichotomy has been transferred to the scope of the collaborative economy, which mistakenly includes under the same name capital platforms and social platforms. These platforms have in common different factors, for instance, namely that they essentially use the digital platform to develop their activity; but they differ in that the first ones seek to maximize capital and the platform is a mere messenger that manages economic transactions just like the classical economy. In front of these, there are social platforms in which the main objective is not for profit, although benefits are obtained, the goal being to have a social impact, at the same time that it provides services or products to the users, following specific values. On the one hand, it is necessary to analyze the legal structure of these platforms. The capitalist economy has as a leading actor the mercantile company, while the social economy is based on cooperatives, associations, foundations. The last assertion does not imply that limited companies of social economy exist in comparative law. On the other hand, is very important to determine the legal position of the parties or participants in the collaborative economy and the value of their agreements, especially in situations where does not exist peer-to-peer. In particular, our study aims to focus on contractual and noncontractual relationships exist between the three participants. At this point, we introduce the initial legislative proposals that are being made in the European Union, which specifically wants to protect the consumer, especially online.
P45|Financial Inclusion And Macroeconomic Stability In Emerging And Frontier Markets|Financial inclusion, being considered as a key enabler to reducing poverty and boosting prosperity in emerging and frontier markets such as Vietnam, is the process in which individuals and small businesses are provided with an access to useful and affordable financial products and services. The extant literature on the empirical evidence regarding the contribution of financial inclusion to macroeconomic stability is mixed. This paper investigates the linkages between financial inclusion and macroeconomic stability, which has not yet been thoroughly examined in the literature, for 22 emerging and frontier economies from 2008 to 2015, with particular focus on a potential optimal level. Using the panel threshold estimation technique, the empirical findings show that financial inclusion, as approximated by the growth rate in the number of bank branches over 100,000 account holders, is found to enhance financial stability under a certain threshold. Financial inclusion is also found to be of benefit to maintaining stable inflation and output growth. Policy implications are also discussed on the basis of the important empirical findings.
P45|A regression discontinuity evaluation of reducing early retirement eligibility in Poland|The reform introduced in Poland in 2009 substantially and abruptly reduced the number of workers eligible for early retirement. This paper evaluates the causal effects of this reform on labor force participation and exit to retirement. We use rich rotating panel from the Polish Labor Force Survey and exploit the discontinuity imposed by this reform. We find a statistically significant, but economically small discontinuity at the timing of the reform. The placebo test shows no similar effects in earlier or later quarters, but in a vast majority of specifications the discontinuity is not larger for the treated individuals, i.e. those whose occupation lost eligibility. We interpret these results as follows: the changes in the eligibility criteria were not instrumental in fostering the participation rates among the affected cohort, i.e. the immediate contribution to increased labor force participation of these cohorts is not economically large.
P45|Online and physical appropriation: evidence from a vignette experiment on copyright infringement|"This study employs a vignette experiment to inquire, which features of online ""piracy"" make it ethically discernible from a traditional theft. This question is pertinent since the social norm concerning traditional theft is starkly different from the evidence on ethical evaluation of online ""piracy"". We specifically distinguish between contextual features of theft, such as for example the physical loss of an item, breach of protection, availability of alternatives, emotional proximity to the victim of theft, etc. We find that some of these dimensions have more weight in ethical judgment, but there are no clear differences between online and traditional theft which could explain discrepancy in the frequency of commitment."

P45|Societal benefits and costs of International Investment Agreements: A critical review of aspects and available empirical evidence|This paper reviews alleged societal benefits and costs of International Investment Agreements (IIAs) as suggested by academia, governments, business and civil society. It sets out the wide range of issues that diverse actors have proposed in the context of assessing the societal benefits and costs of IIAs. The paper analyses and organises the available material generated by these sources to identify and classify the many different issues, summarises available empirical evidence and findings in these sources on the individual aspects, and assesses strengths and weaknesses of the approaches. The paper focuses in particular on the investor protection component of IIAs. The inventory finds that for many claims about the positive or negative impact of IIAs, little robust evidence has been generated to date. The paper highlights methodological challenges and suggests areas where further study would be required to draw firmer conclusions.
P45|Cabo Verde Transition Finance Country Pilot|A transition finance country pilot was initiated by the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) in partnership with the government of Cabo Verde. The study aims to capture the challenges facing Cabo Verde following graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) to Lower Middle Income Category (LMIC), including the shifting financing for sustainable development landscape, the mounting risk of debt distress and the economic and environmental vulnerabilities as a Small Island Developing States (SIDS). In line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA), the pilot study proposes a new “ABC” approach targeted to assess all available sources of financing (ODA, OOF, private investment, domestic resources, and remittances), identify emerging SDG financing gaps and promote better alignment of resources with national financing for sustainable development strategies.
P45|OECD Progress Update on Approaches to Mobilising Institutional Investment for Sustainable Infrastructure|The large need for investments in sustainable infrastructure will require investments from the private sector, including institutional investors. This working paper contributes to scaling up investments by analysing public project-level interventions for projects involving institutional investors. It presents findings from an updated database on institutional investments in environmentally sustainable infrastructure with project-level intervention by the public sector.
P45|The Lights of Iraq: Electricity Usage and the Iraqi War-fare Regime|This article explores the lights of Iraq, Iraq's variety of capitalism (VoC) and its system of public and fiscal governance. The first section examines Iraq's VoC, which I define oil-led state-captured capitalism with associated oil-led state-captured war-fare regime. In formerly ISIS-occupied territories, war developments turned the system into an Insurgent ISIS-captured capitalism with associated Insurgent ISIS-captured war-fare regime. The second section investigates electricity usage. The nighttime lights analysis is based on near real-time big data. It includes high-resolution remote-sensing and satellite imagery from the NASA Earth Observatory. I use the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor on the Suomi NPP satellite. Data on greenhouse gases are obtained through the AQUA and TERRA satellites derived from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. I also use the AURA satellite with the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) sensor, as well as the TERRA satellite with the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) sensor. The third part discusses the repercussions of electricity usage for good governance, for good regulatory and for good fiscal practices, as well as for development and growth. The concluding part briefly discusses the “taxman approach” and the introduction of a new fiscal contract necessary to resolve negative incentives in oil-led war economies.
P45|India's Recent Inward Foreign Direct Investment: An Assessment|Most often the reported FDI flows are accepted unquestioningly and are analysed and interpreted in a simplistic manner in spite of their many nuances. The discovery of some serious limitations and specific features of India’s FDI inflows adds a hitherto little discussed dimension which impacts the understanding of the flows significantly. The study, India’s Recent Inward Foreign Direct Investment: An Assessment, published in July 2018, vividly explains the various shortcomings and special features of the data using multiple examples and case studies and demonstrates that the annual aggregates cannot provide adequate guidance regarding the year-to-year changes. Nor do they truly reflect capacity creation in the economy. The problem turns out to be more acute at the sectoral level. The study conveys a strong message that the reporting mechanism and analysis have to be reshaped drastically in order to provide reliable guidance to policymakers and other national and international users. It could provide a template for understating the inflows into developing countries, in general.
P45|Modification of the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) on Indonesia's trade, investment, and industrial incentive policies|This paper modifies the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) method and applies it on Indonesia's trade, investment, and industrial incentive policies. First, it analyses the Indonesian Bilateral Trade Agreements (BTAs) utilizing trade and investment agreement. Indonesia currently has two BTAs in force. One, Indonesia – Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (IJEPA) and two, Indonesia – Pakistan Preferential Trade Agreement (IP-PTA). This paper found that the outcome expectation for trading partner depends on its GNI per capita. If the trading partner has GNI per capita higher than Indonesia’s then the highest expected outcome would be on the increasing FDI inflows from the trading partner. If its GNI per capita is lower than Indonesia's, then the highest foreseeable result would be on the rising net trade balance of Indonesia. Second, industrial sector incentive analysis by comparing RIA scores on all possible incentive policies. In this paper, the modified RIA found that firms prefer supply-side incentives such as government support on the Research and Development, patent and copyright protection than fiscal incentives such as the import duty-free or tariff rate protection.
P45|Econometric modelling of the link between investment and electricity consumption in Ghana|The study examines the long run effect of investment (proxied by gross fixed capital formation) on electricity consumption for Ghana, for the period 1971-2011, by employing annual time series secondary data from World Bank database (World development indicator). The Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Kwiatkowski-Philips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests were used to analyse the stationarity features of the data used in levels and in their first differences. The empirical verification was done using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag model (ARDL). The findings of the study indicate the data used are non-stationary in levels, however, stationary in their first difference. Investment and electricity consumption are cointegrated according to the cointegration test performed. There are both stable short run and long run relationship between investment and electricity consumption. Investment is an appropriate policy tool for electricity consumption management in both short run and long run. Further studies in the area of stationarity with structural breaks, cointegration with structural breaks, causality analysis, and multivariate modelling of investment-electricity consumption link is worth doing since the current study did not consider these issues.
P45|A Comparison of Global Governance Across Sectors: Global Health, Trade, and Multilateral Development Finance|While several studies have traced the development of various intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), charting their growth and influence in international affairs, and assessing their prospects, few if any have compared IGOs across various fields. We take a closer look at three different policy fields to better understand the current architecture of global governance, the centrality of IGOs, the role of new and other actors, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of this “new” architecture. We find that, first, the emergence of new private players has significantly eroded the centrality of IGOs such that the course of global governance in health, trade, and development finance has changed irreversibly. Second, regional arrangements have overtaken global ones and nonstate actors have assumed more prominent roles. Third, this multiplicity of powerful players has led to some positive outcomes but also greater inefficiencies and redundancies. Fourth, developed countries have been pivotal in eroding the centrality of IGOs, but developing countries are taking on a greater role in global governance. Fifth, the new architecture can be described as one of diversification in global health governance, fragmentation in global trade, and variation in multilateral development finance. Global governance in the 21st century is thus characterized by a proliferation of actors and a decentralization of authority, an erosion of IGO centrality accompanied by a greater role for nonstate actors, developing countries, and by increased regionalism. Depending on the sector of governance, its inherent aims, and the nature of the actors involved, the new architecture may be one of variation, fragmentation, or diversification. While this new architecture is complex and might possibly lead to inefficiencies and redundancies, it allows a greater number of actors to participate, making it more representative of the current world order and making it possible to mobilize more resources to promote development.
P45|Redirecting investment for a global food system that is sustainable and promotes healthy diets|More and better quality private sector investment in food systems will be needed if countries are to achieve their Sustainable Development Goals. The key challenge addressed in this paper is how investment in food systems can be redirected such that it is both adequate to drive dynamic food system development and has the quality of promoting inclusive and sustainable systems. Three areas of action are considered: instruments that translate growing consumer awareness of the sustainability aspects of food system development into SDG compliant investment; instruments that encourage investment in food systems in high-risk contexts; and improvements to food system governance. The paper articulates three key areas in which the G20 should take action: (i) to strengthen global platforms for the benchmarking and coordination of private sector sustainability initiatives; (ii) to provide support to the coordinated implementation of voluntary guidelines to foster SDG-compliant investment in higher risk contexts; and (iii) to promote greater coordination between multilateral fora to strengthen the global governance of complex and interlinked food system challenges.
P45|Digital connectivity & e-commerce: Overview of financing flows and examples of aid for trade support|Digital networks are an increasingly critical component of global trade. In 2017, the Global Review of Aid for Trade highlighted the importance of accessible and affordable connections for trade connectivity. Drawing extensively on information harvested in the Monitoring and Evaluation exercise in preparation for the Review, this paper analyses aid for trade for digital connectivity and e-commerce. Also presented in this paper are the types of issues and challenges faced in cross-border electronic transactions - an area in which demand for support is set to grow. The paper also surveys flows reported to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Creditor Reporting System. Funds disbursed to digital connectivity amounted to US$6.6 billion in concessional financing and US$8.3 billion in non-concessional financing in the period 2006-2016. The top providers of financing were the European Union, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the World Bank Group. The paper also highlights the various methodological difficulties encountered, and explains the need to further refine reporting definitions so as to better capture financing flows to digital connectivity and to understand how aid for trade is being used to leverage private sector financing for ICT. The analysis concludes by reviewing the catalytic role that aid for trade is playing in mobilizing private sector financing. Research for the 2017 Global Review suggests that both developing countries and donors view ICT connectivity as an area where demand for financing will grow in future.
P45|Análisis del comercio internacional colombiano y diversificación de exportaciones (2002-2015): Canadá, Estados Unidos y Unión Europea|En este documento se realiza una descripción de los indicadores relacionados con el comercio exterior colombiano durante el período 2002-2015. Particularmente, se presenta el perfil comercial, indicadores de concentración y/o diversificación del comercio (por sectores, rama de actividad, producto y socios comerciales) e indicadores de sofisticación de exportaciones. Así mismo, se desarrolla una sección orientada al potencial exportador con mercados específicos (Canadá, Estados Unidos y la Unión Europea). A nivel de sectores, los resultados muestran el predominio de las exportaciones mineras, las cuales alcanzaron en el año 2015 el 48,4%, mientras las exportaciones del sector agropecuario e industrial representaron en promedio el 56,6% durante el período de análisis. En cuando al grado de concentración y/o diversificación por ramas de actividad, para el año 2015 se concluye que la canasta exportadora se puede considerar moderadamente diversificada, en tanto que las importaciones se consideran diversificadas. En lo relacionado con el potencial exportador, se identifica alta complementariedad comercial en las ramas relacionadas con productos de molinería, vidrio, producción agrícola y pecuaria con los mercados de Canadá y la Unión Europea. Mientras en el comercio con Estados Unidos, se encuentra alta complementariedad comercial únicamente en ramas relacionadas con la actividad minera.
P45|How did Japanese exports evolve from 1995 to 2014? A spatial econometric perspective|Spatial econometric techniques can eliminate the bias when spatial effects are neglected. However, so far there is no research on investigating the spatial configuration of Japanese exports and determinants of its exports to sustain its exports competitiveness.
P45|Internationalization of Indian multinational enterprises - motivations, strategies and regulation from the experience of Indian investments - a focus on Europe|This paper makes a critical assessment of Indian companies’ internationalization experience. It introduces a new theoretical framework in order to go beyond classical notion based on western companies’ global aspirations. Besides the theoretical modifications the paper provides an empirical collection about those successful Indian internationalization projects that sought to enter the European market. The question to be answered here is whether Indian firms are able to compete out dominant western companies in an increasingly multipolar world economy in the future. By applying the modified method on the question of internationalization from developing companies’ point of view, the aim of the paper is to detect future world economic trends to which Indian companies will need to accommodate themselves.
P45|South Africa - a re-emerging player in outward FDI|Since 1994 South Africa has been successfully reintegrated into the world economy and has become a capital exporter country. The main carriers of outward FDI are South African multinationals which are not newcomers in the international arena as they started to be internationalised earlier than other emerging markets' MNEs. Their investment decisions are mainly driven by home country push factors fuelled by the economic, social and political legacy of the apartheid regime, however, market, efficiency and strategic asset seeking strategies also play a role. Efficiency seeking motives are expected to become stronger leading to increasing international orientation, development of alliances and networks outside of the country. Though the main destinations of FDI outflow are traditionally the European countries, especially the UK, the Sub-Saharan African region is a developing location as South Africa is aspiring for regional hegemony.
P45|Real exchange rate policies for economic development|This paper analyzes the role of real exchange rate (RER) policies in promoting economic development. Markets provide a suboptimal amount of investment in sectors characterized by learning spillovers. We show that a stable and competitive RER policy may correct for this externality and other related market failures. The resulting development of these sectors leads to overall faster economic growth. A system of effectively multiple exchange rates is required when spillovers across different tradable sectors differ. The impact of RER policies is increased when they are complemented by traditional industrial policies that increase the elasticity of the aggregate supply to the RER. Among the instruments required to implement a stable and competitive RER are interventions in the foreign exchange market and regulation of capital flows. We also discuss the trade-offs associated with alternative stable and competitive RER policies and the relationship between the use of exchange rate policies for macro-stability and for development.
P45|Russia-EU28 and Russia-China trade interdependence vs. the competitiveness of the Russian economy|Research background: The actual position of a country in the international division of labour is determined by the competitiveness of its trade, the structure of which may both reveal and perpetuate the comparative advantages possessed. This is particularly true for Dutch disease economies such as Russia. Recently, economic literature has seen a growing interest in the topic of Russia’s economic relations with the European Union and China. This article is meant to be the author’s contribution to this discussion. Purposes of the article: (1) to discuss the existing trade interdependence between Russia and EU28, and Russia and China; (2) to try to assess the extent to which the current structure of Russian trade with these two partners corresponds with the competitiveness of the Russian economy. Methodology/methods: An in-depth analysis of Russia-EU28 and Russia-China trade interdependencies in 2007-2015 has been conducted, with emphasis on the categories of goods within the spectrum from low-tech to high-tech, according to the OECD classification. Furthermore, in order to analyse Russia’s competitive profile with regard to the same categories of goods, Balassa’s methodology of revealed comparative advantages has been applied. Findings & Value added: In the recent years, a growing importance of China in Russian trade can be observed, being the effect of dynamic growth of Chinese economy, cooling political relations between Moscow and Brussels and the drop in petroleum prices in international markets. Sadly, the existing structure of Russian trade with EU28 and China seems likely to preserve its traditional competitive advantages in the medium-low-tech goods and petroleum, which, in turn, will only further exacerbate the negative effects of the so-called Dutch disease affecting the Russian economy.
P45|FDI and economic growth: Evidence on the Role of the Size of Natural Resource Sector|This paper uses a threshold regression model and split the sample into groups of low-natural resource and high-natural resource groups. This paper used data from 70 countries for the period 1996-2015 and found evidence that FDI has a positive impact on economic growth of the host country if the host country’s natural resource sector is below the threshold. However, FDI inflow doesn’t have any significant impact on growth in countries with natural resource sector larger than the threshold.
P45|FDI and Economic Growth: A Changing Relationship Across Country and Overtime|In this paper, we use a threshold regression model to estimate a threshold level of natural resource abundance and split the sample of 70 countries into groups of low-natural resource and high-natural resource groups. We found evidence that FDI has a positive impact on economic growth of the host country if the host country’s natural resource sector is below the threshold. However, FDI inflow doesn’t have any significant impact on growth in countries with natural resource sector larger than the threshold. In the end, we apply a Markov regime switching model (MSM) to a time series data from Pakistan and found that Pakistan’s economy experienced 2 states. While in the state 1 the economy didn’t experience any FDI induced economic growth, it did receive a strong FDI induced economic growth in state 2.
P45|Implications of Brexit to the Asia-Pacific region: with a focus on least developed countries|Brexit might affect exports of some countries in the Asia-Pacific region disproportionately more than others. Simulation results, under different Brexit scenarios, show that the potential reduction in trade faced by least developed countries (LDCs) of the region can range from 16% to 50% of their current export value to the UK in key sectors such as fish, clothes, textiles and footwear. Simulations also show that it is the larger developing countries from the region that would benefit from any trade diversion that ensues in these sectors. Countries with higher exposure to Brexit induced risks need to engage in deeper analyses of the extent of such impacts and brace themselves for proactive discussions with the UK in order to limit negative impacts.
P45|Togo: Political and Socio-Economic Development (2015 – 2017)|The presidential elections of 25 April 2015 resulted in a victory for the incumbent, Faure Gnassingbé. Thus, he secured his third five-year term, consolidating the Gnassingbé-clan’s grip on power. The latter have ruled the country since 1967. In view of the ruling party’s absolute parliamentary majority, further meaningful constitutional and electoral reforms that would have been required for free and fair elections have been postponed indefinitely. Overriding concerns for stability in West Africa in view of the growing threat from Islamist terrorist organizations, combined with Togo’s role as contributor of soldiers meant that the international community largely ignored the government’s indefinite postponement of democratic reforms and local elections. However, the simmering discontent of hardliners within the security forces and the ruling party remained evident. The opposition tried unsuccessfully to overcome internal divisions between its moderate and radical wings. An alliance of opposition parties and civil society groups organized frequently peaceful demonstrations in opposition to the regime, which were violently suppressed. Yet, the human rights record of the government has improved but remains poor. A tense political climate persisted due to the presidential elections in April 2015, and the apparent determination of the president to stay in power for a third and possible a fourth term whatever the cost. Despite undeniable improvements to the framework and appearance of the regime’s key institutions during the review period, democracy remains far from complete. However, the international community, notably Togo’s African peers, the AU and ECOWAS, as well as the Bretton-Woods Institutions, China and the European Union (EU), followed a ‘laissez faire’ approach in the interests of regional stability and their national interests in dealing with Togo. Economic growth remained stable at about 5% per annum. Public investment in infrastructure (e.g. roads, harbor) and increases in agricultural productivity, notably of export crops, had been the key drivers of economic growth. However, growth remains vulnerable to external shocks and the climate and has not been inclusive. Positive growth was overshadowed by increasing inter-personal and regional inequality as well as an increase in extreme poverty. Moreover, money laundering and illegal money transfers grew alarmingly. The business climate improved considerably nevertheless. Though the World Bank still defines Togo as low income, fragile stat, the government aims to achieve the status of a developing economy.
P45|A Look to The Ottoman Cash Waqfs As Altruistic Finance Model|Although the waqfs have existed with the history of humanity and are useful in all societies, they had different role and place in Islamic societies. The waqfs have made institutionalized cooperation and solidarity among people. Especially in Islamic societies, great importance has been attached to waqfs. The waqfs that helped institutionalize the concept of infaq met many needs of the community. One of the Islamic states where the foundations are very active was the Ottoman Empire. The size of the waqf services in the Ottoman Empire expanded so much that, besides the human services, waqfs for injured birds and sick animals were established. The fact that the waqfs are so widespread in the state has made it possible to refer to the Ottoman Empire as a waqf civilization. One of the waqf types operating in the Ottoman Empire was the cash waqfs (CWs) which were made up of cash in the capital. The CWs operated the cash that made up its capital with various Islamic finance methods. Revenues from the operating money were used in the direction of waqf purpose. The CWs provided the vital necessities of the society such as education and religion in the period they were active in the Ottoman Empire. Another function of these waqfs was to operate as a micro-credit mechanism. Through these waqfs, the surplus and the accumulated savings in the hands of the asset owners were made available to merchants, farmers, craftsmen, and artisans. Hence, these waqfs have served as resource transfer channels as well as functioning as a charity in the society. The ultimate goal of CWs, which is the pioneer of modern interest-free financial institutions today, is different from these institutions. The CWs did not transfer the profits they got to the waqf founder or owner. The income obtained has been spent to fulfill the charitable services in the direction of the waqf purposes. Therefore, these institutions created Altruistic Finance Model operating within the borders of Islamic prohibitions and orders. In our study, the financial mentality of the Ottoman society in the context of the CWs and how this mentality shaped the CWs will be discussed.
P45|Push Factors of Emerging Multinational Corporations: Evidence from South Africa and Egypt|As literature remains sparse regarding emerging African multinational corporations (EAMNCs), this article focuses on examining the key push factors (i.e. home country macroeconomic specifications) influencing the outward foreign direct investment flow from South Africa and Egypt. Based on dynamic panel data model estimation, the empirical research proves that trade openness, patent and the gross domestic product (GDP) and the GDP growth rate of South Africa and Egypt are dominant drivers of their outward foreign direct investment. In contrast, the number of investment treaties and inward foreign direct investment rate do not significantly influence outbound investment decisions of South African and Egyptian corporations.
P45|Foreign Market Selection of Emerging Multinational Corporations: Evidence from South African and Egyptian Corporations|As literature remains sparse regarding emerging African multinational corporations (EAMNCs), this article focuses on examining the key pull factors (i.e. host country macroeconomic specifications) influencing the foreign market selection of South African and Egyptian multinational corporations as a case study of EAMNCs. Based on estimation of Random Effect and Negative Binomial models, it has been found that the market size, resources endowment and proximity between home and host country are significant pull drivers of both Egyptian and South African MNCs. While not affecting Egyptian MNCs, assets availability, trade openness, the service sector quality, export to host country and the official exchange rate of the receiving destination and quality of institutions have an influential impact on foreign market selection of the South African investors. Inflation neither affects the attention of Egyptian firms nor South Africans to choose a certain market to invest in.

P45|Relationship between good governance and economic growth - A contribution to the institutional debate about state failure in developing countries|Numbers of economists of development consider that good governance, defined as the quality management and orientation of development policies has a positive influence on economic performance. The question is what content the literature gives to the concept of governance? According to the World Bank, good governance is evaluated by the implementation capacity of governance principles of a country, providing a framework for market development and economic growth. Several econometric studies (Kauffman et al. (1999, 2005), Knack et al. (1999) tested the relationship between good governance in the sense of ”market-enhancing governance” (stimulus institutions market) and showed a positive relationship between good governance and economic growth. However a good governance policy is allows developing countries to achieve minimum economic growth and political reforms in order to reach a level of development similar to that of industrialized countries? We focus on the definition and the work on the concept of good governance made by the World Bank and criticism formulated by Mushtaq Khan (2002.2004), who reconstructed the notion of governance in a broader sense, taking into account the capacity of states to drive structural change in institutional, political, economic and social fields, in order to ensure longterm economic growth. Is good governance can explain economic performance? Or according to the thesis of Mushtaq Khan (2002, 2004), reforms of economic structures and government capabilities are the first step to improve economic performance of developing countries, and in a second step to allow economic growth to enhance good governance? Following several works of neo-institutionalist economists on the relationship between economic growth and good governance (Kauffman D. and al.1999, 2005, Knack S. and Keefer P. 1997, Hall, R. Jones, C.1999, Clague, C. Keefer P., Knack S. and Olson M., 1997, Barro R., 1996, Rodrick D., 1995, 1997, and 2002) emerged two divergent theories of ”state failure” in developing countries: The first thesis (market Enhancing governance) defended by neo-institutionalist authors consider the state as a sovereign role and welfare state. Economically, the proper functioning of markets is correlated to the proper functioning of institutions through efficient practice of state governance, what is commonly called ”good governance”. Therefore, underdevelopment and low economic growth performance of countries could be explained by a ”state failure” and the components of good governance with the increase in corruption, instability of property rights, market distortions, and lack of democracy. The second thesis (growth Enhancing governance) developed in particular by Mushtaq Khan (1995, 2004, 2005, 2006) and partly by Dany Rodrik (1995,1997,2002), concerns the ability of the state to implement social change and a voluntary policy of economic development: The transition of developing countries towards a capitalist system comparable to that of developed countries, can not operate without the establishment of efficient institutions in relation with distribution of political power in these countries. Conversely, those countries would face a state failure, as a result of a mismatch between institutions and economic policy for development. Our research consists first to present the results of an empirical model that we have done based on a panel of developing countries chosen by region (MENA, Latin America, and Asia) and due to their natural resource endowment. The aim is to check if growth rate may or may not be correlated with good governance indicators as defined by the World Bank. The goal is to lead in a second time an analysis of criticism made by Mushtaq Khan on the definition of governance, the causes of state failure and barriers to economic development. Our contribution is to discuss the concept of good governance and the failure of states that take into account the level of development and governance capacity that is based on a structure and distribution of political power that evolves in time and may or may not be positive for growth. The assumption we make here is that the so-called good governance policies are relevant if countries reach a sound level of economic and social development that enable institutions of good governance to boost growth.
P45|Federalism and Foreign Direct Investment: How Political Affiliation Determines the Spatial Distribution of FDI – Evidence from India|This paper links the foreign economic engagement of India's states with the literature on federalism, thereby contributing to an understanding of the political economy of FDI inflows in a parliamentary federal system. More specifically, it studies subnational governments' international engagements to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and investigates whether the political affiliations of states' chief ministers and parliamentarians determine the spatial distribution of FDI across the Indian states, correcting for the influence of per capita income, population density, urbanisation, infrastructure, policy regime, and human development. Although the central government plays no direct role in determining the state to which FDI goes, the centre-state relations in a federal structure play a role in creating perceptions about the relative political risk involved in different investment destinations. Employing multiple linear regressions to analyse time-series (2000-2013) cross-sectional (12 states) data using the panel procedure, the study finds that affiliated states attract relatively more FDI per capita in comparison to states ruled by opposition parties or coalition partners. However, some exceptions do result, primarily due to two phenomena: first, the presence of a strong state leadership and, second, the presence of a significant share of members of parliament belonging to the prime minister's party in the non-affiliated states. Further, states ruled by outside supporters have been most successful in attracting FDI inflows during the coalition period.
P45|Más allá del posdesarrollo: avances hacia un sistema de cooperación sostenible|Con este artículo se ha pretendido refutar la autoridad del discurso posestructuralista como alternativa al desarrollo. Haciendo uso del aparato analítico del enfoque de las capacidades se corroboró como desde la concepción de desarrollo como libertad se consigue superar, sin necesidad de abandonarse al relativismo epistémico de la corriente posdesarrollista, el reduccionismo analítico de las teorías contemporáneas de desarrollo. De tal examen se concluyó que frente a las tesis posmodernas, la teoría de las capacidades es no solo más coherente normativamente, sino que también lo puede ser en términos operativos. Para esto último, se incorporan conceptos inéditos como la soft action (acción suave) y la “trampa de no desarrollo” con el que superar así, analíticamente, algunas de las barreras empíricas (fundamentalmente el fetichismo de la mercancía) que pudieran obstaculizar el éxito de un marco de cooperación (sostenible) adaptado a los retos del desarrollo como libertad.
P45|Regional Integration of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community: An Analysis of Malaysia - Association of Southeast Asian Nations Exports|Malaysia is a rapid growing economy especially in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region. The exports with ASEAN countries plays vital role in economic growth and development of Malaysia. Additionally, current chairmanship of ASEAN makes Malaysia more prominent in the region. Consequently, exploring the determinants of Malaysia - ASEAN-5 countries, namely Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippine and Vietnam exports performance is a fundamental objective of this study. The panel data of Malaysia and other ASEAN-5 countries for the period 1990- 2013 and renowned international trade model “gravity” has been applied to explore the determinants. The results of the study explore that distance, population size, economic size and exchange rate are the significant potential determinants of Malaysia – ASEAN exports during the period of study. The findings of this study provide lucid and wide range policies for Malaysian government to boost the economic growth and development through exports promotion with ASEAN countries.
P45|Foreign Investment Promotion Analysis in Sultanate of Oman: The Case of Dhofar Governorate|The stiff rate of competition among the developing countries to attract foreign investments in the regions of their countries has created the deeper understanding of the main foreign direct investment incentive. It is obvious that the foreign investment became a priority for most of the governments. This research paper aimed at examining the main approaches and factors in foreign investment promotion within Dhofar Governorate in Sultanate of Oman. Data collected from relevant scholarly papers and government reports, interviews with officials in charge of foreign investment promotion and the conclusions from participation in meetings and public debates have been utilized in the analysis. Economic and political stability are among the factors which actually motive foreigners to invest in the region. Additionally, high purchasing power, a big market size and low cost of doing business in the region has been reported to be very desirable. It is evidence that the government from Sultanate of Oman have promoted aspects of foreign investments by offering a number of incentives such as favorable government policies and laws, and offering lower tax rates, creating free zones, business incubators, etc.
P45|Trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights agreements and the upsurge in foreign direct investment in developing countries|Globalization has brought about remarkable growth in worldwide foreign direct investment (FDI), especially in developing countries. Many previous papers have examined the drivers of FDI inflows to developing countries. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to relationships between TRIPS (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement and FDI. This paper examines whether TRIPS have spurred a sharp rise in FDI in developing countries. The research presented in this paper addresses the 1985 to 2012 time period to comprehensively examine the impact of TRIPS on inward FDI in 23 developing countries via Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Fixed Effects (FE) and System Generalized Method of Moments (System GMM) techniques. The empirical results show that enforcement of the TRIPS agreement constitutes a driving force of FDI in host countries. In addition, such effects vary with host country characteristics.
P45|US Antidumping Petitions and Revealed Comparative Advantage of Shrimp Exporting Countries|The paper explores the trade competitiveness of seven major shrimp exporting countries, namely Vietnam, China, Thailand, Ecuador, India, Indonesia and Mexico, to the USA. Specifically, we investigate whether the United States (US) antidumping petitions impact upon the bilateral revealed comparative advantage (RCA) indexes for each of the seven shrimp exporting countries with the USA. Monthly data from January 2003 to December 2014 and the panel data model are used to examine the determinants of the RCA for the shrimp exporting countries. The empirical results show the shrimp exporting countries have superior competitiveness against the shrimp market in the USA. Moreover, the RCA indexes are significantly negatively influenced by shrimp prices, and are positively affected by US income per capita. However, the EMS (Early Mortality Syndrome) shrimp disease, domestic US shrimp quantity, exchange rate, and US antidumping laws are found to have no significant impacts on the RCA indexes. In terms of policy implications, the USA should try to reduce production costs of shrimp in the US market instead of imposing antidumping petitions, and the shrimp exporting countries should maintain their comparative advantage and diversify into new markets.
P45|The EU-China bilateral investment treaty: objectives, actual stage of negotiations and possible risks|This paper is based on three major motivations. First, its role is to emphasize that investment has become one of the pillars of EU-China bilateral relationship, although the value of two-way investment flows remain well below that of bilateral trade. Second, it reveals the main objectives of the European Commission in the negotiations for a bilateral investment Agreement with China. Three of them are common to classical investment agreements, however the fourth objective, representing, In fact, the main goal of the EU, is a novelty and is aimed at enabling EU investors entering the Chinese market by reduced access barriers. In its turn, China pursues two main objectives: clarity and transparency in investment relations with the EU, by replacing individual agreements with the existing one, along with gaining access to sensitive sectors in the EU. Thus, China can continue its process of investment diversification, which would facilitate access to famous brands, advanced technology and larger market shares in developed countries. Third, this analysis points out that the targets pursued by both China and the EU through this Agreement are difficult to achieve and there is still a long way to go before the conclusion and implementation of the EU-China bilateral investment agreement, taking into account not only the sensitive issues in the bilateral relationship, but also the need of ratification by national parliaments and approval by the European Parliament and the EU Council.
P45|Problems Of Attracting Of Foreign Direct Investments In Ukraine|In this article there is analyzed the foreign direct investments inflows dynamics in Ukraine e. It is identified that the main investors in Ukrainian economy are offshore countries and this is the trend for the last decade. It is demonstrated that the most investment attracted spheres of Ukrainian economic activity are economically inefficient. It is presented the dynamics of international ratings estimating ease of doing business in Ukraine and the level of its financial solvency. There are also analyzed the trends in legislative field for Ukrainian economic activity stimulation.
P45|Does Stock Market Development Play Any Role In The Effect Of Fdi On Economic Growth In Nigeria? An Empirical Investigation|The objective of the paper is to investigate whether stock market development plays any role in the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic growth in Nigeria. Using annual time series data that span the period from 1981 to 2014, and employing the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) estimation technique, the empirical evidence indicates that FDI, domestic investment and stock market development positively and significantly affect economic growth, but the effect of the interaction between stock market development and FDI on economic growth is negative and significant, indicating that the Nigerian bourse is not yet fully developed to engender positive growth effect of FDI. The study further finds that government consumption expenditure and trade openness adversely affect the growth of the country’s real GDP per capita. Recommendations of the paper include efforts by the government to design and implement programmes and policies aimed at enhancing the attractiveness of the country to foreign and local investors, efforts by capital market regulators to enhance stock market efficiency, reduction of government consumption expenditures and import control.
P45|Emerging Multinational Corporations: Theoretical and Conceptual Framework|Given the looming significance of emerging multinational corporations, this article outlines the primary theoretical aspects pertaining to this growing phenomenon. The following four main aspects are covered: The concept of emerging multinational corporations, theories explaining their evolution, market penetration modes, and finally the types of such firms. Based on the motive of multinationality, it is proposed to classify the different theories into three groups, namely: Firm advantages (asset exploiting), host country advantages (asset seeking), and both firm and host country advantages. This article distinguishes between 10 different types of emerging multinational corporations, based on the timing and the motives for initiating the multinationality process, the relation between the headquarters and affiliates, and the geographical dispersion of foreign activities. Entry modes adopted by emerging multinational corporations vary significantly according to ownership, the nature of overseas’ operations, the control of parent firms over these activities, and the extent of externalising and internalising.
P45|Emerging Multinational Corporations: A Prominent Player in the Global Economy|As emerging market multinational corporations (EMNCs) tend to remarkably expand their global presence, it is of the utmost importance to explore the salient attributes of such unfolding phenomenon. One of the key findings is that top EMNCs are displaying a leapfrogging internationalisation process. Moreover, natural resources related sectors, in particular energy, have been proven to dominate the non-financial industry structure of EMNCs. In addition, various interesting findings have been concluded by this article. Regarding the preferred destination for their outward foreign direct investment (OFDI), EMNCs currently tend to invest more in developing markets. However, the relevance of developed markets is growing over time. Available statistics furthermore exhibit that greenfield is often preferred above mergers and acquisitions (M&As) as an entry mode into developing markets. The opposite is true in developed markets. EMNCs are domiciled predominantly in BRICS countries which account collectively for most of the OFDI getting from EMs. Emerging African MNCs are dramatically losing ground in the EMNC landscape. Regarding internationalisation, ownership, industry and geographical structure and preferred entry modes, remarkable differences are easily seen in the salient features of EMNCs compared to those based in developed markets.
P45|Exports from the Visegrad Group to Latin America - Factors of attractiveness between 2001 and 2013|This paper focuses on the identification of the variables determining the attractiveness of the exports from the Visegrad Group to Latin American and Caribbean countries using methods of economic history and cliometrics. There are a total of twenty-two countries represented over a period of ten years, from 2001 to 2013. It considers institutional and technological variables traditionally not taken into account, such as corruption control, patent applications and FDI inflow per GDP. As shown in the analysis and results presented in this paper, these factors not only point back to traditional variables such as GDP, inflation, population, the share of GDP by sector, etc. but also have an influence in attracting trade flows. This research will also analyze the main export trends from V4 to Latin America and Caribbean in a historical perspective between 2001 and 2013.

P45|Does rising import competition harm local firm productivity in less advanced economies? Evidence from the Vietnam's manufacturing sector| This paper examines whether rising import penetration has an effect on the productivity of domestic firms. The study uses data on a 10-year unbalanced panel of firms in the manufacturing sector in Vietnam from 2000 to 2009. Panel and instrumental variable methods are used to control firm heterogeneity and endogeneity of import penetration. We find statistically significant and negative effects of import competition on local firms’ productivity, but the effect in terms of magnitude is economically small. Further investigation shows no clear evidence of variations in the effects by firm size and technological level. However, we find that rising import penetration is associated with the likelihood of firm death.

P45|Challenges, Performances and Tendencies in Organisation Management|The field of management is, without a doubt, one of the most important and fastest changing fields in today's society. There is not any organisational structure — families, enterprises, towns, industries, countries, for example — which performs well without good management. For this reason, many resources are allocated to improve the management in the largest companies and also to management research/education and training.

P45|What drives China’s outward direct investment?|This study examines the determinants of China’s outward direct investment (ODI) between 2003 and 2009. We first analyse the structure and dynamics of ODI. We propose three testable hypotheses including technology sourcing, resource seeking, and political linkage. Various estimates show that technology sourcing is supported moderately, whereas resource seeking serves one of primary driving forces. Crucially, the motive of political linkage is significantly related to ODI and it is particularly relevant to developing destinations. This finding indicates that China tends to invest in developing countries with high political risk, which is in contrast with the prediction of the FDI theory. Furthermore, a developing country with high political risk seems to be the favoured destination for China’s ODI to acquire technologies and resources.
P45|Globalization and the transmission of social values: The case of tolerance|Tolerance – respecting those who are different – is arguably of particular importance in an era of globalization, where a potential for economic, social and personal development is increasingly a function of interaction with others different from oneself. We investigate whether globalization induces parents to want to instill tolerance in their children, the main idea being that this quality would equip children for greater success in a more integrated world. Using a survey measure, we indeed find that globalization enhances the willingness to transmit such social values. More precisely, economic and social, but not to the same extent political, globalization has this effect, as shown by using the KOF Index of Globalization in regression analysis of up to 59 countries. Extreme bounds analysis and outlier tests indicate robustness. Overall, our results suggest that certain kinds of globalization seem able to shape values in ways considered desirable by many.
P45|The foreign direct investment flows and the national economic evolution|This paper analyzes the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) potential in supporting the economic growth on the national level using CEEC case studies. The analysis is based on the FDIâ€“GDP growth rate relationship and highlights the national policy coping to the challenge of attracting further FDI, as it is shown by development indicators. Authors correlate the FDI path to the GDP and exports rate, reflecting the economic growth in the last decade. This paper is based on three-tier approach. Firstly, relying on international trade and Eurostat statistics there are shown trends on the evolution and structure of trade that might have been influenced by higher FDI in certain areas. Secondly, the paper shows the increasing FDI contribution to the national output on the basis of available official data, using case studies. Thirdly, the results in terms of official statistical data are correlated to information provided by various sources in order to identify the successful sectors and also the sectors confronted to competitiveness difficulties. This paper focuses also on the impact of the world economic crisis on the CEEC economies and especially on their exports and FDI inflows.
P45|Fdi Determinants In Brics|In the past two decades the volume of Foreign Direct Investments increased substantially becoming a phenomenon that characterizes the economic environment in the emerging markets. The aim of this working paper is to investigate the Foreign Direct Investments Inflows in the BRICS economies. The research study employs a Panel Data analysis on a sample of 5 countries, the BRICS economies Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa and a time series from 1992-2012. The variables taken in consideration are Trade Openness, GDP per capita, Population, Exchange Rate and Human Capital. Our results indicate that the most significant determinants of FDI Inflows are Trade Openness, GDP per capita and Exchange Rate. The value of this work is that it investigates the factors that contribute to the increase of FDI inflows towards the most important emerging economies in the world.
P45|Revisiting Neoclassical Economic Growth: A Survey in the Literature|During the second half of the twentieth century economists have build newer models of economic growth that consider policy influences of growth and divergent outcomes among countries. These models address issues concerning economic growth, operation of financial markets, trade policy, government expenditures, and taxation. In this essay we have revisited the interdependence of political and economic institutions, taking the neoclassical growth model of Solow (1956) as a point of departure, which maintains that long run economic growth can be explained by capital accumulation, population growth and technological progress. We first discuss the evolution of the neoclassical school of economics in a historical context, and the role of various institutions in engendering economic growth. Subsequently the role of government spending, political stability, property rights and special interest groups (SIG’s) affect economic growth have been discussed, and how these institutions can explain different countries to grow at divergent rates and achieve different levels of wealth.
P45|The Effects of Sporting Success on Stock Returns: An Application in Istanbul Stock Exchange|The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of the match results of open joint football clubs on stock returns. Through the purpose, the results which are obtained in Turkey Super League by Fenerbahçe, Galatasaray, Beþiktaþ and Trabzonspor whose stocks are dealt in Istanbul Stock Exchange (BIST) and stock returns are analyzed in this study. The related teams’ match results and beta coefficients are considered as independent variable whereas stock returns are regarded as dependent variable. The study incorporates 3-year period including 2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2014-2015. In the conclusion of the study in which econometrical modeling is utilized, it is found out that losses have greater impacts on stock returns comparing to deuce and winning. Additionally, it is also established that all kinds of results obtained by Galatasaray club has impact on stock returns on the other hand only the losses results of Fenerbahçe and Trabzonspor have effects on stock returns.
P45|Investment Treaties over Time - Treaty Practice and Interpretation in a Changing World|Investment treaty law reflects a permanent tension between stability and flexibility. Stability nurtures predictability, while flexibility helps legal systems stay in alignment with changing circumstances and evolving needs. This paper establishes an inventory of the mechanisms in investment treaty law that provide flexibility and surveys relevant treaty practice. The paper: analyses the drivers of change in investment treaty law; provides an inventory of countries’ options – and limits – to alter their positioning vis-à-vis investment treaty law through ‘exit’ and ‘voice’; and analyses treaty provisions on, and States’ use of, flexibility in investment treaty law. The paper finds that most treaties provide for little or no mechanism for countries to influence the use and interpretation of investment treaty law. The paper further finds that treaty provisions for ‘exit’ are likewise geared to provide stability rather than flexibility. Analysis of State practice presented in the paper shows that States rarely make use of the mechanisms available to them to influence treaty use and interpretation and that ‘exit’ from the system has likewise been rare so far.
P45|The Actuals of Crowdfunding|The present paper reveals actual facts and challenges of a method of funding relatively new – crowdfunding. Considering the regulations, the concerns, the people’s view and review of the subject, the paper emphasize the present estate of crowdfunding in general and crowdfunding platforms, using the evaluation of cofounders of some crowdfunding platforms. Also, the effects of funds gathering, over the general public, as the crowd and the beneficiary is analyzed. As a conclusion the non-profit phrase and the new update regulation will do much good to the beneficiary of crowdfunding.
P45|American private direct investment in the Philippines after independence|The Philippines has lagged behind East and Southeast Asian economic growth successes in the course of contemporary times. A historical perspective is presented to explain this lag. When the country entered the definite road to independence from American rule in 1934, it adopted a political Constitution that limited foreign capital to a minority role in three industries – land, public utilities, and the exploitation of natural resources. During the colonial period and after political independence in 1946, American foreign direct investment in the country was dominant and large. This continued after independence as US citizens were granted equal rights of Filipinos and American businesses received war damage payments to rehabilitate their investments. This was further helped by bilateral preferential trade with the United States during twenty-eight years of economic adjustment. In actual practice, the restrictive provisions in the Constitution invited many virulent forms of nationalistic economic policies of exclusions of foreigners in other lines of economic activity and led to inward-looking economic development policies. These policies discouraged American foreign direct investments causing disinvestment in key areas. The restrictive economic provisions in the Constitution continue to this day even as the economy is opening more to world markets.
P45|The Basic Concepts and Feature of Bank Liquidity and Its Risk|Liquidity is fundamental to the well-being of financial institutions particularly banking. It determines the growth and development of banks as it ensures proper functioning of financial markets. Inadequacy of liquidity causes adverse effect on the market values of asset.. Therefore studying and understanding liquidity has very important practical implications. However, understanding the term liquidity is an arduous task due the diversity in its meanings and connotations. This paper attempts to examine different liquidity definitions and the concepts as well as discusses sources of liquidity and its risk.
P45|Malaysia NAP: More Shadows than Lights|After World War II, and in particular during the 1960s and the 1970s, many developing countries began their industrial revolution path. In particular, most of them followed a path of government-led industrial development, with central planning at the heart of the industrial policy. Such a model is not new in economic history and it is typical of many ‘second-comers’ in the industrialization process. The most famous one is the case of Prussia/Germany: with the Zollverein (1833-34) and after the unification in 1870, it was the government which stimulated the development of a powerful heavy industrial system, following what was preached at the time by Friedrich List. In particular, the key point of List preaching was that second-comers countries need to protect their industrialization process (characterized by infant industries) from foreign competition. According to List, once the protected industries reach an adequate competitive level, protection should be removed and the national companies should face competition in the market, in order to stimulate further technological development. Many second-comers countries embraced this model; however, in most cases they failed to follow the second part of List’s recommendations: opening to the market in a second stage.
P45|The role of technology and citizens' involvement in smart, inclusive and sustainable urban development|Human participation and the use of technology are considered as key factors for smart and sustainable urban development. Over the past decade, governments, academic community and organized civil society have been turning their attention to solving urban problems with the new tools of advanced technology. Based on three years of R&D, this paper aims to identify crucial factors for citizens’ involvement in development and adoption of smart city services. It will bring out the results of citizens’ involvement in the i-SCOPE project and explore why some European communities have succeeded in involving their citizens, and the others have not.
P45|Methods for regionalizing input-output tables|The present paper introduces the most common methods of regionalizing national input-output tables. First we describe the different groups of methods based on our review of the international literature regarding regionalization. Then we focus on particular methods that can be applied for Hungarian counties highlighting their advantages and disadvantages and synthetize the empirical results of them again based on the literature. On the basis of these experiences we attempt to create a complex method fitted to the available Hungarian regional data. For better understanding in the end we apply our method on an illustrative example consisting of three regions with hypothetical sectors and data.
P45|Economic dimension of the Czech republic`s development assistance-Case study of Serbia|The article deals with the economic dimension of the Czech Republic’s official development assistance. It discusses that aid and trade need not act contradictorily; in fact, they may work complementarily. In particular, the study focuses on the Czech Republic’s bilateral official development assistance towards Serbia, which shows synergic effects of development assistance and business interests. The first part of the paper is concerned with the various forms of private sector involvement in the Czech Republic’s official development assistance. The second part describes the Czech Republic’s official development assistance on the example of Serbia. First, this section concentrates on the Czech Republic’s relationship towards the Western Balkans and its bilateral relationship with Serbia. Afterwards, it regards the particular projects implemented by Czech actors operating in the framework of the official development assistance. Specifically, it deals with three Aid for Trade projects carried out by the Czech Chamber of Commerce and two projects implemented by Czech companies in the region of Pešter/Sandžak and the municipality of Kruščica.
P45|A Post-2015 Monitoring and Accountability Framework|This paper proposes a bottom-up, multi-layered and multi-stakeholder framework for the accountability of the post-2015 agenda. It would be built upon national follow-up processes supported by the UN country teams, and complemented by consultations (and possibly peer reviews) at the regional level, and a global accountability exercised by the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF), with support from the ECOSOC system, UN organizations and other relevant international organizations. It would also be accompanied by parallel accountability mechanisms for civil society and the private sector as key partners in the achievement of the post-2015 development agenda.
P45|Bilateralizing multilateral aid? Aid allocation by World Bank trust funds|Over the last decade, donors of foreign aid quadrupled their annual contributions to trust funds at the World Bank. Concerns have been raised that trust fund aid may undermine the incentives associated with IDA s performance-oriented aid allocation. Moreover, the earmarking of contributions to donors preferred recipient countries might bilateralize multilateral aid, potentially to the detriment of aid effectiveness. Using new data on World Bank trust fund disbursements for the 2002-2012 period, we test whether trust fund aid substitutes for IDA inflows, and, as official narratives suggest, for other aid inflows. We also investigate the bilateralization hypothesis by comparing multilateral core aid to trust fund disbursements. Trust fund aid is generally not allocated according to World Bank s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index, which could undermine the incentives generated of the IDA allocation mechanism. This result is confirmed when we consider the health, education, and environment sector separately using sector-specific CPIA scores and IDA aid. We do not find systematic evidence that trust funds are to a larger degree motivated by political and economic motives.
P45|Risk And Foreign Direct Investment In Romania|This paper tries to present the main categories (types) of risks that affect the inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Romania, such as: country risk, political risk, economic risks, sovereign risks and so on. FDI is an important factor contributing to the economic development and to the economic growth of a country. In order to recuperate its economic handicap as compared to the other countries in the EU, Romania needs a massive inflow of foreign capital, especially in the form of direct investment. The paper also presents the evolution of FDI inflows in Romania and how they were influenced by the main factors affecting the FDI. In principle, between risk and the level of FDI inflows there is a direct dependency relationship: the higher the risk is in a country, the lower the level of FDI inflows is in that country. This is demonstrated by the empirical studies regarding FDI. These studies show that countries with high risk have major difficulties in attracting foreign investment. Therefore, it is important to identify very precisely the main risks that may affect the level of FDI inflows in Romania, in order to propose and implement strategies to mitigate these risks and to attract more foreign direct investment in Romania.
P45|Evaluating Aid for Trade: A Survey of Recent Studies|" type=""main"" xml:id=""twec12138-abs-0001""> The demand for accountability in ‘Aid-for-Trade’ (AFT) is increasing but monitoring has focused on case studies and impressionistic narratives. The paper reviews recent evidence from a wide range of studies, recognising that a multiplicity of approaches is needed to learn what works and what does not. The review concludes that there is some support for the emphasis on reducing trade costs through investments in hard infrastructure (like ports and roads) and soft infrastructure (like customs). But failure to implement complementary reform – especially the introduction of competition in transport services – may erode the benefits of these investments. Direct support to exporters does seem to lead to diversification across products and destinations, but it is not yet clear that these benefits are durable. In general, it is difficult to rely on cross-country studies to direct AFT. More rigorous impact evaluation is an under-utilised alternative, but situations of ‘clinical interventions’ in trade are rare and adverse incentives (due to agency problems) and costs (due to the small size of project) are a hurdle in implementation."
P45|The Development of Accounting Regulation in Iraq and the IFRS Adoption Decision: An Institutional Perspective|This paper reviews the historical development of accounting regulation in Iraq and analyzes, from an institutional perspective, both the decision to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and the factors likely to impact the expansion of IFRS application beyond listed companies. We find that all three forms of institutional isomorphism (coercive, mimetic, and normative) explain the initial decision to adopt IFRS. The most significant force in the decision to adopt IFRS is coercive pressure, from western forces following the fall of the Ba'ath regime, and from international aid organizations. Further, we find that the accounting system in Iraq is likely to be further advanced due to mimetic and normative pressures from Iraq's trade partners, multinational corporations, and the accounting profession. The paper concludes with a discussion of lessons that can assist other developing nations, and in particular countries in the Middle East in their decision to adopt IFRS. It is important that IFRS adoption is accompanied by reform to governance and investor protection regimes, together with investment in education and training to support ongoing implementation. Otherwise, IFRS adoption may be perceived as merely symbolic.
P45|Spurious regressions and near-multicollinearity, with an application to aid, policies and growth|"In multiple regressions, explanatory variables with simple correlation coefficients with the dependent variable below 0.1 in absolute value (such as aid/gross domestic product (GDP) with GDP growth) face a problem of parameter identification. They may have very large, statistically significant, estimated parameters which are unfortunately ""outliers driven"" and spurious. This is obtained by including another regressor which is highly correlated with the initial regressor, such as a lag, a square or interaction terms of this regressor. The analysis is applied on the ""Gambia and Botswana outliers driven"" Burnside and Dollar [2000] article which found that aid/GDP had an effect on growth only for countries achieving ""good"" macroeconomic policies."

P45|Raising Of Competitiveness Of Export-Oriented Industries – Economic Priorities Of National Importance|Creating a highly competitive economy is a goal of every country. However, even after more than 10 years of transition, competitiveness of our economy is extremely low according to all criteria and indicators recognized by relevant institutions. Incomplete and inefficient structural reforms in industry and activation of the industrial export and development resources are limiting the efficency of our industry’ s involvement on the international market. Serbia, as a small country, by nature of things is focused on trade exchange and international economical cooperation and without that has no chance for independent development, not even a chance to sustain the existing level of production. It can only develop if its industrial companies make their products for the international market and expand their business networks worldwide. For this to be achievable, Serbia first must adjust its products to the demands of the international market, by implementing adequate technology and increasing production efficiency levels. The aim of this work is to shed light on important conditions, factors, strategic goals and incentive policy for increasing the competitiveness of industries in Serbia, because only a strong and competitive industry can withstand the challenges and pressures of other participants, and at the same time, provide the quality and the range of export, in other words, economical growth and social welfare.
P45|Demain, l'aide...?|« L’ODA bashing » est devenue une activité en vogue. Au-delà des procès périodiques sur la faible efficacité de l’aide, voire ses effets pervers, toute une littérature s’est développée ces dernières années pour annoncer la « fin de l’aide », en prétextant parfois que son rôle dans le développement des pays pauvres tendait à devenir marginal : la globalisation de l’économie et la libre circulation des capitaux favoriseraient mécaniquement une convergence économique à l’échelle du globe, rendant désuète l’aide traditionnelle. Dans la plus pure tradition néo-classique, le libre jeu du marché et « le laisser faire » devraient favoriser la convergence des modes de production et de consommation, et ce faisant, le rattrapage du sud.
P45|Does aid have a future?|ODA bashing has become a popular pastime. Apart from the periodic allegations that aid has little effect or that its effects are perverse, a wealth of material has been produced in recent years announcing the end of aid and sometimes claiming that its role in the development of poor countries was becoming marginal. The argument goes that globalisation of the economy and the liberalisation of capital would automatically lead to global economic convergence, rendering traditional aid obsolete. In the purest neo-classical tradition, the free play of the market and laisser-faire policy should promote the convergence of forms of production and consumption patterns, and the south would catch up as a result.
P45|Globalization of Malaysian Economy â€“ With Special Focus on the Role of Growth Enclaves|This paper examines the process of the globalization of Malaysia, a country that has developed over four decades to become one of the top three globalized nations of Asia, after Singapore and Israel. Initially, its enormous primary resources supplied it with a comparative advantage. It pursued an export-oriented economic policy that attracted multinational company (MNC) foreign direct investment (FDI), and modern technology. Subsequently, industrial products from Malaysia made inroads into world markets. This was followed by the establishment of growth enclaves throughout the country and the offer of generous incentives to investors, particularly to MNCs. A further source of FDI was the various bilateral and multilateral investment agreements made with major investing countries. Similar agreements on trade and tariffs helped Malaysia to expand in industrial and primary product markets all over the world. All these efforts at industrial and economic development received further impetus from Malaysiaâ€™s increasing interests in joining regional, continental, and multinational trade, security, and economic blocs and forums. Malaysia entered into Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) with a number of countries, which has further strengthened its trade and investment globalization. Underlying these agreements and partnerships has been a proliferation of economic development and modernization programs, plans, policies, and strategies from all Malaysiaâ€™s national and state administrative agencies and authorities. With a view to achieving a balanced and sustained national development, it formulated plans for all sectors of the economy that complemented a broad national development plan. The national Vision 2020 is for an all-encompassing development ranging from the social and ethnic to law and order issues, education, science and technology, industrialization, tele-communication, digitalization, and many other known and perceivable dimensions of development and modernization.
P45|Compliance with Global Quality Requirements in Pakistan’s Export Sector|This paper describes the level of compliance with quality standards in relation to Pakistan’s top export product categories. With greater competition, innovations in technology, and stricter measures of quality being enforced, Pakistan needs to adopt a holistic, systematic approach to not just meeting, but also exceeding, international quality standards and certifications for its exports. Focusing on rice and textiles, we identify which compliance-related gaps need to be filled to ensure the sustainable growth of high-quality exports to major global markets. The study outlines the key dimensions of international quality standards as well as specific standards and requirements for textiles and rice, examines the quality assurance infrastructure in Pakistan, and presents policy recommendations.
P45|How to finance investment in Bangladesh: Finding long-run factors in a bounds test method|Investment in Bangladesh has been at almost one-fourth of the countryâ€™s output since the early 2000s. Consequently, Bangladeshâ€™s growth has also remained stagnant at around 6 percent since then. The question of how to increase investment in Bangladesh has been of crucial discussion of late. This study examines the long run determinants of investment in Bangladesh by applying the bounds test over 1976-2010. There should not be any policy dilemma about the effect of lending rates, which must be reduced to boost investment and domestic credit should be expanded. Further liberalization in trade and finance is recommended since economic openness and financial deepening show a positive impact on capital formation. The policy prescriptions for Bangladesh are not different from those for other nations that embarked on liberalization to augment investment for accelerating growth.
P45|Current State of European Hotel Chains|The importance of selecting the appropiate brand for a hotel resides in the impact it will have on the market where the hotel is positioned and the potential benefits of the chain's distribution channels. Accor, for example, is the world's number-one and Europe's leading hotel operator. It has more than 3.600 hotels in 92 countries and provides a comprehensive range of options from luxury to economy, with brands like Sofitel, Novotel, Ibis, Hotel F1. With over 170.000 people working for Accor brands around the world, the Group has 45 years of experience in serving its customers and partners. Accor's vision is to be world's most innovative, best performing and most valued hotel company. Its new strategic roadmap, which has redesigned its business model around two divisions - HotelServices and HotelInvest - will boost operational efficency and sustainable growth.
P45|E-fulfillment - a new challenge for electronic business|Currently, we are witnessing a uniform interconnect solutions that allow easier access of small businesses and start-ups to electronic commerce and even their unprecedented development using specialized intermediaries. Thus, a modern distribution system is the e-Fulfillment presented in this paper. In the first part of the paper by presenting the concept and technological developments we have highlighted several classifications thereof. The biggest part presents the main operations are conducted at the operator e-Fulfillment, from taking products from suppliers, management, logistics information needed to store transactions through electronic transfer of goods to customers using courier companies, settlement and billing services, forms of promotion etc. The paper ends with some aspects of the advantages of using these systems, the costs involved and examples for Romania.
P45|Brazil’s Place in the Global Economy|Brazil is a country with long-standing ambitions for a major role in the world economy and in global governance, but its footprint in various measures of both remains relatively modest. On current trends, the gap between ambition and achievement will likely remain large, so we provide a critique of Brazil’s strategy in terms of economic statecraft; reflect on the wisdom of choices made in the past in terms of multilateralism vs. regionalism; and suggest a new approach that could enhance Brazil’s leadership role at the regional and global levels. It would involve the Brazilian government and business elites making clearer and more daring national choices, including shedding increasingly arcane and detrimental strategic alliances, in order to enable the country to become more involved with and thus influential on the global economic stage.
P45|The Effects of Isolation on the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|The economic development of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus remains to be volatile mainly due to the isolation of the de facto Turkish Cypriot state. While on one hand, high costs of energy in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus associated with the isolation, remains as a huge obstacle for the increment in Turkish Cypriot production, embargo placed upon her, including closure of ports and airports, on the other, restrains international trade for Turkish Cypriots, thus making the Turkish Cypriot economy a challanged one. Therefore, after indicating the burdensome effects of isolation on the economy of Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, this paper proposes how the Turkish Cypriot economy needs to overcome her self-reliance issues and suggests alternative solutions to the Turkish Cypriot economy. For this purpose, by using time-series analysis this paper provides a double-model approach in which the economic growth of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is mainly dependent on aid transfers from Turkish government and is suffering from isolation in the first, and is determined by the free-trade and free-movement of international capital brought by becoming a transition economy and therefore easing the contractions on the economy, on the hypothetical second model. While the results of the analysis employed in this paper confirms that main problems of Turkish Cypriot economy are associated with the isolation, it also indicates that Turkish Cypriot economy would be better off in an isolation-free environment. Thus, this paper aims to assert the importance of self-determination rights for the Turkish Cypriots.
P45|Should CARICOM Conclude a New Trade Agreement with Canada: A Case Analysis of Barbados-Canada Trade Negotiations|Historically, trade relations between the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and Canada have been governed by a preferential agreement known as CARIBCAN, which gave CARICOM goods duty free access to the Canadian market. In order to bring their non-reciprocal agreements into compliance with World Trade Organization (WTO) regulations, Canada and CARICOM launched negotiations for an enhanced trade agreement to replace CARIBCAN. Despite repeated granting of extensions to the original CARIBCAN agreement while negotiations took place, Barbados, along with the rest of CARICOM members, remains unprepared to offer greater reciprocity to Canada and therefore face the possibility of losing their share of the Canadian market. Failure to conclude a reciprocal agreement will seriously curtail the export of goods to Canada, as they will face high duties, become uncompetitive, and erode the trade surplus currently enjoyed. Faced with the possibility of being de-listed from the beneficiaries list by 2015, the lost in export options and reduced advantages in others, Barbados must ultimately seek to reach a speedy conclusion to the current negotiations, while maintaining its trade in investment advantage (through achieving parallel operation of the BIT), securing continued duty free access for its goods and maintaining policy space for the services sector.
P45|Managing the State Aid in Romania According to European Union’s Policy|The importance of state aid has gradually increased in the recent decades. Aid allocations in the EU Member States vary depending on the national priorities as they are set by each state. Starting from those facts, this paper presents the trends in Romania, as well as those at the European Union level, as a whole. The research is based on data analysis provided by Scoreboard reporting systems and, as a result, presents authors conclusions and recommendations for managing the State Aid in Romania.
P45|India-Africa Trade: Current Trends and Policy|India-Africa trade has gathered pace over the past few years characterized by a remarkable rise in Africa’s exports to India. Interestingly, India’s exports and imports of products belonging to minority sectors (low share in total exports) exhibit dramatic growth in the recent years than the products in majority sectors (high share in total exports). Broadly, India’s trade basket is heavily dominated by mineral products with very little diversification in the recent past. Along with tariff liberalization, India is lowering different forms of non-tariff barriers (NTBs) which would pave the way for higher trade between India and African economies and help the country withstand the Chinese competition in the African markets.
P45|R&D Intensity and Market Valuation of Firm: A Study of R&D Incurring Manufacturing Firms in India|This study examines the impact of R&D expenditure on market valuation of firm proxied by Tobin’s q using firm level data for manufacturing firms in India. To accomplish the research objective this study obtained data from Prowess database of Centere for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) over the period of 2001-2010. The study forms an unbalanced panel comprising 2382 firm-year observations and employs Pooled-OLS and fixed effects models to analyze the relationship between R&D intensity and firm value as measured by Tobin’s q. The findings reflect an inverted U-shaped relationship between R&D intensity and firm value indicating the diminishing marginal return to each unit spent on R&D. The result implies that R&D investment have a positive impact on the market value of firm at the beginning, however, after a point these investments lower the market performance of firms.
P45|FDI attractiveness in Latin America|This paper focuses on the identification of the variables determining the attractiveness of foreign direct investment in Latin America, represented by 17 countries over a period of time from 1996 to 2011. It considers variables traditionally not taken into account, such as the tax rate and institutional factors, which have revealed important explanatory variables also traditionally considered as GDP, inflation, population, the share of GDP by sector, the income level, etc. According to the analysis in this paper and the results obtained, it is very clear that institutional factors such as the size of the economy and the population have an influence in attracting FDI flows. The institutional quality is determinative for the attraction of foreign direct investment to these countries. Property rights, monetary freedom and investment freedom, are institutional indicators of great relevance as explanatory factors for attracting foreign direct investment, while government expenditures follows to a lesser degree.
P45|Knowing your audience: How the structure of international relations and organizational choices affect amnesty international’s advocacy|While research has addressed the effects of international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) advocacy on human rights outcomes, less is known about how INGOs choose advocacy targets and tactics. We combine insights from political economy and constructivism to understand how INGOs come to choose targets and tactics through the concepts of information and leverage politics, first articulated by Keck and Sikkink ( 1998 ), and salience politics, or the need to select cases that energize organization members and donors. INGOs select potential targets for advocacy and choose their tactics based on considerations of leverage potential and political salience, both of which are a function of potential target states’ aid, trade, and security linkages with major Western powers. Using data on Amnesty International’s written advocacy efforts - background reports, press releases, and new data on Urgent Actions - we find robust evidence that Amnesty International accounts for these linkages with Western powers in choosing targets for its advocacy campaigns.

P45|Did the Aid Boom Pacify Sub-Saharan Africa?: Ex-Post Evaluation Using a Near-Identification Approach|The incidence of civil war in Sub-Saharan Africa since the turn of the century is less than half of what it was on average in the last quarter of the 20th century. This paper shows that the aid boom triggered by 9/11 played a key role in achieving purposefully this result using panel data for 46 African countries over four decades. It applies a nearidentification approach to test the aid-conflict trade-off, taking due account of asymmetric information between the donors and the econometrician. Preference proxies are used in the first-stage to elicit the relevant hidden information.
P45|Measuring the Causal Effect of Privatization on Firm Performance|Despite an apparent consensus in the literature that privatization leads to increased productivity and profitability of firms, the problem of endogeneity bias is profound and has been emphasized in a number of meta-analyses. We propose a new method to address the endogeneity bias and apply it to a universe of Polish medium and large firms over 1995-2009. Unlike some previous studies we find that improvement in firm performance is a rare phenomenon, which suggests that the endogeneity bias could have been indeed large.
P45|The Effect Of The Chinese International Trade On The Brazilian Trade Balance|According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD, 2012), after China officially joined the World Trade Organization, at the end of 2001, its share on world's exports increased from 4.34%, in 2001, to 10.50%, in 2011. At the same period, China's share on world's imports increased almost 150% - from 3.84% to 9.53%. The increase in international trade happened at the same time China's industrial sector changed the composition of its Gross Value of Production (GVP) towards products that use more scale and differentiated technologies, while natural resources and labor intensive products lost their share in total GVP (Diegues; Angeli, 2011). Most of researches in the field agree that China's economic growth is related somehow to its fast industrialization process on the last two decades, as a consequence of the transition process towards a more market oriented economy. In addition to that, it is also agreed that the exchange rate depreciation has played a major whole while setting up China as one of the most important players in the international market. Trade relations between Brazil and China have intensified in recent decades while caused changes in the list of imported and exported products of the country. In this context, the present study aimed to analyze the evolution of imports and exports of Brazil ? China between 2000 and 2011. Two different forms of sectorial analysis were analyzed which allowed the identification of the most significant exported sectors. The sectorial analysis was performed following two criteria: (i) technological intensity and (ii) types of technology. The study used import and export data between Brazil and China provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade. It was found that the trade between Brazil and China has become more intense in the most recent years mainly because the Brazilian exports have been more focused on commodities and natural resource-based products. Chinese exports to Brazil, on the other hand, are more concentrated in products of high and medium-high-technology, based mainly on differentiated technology and scale, but with a wider range of products compared to the Brazilian exports. We conclude that a regressive specialization of Brazilian exports to China has been happening probably as a result of both the direct and indirect trade effects between the countries. Key-words: China; Brazil; trade; specialization
P45|Time Series Analysis about the Relationship between Foreign Trade and Exchange Rate in Turkish Economy|In this study, the relationship between the foreign trade data and the exchange rate is tested using the monthly data for the period of 1992:01-2014:01 in Turkish Economy. The devaluation of local currency is expected to increase export while decreasing import rates, thus it will close the foreign trade deficit, theoretically. However, this effect is observed in varying degrees in the on both short and long terms. One of the most fundamental problems of the Turkish Economy is the foreign trade deficit, beside the Turkish Lira is a quite frequently fluctuating currency. The relationship between the foreign trade data and the exchange rate is an important topic to examine when the dependence of export to import is especially considered. In this study, the long-term relation between these two main variables and their causality are examined as using the time series analysis. Therefore, the tested hypothesis will be „there is a long term relationship between the exchange rate and the foreign trade in Turkish Economy“. It is was empirically observed that this hypothesis is correct as a result of the tests. It is also observed that there is Granger causality from the exchange rate to the exports, imports and net foreign trade in addition to the fact that the long term relationship exists between the foreign trade and the rate of exchange.
P45|"Achieving Bangladesh's tourism potential: Linkages to export diversification, employment generation and the ""green economy"""|"Bangladesh's international image is not as a popular tourism destination, and many people might be surprised to learn it has three World Heritage sites, including the Sundarbans tiger reserves. Moreover, it is part of important travel circuits for cultural and religious tourism, and has demonstrated potential for sports tourism. The objective of this working paper is to critically test the assertion that pro-poor ""green"" tourism is one of the best development options for the majority of least developed countries (LDCs) - a challenging task in Bangladesh in the face of the country's success as an exporter of readymade garments - by comparing tourism to the available alternatives with regard to the crucial government priorities of export diversification, employment generation and the ""green economy"". It is well-known that Bangladesh is under strong pressure to diversify its exports, to generate new employment (especially in rural areas), and to respond to critical environmental issues. The government has identified over 30 ""thrust sectors"" (including tourism) to help address these challenges, but otherwise tourism is rarely mentioned as a major trade and development option for Bangladesh. Within the limitations of data availability, this working paper reaches the conclusion that greater efforts to develop ""green"" tourism would be highly beneficial for facilitating rural development, environmental and cultural protection, gender equality, and export diversification in services. The most obvious current impediments are inadequate infrastructure, lack of investment and (typically election year) political conflict, but behind these factors appear to be a serious lack of stakeholder coordination, insufficient regulatory and administrative transparency and coherence, as well as some government reluctance to relinquish greater commercial autonomy in tourism to the private sector. This paper offers extensive analysis and some suggestions to help address the impediments, including the recommendation to create a Bangladesh Tourism Stakeholders Forum."
P45|The causal relationship between Foreign Direct Investment and Current Account: an empirical investigation for Pakistan economy|This paper investigates relationship between FDI and current account (CA) in Pakistan using the Johansen-Juselius cointegration technique and the Granger causality test. The study results indicate that FDI and CA are cointegrated and thus exhibit a reliable long run relationship. The Granger causality test findings indicate that the causality between FDI and CA is uni-directional. However, there is no short run causality from FDI to CA and vice versa. Therefore, as a policy implication that FDI inflows may cause to the deterioration of the balance of payments in the long run should be taken into account when policy makers decide to implement policies to attract foreign investors.
P45|FX and derivatives markets in emerging economies and the internationalisation of their currencies|Derivatives markets in emerging economies have continued to grow since 2010, driven mostly by very strong growth in the OTC market. Emerging market currencies have become more international as offshore markets are a major contributor to FX turnover. The Chinese renminbi is actively traded within emerging Asia. Trading of emerging market currencies is positively related to the size of cross-border financial flows.
P45|World Crisis Impact On International Trade|Characteristic of world recession was its global, synchronized feature, expression of the interconnection occurring between the financial markets and goods markets. The negative effects of the financial crisis, with impact on the real economy, have led to sudden decrease of economic growth, at global level, still from the year 2008, having a strong echo on the international trade, both in the goods area and in that of services. The study expounds aspects of world trade contraction, in the context of global crisis, the main phenomena that had drawn it, influencing the international trade development. The are presented some analyzes, in dynamics, on the basis of statistical data about the evolution of trade in goods and services, at the EU level, and, distinct, for Romania, accompanied by comments and conclusions.
P45|Las Exportaciones y el crecimiento económico en Colombia 1994-2010|Este trabajo examina el rol de las exportaciones en el crecimiento económico de Colombia, enmarcado en el periodo post apertura económica, que va desde mediados de la década de los noventa, del siglo pasado, hasta los últimos diez años de la presente década. Los resultados obtenidos indican ausencia de causalidad entre las distintas categorías de exportaciones que se utilizaron (exportaciones primarias e industriales) y el producto neto de exportaciones. Sin embargo, el modelo también arroja un efecto positivo entre las importaciones de bienes de capital y el producto, que aunado, igualmente a una relación positiva entre el producto y las exportaciones manufactureras, permite presumir que el crecimiento de las exportaciones, ha permitido, indirectamente, a través de las adquisición de divisas, financiar la compra de bienes de capital necesarios para la ampliación del producto.
P45|Channelling The Nigeria’s Foreign Exchange Reserves into Alternative Investment Outlets: A Critical Analysis|In recent years, impressive price of crude oil has stimulated the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves in Nigeria. However, observers have expressed fears about the channels of utilisation of the reserves, especially to other alternatives investment outlets. This paper examines the cost-effective propositions of the foreign reserves in Nigeria, and considers alternative investment channels. The study uses data from publications of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Statistical Bulletin, Annual Reports and Statement of Accounts. It adopts the theory of demand for internationalreserves based on three motive notably transaction, precautionary and mercantilist. The study among others finds that Nigeria foreign reserve is adequate. The level of reserves to import satisfies the international benchmark etc. The study recommends among others the need to split foreign reserves into four portfolios. The liquidity portfolio, long-term portfolio or investment portfolio, immunization portfolio, and the petroleum fund buffer portfolio or sovereign wealth fund.
P45|Impact of China's currency valuation and labour cost on the US in a trade and exchange rate model|Ricardian dynamic general equilibrium analyses show that under free trade arrangements a low income country with lower wage cost and large endowment of labour has comparative advantage in trade. Efficiency gains from this enhance economic growth and welfare of households simultaneously in both low income and advanced economies. Theoretical predictions are empirically validated here with structural VAR analysis based on quarterly data over the time period 1995:1 to 2009:1 on China's relative wage cost, interest rate differential, real effective exchange rate (REER), relative GDP and the US current account balance. It is shown how the relative prices of labour, capital and the currency affect the economic activity in China and current account balance in the US. With free capital inflows and outflows and restrictions on labour mobility, comparative advantage of China and the trade deficit of the US will both be minimised if China allows real appreciation of the Yuan and complete adjustment in prices. Higher production cost and prices in China could reduce welfare of Chinese households and the trade imbalance of the US, while higher relative GDP of China lowers the current account balance for the US.
P45|Disentangling the Effects of Fair Trade on the Quality of Malian Cotton|The increasing importance of premium segments and private labels raise skepticism about the ability of Fair Trade to help smallholders compete in high value-added markets. Using panel data collected in Mali, this paper contributes to the debate by estimating the impact of Fairtrade certification on the quality of Malian cotton. Controlling for the nonrandom certification of producers, results show a significant impact on the quality of cotton produced by both certified and geographically close noncertified growers via spillover effects. The analysis suggests that contract farming enforced by third-parties and demonstration effects foster the adoption of innovative agricultural practices.
P45|The Integrated Framework for Trade-related Assistance to the Least Developed Countries: A Promising Initiative|The “Integrated Framework for Trade-related Technical Assistance to the Least Developed Countries” (IF) is a global initiative established in 1997 and is a particular application of what has since been known as “Aid for Trade”. The objective of the IF is to support the least developed countries (LDCs) in building their capacity to trade and to integrate trade issues into overall national development strategies. The core multilateral agencies that initiated the IF and participate in it are the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Trade Centre (ITC), the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) the World Bank and the World Trade Organization (WTO). The original IF initiative has been gradually reinforced; since 2007, it is called the “Enhanced Integrated Framework” (EIF).

P45|The financialisation of the Romanian Economy: from central bank-led to dependent financialization|This study argues that financializations is not a phenomenon exclusively associated with complex innovation in highly developed financial markets. Financialization also affects countries with 'shallow' financial markets but with a significant presence of transnational financial actors that become a powerful economic and political force able to navigate and shape uneven regulatory and institutional terrains in order to sustain new modes of profit generation. The study distinguishes two stages in financialization of the Romanian economy. The first, central-bank dominated stage saw the systemic transformation of firm-bank-state relations that resulted in the creation of impatient banking and the forestalling of industrial policy options. The second, dependent financialization, is in turn characterised by new modes of profit generation for transnational financial actors, interconnectedness and fragility as the main mechanism of incorporation in European financial structures.

P45|The Complete Issue|Is aid dead? Dead Aid was the provocative title of a book that appeared on the 2009 New York Times bestseller list in which Dambisa Moyo outlined the shortcomings of traditional aid to Africa and proposed some even more contentious solutions for her continent. But has development assistance really run its course? Does all aid follow old colonial patterns and actors, as Moyo maintains?. We argue that aid is alive and kicking with some exciting turns that have been gathering momentum in recent years both among traditional donors and new and still emerging South-South Cooperation (SSC) actors. Developed country aid alone still channeled US$134 billion in 2011, a 154 percent increase from a decade earlier; preliminary figures for 2012 show to little surprise a slight decline to US$126 billion. Despite its shortcomings, aid provided by Development Assistance Committee (DAC) members is rapidly changing to be more effective, inclusive, and recipient-owned; principles that were reflected in the Paris Declaration of Aid Effectiveness (2005) and that were later reinforced in the Accra Action Plan and the Busan outcome document (2011) ...
P45|The New Boom in South-South Cooperation : The Experience of Ibero-America|The article reviews and characterizes the recent boom in South-South Cooperation (SSC) by focusing on a specific experience: that of the member countries of the Ibero-American Conference and, in particular, the nineteen Spanish and Portuguese-speaking Latin American countries (from Mexico to Chile, including Cuba and Dominican Republic), plus Spain and Portugal. It seeks to understand a kind of cooperation that is expanding under various different guises and gaining in importance in the international development cooperation agenda with each passing year. Accordingly and in constant reference to this specific case, the article first explores the way this kind of SSC is evolving, its new scope, and its main features. Next, it reconstructs the bloc’s political discourse regarding SSC, as well as the way it is pervading the international debate. With this in mind, it draws on the various editions of the Report on South-South Cooperation in Ibero-America, prepared by the Ibero-American General Secretariat (SEGIB), an analytical tool that, in addition to providing information, constitutes, both in itself and by structure, an intergovernmental, horizontal, and collective instance of SSC.
P45|La Revista Completa|Es la ayuda el problema? 'Cuando la ayuda es el problema' es el provocador título de un libro que figuró en la lista de best sellers del New York Times del año 2009. En él, su autora, Dambisa Moyo, reseña las deficiencias de la cooperación que tradicionalmente se realiza con Africa y propone algunas soluciones aún más polémicas para su continente. Pero ¿realmente la cooperación para el desarrollo ya ha cumplido su ciclo? ¿Y acaso toda la cooperación sigue las antiguas pautas coloniales y continúa en manos de los actores de siempre, tal como sostiene Moyo? En nuestra opinión, la cooperación sigue 'viva y coleando', con algunos cambios interesantes que han venido ganando impulso en los últimos años, tanto entre los donantes tradicionales como entre los nuevos actores de la Cooperación Sur-Sur (CSS), que siguen sumándose. La ayuda de los países desarrollados canalizó US$134.000 millones en 2011, lo que equivale a un aumento del 154 por ciento respecto de la cifra movilizada en la década anterior; los cálculos preliminares correspondientes a 2012 muestran, para sorpresa de pocos, una ligera caída (US$126.000 millones). A pesar de sus posibles carencias, la cooperación que otorgan los países miembros del Comité de Ayuda al Desarrollo (CAD) de la OCDE está pasando rápidamente a ser más eficaz e inclusiva y a fortalecer la apropiación por parte de sus beneficiarios, principios que quedaron reflejados en la Declaración de París sobre la Eficacia de la Ayuda para el Desarrollo (2005) y que luego se consolidaron en el Programa de Acción de Accra y en el documento de resultados de Busan (2011) ...
P45|El renovado auge de la Cooperación Sur-Sur : La experiencia iberoamericana|El presente artículo revisa y caracteriza el renovado auge que la Cooperación Sur-Sur ha experimentado en los últimos años a partir de una experiencia concreta: la protagonizada por los países miembros de la Conferencia Iberoamericana y, en particular, por los diecinueve latinoamericanos de habla española y portuguesa (desde México hasta Chile, incluyendo a Cuba y República Dominicana), más España y Portugal. Busca entender una cooperación que crece y se expande bajo distintas fórmulas y dimensiones y que, año tras año, gana peso en la Agenda sobre la Cooperación Internacional al Desarrollo. Por ello y siempre a partir de este caso específico, el artículo: profundiza, primero, en el modo en que evoluciona esta Cooperación Sur-Sur, la dimensión que va adquiriendo, sus principales rasgos; y reconstruye, segundo, el discurso político que este bloque de países ha articulado en torno a la Cooperación Sur-Sur, así como el modo en que éste está penetrando en el debate internacional. A estos efectos, recurre a lo recogido en las distintas ediciones del Informe de la Cooperación Sur-Sur en Iberoamérica: una herramienta de análisis que además de aportar información constituye, en sí misma y por cómo se hace, un ejercicio intergubernamental, horizontal y colectivo de Cooperación Sur-Sur.
P45|Short Description Of The Relevant Aspects Of The Dutch Economy In The Global Economic System|Despite of its reduced population number and small area, the Netherlands is one of the top countries in terms of trade and FDI. The aim of this article is to present its trade, FDI flows and to highlight some of the advantages that the country has in the mentioned fields. Even though it was hit by the economic crisis, the state recovered fast and, since 2009, maintained a positive trend to its foreign trade and FDI. Moreover, because it has a stable economic environment and a professional labour force, foreign investors are eager to start investing in businesses in this country.
P45|Temporal Validity of International Investment Agreements: A Large Sample Survey of Treaty Provisions|International investment agreements (IIAs) almost universally define their temporal validity and thus set conditions for States’ exit from these treaties. This study presents the results of the survey of language that determines the temporal validity of 2,061 bilateral investment agreements that the 55 economies participating in the OECD-hosted Freedom of Investment Roundtables have concluded with any other economy. The paper summarises in its first part past and current treaty practice in this regard: how do States design the parameters that define the temporal validity of their treaties and the duration of the obligations contained therein? How has this design evolved over time? Do different kinds of IIAs take different approaches to this matter? Have individual States developed distinct practices or policies? The second part of the paper presents key findings that result from the analysis of treaty practice in a large number of agreements. It highlights characteristics of the provisions on temporal validity employed in IIAs; emphasises the collective engagement that results from the clauses in IIAs and the consequences of country-specific practice; and suggests questions on intriguing policy choices that a large comparative study reveals.
P45|International Trade and Institutional Change|" This article analyzes the impact of international trade on the quality of institutions, such as contract enforcement or property rights. It presents a model in which imperfect institutions create rents for some parties within the economy and are a source of comparative advantage in trade. Institutional quality is determined as an equilibrium of a political economy game. When countries share the same technology, there is a ""race to the top"" in institutional quality: both trade partners are forced to improve institutions after opening. On the other hand, domestic institutions will not improve in either country when one of the countries has a strong enough technological comparative advantage in the institutionally intensive good. While time series results are not statistically significant, a related cross-sectional prediction of the model is consistent with the data. Countries whose exogenous geographical characteristics predispose them to exporting in institutionally intensive sectors exhibit significantly higher institutional quality. The Author 2012.

P45|The Role of Remittances as More Efficient Tool of Development Aid in Developing Countries|This paper examines the effectiveness of remittances and official development assistance (ODA) in developing countries. It compares the outcomes of aid poured into the economies of the Third World for decades without any visible effect and remittances transferred by emigrants to their countries of origin which proved to be quite effective. We find that remittances have a stronger net positive effect on the increase of GDP per capita in developing economies than development aid. In addition, remittances tend to be higher than ODA funds, they are absorbed by 80-90 per cent (in comparison with 50 per cent of aid budgets spent on administrative and other costs) and do not hinge on institutional quality. The paper advocates the importance of remittances over ODA and supports the wide usage of coherent development policies executed by the developed Western economies with an aim to enhance transparent and efficient remittance transfers as one of the best methods to promote development in less-developed countries (e.g. economies in Africa, Asia or Latin America).
P45|Measuring The Foreign Exchange Premium And The Premium For Non-Tradable Outlays For Twenty Countries In Africa|In this paper we develop an analytical general equilibrium framework to measure the foreign exchange premium and the premium for non-tradable outlays for a country. The framework allows us to capture in a consistent manner the impacts of the sourcing of funds and their expenditure on tradable and non-tradable goods and services of investment projects. An application of the model is carried out for 20 countries in Africa. The results show that the foreign exchange premiums range from 4.00% to 9.50% and the premium for non-tradable outlays from -1.75% to 1.50%. The empirical values depend on a number of factors, including the indirect taxes, production subsidies and international trade distortions of a country. These premiums should be incorporated into the economic evaluation of investment projects.
P45|Impact of macroeconomic factors on tourism receipts: evidence from SAARC region|The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of various macroeconomic factors i.e. per capita GDP; Gross capital formation; trade openness and consumer price index on tourism receipts in selected South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries (namely, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan and Srilanka) by using pooled least square, fixed effect and random effect model. The analysis was carried out for the period from 1995 to 2011. By and large, the results reveal that per capita GDP and trade openness both have a positive impact on tourism receipts, as if there is one percent increase in per capita GDP and trade openness, tourism receipt increases by 1.437 percent and 1.982 percent respectively, however, gross capital formation has a significant negative impact on tourism receipt in SAARC region. The results of fixed effect model, which absorb the country specific shocks, show that both per capita GDP and trade openness has a positive impact on truism receipt. However, the magnitude of coefficient varies from pooled OLS to fixed effect model. The final model which incorporate both country and time specific shocks reveal that both per capita GDP and trade openness have a significant impact on tourism receipt, however, the magnitude of the variables in random effect model is less than pooled OLS and fixed effect model. The Hausman model results show that fixed effect model is considered as the best model in the selected SAARC region.
P45|Fostering Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the Global Supply Chain: Capacity Building of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in APEC|The last decades have witnessed profound changes in the nature of production in the Asia-Pacific region as multinational corporations (MNCs) have pursued complex, cross-border production and distribution systems. This process has precipitated the integration of the APEC region through the emergence of global supply chains and global value chains. Increasingly connected global supply chains have created new opportunities for businesses, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing economies of the region, as they become important suppliers for MNCs. However, the development of unprecedented levels of cross-border production sharing has also brought new challenges for both business managers and public policymakers. In particular, the rise of corporate social responsibility (CSR) standards has created a new set of challenges for SMEs linked to global supply chains. A complex, multi-layered set of CSR standards concerning socially and environmentally sustainable business practices have been developed at international, national and local levels. An increasingly large number of MNCs have also started to demand that suppliers comply with corporate codes of conduct. The proliferation of CSR standards, global buyers' requirements of supplier codes of conduct throughout their supply chains and various monitoring and audit mechanisms have created challenges for SMEs which tend to lack the capacity and resources to comply with new requirements. As the uptake of CSR has become a prerequisite to enter global supply chains in the region, SMEs which are unable to adopt CSR practices have been excluded from global supply chains. SMEs are drivers of sustained economic growth in APEC economies. Building CSR capacity of SMEs for their effective participation in global supply chains is thus an important challenge many APEC members face. The objective of this paper is to examine and propose the ways in which APEC can assist SMEs in the region to build the capacity to adopt CSR practices and to improve linkages with regional and global supply chains. CSR has emerged as an APEC agenda only recently and has not been given top priority so far. Furthermore, the initiatives of APEC so far have largely relied on CSR capacity building in a narrow sense. While capacity building of enterprises to adopt CSR is essential, its effectiveness can be limited without a supporting policy or regulatory environment.
P45|Migration and foreign direct investment: education matters|The rapid growth in the foreign-born population in many high- and middle-income countries in recent decades has prompted much research on the socio-economic determinants and impacts of immigration. This paper investigates the relationship between the stock of foreign population by nationality living in the UK and the bilateral stock of foreign direct investment (FDI), both inward FDI into the UK and outward FDI from the UK. This study contributes to the literature on the above-mentioned association between migration and FDI, by using the UK annual data from 2001 to 2007 for 22 countries on the inward volume of FDI and for 27 countries on the outward volume of FDI. Our study finds a significant and positive relationship between migration and outward FDI. This result also holds, if we correct for endogeneity by using an instrumental variable approach. If we then include the education level of migrants living in the UK, our results indicate that the more educated migrants from a certain country are, the stronger positive effect they have on FDI in both directions (inward and outward).

P45|Promoting International Environmental Cooperation Through Unilateral Action: When Can Trade Sanctions Help?| International environmental cooperation is difficult because states disagree on burden sharing and have incentives to free ride. However, interested countries can promote future cooperation through unilateral action that induces technological change in and, thereby, shapes the preferences of foreign countries. How can the effectiveness of such unilateral action be improved? This article offers a game-theoretic analysis of the value of combining unilateral action with trade sanctions, or policies that force foreign exporters to comply with domestic environmental regulations. Trade sanctions can significantly improve the effectiveness of unilateral action, but only when (1) they induce clean technology adoption by exporters in targeted countries and (2) this reduces the cost of clean technology elsewhere in the economy through intersectoral technology spillovers. © 2013 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
P45|Foreign Direct Investment In Emerging And Developed Economies|In the context of globalization, the issue of foreign direct investments and theirinfluence on the development of the emerging economies, continues to be a topic of interest formany economic theories. The need, the importance and the effects of foreign directinvestments have attracted the attention of all the states and produced an intense competitionto attract the foreign capital. FDI inflows have a very important role in the establishment ofnew world economic powers. In the world economy, the foreign direct investment are orientedin major proportion to developed countries, but the interest in this type of investment isparticularly developed also in the emerging countries who need not only foreign capitalinflows, but also the modern managerial experience and access to markets. The aim of thispaper is to study and analyze the evolution of foreign direct investment in emerging anddeveloped economies in the last twenty years.
P45|Is the effect really so large? Firm‐level evidence on the role of FDI in a transition economy-super-1|Literature is not clear on the effect of FDI on the economic performance in hosting countries. The analysed effects include productivity, propensity to export, access to financial markets, etc. Although foreign subsidiaries usually perform better than the average of the hosting economies, sometimes the selection effect is found to be considerable. In this paper we use a unique dataset based on accounting annual reports to the statistical authorities by all medium and large Polish enterprises over a period 1997-2006. We apply a propensity score matching technique to disentangle the effect of self-selection and FDI entry (treatment). We also distinguish explicitly between foreign ownership and privatisation through a foreign investor. We find strong support of the view that foreign ownership increases access to financing. Evidence suggests also that although FDI enters more frequently companies who already participate in the international trading networks, 20% of the export intensity may be consistently attributed to the treatment effect. On the other hand, we were not able to confirm large effects on efficiency, nor in the case of rentability, while the sizes of the effects are different for greenfield and private acquisitions as opposed to privatisation.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P45|Another Look at Foreign Aid|"The discussion of the effectiveness of foreign aid has reached a high pitch. This paper assesses the sorry past and present key arguments for a potentially more effective and sustainable method of aid delivery. A key ingredient is to shake off the vestiges of structural adjustment and move towards true recipient country ownership complete with ""self-conditionality"" with aid recipients formulating their own reform packages. This means donors become much more passive, act like a bank and respond to proposals which concentrate on a few critical areas over a three to five-year period. Policy-based program lending should respond to packages put together by the main domestic stakeholders with the help, if necessary, of independent third parties. There should be no compulsion to lend; indeed, an aid hiatus is an indication that the new system is effective. What is required is for donors to stop using aid as a short-term foreign policy tool and for recipients to accept the notion that aid provides the opportunity to reduce the inevitable adjustment pains caused by real reforms."

P45|Macroeconomic Modelling of Sustainable Development and the Links between the Economy and the Environment|Europe 2020 is the EU's growth strategy for the coming decade, pushing the EU to become a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy. Under the Europe 2020 strategy the flagship initiative for a resource-efficient Europe points the way towards sustainable growth and supports a shift towards a resource-efficient, low-carbon economy. The purpose of the MACMOD project by Cambridge Econometrics, GWS, SERI and the Wuppertal Institute is to strengthen the economic underpinning for resource policy. Essentially to analyse, how important resources are to our economy, how we will use resources in the future under a business as usual scenario, what are the economic and environmental potentials of improved resource use, how we could achieve that, and what this would mean for our economy, our competitiveness, jobs and our environment. This report presents an overview of the results which provide strong support in favour of a resource policy.
P45|Hedge Transactions on the Stock Exchange|Hedge operations are particular stock market operations through which stock market traders, producers, intermediaries intend to cover the unfavorable outcome of the goods price on the cash market (physical). Price hedging by hedge operations is possible with the similarity and possible convergence between cash and futures prices. Since both markets are influenced by changes in the same general factors of market, prices tend to move in the same directions, but not necessarily with the same magnitude. The exposure rank to price risk which can be minimized depends on the correlation rank between the cash price changes and the future prices variations. Hedgers manage to decrease losses by using this type of transaction.
P45|The impact of exchange rate volatility on trade integration among North and South Mediterranean countries| Timely after the increased exchange rate volatility caused by the global financial crisis, the Arab Spring and European sovereign debt crisis, this article investigates its impact on trade flows. With monthly data from 2000 up to 2011 we estimate by means of a vector auto regression model with eXogenous (VARX) variables the responses of bilateral exports and imports to exchange rate fluctuations between South and North Mediterranean economies. Our results show that the exports of goods from Egypt to the European Union decrease significantly in case of an appreciation of the Egyptian pound vis-à-vis the Euro, while the imports of Egypt from the EU increase to an even larger extent. The same results hold for Morocco, in case of a similar size appreciation of its domestic currency. Jordan is less import-dependent. We conclude that the impact of exchange rate volatility on trade is quite high.
P45|The Japan-Peru FTA : antecedents, significance and main features|The Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between Japan and Peru came into effect on March 1, 2012. This paper provides background information about this agreement's significance, mostly from a Peruvian point of view. It focuses on the following subjects: the statistical trends showing Peru's declining shares in Japan's trade and investment flows with Latin American countries between the mid-1970s and mid-2000s, the main explanatory factors of such a deterioration in Peru's economic position over that period, the changes of trade policy strategy in both countries since the 2000s, and the EPA negotiation process and some of its key results as featured in the text of the agreement.
P45|Managing Systemic Risk|Today, world faces ever-greater concerns regarding global financial risks, the prospect of rapid contagion through increasingly connected financial systems and the threat of disastrous financial impacts. One of the most important forms of financial risks is the systemic risk which we are confronted more and more. Systemic risk is a relatively new term that has its origin in policy discussions more than in the professional economics and finance literature. Systemic risk is the risk of collapse of an entire financial system or entire market and refers to the risks imposed by inter-linkages and interdependencies in a system or market where the failure of a single entity or cluster of entities can cause a cascading failure which could potentially bankrupt or bring down the entire system or market. Taking into consideration the above mentioned facts it is compulsory to drawn up a new regulation in order to mitigate systemic risk and its consequences.

P45|Dispute Settlement Provisions in International Investment Agreements: A Large Sample Survey|Investor-State dispute settlement mechanisms (ISDS) are an important component of most International Investment Agreements (IIAs) and have significant influence on how disputes between States and investors are resolved. This statistical survey of a large sample of 1,660 bilateral investment treaties (BITs) identifies the main parameters of ISDS regulation in BITs; traces their emergence, frequency and dissemination over time; and highlights past and recent country-specific treaty practice. The survey finds among other things that many countries define the procedural framework thinly compared to advanced domestic procedural frameworks, despite a broad trend toward greater regulation in treaties of parameters of ISDS. Many treaties offer foreign investors a range of procedural choices, such as a choice between arbitration fora. The survey also highlights the diversity that characterises the design of ISDS: over a thousand different combinations of rules regulating ISDS can be found in only 1,660 bilateral treaties –, with variation found both at editorial and substantial level. Differences in policy approaches between countries are the source of some of this variance, but it appears that much of it may not reflect differences in policy. The study also found little evidence of general convergence of approaches towards regulating ISDS in BITs, or indeed much development in the BIT negotiating practice of a number of countries. A different approach, characterised by significantly more thorough ISDS regulation and pioneered by some countries, seems to spread increasingly in multilateral IIAs and more comprehensive treaties.
P45|Investor-State Dispute Settlement: A Scoping Paper for the Investment Policy Community|Governments are facing an increasing number of arbitration claims by foreign investors relating to important public policies or seeking substantial damages, and many governments are taking a greater joint interest in how such cases are resolved in investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). This scoping paper has supported inter-governmental dialogue about ISDS at several OECD-hosted investment Roundtable meetings. Part I compares ISDS with other international and domestic processes for resolving disputes including the WTO and European Court of Human Rights, and considers how ISDS may affect domestic policy making processes. Part II examines eight current and emerging issues in ISDS: (i) investors’ access to justice; (ii) the costs of ISDS cases; (iii) remedies for foreign investors under investment treaties and their possible impact on a level playing field for domestic and foreign investors; (iv) the enforcement and execution of ISDS awards; (v) third party financing of ISDS; (vi) the characteristics, selection and regulation of arbitrators in ISDS; (vii) forum shopping and treaty shopping by investors; and (viii) the question of the consistency of decision-making in ISDS. Part III outlines key findings from a statistical survey of ISDS provisions in 1,660 bilateral investment treaties. Public comment on this paper, including 46 investment policy questions (as outlined in the paper), was obtained in May-July 2012 and is available on the OECD website.
P45|Does High Corporate Tax Rates Attract Foreign Direct Investment?|A part of the empirical literature seems to support the view that international differences in corporate taxation are important determinants of FDI location, while another part argue that FDI are attracted by the business environment, without taking into consideration any directly or indirectly influence of fiscal policy. In this context, the aim of the present paper is to analyze the relation between corporate tax rates competition and Foreign Direct Investment location and to offer conjectures as to the reasons behind. In this purpose the paper analyze the evolution of FDI in European Union, in the developed and emerging economies together with the national differences in corporate taxation, for the period 2005-2010. The study’s results suggest that fiscal competition between governments for FDI is not necessarily a corporate tax rates competition, but a business environment one, which is determined primarily by fiscal policy.
P45|Particular Warehousing Techniques for Goods Carried by Sea|A warehouse is a commercial building used for storage of goods while warehousing is the process of proper storage and handling of goods and cargo using scientific methods in the warehouse and making them available conveniently when needed. In today's economics, warehousing is considered as one of the most important aspect of trade. Warehousing techniques are the systematic ways and means of receiving, storing, protecting and issuing materials and commodities for future use. This article will point out few stages in the process of warehousing goods carried by sea and shows how good techniques can improve the efficiency and economy of a warehousing organization.

P45|New Solutions to Old Debates: A New Transaction Tax Proposal|From 1980s to today social welfare idea was changed and a neoliberal economic thought takes its place. In 1989, Berlin Wall and then Soviet Union was collapsed which is also the reason for free market system and privatization in transition economies of Eastern Europe. Developing countries in general were also modified their trade and competing policies. Today, globalization has lifting the barriers on capital inflows but also the financial transactions. From another view, it changes policies and triggers integration of world economies. As a result of this process, taxation of international transactions is becoming a more interesting subject in time being. As known, the growing international financial activities and transactions have also some effects on the countries’ financial structure, direct or indirect ways. Since 1990s, these increases have some benefits for helping to overcome the problems of liquidity or investment. On the other hand, it has some financial instability kind contrary effects which make countries’ development process into question. In this study, financial transaction phenomenon will discuss and then taxation proposes will suggest for instability cases.
P45|Investments For A Sustainable Energy Future|Taking into account that today the consumption of energy has grown six times since half a century ago, investments are needed for diversifying the sources of energy consumption and raising the efficiency of energy use. In this article authors concentrate on declaring trends in the energy field in the last decade, with emphasis on production, consumption and installed capacity. We also focus on shaping a view for Romanian energy market, which even though it is a net importer of energy, it also has a great potential for various resources: natural gas, coal, oil, uranium ore and renewable resources. Finally the subject of financing investments in renewable energy is discussed. All this arguments combined may explain our country’s average score for the Energy Sustainability Index that gives us a middle place in this country ranking.

Although often neglected as a serious policy option - and consequently most of its potential still remains untapped - tourism is the leading export for at least 11 LDCs, and the 2nd or 3rd largest export for another 11 or more. It is also a major source of new employment, especially for women, youth and the rural poor in general. While difficult to measure accurately, tourism's pro-poor impacts are directly related to the achieved level of inter- and intra-sectoral linkages. Taking export diversification, employment generation and the green economy in turn, the working paper analyzes feasible LDC alternatives, reaching the conclusion (within the limits of data availability) that - in contrast with the current overemphasis on agriculture and manufacturing - green tourism is demonstrably one of the areas of greatest current comparative advantage and development potential for the majority of LDCs, via its extensive upstream and downstream linkages/multiplier effects, employment-generating and poverty alleviation capacities, opportunities for export test marketing of new products, sustainability, and largely untapped export opportunities. An economy wide, primarily private-sector approach is an essential element for maximizing tourism benefits - including its multiple linkages with agriculture and manufacturing - together with a significant coordinating governmental role to minimize negative externalities. Unfortunately, there is no automatic guarantee that expanding tourism will significantly increase poverty alleviation or local employment generation: the necessary mechanisms must be explicitly included in tourism planning and implementation.
P45|Always Late: Measures and Determinants of Disbursement Delays at the African Development Bank|Over the years, an abundant number of studies have pointed to long delays at project start-up as one of the main impediments to the performance of development operations in Africa. The influence and importance of time delays on project performance emphasizes the need for a systematic effort to understand why some projects delay so much and others do not. This study attempts to identify the projects’ characteristics which affect the probability to experience delays. Using a sample of African Development Bank Projects, statistical and econometric analyses are employed to identify the determinants of long delays in project start-up in the agricultural sector. The dataset used, consists of all the 525 agricultural sector operations approved by the Bank between 1990 and 2007.Analyses generally reveal that long gestation and delays at project start-up is prominent for agricultural sector projects and is a potential bottleneck for the Bank funded operations. Time delays have significantly improved for newly approved operations. Close to half of the time delay to the first disbursement is due to the delay between commitment and loan effectiveness. Multinational projects are significantly more efficient in term of delays at start-up. The smaller the cost of the operation, the greater will be the probability to experience long start-up delays. The longer the planned implementation period of a project, the higher the start-up delay will be. Projects with many components have lower probability of experiencing delays at start up. After a project has entered into force, the time elapsed to first disbursement will be longer for ADB countries.The paper concludes by outlining a number of implications for effective strategies to mitigate long delays encountered throughout the project cycle in the agricultural sector.

P45|Public Private Partnerships In Infrastructure Projects|Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are new, innovative ways in which the public and the private sector can cooperate to efficiently build infrastructure assets by sharing risks and rewards and focusing on elements that each of them excel in. Over the course of the last half of century, several countries in the world such as the UK, Australia or the Unites States have embraced the concept and have sets new challenges in applying its principles to evermore activities and economic sectors. The PPPs represent a hybrid way of supplying good and providing services in which the private and public sectors work together to achieve results which could not have been obtained by one party’s efforts only.
P45|Measuring The Outside Potential Of The Oecd Countries|The purpose of the article is to measure the outside potential of the OECD countries with the help of the K-index, an indicator we created after conducting a survey on it. Later on the index will be used to classify Hungary’s performance in a three-dimensional matrix of institutions. After an analysis on the data of OECD economies, we have concluded that the developed countries can be divided into four groups, and these four groups can be distinguished by four main factors: macroeconomic performance, knowledge-based entrepreneurial environment, guarantees of market competition and international attractiveness. These factors summarize the institutional conditions that influence an economy’s ability to make use of the opportunities provided by the global market.
P45|International Trade, Foreign Direct Investment, and Security|The main focus of this review is on international trade and foreign direct investment when the institutions that provide the security of property rights and enforcement of contracts are imperfect. Some issues of national security related to poor governance of international transactions are also considered. The discussion organizes a selective overview of the literature and offers some suggestions for future research.
P45|The Implicit Theory of Historical Change in the work of Alan S. Milward|Alan S. Milward was an economic historian who developed an implicit theory of historical change. His interpretation which was neither liberal nor Marxist posited that social, political, and economic change, for it to be sustainable, had to be a gradual process rather than one resulting from a sudden, cataclysmic revolutionary event occurring in one sector of the economy or society. Benign change depended much less on natural resource endowment or technological developments than on the ability of state institutions to respond to changing political demands from within each society. State bureaucracies were fundamental to formulating those political demands and advising politicians of ways to meet them. Since each society was different there was no single model of development to be adopted or which could be imposed successfully by one nation-state on others, either through force or through foreign aid programs. Nor could development be promoted simply by copying the model of a more successful economy. Each nation-state had to find its own response to the political demands arising from within its society. Integration occurred when a number of nation- states shared similar political objectives which they could not meet individually but could meet collectively. It was not simply the result of their increasing interdependence. It was how and whether nation-states responded to these domestic demands which determined the nature of historical change.
P45|Fragile States And Development Policy|It is widely recognized that fragile states are key symptoms of under-development in many parts of the world. Such states are incapable of delivering basic services to their citizens and political violence is commonplace. As of yet, mainstream development economics has not dealt in any systematic way with such concerns and the implications for development assistance. This paper puts forward a frame-work for analyzing fragile states and applies it to a variety of development policies in different types of states.9076:<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P45|China’s new exchange rate regime, optimal basket currency and currency diversification|We build an optimising framework to analyse a class of economies that adopt an ECU-type basket currency while in transition to increased flexibility of the exchange rate regime. Instead of conventional basket pegging, such an economy uses an ECU-type currency index as a benchmark for monitoring and assessing exchange rate movements. This provides an anchoring device for the nation’s exchange rate regime and allows the home currency’s exchange rate to fluctuate. Under the assumption that the central bank is chiefly interested in maintaining stability, the optimal structure of the basket currency is based on its contribution to minimizing the volatility of the country’s external account. A currency invariance index is applied to capture the effect of the country’s exit from exclusive linkage with the US dollar. The approach is illustrated by Chinese exchange rate policy. We find it advisable and viable for China to form a basket currency with a diversified portfolio of currencies. While the portfolio’s weighting scheme could favour the dollar, euro and Japanese yen, we show that the composition of the basket is open to a wide range of possibilities. Moreover, contrary to general fears, there is considerable potential for China to engage in currency diversification, which will not necessarily affect the dollar’s position.
P45|The role of the stock market in the provision of Islamic development finance: Evidence from Sudan|This paper assesses the impact of stock exchange funding in the Shari'ya compliant Islamic economy of Sudan. Evidence suggests that while Islamic financial instruments have considerable potential in facilitating development finance through their emphasis on partnership this is better achieved by the banking system rather than the Khartoum Stock Exchange. A case study of the Sudan Telecommunications company shows that larger firms able to cross-list elsewhere are likely to choose regional markets in preference to their domestic one thus benefiting from lower costs of equity. However, governance preferences are likely to favour block shareholders following the Islamic finance partnership concept.
P45|Trade agreements, bargaining and economic growth|Rebelo's two-sector endogenous growth model is embedded within a two-country international trade framework. The two countries bargain over a trade agreement that specifies: (i) the size of the foreign aid that the richer country gives to the poorer one; (ii) the terms of the international trade that takes place after the aid is given. Foreign aid is given not because of generosity, but because it improves the capital allocation across the world and thus raises total world production. This world production surplus enables the rich country to raise its equilibrium consumption and welfare beyond their no-aid levels. To ensure it, the rich country uses a trade agreement to condition the aid on favorable terms of trade.
P45|Evidence On The Impact Of International Finance Corporation Tourism Investment On Latin American And Caribbean Economies|The International Finance Corporation (IFC) as a member of World Bank Group is the largest multilateral source of loan and equity financing for private sector projects in developing countries. Particular focus of International Finance Corporation is to promote economic development by encouraging the growth of productive enterprise and efficient capital markets in its member countries. The purpose of this article is to show the correlation between International Finance Corporation investments and economic development of the region, country, national economies and private enterprises or companies that make partnership with International Finance Corporation. The main object is to evaluate in details the connection and difference between International Finance Corporation and investments in different projects and the difference if the Organization is not investing in some projects or in the specific country. The research objective is to determine the role and significance of International Finance Corporation investments in tourism and hospitality industry on the example of Latin America and Caribbean, and analyze interrelationship between investments and development of specific country in which investments are made, and development of its whole economy and to draw attention on need for stronger implementation and importance of International Finance Corporation as a source of investment funds.
P45|Not All That Glitters| >p>Although foreign subsidiaries usually perform better than the average of the hosting economies, empirical literature has also established that the selection effect is statistically significant. In this paper we attempt to evaluate its economic relevance, using a unique data set of annual financial reports by all medium and large Polish enterprises over the period 1995-2007. We match firms privatized with the use of foreign direct investment (FDI) to a control group of nonprivatized state-owned companies in order to disentangle the effect of self-selection and FDI entry.>/p>>p>Evidence suggests that although FDI enters more frequently into companies that already participate in the international trading networks, roughly half the export intensity differential may be attributed to the entry of FDI. On the other hand, selection effects seem to dominate as far as efficiency is concerned, whereas only toward the end of the sample may the positive effect of FDI on profitability be confirmed.>/p>
P45|Growth in the Shadow of Expropriation| We propose a tractable variant of the open economy neoclassical growth model that emphasizes political economy and contracting frictions. The political economy frictions involve a preference for immediate spending, while the contracting friction is a lack of commitment regarding foreign debt and expropriation. We show that the political economy frictions slow an economy's convergence to the steady state due to the endogenous evolution of capital taxation. The model rationalizes why openness has different implications for growth depending on the political environment, why institutions such as the treatment of capital income evolve over time, why governments in countries that grow rapidly accumulate net foreign assets rather than liabilities, and why foreign aid may not affect growth.

P45|Algerian Economic Structure: Opportunities or Threats in a Crisis Situation|"According to the theory of Joseph Schumpeter, a business cycle is characterized by an expansion phase followed by a depression phase in the production process. This cyclical crises has attracted interest from various researchers in the example of Clement Juglar, in an attempt to explain the phenomenon in order to prevent future crises. The main causes of these crises are either endogenous or exogenous. But every crisis did not have the same effects and similar impacts on the country. It is true that the nature of the crisis determines the impact. But it also seems that the economic structure of a country is a factor that could determine the extent of the impact of the crisis on the country. Indeed, the volume of international trade in a nation and the diversity of products traded are crucial in the impact of crises on its economy. As such, Algeria known for its particular structure of its trade, characterized by export-oriented oil almost suffered the same way as many other countries in development, more or less serious effects on its economy. However, Algerian officials announced, following the example of the last global financial crisis, the country remains safe even if oil prices fell and thanks to large foreign exchange reserves combined. Indeed, the Algerian state argues the fact that its economy is weakly inserted in financial globalization. The economic structure of Algeria, is characterized, among other things, by a quasi ""mono-export"", may ""be regarded as an opportunity for the country to avoid the impact of an international crisis, or is it a threat that can lead the country into an economic and social crisis? It is to this main question that this work will attempt to provide some thoughts based on the analysis of the impact of crises on the economy of this country while referring to its economic structure."
P45|Haiti: Much Attention, No Results. Why Development Assistance Doesn’t Work|The present paper is an excerpt, with little adaptation, from the master thesis: “Project management’s contribution to international cooperation. How to make things work: ODA in Haiti” wrote under the coordination of Prof. Dr. Horst Brezinski from Technical University Freiberg Bergakademie and Prof. Dr. Eng.. Sabina Irimie from University of Petrosani, while benefiting from an Erasmus study scholarship at the first mentioned institution. It presents the case of Haiti, a small country facing big challenges and enjoying plenty of international attention especially due to the recent earthquake that struck the country at the beginning of 2010. The SWOT analysis inside the paper offers a detailed view of Haiti’s actual situation, identifying in the same time its problems and the variables that should be taken into consideration when designing programmes and projects targeting Haiti’s development.
P45|The Evolution Of Foreign Direct Investment In Brazil, Russia, India And China Economies (Bric)|This paper aims to analyze the evolution of foreign direct investment in the economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China. These four economies known as BRIC economies, are considered the largest emerging economies, with a high potential to reach developed economies. The need, the importance and the effects of foreign direct investments have attracted the attention of all the states and produced an intense competition to attract the foreign capital. FDI inflows have a very important role in the development and establishment of the new world economic powers.
P45|India's FDI Inflows: Trends and Concepts|India’s inward investment regime went through a series of changes since economic reforms were ushered in two decades back. The expectation of the policy makers was that an “investor friendly” regime will help India establish itself as a preferred destination of foreign investors. These expectations remained largely unfulfilled despite the consistent attempts by the policy makers to increase the attractiveness of India by further changes in policies that included opening up of individual sectors, raising the hitherto existing caps on foreign holding and improving investment procedures. But after 2005‐06, official statistics started reporting steep increases in FDI inflows. This paper is an attempt to explain this divergence from the earlier trend. At the outset, the paper dwells on the ambiguities surrounding the definition and the non‐adherence of international norms in measuring the FDI inflows. The study finds that portfolio investors and round-tripping investments have been important contributors to India’s reported FDI inflows thus blurring the distinction between direct and portfolio investors on one hand and foreign and domestic investors on the other. These investors were also the ones which have exploited the tax haven route most. These observations acquire added significance in the context of the substantial fall in the inflows seen during 2010‐11. In most countries, particularly those that have faced chronic current account deficits, obtaining stable long term FDI flows was preferred over volatile portfolio investments. This distinction between long term FDI and the volatile portfolio investments has now been removed in the accepted official definition of FDI. From an analytical point of view, the blurring of the lines between long term FDI and the volatile portfolio investments has meant that the essential characteristics of FDI, especially the positive spill‐overs that the long term FDI was seen to result in, are being overlooked. FDI that is dominated by financial investments, though a little more stable than the portfolio investments through the stock market, cannot deliver the perceived advantages of FDI. The net result is that while much of the FDI cannot enhance India’s ability to earn foreign exchange through exports of goods and services and thus cover the current account gap on its own strength, large inflows of portfolio capital causes currency appreciation and erodes the competitiveness of domestic players. The falling share of manufacturing and even of IT and ITES means that there is less likelihood of FDI directly contributing to export earnings. India seems to have been caught in a trap wherein large inflows are regularly required in order to finance the current account deficit. To keep FDI flowing in, the investment regime has to be liberalised further and M&As are allowed freely. Even at the global level, the developmental impact of FDI is being given lesser importance notwithstanding the repeated assertions to the contrary in some fora. International data on FDI and its impact has never been unambiguous. If FDI has to deliver, it has to be defined precisely and chosen with care instead of treating it as generic capital flow. India should strengthen its information base that will allow a proper assessment of the impact that FDI can make on its development aspirations.

P45|New Developments in EU's External Trade Policy and Implications for Asia-Europe Relations|"Asia-Europe relations have long been overshadowed by the predominance of the United States in the Asian region. The New Asia Strategy and the ""Global Europe"" strategy of the EU, which are adopted in 1994 and 2006 respectively, however, have changed the posture of the EU towards East Asia. The EU, which was extremely cautious in concluding a full-fledged FTA with non-European countries, has since then been negotiating a number of FTAs with Asian countries. This opens up a series of new opportunities for East Asia to enhance its relationship with the EU. The paper recommends the East Asian countries to pursue a two-track approach in order to fully materialize the potential for strengthening the bilateral relationship."
P45|Challenging Indifference to Extreme Poverty: Considering Southern Perspectives on Global Citizenship and Change|Canadian universities are expanding opportunities for students to travel, study, volunteer and work abroad for academic credit, especially in regions of the global south often called “developing countries.” It is widely assumed that exposure to extreme poverty through short-term placements overseas will make young Canadians and other Northerners into “global citizens” who would by definition be incapable of indifference to the lack of freedom that accompanies extreme poverty. This paper asks whether it is warranted for Northerners to attain a claim to global citizenship via this mechanism, especially in light of the burdens falling upon Southern organizations that host young people from Canada and elsewhere.
P45|Depoliticization, instrumentalization and legitimacy of Czech development cooperation: A case of imposed altruism?|This paper draws on James Ferguson’s concept of ‘anti-politics machine’ and Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of illusio to explore the nature of the international development cooperation programmes financed by the Czech government. It argues that its character as an ‘anti-politics machine’ turns development into a highly technical issue and dismisses essential political questions of global equity and policy coherence from the public debate. Moreover, the actors in the field of development cooperation are held in an illusio: they are required to appear as altruistic, which obscures their particular interests. This instrumentalization of development aid contributes to further isolation of the Czech development constituency and raises fundamental questions for the democratic legitimacy of development cooperation.
P45|The Role of Institutional Quality in FDI Inflows in Sub-Saharan Africa|During the period 2000 to 2008, Africa’s collective GDP grew at an annual rate of 4.9 percent. Even though previous studies argue that strengthened and improved institutional quality is key determinant for attracting foreign direct investment to Africa, we find no evidence to that effect. Using a panel data for 45 Sub-Saharan African countries (SSH), we estimate the role of institutional quality (governance) in attracting FDI inflow during the 1996-2007 period. After controlling for country and time specific effects and the economic environment of the host country, we find no significant evidence of the impact of institutional quality on FDI inflow in our analysis. This finding may suggest that FDI inflow to SSH is potentially motivated by the abundance of raw materials and natural resources than good governance.
P45|Aftercare of inward foreign direct investment: A case study of South Africa|Attraction of new inward foreign direct investment (FDI) globally, especially in the developing countries, is problematic. Economic development practitioners have recently started to prioritise the retention and growing of existing investments to enhance their economic development agenda. The purpose of this paper is to analyse and investigate the relationship between inward FDI and investment aftercare in South Africa (SA). Only a few studies have been carried out on the topic at the global level and none on SA as far as could be ascertained. A structured questionnaire was used to collate data, and 30 face-to-face interviews were conducted with 16 investment aftercare practitioners and 14 executives from the investment promotion agencies (IPAs) in seven of the nine provinces of SA. The main finding of the study is that although investment aftercare services are essential, they receive limited funding, staff and attention, and have not yet been developed in SA.
P45|Migrants and International Economic Linkages: A Meta-Overview| The migration issue is a much debated subject in many developed countries. This study provides a review of the relationship between migrants and their international economic linkages. It then focuses on foreign direct investment (FDI), for both inward and outward FDI. This study aims to offer a synthesis by means of a meta-analysis of various studies, in order to test the robustness of the relationship between migration and FDI. Our results confirm that immigration has a positive impact on FDI investment in both directions (inward and outward), and that these impacts are higher when migrants are highly educated and skilled. RÉSUMÉ Le problème de la migration est un sujet qui suscite un intÃ©rêt considÃ©rable dans un grand nombre de pays Ã©voluÃ©s. Cette Ã©tude passe en revue les rapports entre les migrants et leurs liens Ã©conomiques internationaux. Elle se penche en suite sur les investissements Ã©trangers directs (IED), tant pour les IED Ã©trangers que pour les investissements à l’Ã©tranger. L’Ã©tude s'efforce de prÃ©senter une synthèse par le biais de mÃ©ta-analyses de diffÃ©rentes Ã©tudes, dans le but de tester la soliditÃ© des rapports entre migration et IED. Nos rÃ©sultats confirment que la migration a eu un effet positif sur les investissements IED dans les deux sens (de l’Ã©tranger et à l’Ã©tranger, et qu'elle a un impact majeur lorsque les migrants sont des personnes haute ment qualifiÃ©es et spÃ©cialisÃ©es. RESUMEN La inmigración es un tema muy debatido en muchos paÃ­ses desarrollados. Este estudio proporciona una reseña de la relación entre los inmigrantes y sus enlaces económicos internacionales. DespuÃ©s se enfoca en la Inversión Extranjera Directa (IED), tanto de entrada como de salida. Este estudio tiene como objetivo ofrecer una sÃ­ntesis mediante un metanáli sis de estudios varios para evaluar la solidez de la relación entre inmigración y la IED. Nuestros resultados confirman que la inmigración tiene un impacto positivo sobre la IED en ambas direcciones (entrada y salida), y que estos impactos son mayores cuando los inmigrantes tiene un alto nivel de educación y cualificación.

P45|Systemic Implications Of Transatlantic Regulatory Cooperation And Competition|Regulations and enforcement decisions that at first appear to have only a domestic impact can have substantial spillover effects on other nations' economies. Experience has shown time and again that there is no reason to expect that these effects are confined to jurisdictions at the same level of development. Governments on both sides of the Atlantic recognize this, yet their responses in many policy areas are not aligned â€” sometimes deliberately so. This creates a complex regulatory landscape that appears to be the product of both cooperation and competition, and which can only be fully understood by looking through a number of disciplinary lenses.Drawing on some of the best legal, economic and political science expertise from both sides of the Atlantic, as well as on the knowledge of officials and private practitioners with experience in both industrialized and developing countries, this timely book assesses the systemic, global implications of transatlantic regulatory cooperation and competition. Insights from thematic papers are integrated with those from sector-specific analyses, and a rich set of implications for policymakers, business and civil society is offered.
P45|THE KELLY CAPITAL GROWTH INVESTMENT CRITERION:Theory and Practice|This volume provides the definitive treatment of fortune's formula or the Kelly capital growth criterion as it is often called. The strategy is to maximize long run wealth of the investor by maximizing the period by period expected utility of wealth with a logarithmic utility function. Mathematical theorems show that only the log utility function maximizes asymptotic long run wealth and minimizes the expected time to arbitrary large goals. In general, the strategy is risky in the short term but as the number of bets increase, the Kelly bettor's wealth tends to be much larger than those with essentially different strategies. So most of the time, the Kelly bettor will have much more wealth than these other bettors but the Kelly strategy can lead to considerable losses a small percent of the time. There are ways to reduce this risk at the cost of lower expected final wealth using fractional Kelly strategies that blend the Kelly suggested wager with cash. The various classic reprinted papers and the new ones written specifically for this volume cover various aspects of the theory and practice of dynamic investing. Good and bad properties are discussed, as are fixed-mix and volatility induced growth strategies. The relationships with utility theory and the use of these ideas by great investors are featured.

P45|The Banking Crisis: Causes, Consequences and Remedies|AbstractThe paradigm that financial markets are efficient has provided the intellectual backbone for the deregulation of the banking sector since the 1980s, allowing universal banks to be fully involved in financial markets, and investment banks to become involved in traditional banking. There is now overwhelming evidence that financial markets are not efficient. Bubbles and crashes are an endemic feature of financial markets in capitalist countries. Thus, as a result of deregulation, the balance sheets of universal banks became fully exposed to these bubbles and crashes, undermining the stability of the banking system. The Basel approach to stabilize the banking system has as an implicit assumption that financial markets are efficient, allowing us to model the risks universal banks take and to compute the required capital ratios that will minimize this risk. I argue that this approach is unworkable because the risks that matter for universal banks are tail risks, associated with bubbles and crashes. These cannot be quantified. As a result, there is only one way out, and that is to return to narrow banking, a model that emerged after the previous largescale banking crisis of the 1930s but that was discarded during the 1980s and 1990s under the influence of the efficient market paradigm.

P45|Systemic Implications of Deeper Transatlantic Convergence in Competition/Antitrust Policy|AbstractIn the transatlantic context, the field of competition (antitrust) policy has benefited from both: (i) the establishment of formal arrangements to promote cooperation between North American and European enforcement authorities; and (ii) a significant but incomplete and voluntary convergence of substantive enforcement approaches based on mutual learning and experience. These developments have undeniably helped to strengthen enforcement and to minimize inter-jurisdictional conflicts, though they have not eliminated the scope for such conflicts. In the future, however, the most serious policy clashes in the antitrust field are more likely to involve countries outside the transatlantic context. This reflects the proliferation of competition laws across all regions of the world during the past decade and the lack of deep antitrust traditions in some of the relevant countries. The scope for such conflicts may eventually compel reconsideration of multilateral “framework” approaches to competition law that would promote sound economic approaches and ensure non-discrimination in policy application without entailing forced harmonization. Further efforts at achieving deeper cooperation and convergence in the transatlantic context could provide essential intellectual leadership in this regard.

P45|Exposition Of A New Theory On The Measurement Of Risk|EVER SINCE mathematicians first began to study the measurement of risk there has been general agreement on the following proposition: Expected values are computed by multiplying each possible gain by the number of ways in which it can occur, and then dividing the sum of these products by the total number of possible cases where, in this theory, the consideration of cases which are all of the same probability is insisted upon. If this rule be accepted, what remains to be done within the framework of this theory amounts to the enumeration of all alternatives, their breakdown into equi-probable cases and, finally, their insertion into corresponding classifications…
P45|A New Interpretation of Information Rate|If the input symbols to a communication channel represent the outcomes of a chance event on which bets are available at odds consistent with their probabilities (i.e., “fair” odds), a gambler can use the knowledge given him by the received symbols to cause his money to grow exponentially. The maximum exponential rate of growth of the gambler's capital is equal to the rate of transmission of information over the channel. This result is generalized to include the case of arbitrary odds.Thus we find a situation in which the transmission rate is significant even though no coding is contemplated. Previously this quantity was given significance only by a theorem of Shannon's which asserted that, with suitable encoding, binary digits could be transmitted over the channel at this rate with an arbitrarily small probability of error.

P45|Optimal Investment And Consumption Strategies Under Risk For A Class Of Utility Functions|This paper develops a sequential model of the individual's economic decision problem under risk. On the basis of this model, optimal consumption, investment, and borrowing-lending strategies are obtained in closed form for a class of utility functions. For a subset of this class the optimal consumption strategy satisfies the permanent income hypothesis precisely. The optimal investment strategies have the property that the optimal mix of risky investments is independent of wealth, noncapital income, age, and impatience to consume. Necessary and sufficient conditions for long-run capital growth are also given.

P45|Competitive Optimality Of Logarithmic Investment|Consider the two-person zero-sum game in which two investors are each allowed to invest in a market with stocks (X1, X2, …,Xm) ∼ F, where Xi ⩾ 0. Each investor has one unit of capital. The goal is to achieve more money than one's opponent. Allowable portfolio strategies are random investment policies $\underline{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{m} , \underline{B} \geqslant \underline{0}, E \sum\nolimits_{i = 1}^{m} \underline{B}_{i} = 1$. The payoff to player 1 for policy $\underline{B}_{1} \; \textrm{vs.} \; \underline{B}_{2}$ is $ P \{ \underline{B}^{t}_{1}\underline{X} \geqslant \underline{B}^{t}_{2}\underline{X} \}$. The optimal policy is shown to be $\underline{B}^{*} = U\underline{b}^{*}$, where U is a random variable uniformly distributed on [0, 2], and $\underline{b}^{*}$ maximizes E In $\underline{b}^{\prime} \underline{X}$ over $\underline{b} \geqslant \underline{0}, \sum {b_{i} = 1}$.Curiously, this competitively optimal investment policy $\underline{b}^{*}$ is the same policy that achieves the maximum possible growth rate of capital in repeated independent investments (Breiman (1961) and Kelly (1956)). Thus the immediate goal of outperforming another investor is perfectly compatible with maximizing the asymptotic rate of return.
P45|A Bound on the Financial Value of Information|It will be shown that each bit of information at most doubles the resulting wealth in the general stock market setup. This information bound on the growth of wealth is actually attained for certain probability distributions on the market investigated by Kelly. The bound will be shown to be a special case of the result that the increase in exponential growth of wealth achieved with true knowledge of the stock market distribution F over that achieved with incorrect knowledge G is bounded above by D(F‖G), the entropy of F relative to G.
P45|Asymptotic Optimality And Asymptotic Equipartition Properties Of Log-Optimum Investment|We ask how an investor (with knowledge of the past) should distribute his funds over various investment opportunities to maximize the growth rate of his compounded capital. Breiman (1961) answered this question when the stock returns for successive periods are independent, identically distributed random vectors. We prove that maximizing conditionally expected log return given currently available information at each stage is asymptotically optimum, with no restrictions on the distribution of the market process.If the market is stationary ergodic, then the maximum capital growth rate is shown to be a constant almost surely equal to the maximum expected log return given the infinite past. Indeed, log-optimum investment policies that at time n look at the n-past are sandwiched in asymptotic growth rate between policies that look at only the k-past and those that look at the infinite past, and the sandwich closes as k → ∞.
P45|Universal Portfolios|"We exhibit an algorithm for portfolio selection that asymptotically outperforms the best stock in the market. Let xi = (xi1, xi2, …,xim)t denote the performance of the stock market on day i, where xij is the factor by which the jth stock increases on day i. Let bi = (bi1 , bi2, …, bim)t, bij ≥ 0, Σj bij = 1, denote the proportion bij of wealth invested in the jth stock on day i. Then $S_{n} = \prod\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} {\bold{b}_{i}^{t} \bold{x}_{i}}$ is the factor by which wealth is increased in n trading days. Consider as a goal the wealth $S_{n}^{*} = \max_{\bold{b}} \prod\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} {\bold{b}^{\textrm{t}} {\bold{x}}_{i}}$ that can be achieved by the best constant rebalanced portfolio chosen after the stock outcomes are revealed. It can be shown that $S_{n}^{*}$ exceeds the best stock, the Dow Jones average, and the value line index at time n. In fact, $S_{n}^{*}$ usually exceeds these quantities by an exponential factor. Let x1, x2, …, be an arbitrary sequence of market vectors. It will be shown that the nonanticipating sequence of portfolios $\widehat{b}_{k} = \int \bold{b} \prod\nolimits_{i = 1}^{k - 1} \bold{b}^{\textrm{t}} \bold{x}_{i} \; d \bold{b} / \int \prod\nolimits_{i = 1}^{k - 1} \bold{b}^{\textrm{t}} \bold{x}_{i} \; d \bold{b}$ yields wealth $\widehat{S}_{n} = \prod\nolimits_{k = 1}^{n} \widehat{\bold{b}}_{k}^{\textrm{t}} \bold{x}_{k}$ such that $( 1/n ) \ln {(S_{n}^{*} / \widehat{S}_{n})} \to 0$, for every bounded sequence x1, x2, …, and, under mild conditions, achieves $$\widehat{S}_{n} \sim {{{S}_{n}^{*} (m - 1) \, ! \, (2\pi / n)^{(m - 1)/2}} \over {|J_{n}|^{1/2}}}$$ where Jn is an (m − 1) × (m − 1) sensitivity matrix. Thus this portfolio strategy has the same exponential rate of growth as the apparently unachievable $S_{n}^{*}$."
P45|The Cost Of Achieving The Best Portfolio In Hindsight|For a market with m assets consider the minimum, over all possible sequences of asset prices through time n, of the ratio of the final wealth of a nonanticipating investment strategy to the wealth obtained by the best constant rebalanced portfolio computed in hindsight for that price sequence. We show that the maximum value of this ratio over all nonanticipating investment strategies is Vn = [∑ 2−nH(n1/n, …, nm/n)(n !/(n1 ! ⋯ nm !))]−1, where H(·) is the Shannon entropy, and we specify a strategy achieving it. The optimal ratio Vn is shown to decrease only polynomially in n, indicating that the rate of return of the optimal strategy converges uniformly to that of the best constant rebalanced portfolio determined with full hindsight. We also relate this result to the pricing of a new derivative security which might be called the hindsight allocation option.
P45|Optimal Strategies For Repeated Games|We extend the optimal strategy results of Kelly and Breiman and extend the class of random variables to which they apply from discrete to arbitrary random variables with expectations. Let Fn be the fortune obtained at the nth time period by using any given strategy and let $F_{n}^{*}$ be the fortune obtained by using the Kelly–Breiman strategy. We show (Theorem 1(i)) that $F_{n} / F_{n}^{*}$ is a supermartingale with $E(F_{n} / F_{n}^{*}) \leqq 1$ and, consequently, $E(\lim {F_{n} / F_{n}^{*}) \leqq 1$. This establishes one sense in which the Kelly–Breiman strategy is optimal. However, this criterion for ‘optimality’ is blunted by our result (Theorem 1(ii)) that $E(F_{n} / F_{n}^{*}) = 1$ for many strategies differing from the Kelly–Breiman strategy. This ambiguity is resolved, to some extent, by our result (Theorem 2) that $F_{n}^{*} / F_{n}$ is a submartingale with $E(F_{n}^{*} / F_{n}) \geqq 1$ and $E(\lim {F_{n}^{*}} / F_{n}) \geqq 1$; and $E(F_{n}^{*} / F_{n}) = 1$ if and only if at each time period j, 1≦j≦n, the strategies leading to Fn and $F_{n}^{*}$ are ‘the same’.
P45|The Effect of Errors in Means, Variances, and Covariances on Optimal Portfolio Choice|There is considerable literature on the strengths and limitations of mean-variance analysis.

P45|Time to wealth goals in capital accumulation|This paper considers the problem of investment of capital in risky assets in a dynamic capital market in continuous time. The model controls risk, and in particular the risk associated with errors in the estimation of asset returns. The framework for investment risk is a geometric Brownian motion model for asset prices. with random rates of return. The information filtration process and the capital allocation decisions are considered separately. The filtration is based on a Bayesian model for asset prices, and an (empirical) Bayes estimator for current price dynamics is developed from the price history. Given the conditional price dynamics, investors allocate wealth to achieve their financial goals efficiently over time. The price updating and wealth reallocations occur when control limits on the wealth process are attained. A Bayesian fractional Kelly strategy is optimal at each rebalancing, assuming that the risky assets are jointly lognormal distributed. The strategy minimizes the expected time to the upper wealth limit while maintaining a high probability of reaching that goal before falling to a lower wealth limit. The fractional Kelly strategy is a blend of the log-optimal portfolio and cash and is equivalently represented by a negative power utility function, under the multivariate lognormal distribution assumption. By rebalancing when control limits are reached, the wealth goals approach provides greater control over downside risk and upside growth. The wealth goals approach with random rebalancing times is compared to the expected utility approach with fixed rebalancing times in an asset allocation problem involving stocks, bonds, and cash.
P45|Survival and Evolutionary Stability of the Kelly Rule|This chapter gives an overview of current research in evolutionary finance. We mainly focus on the survival and stability properties of investment strategies associated with the Kelly rule. Our approach to the study of the wealth dynamics of investment strategies is inspired by Darwinian ideas on selection and mutation. The goal of this research is to develop an evolutionary framework for practical investment advice.
